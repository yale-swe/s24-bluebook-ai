    "This is a great class--it's unfortunate that Prof. Arnsten doesn't teach it every year. Definitely take it if you have any interest in the brain. Not too sciency--she makes sure to break things down in terms that anyone could understand. I'm not a science person at all and I had no problem grasping the concepts. The grading is also great--a lot of different components so one poor test won't hurt you. Three exams, section, a final paper, and a final exam. Manageable class, hardly any outside work. There was an occasional reading response for section, and I didn't find the reading to be necessary (only used the book as a supplement to look things up for exams). Prof. Arnsten is awesome--fun, engaging, and clearly loves her field. Also, it's fascinating to learn about the brain. Take this class for sure.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. No matter what your major, you will love it, and you will get an A if you study decently hard.",
    "TAKE IT, awesome class, great professor and TAs. A lot of fun and not a whole lot of work. Although, I still stressed over the tests and spent a lot of time studying.",
    "This is a really interesting but work intensive science credit. Take it credit\/d if you're looking to learn some cool things about the brain but aren't ready to put in a lot of hours in studying for the tests.",
    "A great introduction to neuroscience. Take it if you ever want to learn this stuff.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT!!!! You don't need any science experience before (though I wouldn't call it a gut for non-science majors). If you put the time and work into it, it is not hard to do well. The tests are all straightforward and she is not trying to trick you. The material is very interesting and very well taught and Professor Arnsten is phenomenal! It's a shame she only teaches it every other year.GREAT CLASS!!!!",
    "Introduction to neuroscience: survey of the anatomy and physiology of the brain and the science behind everyday function and mental illness. Absolutely take this class. amazing.",
    "Definitely! This class is really interesting, even if you aren't a science person.",
    "Yes, it's a fun and interesting way to get your science credit, the workload isn't bad at all, and if you want to gain a basic understanding of what is going on in the brain it is useful.",
    "Best grading breakdown ever, it's an incredibly fair system and allowed for a lot of second chances. If you messed up on one exam it wasn't a big deal because they were only 10% and in the end you had the chance to make it up on the final which was 30%. A nice creative paper that allowed for synthesizing the material at the end of the course too! 20% The right section is a big help but Professor Arnsten really holds all her TAs accountable and she does a great job at choosing people who are genuinely interested in teaching their students. :)WAY BETTER THAN ISSUES APPROACH TO BIOLOGY!",
    "Definitely recommend! It can be pretty science-y for a non-science class, but if you liked AP Bio you'll like it. Really really interesting lectures, topics like the senses, memory, mental illnesses - all very relevant. I think she's not teaching it next year but take it if you can!",
    "This class is a crash course through the human mind and various disorders. it comes highly recommended as an interesting and fulfilling class.",
    "This was such an incredible class. Amy Arnsten is the most engaging lecturer -- she always supplements the science with a humanistic, almost poetic perspective. The class is definitely challenging, because there is a lot of material to memorize, but the tests are very fair. They usually consist of 30 or so fill-in-the-blanks, with a word bank, plus a an essay (she often gives you the topic in advance). I would say that if you have any interest in the human brain, take it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It helps to give a great preview of this area of study and it is really interesting. While it is not a gut class, if you put in the work that you would any other class you will do fine. It was a highly entertaining and informative course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The lectures are really cool and Professor Arnsten makes neuroscience fun and accessible. There are some really great guest lecturers too. The class has three tests during the semester, a final paper, and a final exam. This is a lot, but the series of tests makes sure you really have a good grasp on everything.",
    "Brain and Thought is an interesting class, and is not very difficult. Prepare for the paper ahead of time because it is not as easy as the rest of the class. I would recommend this if you are interested in the brain and need a science class, or if you are interested in Cognitive Science.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone! It's a really interesting course. The material is very detailed, but everything you learn gives you a cool insight into how our brains\/ minds work. It is definitely not an easy class- there are 3 tests, a paper, and a final, and it's a ton of memorization, but it was worth it. Dr. Arnsten is a great lecturer and she presents the material clearly (however, not all of the many guest lecturers are as clear...), and she's the absolute sweetest. The course is only offered every other year, so take it when you can!",
    "Great intro course to neuroscience with a cogsci perspective. Amy Arnsten is an incredible lecturer and somehow manages to explain very complex phenomena in easy-to-understand ways. If you're interested in the brain (esp. higher level processes), but don't care for the nitty gritty bio perspective, take this class!!! One weakness is that we had a ton of guest lecturers, many of whom were not as organized or clear as prof. Arnsten. Exams were pretty fair though, just a lot a memorization.",
    "Best described as an introductory medical school neuro class, although with less scientific background assumed. For science majors, it may seem a little lacking in the science component at times, but on the flip side, the science may seem a little challenging for non-science majors. Overall, though, probably the only experience you'll have to learn specifically about brain anatomy and how it relates to higher cognitive function, so definitely worth taking.",
    "This class was great. You learn a lot, and it's stuff I would never have learned otherwise. Most of the work I ended up doing was studying for tests.",
    "YESS! This class is phenomenal.",
    "Great class!",
    "Yes, definitely. The class broadened my horizons.",
    "The readings from the textbook were pretty hard to get through since the book is clearly aimed at science people and the class is not. However, the material is exciting and relevant, and Professor Arnsten presents it in a very manageable way. Somehow it always felt like the tests were going to be a lot harder than they actually were.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it if you're interested in neuroscience or cognitive science. Don't take it if you just want a science credit.",
    "Take it for sure, especially if you want a science credit that's actually interesting.",
    "This course is an introduction to the neurophysiology and neurobiology of the basic functions of the brain. You learn relevant information about mental illness, how we sense things (feel, taste, see, hear), memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. It's a really cool class because you'll never forget what you learn and who doesn't want to know how their body does what it does?",
    "Take it. You'll learn a lot of really useful material--particularly towards the end of the class, when you cover cognition, memory and mental illnesses. There's quite a bit of work (3 midterms, a 10-page research paper and a final) but if you're ready to put in a decent amount of time, you'll find the assignments and tests pretty reasonable. Try and get into Rob's section--he's a great TA.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in the basic mechanisms of the brain. The course starts at the very beginning, exploring the interaction of neurons and the physical processes by which neuronal communication takes place. As the semester goes on, we got into more interesting topics (in my opinion, at any rate) such as the brain processes underlying learning, memory, and decision-making. The class is taught in such a way as to make it understandable for students of varying backgrounds, and you certainly do not need previous experience with neuroscience to keep to. Professor Arnsten is one of the most intelligent teachers I have had the pleasure of learning from at Yale, and I would encourage anyone to look into this class.",
    "If human behavior is of any interest to you, absolutely take it. It's not an easy class, but you don't need to be a\"science person\". You will find a way to apply this class to your life no matter who you are. A good TA can make a BIG difference in this class, so make sure you have one. You will learn about all sorts of interesting topics like schizophrenia, alzheimers, etc. but a lot of the course is learning about the senses etc. so make sure that interests you too.",
    "Definitely. Very interesting, and I learned a lot.",
    "I came into the class hating the brain, but now I actually enjoy talking about it--took a few classes though. really easy to get perfect scores on the tests as long as you study. no tricks.",
    "CGSCI 201 was incredible. Take it if you ever get the chance. It's easy to cruise through the course, but if you put a bit of work into it, Prof. Arnsten and all of the TAs are so willing to help and you'll truly lean a lot during the semester.",
    "Great intro course, it really gives you a good feel for the field.",
    "A great class for learning neuroscience. It was very detailed and in-depth neuroscience, but if you want to learn that, this is a great course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! You learn a lot and it's not too much work. The course material is really interesting.",
    "Overview of the brain and its functions, tedious at times but never undoable, and often very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone thinking about going into a related field of course. And I would ALSO recommend it to any non-science major looking for a science credit that actually teaches you something, that is interesting without the supplement of other science courses, and that makes you feel like it was worth going to class.",
    "Yes. It is distressing that sometimes the course presents material as fact when some of it is pretty experimental\/theoretical (like the Two-Stream Hypothesis of vision), but it's an incredible overall introduction to neuroscience and how the brain functions.",
    "I studied so hard for this class. Why? Because I desperately want to remember everything I learned for the rest of my life. The first day of class, Prof Arnsten pulled out a jar from under the podium which contained a human brain. She spoke of it tenderly, and told us about the man whose entire life took place inside of this tiny chunk of meat. And then we got to hold the brain. At the time I was like \"whoa I am holding a brain, cool.\" But by the end of the course, when she pulled out the brain I found myself choking back emotion as I realized how much I'd learned about the brain and what it means to be human.Like many people in Brain& Thought, I hadn't taken a hard science class since high school. This course requires a lot of memorization, to be sure, but it has also reminded me of how amazing it feels to learn information instead of just \"how to think.\" Although you'll learn roughly the same amount of stuff in this class as you would in the med school's intro neuroscience class, the workload isn't actually that difficult. Lectures are fascinating and the exams are fair.Everyone should take this course. The brain is magical, and learning about it has helped me understand what it means to be.",
    "GREAT CLASS! The material is extremely interesting and relevant to everyday life. It was one of my favorite classes this semester even though I have no background in psychology, cognitive science, or biology. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You'll come out knowing a lot more about the brain and how it determines our behavior\/moods\/personality\/lives in general.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is fascinating to learn how everyday things are related to the brain.",
    "This is one of my favorite courses at Yale. I am a senior Econ major, and originally taking this for a science credit. The materials turn out to be incredibly fascinating and relevant. I took Paul Bloom's Intro Psych and I loved it a lot. However, I enjoyed this even more because it gets into the details of how the brain produces the behaviors you learned in Intro Psych, which will make you so impressed by evolution and your own body. What we learned in the course really changed how I think and see the world. When I feel excited, nervous, tired, etc., I just can't stop thinking about what brain regions are active. Exams were almost easy, provided that you understand the main concepts. There were not a lot of memorization, although there are some names that you need to learn. After you study and learn everything, it's just so worth it.",
    "Brain& Thought is an amazing course - take it!! It's accessible to sci and non-sci majors, but isn't quite a gut. The guest lecturers are awesome, the paper is fun to write, and the exams aren't too bad if you go to review sessions. Plus, learning about the brain is just crazy interesting!",
    "This is a course that everyone should have to take. The wau in which this course lets you think about yourself and how you make decisions is amazing. Neuroscience is so interesting (and in this course, very accessible), and no student should graduate without a brief understanding of this science that is so changing fields around us from economics to medicine to philosophy.",
    "This course is very fact based. You will come out knowing a lot more about the brain than when you came in. It's not much of a \"skill\" class in that you wont know how to solve any new types of problems, but this is good material to know for anybody interested in how the brain works.",
    "Great overview of the brain and its functions& pathways. I would recommend it because it's a great science class. Definitely need to put work into it, though.",
    "Take it. I have no particular interest in neuroscience, except inasmuch as I have a brain and so does everyone else I know. And if that holds true for you, you have every reason to take this class. After the final, Professor Arnsten (who is one of the most subtly elegant lecturers I've heard at Yale) told me that she thinks everyone should know this stuff, so that they can at least be more forgiving of others.After learning what you learn in this class, that statement packs an emotional whallop.This class is not a gut, but that's more because of the volume of material that you have to learn than because of the nature of the work you have to do. There's no hard science involved, no math whatsoever, just a whole lot of information about the brain (plus an intriguing final paper).This class was a pleasure to take, plain and simple.",
    "TAKE IT. You'll never feel the same way about your brain again. (The day before the final exam, I woke up in awe of human cognition, absolutely staggered that a little pink blob of meat in my head could produce such a rich and textured experience.) Professor Arnsten is a very clear lecturer; the course is designed to help you succeed; the workload is manageable. I'm a non-science major, and this was absolutely my favorite course of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend CGSC201 and I'm not a science person at all. I initially thought I had made a huge mistake by taking it when it came time to study for the first test because I did NOT understand the material and she said the tests would get progressively harder, but after that first test everything got easier, in my opinion. Even by finals I didn't really understand what we learned in the first week and felt like I understood everything else. So don't be intimidated at first--the rest is less science-y and more interesting. Don't buy the textbook though- it was absolutely pointless and a waste of 70 $. It's hard to understand and goes much more in-depth than you need to. The other book is awesome though, definitely get that.",
    "A solid, broad introduction to the human brain that will leave you wanting to learn more. The tests are straightforward and the essay gives you an opportunity to get creative. The course is great for science people and non-science people alike.",
    "Challenging, but definitely worth it. I would absolutely reccommend this class, it is incredible.",
    "It's a great introduction to the human nervous system. Managable for non-science majors, and yet informative enough for science majors.",
    "Great class will teach you about how the different parts of your brain contribute to the experience of being alive on a biological level. I would very much reccomend it.",
    "great class- take it. it is not a gut, but manageable",
    "Yes, take it. A very cool science class. You have a lot of work for the course but it is really a great way to spend your science credit.",
    "Yes, you HAVE to take this course. Professor Arnsten is very passionate about teaching, and that passion is contagious. This course changed my perspective on Neuroscience. TAKE IT.The workload is kind of scary... but it's worth it.",
    "This is definitely a gut course and seems to be designed for non-science majors to get a science credit. I have taken both science courses and humanities courses and this course does not really fit into either group. The tests involve filling in blanks with words from a word bank, nuff said.",
    "Take this class. It's a great science course for non-science majors. You get out of it exactly what you put into it. If you study smart (i.e. what they tell you to study) it won't be as overwhelming and you can be very successful on the exams. This is also a great way to get a List 2 requirement for the BA psychology majors.",
    "If you've ever wondered about how the brain works, this class is for you. Very well structured and very informative on an important topic. Although there may be slightly easier SC credits, this one is much more useful; now when you read pop books or news articles that mention the brain, you'll have a much better and more holistic idea of what's going on.Class structure is 3 tests, 1 paper, and 1 final. Each test has fill-in-the-blanks using a word bank with extra terms, and 1 essay. Final is of a similar structure.The class is pretty technical (for ex, our textbook is a neuroscience textbook). You can rely on the class lectures to learn the material, and the lectures are very good. Approximately half of the lectures are done by guests from the medical school and they're all great.Mandatory section was pretty enjoyable, and more importantly, very helpful for learning the material. Lectures are usually 50 minutes jam-packed with new brain system terminology. Section is a way for students to digest this material andask questions. TA Zhihao Zhang is excellent, if the class is offered again you should definitely try to get in his section. He's very devoted to the class and is extremely prepared for each section.",
    "Definitely! It is a great neuroscience course. You really do learn a lot, and it is much more painless than Psych 160 or 170, and definitely any of the MCDB courses. There are three midterms, each worth 10%, that keep you up to date with the material, which is incredibly helpful, and not too stressful since each is only worth 10%. Section is 20%, there is afinal 10-page paper (not very difficult at all... you choose the topic), and the final is worth 30%.This is definitely the one to take if you want a neuroscience course that's incredibly engaging without being too nitty-gritty.",
    "This is a comprehensive class about the brain. You learn nitty gritty chemical processes and the anatomy of the brain. By the end of the course, you can talk pretty knowledgeably about what's happening in your brain, but it also requires a ton of work. Professor Arnsten gives lots of opportunities for non-science people to still interact with the course (the paper, etc.)",
    "I highly recommend Intro to the Human Brain. It's NOT a gut, but it stays away from excessive detail and is perfect for none-science majors who still want a challenging and useful course. I think about human interactions with the environment in an entirely different way now. I'm quite pleased to have taken this class.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course for students interested in considering thought from a physical, low-level basis (which would be many students!)",
    "A GREAT COURSE. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS IF YOU CAN. I absolutely loved this class because I learned SO MUCH really interesting stuff that it's really cool to know. Yes, there's a lot of memorization and some stuff that it's hard to wrap your head around, but it is really great knowledge to have. Amy Arnsten is fantastic, really caring and sweet, fun and funny, and a super clear and articulate. I only wish she taught more of the lectures because there are a lot of guest lecturers that are sometimes more hard to follow. The class is definitely a lot of work--not a gut in any way. 3 midterms, 10-12 pg paper and a final, plus weekly discussion that depending on your TA requires a variant amount of work (you read research papers most weeks and have to write a summary that is more intense for some than others.) You don't really have to do the readings if you take really good notes in class, the textbook is more of a nice supplement for studying. Sarah Bhagat is THE BEST TA EVER. She was really fun to have in section, really good at reviewing with us and even set up an extra review session just for our section. The TA's in general all seemed really helpful from the review sessions they held. The tests are actually pretty predictable (fill in the blanks + essay question) if you really study and know everything, it's just a lot to know. Use flashcards! The paperis fun--it's the creative aspect of the course so it's not a research paper but there are lots of possible prompts that come from a more creative, even personal, perspective. Super fun class. I really loved it...",
    "A great and fun class that teaches you a ton about the brain. More technical than the most psych classes though. I would recommend highly to anyone interested in psych, neuroscience, or biology.",
    "Definitely more brain than thought here. Worth taking. Interesting and very well taught, but this is really a simple neuroscience class. Definitely take it if this is your cup of tea or you want a worthwhile science class to fulfill your requirement. But this is not something that you will sail through, and if you're looking for a class on thought and the more psychological aspects of the brain, you may want to keep looking.",
    "Take this class only if you are really interested in neuroscience. It is definitely not an easy science credit, you really have to put a lot of work if you want to do well in the class. I felt that I was learning a lot without really understanding the material well, I would say that some background in biology is certainly a plus.",
    "Yes; take it over other intro neuroscience courses. It can be tough, but pretty much everything you need to know is in the lectures. If it's difficult, there's still very few surprises. And it's interesting stuff!",
    "If you are looking for an easy science credit, this is not the one. It is challenging and difficult at times, for a non-science person like me. I thought the paper was really difficult too.",
    "The lectures are pretty fast-paced and packed with information, and then in section, you discuss the main concepts and details you need to take away from the lectures. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You really do learn a lot, and the lectures are good. There are three exams and a final paper and final exam.",
    "This is an intensive introduction to the science of the brain, but is perfectly accessible and even fascinating for non-science major. As someone who generally loves social science classes only, this was perhaps my favorite course of the semester.",
    "Take it! Brain and Thought is super interesting pretty much no matter what kind of person you are academically. Amy Arnsten's lectures are poetic and beautiful while also being packed with information. Guest lectures are the experts from the med school. The book is also interesting and helpful, but lectures are what you're tested on so DON'T MISS THEM (not like you'd want to anyway). Information does sometimes go by quickly in lecture though, so you have to be alert in lecture (oops), because not everything can be figured out from lecture slides or notes later.",
    "Yes, definitely take it!",
    "It's a really interesting class. You learn a lot of material, and it's all fascinating. It just makes you want to learn more.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Introduction to Brain and Thought to another student! It was a class that was very accessible for a non-science major, and taught me a great deal about how my brain works in every day life. Whether you plan to use this information towards a career or not, it is fascinating to understand more about yourself on a physiological level. The class is also a great way to hear experts in their respective fields and be presented with novel research and leading ideas.",
    "Take this class! The material is really interesting!",
    "Interesting, but a lot of guest lecturers who are hit or miss. Has the risk of making something that's really interesting inaccessible and hard to engage with.",
    "amazing class. one of the best taken. well organized, interesting lectures. prof + TAs are fabulous. makes difficult material very manageable.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "For those who are interested in the brain and don't mind memorizing a book, I would recommend this class.",
    "It's a great module if you want to know more about the brain, but be prepared to work. A lot of memorisation.",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yalie. The course is all you need to understand the framework of how the mind and thought works.",
    "It's a tough class, covers a lot of material in a really short time. The amount of infoemation you're expected to know is a little daunting, but the tests are reasonable and you're prepared to know what to expect. Professor Arnsten is great. She loves the material from the class and really wants her students to enjoy it as well. Some of the guest lecturers I didn't like as much- mainly the problem was that they tried to put too much information into a 50 minute lecture. A lot of people stopped taking notes halfway through the lecture bc there was so much being said\/on the slides that there wasn't enough time to process the information.",
    "Absolutely recommended. Easy to do well if you prepare and take notes.",
    "Perfect for a cog. sci. or psych. major who wants a one-semester dive into neuroscience.",
    "This is a really interesting class. It is a wonderful(!!!) science credit. The exams consist of IDs and essay questions (that you sometimes get before the exam). The information is insanely cool and it revolutionizes the way you think about your own actions and behavior. I wish I had taken it earlier so I could take more cog sci courses. This course reminds me why a liberal arts education is important--it exposes you to new information! The professor is really lovely and the TAs tend to be super nice. MAKE SURE TO GET A GOOD ONE!!!! If robert wickham is ta-ing, take his section. Some TAs are just NOT helpful and sometimes you need someone who will go over the information with you multiple times!",
    "Though neuroscience isn't really my thing, I did enjoy this class and felt like I learned a lot of cool\/interesting stuff. Professor Arnsten is a sweetheart, and the lectures are fairly easy to follow. Not a gut, but certainly a manageable science course, whether you're a psych\/cogsci major or not. That said, don't buy the Neuroscience textbook. Super-expensive and filled with dense, impenetrable text that is mostly a repeat of the lectures, plus a computer program that's more of a cool toy than anything else. I stopped using the book after the first week or so and did just fine."
