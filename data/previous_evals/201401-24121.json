    "I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot about different types of cancer.",
    "I really enjoyed the speakers and range of topics covered in this course. I think my favorite lecture was the one on exogenous hormones where it was more discussion based. Perhaps more lectures like that one!",
    "Favorite class at YSPH thus far.",
    "It was a great broad overview of cancer epi, and allowed us to learn about various different cancer sites, issues and special topics. I especially liked that there was a guest lecture almost every week. But for someone who is interested in cancer epidemiology, I would've liked to learn in more detail the methodology behind cancer epi and how to deal with the particular issues associated with this particular area.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I liked having different guest lecturers each week.",
    "This is a very good course. Its main strengths are that it covers the main topics in cancer epidemiology and that several of these topics are presented by experts in the field."
