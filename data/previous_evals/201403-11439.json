    "The readings were much more time intensive than any other course, and I often could not finish them each week. Thesis sentences forum was helpful for that reason (when I couldn't finish the readings myself).",
    "Question 12: This course was valuable mostly in that it asked students who want to work in the fields of international development (and to a lesser extent, conservation) to examine their assumptions and the power relations inherent in the type of work they do. It was more theory-based and less couched in terms of students own experiences than I would have liked.",
    "I took this class as a foundational introduction to social science, hoping it would be particularly focused on the conservation side (vs. the development side). It turned out to be more focused on development theory than on conservation, but there were still some interesting conservation readings. It's also heavy into anthropology, but I should have known that since it was cross-listed in the anthro department. It was more anthropology than I cared to learn, but it still provided a good introduction to social science theory.",
    "The instructor did little to create a comprehensive narrative for the class. It felt like a jumbled collection of readings with no clear theme. Lecture should be used to frame \"big picture\" ideas and questions that contextualize the readings. The instructor said little that was comprehensible about how everything tied together. Additionally, there is far too much focus on Foucauldian analyses of conservation and development. I would appreciate seeing a greater diversity of readings from Marxian and other frameworks. The instructor could also be better about accepting non-Foucauldian explanations. The class was too large to have productive discussion. The size should be smaller or there should be a greater focus on the lecture. Or the class could be broken into two discussion groups.",

    "The readings",
    "The wide range of readings and the class discussions.",
    "The in-class discussions, which towards the second half of the semester became very interesting. It took the class a long time to feel comfortable with addressing the serious questions that the class brought up in discussions, and I think this contributed to discussion at the beginning of the course being somewhat stilted or lackluster.",
    "Some of the readings were painful to get through for someone with no background in anthro or in development theory, but the weekly thesis sentence exercise was great. Hugely helpful in learning how to do these readings and a good skill to develop for complicated readings of any kind.",
    "I appreciated the format of having a discussion session for the latter half of each class that allows everyone to talk about the day's topic - the talking and sharing of ideals and interpretations really helps.",
    "The students in the class brought a diverse set of perspectives--I wish that I heard more about those in discussion.",
    "Carol's lectures are fantastic on the whole. I enjoyed the respectful, candid discussion with my peers.",
    "Writing thesis sentences is very helpful to train my reading skills.",
    "Writing thesis sentences each week was a very valuable exercise. I also enjoyed the discussion section of each class meeting.",

   "comments": [
    "Discussion leadership by instructor; lectures",
    "The longer writing assignments were structured in too specific of a way - inhibited exploration of ideas, and grade points were deducted for seemingly unimportant things",
    "I think it would be useful to hand in a draft of the final paper in the end of October or so. This helps not doing the final paper in the last minute. It would be helpful to get some concepts explained in the first or second class, so then students who don't have a background in SS could better understand the readings.",
    "connecting the readings to larger theoretical frameworks within conservation and developing. not just who the authors are, but how they contribute to larger literary tendencies and philosophies.",
    "I think the lectures could be more straight forward and focused, and less desultory.",
    "The professor's lectures were often disorganized. There was no clear thread running throughout the course to help students make sense of the material in context, or in relation to materials addressed the week before. More contextualization and more organized lectures would be helpful.",
    "I found the student-led discussion portion of the class just painful, on most occasions. Stilted conversation doesn't help anybody; but that was in part the nature of the group and the classroom (big room, big class with all kinds of different levels of background in the subject material). It was much better on days where Carol was actively participating in the student discussion part. I wish there had been more of a focus on drawing from peoples' past experiences, but that's not the professor or the course's fault - people just didn't seem that interested in volunteering stories about themselves.",
    "The readings can be quite difficult for people with no social sciences background.",
    "See question 13.",
    "Teaching!",
    "Carol commented a lot in the first couple of weeks about the quality of our thesis sentences. Initially, she provided her own examples and highighted good ones from our peers. However, when asked for more specifics on constructing a good sentence, she seemed very unwilling to provide guidance. She asked if we could not tell what a good sentence was, which did not address how she actually reads and evaluates our sentences. There was never any rubric or indication of how she was grading them. And, instead of stating that anyone who was interested could request feedback, it would be more helpful to just provide feedback on everyone's sentences for the first couple of weeks. The due date of the final paper is way too early.",
    "The second half of the class relied on a group of students leading a discussion on the week's readings. Many discussion questions students posed were premised on conclusions a student facilitator reached from the reading requiring lengthly background explanation or were framed in a way where they were really trying to present a statement rather than a question. As such, discussion at times was minimal or went on tangents (which is not necessarily bad). I would have liked to see the professor facilitate the discussions for at least the first two weeks of class. Though the discussions improved, facilitation is an art that can be learned from first by seeing how it should be conducted. Also it would have been great for the professor to emphasize students developing how to lead focused and in depth discussions as she did for emphasizing the importance of critical reading.",
    "The lecture portion of the class time provided a lot of useful information and helped tie the readings and concept together, however it was sometimes unclear what exactly we were supposed to get out of the lectures. Posting copies of all of the lectures could have been helpful as well.",
    "Some of the readings were practically unintelligible for students who did not have an anthropological background."
