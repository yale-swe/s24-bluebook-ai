    "It is a standard intermediate Spanish class, a continuation of Spanish 130.",
    "You're probably only taking the class because you have to fulfill your language requirement. That's why I took it. It's very similar to Span 130. I don't really know how to rate the professors. Luis was ok, very nice and personable, though at the beginning I didn't like him because he used to laugh at everything. He's a fair grader though and understands that sometimes stuff gets turned in late. I didn't like the location of the class (Phelps Hall), but I don't know how that will change in the upcoming years. Overall, your average language course.",
    "yes!",
    "I would! It's an extension of L3, not too hard, not that much work. You just get better at Spanish. Take it with Luis if he's still teaching it. He's so chill, so nice, and really good. Definitely recommend.",
    "If you get Luis it's amazing!! Really honestly he makes it so interesting. I liked the course; we talked about interesting material that really made me engage with learning the language!",
    "While I think its a pretty good class, its hard to imagine recommending it to anyone who doesn't need to fill their requirement. It does a good job of introducing you to literature and culture while still being a grammar based class (versus L5 classes).",
    "Because it is a daily class you have lots of work from day to day but it is never too much so it's a pretty manageable class. I think that if you get an instructor that you get along well with this can be a very enjoyable and worthwhile class.",
    "Good combination of advanced grammar\/vocabulary with stories, movies and songs incorporated to improve listening and reading comprehension. Would recommend to another student because it is straightforward and improves your spanish."
