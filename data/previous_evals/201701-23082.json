    "I like the format for both the two classes.",
    "The course was awful. It needs to be revamped entirely. Ethics is an incredibly important topic and should be given the highest priority. This class made is apparent that BBS does not highly value ethics and scientific misconduct. We were even advised to record all of our emails with our PI! That's an unacceptable recommendation for how to be a student at Yale. If you have to do that (either in response to something or out of the fear), the environment and culture needs to be drastically changed. This is not acceptable.",
    "A strength is that it is very low time commitment, but leads to good discussions and interesting topics. A weakness is the obvious inability for Yale to support PhD students when the ethical dilemma involves a conflict with their PI. No matter what the dilemma is, by standing up to your PI, you risk messing up your entire future career, as any post-doctoral research position requires a good letter from that PI. This is an industry-wide problem, but its unfortunate that even a place as progressive as Yale doesn't have a good infrastructure in place to help support the student. This became evident during the course. A future improvement could be a more engaging speaker for the BBS-wide event.",
    "Session was longer than necessary. The review was useful.",
    "If it's so important, it should be treated as such. This means that professors should actually prepare for lecture and there should be clear goals...",
    "The group session for all BBS students could be improved. The professors were unable to tell us how yale protects students who report academic dishonesty of their professors. This was very frustrating and made us feel like there weren't processed established to protect us. The department based section (CBB) felt like a waste of time."

    "Yeah, I will recommend this course. As the professor said when you became independent scientist, you probably would be the only person double check your research work and make sure everything is logic and true. It's important to set the standards high at the beginning of a person's career.",
    "Nope. Worst \"course\" I have ever taken in my life.",
    "Yes. It is short, but filled with important information.",
    "It is required.",
