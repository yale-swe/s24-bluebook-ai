   "comments": [
    "The material covered isn't anything ground-breaking. If you already have taken a few classes on development issues, you likely won't learn much. The goal of the course is to help you write your senior essay. However, I don't think this was emphasizes enough. Much of what we read is not directly related to your topic itself and I felt that discussing the issues, while interesting, was not particularly fruitful. Perhaps this is my gripe with the IS senior essay in general, which feels like a rather diluted process. I have no complaints about Professor Lust though, she's excellent.",
    "This is a fantastic seminar. It is a fantastic class. The readings are interesting and class discussions are great. So far, I have had a great experience working on my senior essay- I have made real progres towards a GOOD essay. Prof. Lust is incredible. She is really helpful and generous with her time, and she is light hearted in class, which makes it fun, and not just interesting.",
    "This course is for IS seniors interested in writing their senior essays on the Middle East and Africa. The first semester is dedicated to doing a variety of readings on different topics surrounding development and governance, and the second semester is focused on developing, editing, and writing the senior essay. Prof. Lust is a great professor, and really willing to work with students, even if their topic is not within her area of specialty."
