    "We learned about the different impositions to domestic and global climate policy and the different market mechanisms that can be employed to decarbonize such as energy efficiency, pricing schemes, grid revitalization, etc. We learned about the global environmental governance scheme such as the Paris Climate Agreement and we learned about the climate policies within a range of countries including China and India.",
    "Policy memo writing skills Knowledge about energy policy Understanding of global climate regime",
    "I feel that I gained particularly insight into the history and current state of climate change negotiations, prospective solutions for the climate crisis, and substantial knowledge about the energy industry.",
    "Learnt about many topics related to climate change policy (e.g. natural gas, renewable energy, energy efficiency, international climate agreements, the role of china\/india\/developing countries in climate action etc)",
    "I learned about global efforts to fight climate change, and especially about methods and policies that have been unsuccessful.",
    "How to write policy memos",
    "Broad overview of climate policy over the last few decades with a focus on effective action taken by different industries, governments, and companies to increase energy efficiency and transition toward sustainable economies. Unlike other classes, Professor Esty assigns short 2-page policy memos (rather than five page essays) addressed to key government officials so students have the chance to practice the mode of the writing most used in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The material was fascinating and Esty is an engaging lecturer who has a lot of experience and his insights are valuable. The readings came from a diverse set of sources and were very interesting. Having the lectures recorded was amazing and allowed me to rewatch and relearn whenever I felt my understanding of a subject was weaker. The TFs for this course are great! They answer emails promptly, their office hours are so insightful, and they are very knowledgeable on the course material. The guest lectures were very cool and covered a broad spectrum of topics. The policy memos were a cool\/fun assignment. Weaknesses: I wish Professor Esty used a powerpoint in class which would make it easier to follow him. The fact that participation was a large portion of our grade even though it was a large lecture was confusing. I wish there was some sort of (mandatory or not) discussion section where you could meet to go over the topics and the readings. That would have improved my understanding of the material and forced me to stay engaged with the class more. More focus on climate justice, how climate change impacts women\/ minority groups more, etc. would have been nice. Also the possibility for non-market oriented solutions such as legal mandates could've been further fleshed out.",
    "Policy memos: definite strength. TAs were great resources in teaching us how to write policy memos, and provided good feedback to improve subsequent memos. Given the amount of work they took, relative to the final exam, they should have counted for more than 10% of the grade each. 15-20% would have been more appropriate. Lecturer spent most of the semester speaking solely about energy, and overwhelmingly from the US domestic context. Though that is an area of expertise of his, MUCH greater emphasis ought to have been placed on the global climate regime, climate policy in Brazil, India, China, Russia, EU and South Africa, and a more integrative, global perspective on climate policy. This was a major drawback of the course.",
    "I believe the policy memo assignments were invaluable skill-building exercises for the real-world ahead and I liked how we had enormous choice to write about issues of particular interest to us. I also appreciate the wealth of reading resources for every class, covering diverse perspectives on a single issue. I wish more time had been spent on climate adaptation and solutions for poor developing countries. Also, I do not believe \"class participation\" should be a component of student assessment, given the large lecture format of the class.",
    "Prof Esty is a great lecturer. Charismatic, funny and obviously very intelligent, he talks basically for 1h 20min straight without slides or a script. I really enjoyed listening to his points of view and experiences. You also get to learn about a very important topic from multiple important lenses. Yet, sometimes it was difficult to stay engaged during the entire time. Furthermore, we were given a lot of readings every week, but never really did a deep dive into them. Maybe an option to dive more critically into our readings would be to have sections. Finally - I would say to change the 20-30% participation rule! It's so hard for everyone to participate in a lecturer hall of more than 40 people, especially when some people know a lot more \/ dare to speak a lot more for others.",
    "The strength of this course is its subject matter, and the wide-scope questions you are forced to face. While these questions were fairly broad and fundamental, they encouraged me to grapple with the construction of real, implementable solutions to seemingly eternal problems. The weaknesses of the course were many -- 1) the readings for the course were not well curated (a bizarre mix of 2-5 page news articles and 50-100 page international negotiations and analyses full of dense legal language). I was discouraged from engaging with the readings because I felt that they were either too detailed to be interesting or even comprehensible without deep background knowledge, or they offered very little information that coordinated with the lecture. Overall, the readings seemed to serve as resources for the policy memos, which was useful for writing memos, but not useful for engaging with the course on the whole. There was a distinct disconnect between the readings and the lectures, which brings me to: 2) the lectures felt completely disorganized and almost improvisational. With more structure (visual aids, perhaps), Prof. Esty's extemporaneous style of speaking might be effective in captivating attention, but without that structure I found the lectures difficult to follow or take meaningful themes from. A lot of time was spent discussing timelines and Prof. Esty's first-hand of the successes of certain policy initiatives, or simply naming countries that were on one or another fact sheet list. There was no clear trajectory to the course.",
    "Could be improved by improving the assessments.. The policy memos were repetitive and we never got good enough (or quick enough) feedback to actually improve our policy memo writing.",
    "Professor Esty is very knowledgeable and cares deeply for the topic and his students. His assignments were short, but very effective and often required more thought and research to make a concise argument. I also appreciated that we had the chance to practice the type of writing used in the profession and now feel confident about my ability to draft memos. I do wish Professor Esty integrated the readings more in his lectures and used a power point or another form of multimedia as supplements. At times, it was difficult to follow along with just his voice."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Especially if you are interested in climate change and want to learn about market-oriented solutions\/ policy-based learning. This class was a very cool course unlike others that are more theoretical. This was action-based which was inspiring and seemed more practical\/ useful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as an introduction to the climate change issue for any student.",
    "If you're very interested in climate change policy, to the point that you'd be able to listen to Prof Esty talk for 1h 20min straight and also do the readings out of your own volition, take this class. However, note that this is a very self-driven class (no section, you don't have to do the readings), so if you aren't self-motivated to learn there is no point taking it.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It is poorly organized, and does not offer considerable insight that one could not develop by engaging with readings and news independently.",
    "I am an undergraduate, so take my opinion with that in mind. Ultimately, I would not. The thing I really like abut Yale is that it pretty aggressively avoid preprofessional courses which too often get bogged down in specifics of situations, instead of understanding general principles that are fundamental to those situations. This class very quickly got bogged down in the specifics of specific negotiations and specific countries' positions. While that was interesting (and ESTY is a great teacher and knows a ton) that wasn't really what I was hoping to get out of the class. It wasn't very intellectually challenging and it seemed like the class was roughly divided into thirds 1\/3 who knew relatively little on the subject, 1\/3 who were in F&ES, but weren't very invested in the large lecture format, and 1\/3 who were quite involved inn climate negotiations (had been to COPs, wrote memos to leaders, etc. This class was perhaps the moat helpful to the latter third (oh which I do not count myself). Some of the classes were quite interesting Esty's take on carbon fee, on the pricing of green energy, etc but by and large it isn't that amazing. Esty is an expert in the field and to get a chance to go into his office hours might be the best argument to take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in an overview of climate policy. Professor Esty is an expert in the field and draws upon his experience. I also generally enjoyed the memos and the ability to shape the topic to fit my interest. However, the lectures can get repetitive and for those who have already studied the topic, most of the material is likely familiar. The workload is very fair and the TAs are wonderful!"
