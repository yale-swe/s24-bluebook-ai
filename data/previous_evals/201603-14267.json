   "comments": [
    "I gained a much greater understanding of Spanish cinema, of both the ongoing conversation taking place over time between different Spanish directors and of the individual films we watched. I learned analyze films as pieces of art rather than just enjoy them as pieces of entertainment. Because of this, the class gave me a greater appreciation of cinema as a whole. My Spanish also dramatically improved as a result of watching so much Spanish cinema, as well as through the various essays assigned for the class.",
    "I was able to learn a lot about the history behind Spain and its film industry as well as the film industry producers and directors, those that made a big difference for the film industry. I enjoyed watching the many films that taught me about Spain's personality. I also learned more about how to write well in Spanish and what writing essays was like.",
    "Taking this course definitely developed my ability to think critically about movies. Professor Valis has so much knowledge about Spanish Cinema that she's able to delve into very specific themes and theories while discussing different directors' influences and thoughts on a broader level as well. This was my first course in Spanish film but I feel like Professor Valis gives all the tools necessary to learn a lot about film while developing as a Spanish speaker.",
    "I learned how to view things from a different perspective.",
    "I gained the ability to analyze films and understand the rationale of directors in shaping their cinematographic choices.",
    "I felt this course provided a great overview of Spanish Cinema as well as general film theory (it was my first film class, and I never felt lost).",
    "This was the first film class I had taken and I really enjoyed learning how to approach analyzing a film both thematically and stylistically. I also gained unique insight into Spanish culture by learning about its cinema that I don't think I could have gotten otherwise.",
    "I learned to view cinema in a completely new way. I had never considered how a director achieved meaning, besides plot, and this class really opened my eyes to that reality."

   "comments": [
    "The course gives an excellent overview of various directors while also giving an in depth understanding of the style and ideas of a few of the most important Spanish directors. The course also improves Spanish ability and general analytical ability, mainly through the assigned essays. I don't feel the course developed my spoken Spanish as much as it improved my written Spanish, something that could be improved by making the class more discussion-based than it currently is.",
    "I wish that everyone in the class could have been more engaging in the movies, since I know not everyone watched them. I enjoyed our discussions, but wish there had been more structure to them. It would have been nice to receive a little more help on the final essay in terms of preparing for it since I am a freshmen, but considering there are upperclassmen in the class as well it makes sense that there wasn't. I really liked the presentations we each had to give and how there was a lot of leeway for us to pick what we wanted to focus on in that and the essays we had to write.",
    "It is great how we got to view a variety of films, but we couldn't spend too much time on each one",
    "The movie viewings were twice a week at set, but unfortunately very frustrating, times. As a result, if I were to watch a film I would need to find it online and watch it in my own time or even read a synopsis of films I had to miss. The course itself promotes terrific discussion of many of the themes we learn about.",
    "I would say the biggest strength is the incredibly well-curated, well-thought out film selection, as well as Professor Valis herself (amazing teacher).",
    "The strengths of this class are the material, discussions and teaching. The class could be improved by structuring the sequence of films either more chronologically or thematically and providing a bit more information\/background about the overarching groups of films.",
    "Strengths: The quality of the material we're exposed to is amazing. The discussions are engaging. Weaknesses: Too much covered, too little depth."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course - I think Spanish cinema asks a lot of very interesting questions and includes some well-made, thought-provoking films. The course also definitely gives a deeper appreciation of film as an art form. It was an enjoyable way to learn some Spanish history and to improve Spanish, without being too work-intensive.",
    "Yes, especially a native speaker.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone who is genuinely interested in learning all about the different components of Spanish movies. Professor Valis is a fantastic lecturer and all of the information is there- anyone who enjoys speaking, and listening to, Spanish should take this course",
    "Yes- great way to broaden horizons",
    "I never intended to take a language class. However, this was the perfect class to use in order to test out of language requirements. I would definitely recommend it to another student in my position.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is already fluent in Spanish (discussion was in Spanish and at a very high level). Even if you're not a film buff, you'll love this class.",
    "I really recommend this class because the movies and readings are very interesting, Prof. Valis is great, the workload is not too much, and you can learn a lot about Spanish culture.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. My advice: stick with it. There will be a time at the beginning of the semester, in which you feel you're pulling teeth to get through the older movies, but by the end I promise it will all come together. I didn't just learn to love Spanish cinema, I learned to love movies in a whole new way. Profesora Valis is genuinely inspiring and her love of this subject in infectious. Highly recommend."
