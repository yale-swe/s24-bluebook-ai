   "comments": [
    "This class is amazing. The year-long structure is crucial to dive deep into: first, the social enterprise sector, then engage with one from within a host organization, and last to come back and process all the knowledge by writing a case study. Above all, I have learnt TEAM WORK! If you think that team projects\/presentation that last for one month in some of the other Yale classes -- try to work with people for a FULL year. You learn a lot.",
    "The second half of a yearlong course, we learned how to write an effective case presenting the problems facing a social enterprise we'd worked with over the summer. Building the case and consolidating the lessons learned from the summer project was very rewarding.",
    "I learned how to analyze large amounts of data and information, develop a compelling narrative, and present it in a manner that was digestible. It was also my first major project working with a team; hence, I bettered my team-working skills (as clich as that sounds). A large part of what I learned was over the summer working with the NGO on the project, the results of which this class was based. The project included data collection, stakeholder management, product development and interviewing.",
    "teamwork and research and drafting cases",
    "I learned about theoretical frameworks, potential of impact, and the complex challenges surrounding social enterprises in BoP economies. Through examining case studies and eventually writing my own, I felt that I could apply knowledge learned in class to real-world problems at social enterprise organizations we were placed at over the summer",
    "Skills: case-writing, team work, managing a long-term project. Knowledge: improved understanding of African health context, social enterprises. Insights: whether social enterprises are an adequate solution to global society's most challenging problems. Overall, very happy with what I learned in this class and would highly recommend.",
    "Hard to know where to begin! The first semester of this class is a great - albeit a whirlwind - intro to many basic business concepts, and social enterprise-specific concepts. The summer expanded my knowledge immensely. Much of the knowledge is fairly esoteric, specific to Ghana's water sector and the field of microinsurance. However, other parts gave me skills that are absolutely generalizable: the problem solving; the planning of meetings; the stakeholder analysis; and the communication skills just to name a few. This semester, I learned the valuable skill of writing for my audience. Writing the case means knowing how to present information you know intimately well to an audience that is probably completely unfamiliar with it. This means knowing what to include and what to omit, and how to present things in order to keep it engaging but also intellectually complex.",
    "This course specifically focused on writing and compiling online case studies."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The structure: The year-long structure is crucial to dive deep into: first, the social enterprise sector, then engage with one from within a host organization, and last to come back and process all the knowledge by writing a case study. Bo: An awesome instructor. Always fast with feedback, always happy to help, always into everything he is teaching. One can learn so much from him -- from his professionalism, from his advice on team work -- make sure you interact with him. There is a reason why he is known as Bo and not Robert ( super approachable guy). Weaknesses: Sometimes less engagement by students in semester 1: I think Bo needs to ban laptops and ask people to print out readings. Bo, many times I have seen people not pay attention to you (SOM banned them for a reason--decreases learning outcomes and attention). Class chemistry: I feel like maybe some events should be put for people in this class to bond a little earlier in the semester. Hopefully CAS\/Macmillan can assist. Lack of class chemistry might affect work within teams as well (",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale, hands down. Bo is great, the people in the class are generally great, the summer project is challenging but amazing. Only improvements I'd suggest are having a more detailed timeline of deadlines in the fall semester to ensure work gets done earlier, and more opportunities for cross-team work so the whole class gets to know one another better.",
    "I liked how independent it was because I was able to make it fit around my schedule, which eased my courseload during very busy times. Bo Hopkins, the professor, was also incredibly available and helpful in giving advice and helping us with the case.",
    "I LOVED the class!! I not only got to see a social enterprise in action but also the multilateral partnerships surrounding it. The summer experience really puts things in perspective, and you also work very closely with your teammates. Some improvements may include more tangible lessons from case studies over the spring, and a better timeline structure for the fall.",
    "Strengths: Bo is amazing, fascinating material, excellent experience over the summer, work is different from what the average Yale student would otherwise be exposed to, requires independent thinking and initiative. Weaknesses: teamwork can sometimes be challenging, work almost exclusively within our project groups of 3. Overall, I don't think improvements are necessary. That teamwork is challenging is also a sort of strength of this class - I definitely think it helped me prepare for working in other contexts.",
    "Strengths of the course are in the content of the course and the instruction of the course (shout out to Bo). Also, the case is an excellent way to solidy things learned over the summer. However, there are definitely some weaknesses. The class period should be mandatory from the beginning of the semester, even if nothing is planned, allowing for a set time period for teams to work on the case or ask questions. There should be an earlier deadline, maybe in early September, for a task that just involves writing everything from the summer down in some kind of format, however unstructured - this might help in avoiding students forgetting important details.",
    "The course is taught by an incredible professor with great knowledge of the field who consistently goes out of his way to find interesting projects.",
    "This course could be improved by including more pre-departure information on issues like harassment that may be encountered during the trip, during the first section of the course. Additionally, I think the second semester of the course could be reasonably condensed into half a semester. The additional time to complete the project is appreciated, but perhaps not necessary."

   "comments": [
    "This class is a must. No other class would allow you to engage with the complexities of development as this year-long class. No other class can allow you to work (and be frustrated) with two other teammates for a full year; lots to learn. No other class could offer so much outside class learning from a great instructor like Bo.",
    "Definitely, definitely take this class if you have any interest at all in public service abroad, the African continent, social enterprise, or poverty alleviation. It's a two-semester commitment but includes a summer project what's not to love?? I learned SO much personally and academically and professionally through the summer experience and it's something I never could have imagined doing but now an experience that has really shaped my career goals and one I will never forget. Bo is a kind, smart, funny teacher and he cuts straight through a lot of the typical seminar bs of flowery language\/not saying much etc and asks really great questions. In terms of practical learning and getting to know about the real world and having material to think about with regards to more philosophical questions, this course is unsurpassed. I am so lucky that I stumbled upon it.",
    "Absolutely. You just don't get a chance to take another class like this at the undergraduate level. It is a year of working on a project with a party outside of Yale, with real stakeholders. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "yes. great opportunity. kind of like an international capstone project so great for non global majors to get that experience. more classes like this!!",
    "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in social entrepreneurship, international development, impact investing, or tackling a range of issues from education to healthcare, this should be on your shopping list - truly unique opportunity for experiential learning",
    "100%. You should take this course if you're interested in innovative solutions to big problems. I think each person takes away what they put into it, but the course is well-organized for students who want to consider market-oriented approaches to alleviating extreme poverty and tackling global health problems. Bo is an extremely good professor\/mentor and is really invested in your success. It is sometimes rare to have a professor who knows and (seems to) believe in you like Bo seems to. There are very few opportunities to work and learn in Africa, and this is an amazing one.",
    "Absolutely. It is the best course I have taken at Yale. Not only is it incredibly interesting, but it is really engaging in how much it surprisingly demands creativity and independent thinking. This is certainly true for the summer component, but also for the casework in the first semester, and the writing in the second. It also grounds all of the material in the real world through the summer portion, which is truly unique with regard to the rest of my yale experience.",
    "Absolutely, this is a great course for anyone looking for real industry experience or to get a greater understanding of social enterprise."
