    "HIST 301J was a great survey on Korean history. It also informed me on the historical process and historiography more than any other Yale History seminar I have taken. Professor Burge knows the subject very intimately and demonstrated a substantial willingness to help students one-on-one.",
    "A ton of different things.",
    "This was basically a survey course of Korean history, starting with a brief introduction to the Choson Dynasty.",
    "This class was styled as a seminar when it would have better served as a lecture in the way that the instructor taught. While informative, the readings had little to do with the writings we were expected to do for class. That being said given the general lack in courses on Korea at Yale it was a seemingly decent survey on the history of generally the 20th century on the peninsula. However, the title and theme of the class, \"The Two Koreas,\" was not really discussed.",
    "I have to main takeaways: (1) learning about the history of traditions in Korea, such as how deeply rooted Confucianism is, (2) learning how to be a better historical writer.",
    "I learned about the history of Korea, particularly starting from the period 1905-1970s, and gained an appreciation for the evolution in the historiography of Korea.",
    "Amazing class with an amazing instructor. It is not like a typical seminar, but more of a quasi-seminar, semi-lecture class. No background needed. Will come out having a very good overview foundation in the modern history of Korea.",
    "I learned how to begin to start thinking for myself using prinary sources. It was great to see what connections I could begin to make on my own."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the syllabus and readings were well-designed for the course. The only area of potential improvement would be facilitation of seminar discussion. Professor Burge developed creative partner activities to spark discussion, but whole-seminar discussion was often more stagnant. I think this could be most easily fixed by more nuanced facilitation. Professor Burge's questions were often too broad (what did you think about the reading?) or belied a clear answer he was seeking (what did writer X think about Y?). In an upper-level history seminar, ideally our discussions could be more engaging. The professor could have asked students to share insights from their reading reflection papers, when relevant. Additionally, more complicated questions such as \"what flaws did you identify in author Z's analysis?\" or \"how did our first reading relate to the topics we discussed last week?\" could have initiated more fruitful group discussions.",
    "Very strong course. Should be offered in a lecture style. Many would take",
    "This course had many strengths. It was so well organized - I loved how the different weeks were split into different topics. The readings were so fascinating and very diverse (we read memoirs, scholarly books and articles, excerpts from novels, lots of different primary sources). We also did a few role play scenarios which was really fun because we got to act as historical actors in the time period we were studying and deal with the dilemmas they grappled with. I also like how well spaced out the assignments were. I felt like I was busy but not overwhelmed. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "The instructor should be more clear on expectations for assignments. Several students did not feel like they were clear and as result re-writing was something a few had to do. In a more mild case the reading responses for the class were an unclear task as opposed to most Yale courses where summarizing the readings with clear themes and questions that arise from the readings a goal for the response. This fluctuated in this class and during our discussions as a seminar it was clear that students were not able to converse on some themes given how they weren't highlighted. Moreover, the class often became a conversation between the professor and 1 or 2 students who were particularly overactive in the class leaving the rest of us just sitting and listening with little opportunity for feedback.",
    "I enjoyed how accessible this course was, and I am glad that we were able to cover the a large time period of the history of the two Korea. However, I feel like we zipped through material very quickly, forgoing the opportunity to really dig into the content. I understand that perhaps that was the nature of the intro-level course, but I wish it were more focused. For the future, maybe you can have themes running through the course material and the students could have those themes in mind when doing the readings. I would recommend cutting some of the material to allow time for this closer analysis of sources. Additionally, I would have appreciated more discussion and less lecture. And when lectures are necessary, to integrate them with the discussion since it is a seminar.",
    "I think the strengths of this course is the professor's attention to welcoming students who may not have had background information on Korea or its history prior to the class through the syllabus and classroom discussion environment. The syllabus provides good review material and the professor is always helpful in referring students to additional information, although I think less class time could have been dedicated to lecturing period (about 2\/3rd of the class was dedicated to lecture with 1\/3 to discussion, particularly later in the course) even if it was at the expense of greater reading for the students prior to class.",
    "This class is meant to be an introductory-level course on Korean history. It's labeled as a seminar, but it's really a lecture course (and should be marketed as such in my opinion). A typical class would involve 40 min - 1 hour of lecture, and ~1 hour of discussion. These discussions were highly structured, mainly dealing with comprehension questions. This class has a lot of potential, but it was disappointing how we never as a class got beyond the \"who, what, and where\" of modern Korean history. This is the main reason I think the class should be labeled as a lecture. Students may expect a typical Yale seminar from the way this course is marketed, and that's not what they're going to get.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the lectures, and the vast amount of knowledge that was presented. Weaknesses: Some of the discussions were not helpful in terms of really engaging with the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great coverage of the material. It's not a gut though.",
    "Absolutely. Take it with Russell if you can.",
    "YES! This topic is not taught often enough. I think Yale needs to put more effort and funds into investing in a Korean studies program, though they have been doing a better job with recent events. And there is definitely significant interest in an expanded Korean studies department. There is also a lot of relevance of Korean History to American history yet many students sadly do not know this history.",
    "If you need a junior seminar or breadth course this may not be the type of course you need for upper-level writing practice towards a senior thesis. But if you are looking for a class on a rarely taught topic and are willing to put in the effort it could be interesting. That being said I would recommend to Cr\/D the course if its purely for interest rather than need.",
    "For those students who are interested in Korean history, they don't really have a choice because Yale doesn't offer many course offerings related to Korea (although I hope that will change).",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning a broad overview of Korean history from the Choson dynasty to the present era.",
    "I would recommend this course. Russell is an amazing teacher, and helped all of us understand a history that few of us had much knowledge in. While this oftentimes resulted in sessions turning into more of a lecture than a discussion, I found it very valuable.",
    "I would recommend this class to others students! Given that most of us did not come in with a lot of background knowledge, I think Russell did a great job making the material accessible for all of us. For anyone who wants to understand what's happening on the Korean peninsula today, knowing some basics of its modern history is incredibly important.",
    "I would recommend this class because it allows you to think critically about Korean history and culture."
