   "comments": [
    "Take it. Do the reading but don't spend too much time on it--the lectures make it all clear.Don't go to lecture sleep-deprived.",
    "Yes -- it is a good introduction to the CPR. In general, though, I wish that the department made the intro-to-CPR class a two semester thing, with the first semester being the aesthetic and the analytic, and the second semester being the dialectic",
    "DON't take this class unless you are a philsophy major. it is very intense!!!!! don't let the low number of 204 fool you. it should be like philosophy 402 or something.",
    "The Critique of Pure Reason could merit a career\u0092s-worth of reading rather than just a semester\u0092s-worth, and Professor Vogel\u0092s deep thinking attests to this fact. However, Phil 204 is a good introduction. I urge you to study the Critique if you want glean ideas that really don\u0092t seem outdated about metaphysics and epistemology, and to experience such an impressively \u0093architectonic\u0094 system of arguments. This course demands sustained attention and eagerness. The reading and writing requirements are light, but the thinking requirements are heavier than other philosophy courses I\u0092ve taken. This is an excellent course for philosophy students who enjoy deep, close reading and who don\u0092t mind that not all of the \u0093breakthrough\u0094 ideas encountered in lecture or on one\u0092s own will make it into a paper written for the course. This is largely reading and learning for its own sake.",
    "I would recommend it for those wishing to acquire a basic familiarity with Kant's contribution to Western thought."
