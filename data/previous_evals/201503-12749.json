   "comments": [
    "Hebrew is a very interesting language to learn. I recommend that anyone interested in Middle Eastern politics to try and learn Hebrew.",
    "The class requires outside work such as Hebrew Tables, section, and hebrew events.",
    "This is a good class for both those with a lot of background in the language or very minimal.",
    "I would summarize this class as an extremely thorough introduction to modern Hebrew and some elements of Israeli culture, where the small class size and daily schedule enable a unique closeness and companionship between students and between students and the professor. I would definitely recommend this class to another student looking to begin Hebrew studies, but I would advise students to make sure they are really interested in the material and committed to the workload because it is a big commitment in and out of the classroom (homework, cultural events, Hebrew tables, weekly sections, etc.)",
    "Remove any doubts about taking Hebrew - this class, and the program, are AWESOME. I've learned an incredible amount just from one semester, and actually intend on going to L5 hebrew. The cultural part of this course is very nice as well - you have to talk at the Hebrew tables at Slifka 5 times during the semester, and have to attend a few Israel-related events. Overall a great experience. Take it!",
    "Hebr 110 01 gives you a strong set of conversational and grammar skills to kickstart your learning of Hebrew. I would recommend it to anyone who is dedicated to the language and ready to put in time and effort.",
    "A lot of work, but you learn a lot and have fun."
