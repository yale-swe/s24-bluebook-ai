   "comments": [
    "Definitely a good class. The subject matter is worthwhile and interesting; because of the format of the class (a small lecture that isn't quite organized enough to be a pure lecture, and not quite small or intensive enough to be a seminar) I felt like we didn't get into the issues as deeply as we could have, but it was definitely a good class. With Eric teaching it, it was more on the cogsci side than the physics side, which meant I learned some history of psych too.",
    "Great course, particularly when taken with Professor Mandelbaum.",
    "It's more of a philosophy of psychology class than science, but that doesn't make it any less interesting.",
    "Unless you have a pretty good idea of what philosophy of science is already, this class is not going to be what you expect. That isn't a bad thing. The course is incredibly interesting. The material covered is pretty cool, but more interesting is the variety of perspectives through which this class invites you to observe the world. There isn't too much active work (3 essays over the semester) but the reading can get heavy, especially if you fall behind. All in all, not bad though. Definitely worth it for me; I learned a lot.",
    "Great class for anyone who wants to learn more about go science us evolved. Promotes great disussion about epistemology and how things are studied. Take this class! Eric is awesome!",
    "I thought it was a good class. It gave me a new perspective on how we acquire and analyze knowledge. The readings varied in how interesting they were. While the day-to-day discussions were not always particularly exciting, I come out of the class with a new view on science and the world. The workload was very reasonable and the papers were enjoyable and interesting to write.",
    "take it if you like psych",
    "Really great course for anyone looking to think a little more critically about what science is and how it works. It also makes a good first philosophy course; no background is assumed, but you do get a good bit of exposure to basic concepts in epistemology. Lots of really interesting readings on a range of related science and philosophy topics. Definitely recommended. That said, it's worth noting (as Professor Mandelbaum does in the first lecture) that this is decidedly a philosophy class and not a science class.",
    "This is a great course, at least with Eric Mandelbaum. He's brilliant and hilarious. Not too much work, and not too hard, even if you haven't taken philosophy before. Totally changed the way I view science.",
    "This is a very fun and interesting course. Eric Mandelbaum is funny and knowledgeable. The course is accessible to people with any background. The workload is normal for a philosophy course: three essays and a fair amount of reading (most of which, tough interesting, is not necessary to read for class).",
    "I would definitely recommend Philosophy of Science to another student. Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions is a must-read for anyone interested in science or philosophy, and Eric Mandelbaum makes the course, he really knows his stuff and is a great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you are a scientist, then this course provides bot ha nice intro to philosophy, and also a ton of relevant questions to ponder. If you have some background in philosophy, be forewarned that the course is designed as anintro course, but Professor Mandelbaum was always happy to discuss topics in more details if desired. Professor Mandelbaum is a very engaging lecturer, and the lecture was small enough to also facilitate some discussion during the class. He is not the most disciplined lecturer, though, so if you like strictly organized lectures every week, this may not be the best course."
