   "comments": [
    "It is a good introductory course, if you are interested in Geology or would like to take a science course which does not require extensive background knowledge of chemistry, biology, and the like. However, it does include quite a bit of reading and research, so if you are not a fan of writing a 20-page research paper on a geological process as your final, perhaps re-consider.",
    "I would suggest, especially EVST majors, to take this class just for the basic knowledge about geology. Most students never take courses like this and never really learn about the foundation of our earth.",
    "This is a straightforward introduction to geology that can act as a substitute for the lecture class, and is perfectly accessible to a non-scientific student like myself. The mix of science and humanities majors kept the class accessible without being a gut. Before each class, the students are given a set of about ten questions concerning a chapter of the text, and during the seminar, more or less each student presents the answer to one of the questions. There are also two student presentations of articles from scientific journals pertinent to the topic at hand every class. The format can get a little tedious sometimes, but you will learn a lot about geology (you actually read the entire textbook!), but it is not too bad. Professor Park is really great, a super funny guy who seems to really remember what it was like to be a college student. If you can stand to get up for the 9 am slot, take it!",
    "As a science class goes, not bad. Some prep time for each class, a small presentation every couple of weeks, and two papers.",
    "As a geology major, I think this was a great way to learn introductory geology and I think there needs to be more introductory science classes as well. Jeffrey Park clearly has an interest in teaching and is a great person to learn from. There's no problem sets or exams, just reading (the textbook and some scientific papers), in-class presentations, a 4-6 page paper and a 15-20 page final paper. I can't speak for non-science majors but I think this format should work well for them as it's structured similar to a humanities or social science seminar. But it's good for science majors also: reading and writing scientific papers and presenting ideas are important skills for any scientist, so it's great to be doing this in an introductory class. Also, the class was held in LC this year so it was far more convenient than having to walk up Science Hill. If you're a geology major and you can't take G&G 110 because it conflicts with physics, then I highly recommend taking this class to fulfill the introductory requirement instead.",
    "If you're interested in geology, it's an ok class. I thought it was pretty useful to learn about how different parts of the earth work and came to be. It's not overly difficult, but you should do the reading and participate in class if you actually want to get anything out of it.",
    "Great intro geo class, good for non-science folk. Very interesting subject, seminar-style discussion, occasional presentations, and a couple papers.",
    "This class was good. It was a seminar style science class with no problem sets and only two essays (4 and 20pgs). Don't be fooled though! Every day you have to answer an hours worth of questions. And be prepared to participate: its 30% of your grade and he doesn't let you be quiet.",
    "EVST 200 is a great class; you go rather quickly through the textbook Dynamic Earth. There are chapter questions that serve as a guide to discussions, and then there are student presentations after the chapter questions that illuminate scientific papers. I would highly recommend this course, even to non-science majors. You can choose your paper topics, and really cater the course to your interests.",
    "This class entails reading assignments and discussion questions for each class, bi-weekly student presentations, and a couple of papers. None of it is terribly labor-intensive, though the final paper is quite lengthy.However, I felt that the fact that the seminar was so student-driven rather deprived me of the opportunity to hear from the professor, who actually has training in this field. I think that this course may in fact be better suited to a lecture-style course."
