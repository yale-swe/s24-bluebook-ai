   "comments": [
    "You learn about a stage of development that's really interesting. I understand way more how and why adolescents make the choices they make and act the way they do.",
    "I learned a few interesting things about adolescent neurobiology that I did not before taking this course -- mainly in the areas of fear learning\/extinction, susceptibility to the effects of alcohol and cognitive vs. emotional development. I would not say I learned any real \"skills\" in this class outside of these few interesting facts.",
    "I learned how to integrate the subjects of psychology, neuroscience, economics and policy in a rigorous seminar environment. I learned to argue a point by not only grounding it in scientific evidence, but also rendering it compelling using creative thought and presentation in a debate setting, which I feel will be a valuable skill to apply in future courses, both in papers as well as in discussion.",
    "The big takeaways from the class for me was the idea that it is crucial not just to learn about the differences in the adolescent brain relative to adulthood and childhood, but to apply the neuroscience that we know in order to change laws and policies that are ineffective for helping adolescents move successfully into adulthood.",
    "I gained insight into the differential development of different brain regions and how that development is thought to affect adolescent behavior. We also focused on translating scientific research into policy.",
    "I gained a wide-ranging understanding of the current issues in neuroscience and behavioral research on adolescence, as well as the policy implications of that research. I am now better able to read, comprehend and critique detailed scientific papers, and I understand the basics of how frontostriatal circuitries function and the crucial role they play in development. I also learned to see several differences between normal and abnormal neural development and to think critically about problems in the context of what is feasible in modern research methodology.",
    "I learned a lot about the adolescent brain in this class. I've never really looked at that developmental period before, so it was fun to learn about it. The class is very based on reading and understanding new research about adolescence which is cool.",
    "Great introduction to the adolescent brain and the unique behavioral, cognitive, and neural changes that occur during adolescence. Also, ends with a interesting look at how this research can inform policy and improve the juvenile justice system."

   "comments": [
    "The class was a delight and the tests could be improved by being a bit longer and more comprehensive (final was better than the midterm but multiple choice is kind of a pain especially if it's worth so much)",
    "This course is lead by an engaging and charming instructor, Professor BJ Casey, and covers a wide range of topics within the adolescent neuroscience literature, ranging from psychopathology to cognitive control, reward sensitivity and the juvenile justice system. It is comprehensive in its scope, and the assigned readings are helpful towards understanding in-class lectures. The short paper on policy was a fun assignment that forced me to think more critically about the facts we had learned in the class, and the exams were very fair, albeit too easy. The debate at the end was a nice touch, and I had fun during it - it also was a good way to force me to start reviewing for the final exam. The course, in its current form, is not sufficiently academically stimulating or difficult to meet the standards of Yale's Psychology department. I know that this is the first year that the course has been taught, so it's not surprising that some things need to be tweaked. But overall, I felt like the material we covered could have easily all been condensed into 2-3 lectures of a broader developmental neuroscience course, and did not merit the creation of an entirely separate class. There was a huge amount of redundancy in the topics that we studied, and I felt like the total number of facts\/trends that I memorized for the exam greatly paled in comparison to the other courses I have taken through the department. The exams were too easy to really force students to integrate and think deeply about the concepts learned in class. Finally, I feel like the field itself may simply not be developed enough yet to warrant the existence of this class, which is no fault of Professor Casey, whom I do believe is an excellent researcher. But there may be some way in which she can make the course more stimulating or challenging for students, perhaps by including more regular assignments (e.g. reading responses), making the paper a research paper instead of a policy critique, and\/or by making the exams longer and covering more details. I also found it a bit strange that the course was dismissed about fifteen minutes early every single time -- it suggested to me, almost, that there was simply never enough material to fill up an entire 75 minute lecture 13 or so times throughout the semester. If that really is the case, then I would recommend either merging this class with another one, broadening the scope of the course or simply including more material on the neuroscience of the findings we cover, e.g. spending more time on the exact nature of the studies that we talk about, the imaging techniques used, the points covered in the authors' discussion sections, and so on.",
    "I think we perhaps did need quite as much time as was allotted for in-class debate prep. Everything else about the course was a strength! Though I know the course had a much greater capacity than the 14 students it ended up with, I do think the small size was a strength, and allowed for amazing discussions!",
    "The big weakness in the course was that a majority of the work was concentrated in the last two weeks of the semester. I would have preferred to have the final paper and\/or the debate earlier in the semester so as to spread out the work more evenly. The strengths in this course were numerous. It was a great balance of learning neuroscience and applying knowledge to policy. It was engaging and thought-provoking, and went beyond just memorization of facts. It was well-taught, and allowed time for both lecturing and discussion during class time which was helpful for review and crucial for building up one topic on top of the last. The Adolescent Brain was a truly wonderful course. It was a lot of fun to have a small classroom (14 students), and I hope that the dynamic of the class can be as engaging, entertaining, challenging, and thought-provoking even with a larger class size in future semesters!",
    "One of the strengths was definitely the professor. She is amazing, and anyone would be lucky to have her. One of the weaknesses was the variability in prior knowledge of the students. Sometimes we got bogged down trying to explain neuro anatomy or statistics instead of working on the actual material.",
    "I very much enjoyed the course, especially the discussions that we were able to have due to the small class size. I think a major strength was the layout of the course, as the new material clearly built on the older material in a way that was very helpful. For future courses, it may be helpful to spread out the assignment due dates, as it was a bit hectic to have a debate, paper, and final in the last week or so of the semester.",
    "Strengths: Professor Casey is fantastic; very engaging lectures; fair assessments Weaknesses: At first the structure of the course was a little unclear; it was hard to see how different things fit together till later on. Also, too many large assignments clustered together at the end of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Totally. It's different than any class I've ever taken (nicely convivial\/conversational vibe) and it's cool to be learning from someone so knowledgeable about the adolescent brain.",
    "Don't take this class unless the syllabus or format has changed since Fall of 2016 in some positive and meaningful way. As it currently stands, the material you cover is very surface-level and doesn't go very far intellectually. From the syllabus, it looks like a course on Adolescent Neurobiology, which is what I thought it would be when I signed up to take it, but it turned out to be a fairly repetitive and meandering course that rehashed the same few findings about the same few brain areas over and over again and then synthesized these few points at the end when we discussed policy implications. It definitely is an easy course, I will tell you that. No regular assignments, two very short\/easy exams and one very short \"policy paper,\" plus a \"debate\" at the end that you don't really have to prepare for. Overall, the class doesn't feel like it includes enough material, as of yet, to warrant its continued existence. Professor Casey is a sweet and very friendly instructor and probably the most \"casual\" one that I've ever had, but that doesn't nearly make up for the fact that the class is just plain boring and repetitive most of the time.",
    "Definitely! Though I do believe that a strong psych background is necessary for this course (I hadn't taken the prerequisite, \"The Human Brain,\" and sometimes felt this knowledge gap during class discussion), I think the course could serve as a model for a lower level psych class that is policy-based, which could garner interest not only from psych students but also from any student interested in policy.",
    "Absolutely! BJ is amazing, brilliant, quirky in the best ways, and she cared so much that we learn not just the neuroscience but the application of neuroscience to real life policies and practices. She is a gem. Also, the course counts as a science credit and doesn't have a lot of super difficult science-based material, so it's a wonderful chance to learn from an incredible professor at the top of her field without being scared of difficult terminology. She teaches in a way that makes the concepts easy to understand.",
    "If you have any interest in adolescence or just want to take an awesome psych class, I would 100% recommend this class. It's absolutely amazing.",
    "If you are interested in the material, definitely take the course. BJ is insanely knowledgeable about the field of neuroscience research on adolescence, and she is able to connect the science to policy in a way that definitely makes you think about the gravity and importance of this research. The per-week workload is minimal, and there are only a few major assignments (a paper, a debate, and 2 exams). As a cognitive science major, I enjoyed it, and I have no doubts the class will only get better from here, since we were the first run. You will also just have a lot of fun with BJ, since she likes to make sure everyone is enjoying the class and is always ready to spice up classtime with something unexpected.",
    "This was a super fun class. I loved the debate we had at the end it was a great way to put what we've learned to work.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Casey is extremely knowledgeable about developmental neuroscience and adolescent behavior, and it seems like she is a leading researcher in these fields. She leads a very engaging and comfortable class environment, and pays attention to each student. The workload is generally light, and consists mainly of reading primary literature in the relevant fields. We also focused on public policy as it is informed by adolescent neuroscience. I'm really glad I took this class, and would recommend it to another student who is interested in neuroscience or adolescence as a field of study.",
    "Take this class! It is very interesting and not a lot of work. The reading load is very light and the assessments are fair (though they are a little end-loaded so plan ahead). Professor Casey is very engaging and it is clear that she really cares a lot about her students."
