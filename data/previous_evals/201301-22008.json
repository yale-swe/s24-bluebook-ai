    "yeah! take it! there will be vision science and not much neuro, prep yourself",

    "Flexible lecture on social perception.",
    "A pretty typical senior psych seminar - studies to read each week, some discussion and debate. There isn't really much discussion, though - more similar to a lecture with a little participation here and there, which was underwhelming for a senior seminar. Make sure you're interested in the topics, some of them can get repetitive if you're not into social psychology. Professor Scholl is very knowledgeable and a great guy, but does talk a lot during class.",
    "This course looks at the way that humans perceive social stimuli. I would definitely recommend the course - Prof. Scholl is really engaging, and the course material is very interesting. You have a bunch of weekly readings and a reading response, and then besides that just one final paper. The discussions are always really interesting."
