   "comments": [
    "Good material\/topics, tough papers and grading. I dont know if id recommend it only because of the grading. if u cred\/d it then yea take it if it sounds good to you.",
    "Take it. Credit\/D it if you're scared about the grade. This is a fantastic course that moves at a pace slow enough to foster real learning.",
    "easy way to fulfill a WR credit. grading is tough though. Always write in advance and revise multiple times.",
    "Very few pages for a writing credit, and a pretty interesting class, however work is graded very harshly.",
    "Excellent class. Recommended for writing requirement.",
    "The material in this class is very interesting - philosophical underpinnings of some of the major concepts in computer science. Gelernter is very intelligent and knows what he's talking about. I really enjoyed the discussion (you have to kind of force himto debate, otherwise he'll just steamroll and talk to himself the whole time) and I feel like I learned a lot about the topic, which is ultimately the goal of education.However, he can be a tad repetitive. And he moves at a glacial pace - you won't cover more than half the syllabus.He's also a hellacious grader, who won't tell you how to write better, besides saying \"write tersely\" (or using another one of his 500 synonyms for that phrase), or quoting you passages of Shakespeare and then telling you nobody will ever be as good as Shakespeare. I couldn't figure out the arbitrariness of his grades, and I struggled with my grade in the class. This is NOT a gut, despite the few, short assignments, and the lax amount of reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student! I know NOTHING about computers, but that doesn't matter. If you are looking for an unusual way to approach philosophy, psychology, the brain, or if you want an interesting and very enjoyable class requiring almost no work, or just a fun few hours per week to sit around and discuss poetry, computers, history, and the mind, this is a great way to go. I think it would be a welcome addition to any semester in any year \/ major of Yale.",
    "I wouldn't recommend CS150 to another student. Sure, there are very few assignments, but there's no indication of how you're supposed to write for them, and the professor is very picky in his own strange way. It ended up being very stressful and unfair."
