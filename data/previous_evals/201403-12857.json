    "Would strongly recommend. Professor Sanjabi is a highly engaging teacher, who completely brings to life the broad range of texts covered in class. There are a fair amount of readings, but nothing overwhelming especially if you are well-organized. 2 short papers, one class presentation and one oral exam, in addition to a couple of paragraph-long reading response tasks is a very very comfortable workload, so if you have solid proficiency in reading French, this class is worth your while no matter what your schedule looks like.",
    "This course is an excellent survey of French literature, starting with medieval texts and working up to 21st century works. Unlike in some survey classes, where professors just pick random texts from different time periods without any attempt to link them, in this class you actually feel the arc of France's rich literary history. We read a lot (usually a work per class or per two classes), so don't take it if you don't like to read. That said, the great thing is that if you're not crazy about an author or a text, you will be moving on from it shortly so never get bored. The only issue is that the fast pace can sometimes make coverage of a book feel too superficial, but that is to be expected. Professor Sanjabi starts each class with brief biographical and contextual information about the author\/work we are studying, and then we spend the rest of the class in discussion. Around the middle of the term, presentations start: each student talks for around fifteen minutes about a topic of their choice. These were low-stress and really fun to do because you really feel like you're bringing something new to the rest of the class (although not to Professor Sanjabi, who is a pro at basically everything). There are several short (half-page to a page) writing responses throughout the term to build ease of expression, and then two 4-5 page papers. Professor Sanjabi offers feedback on a rough draft before the final is due, so you can feel free to challenge yourself in your writing without worrying that every clause is flawless. The class culminates with an oral final, which is also low-stress and just plain fun: you realize how much you have learned and get to engage in a one-on-one conversation with an expert in her field. Take the class if you have any interest in French literature, and take it with Professor Sanjabi. It was such a pleasure and relief to just be able to talk about and enjoy the texts twice a week.",
    "Definitely recommend, if you have reading knowledge of French. Great overview, not too much workload (apart from the readings themselves) and you will learn A LOT.",
    "I would highly recommend this course as a challenging follow up to French 150. There are so many enjoyable and memorable readings! The syllabus selects from centuries of literature, including many genres and styles. Madame Sanjabi provides a lot of background knowledge and insights. The workload is fair and well spread across the semester. Overall, a pleasure!",
    "This is an introductory class on french literature. A diverse set of genres and authors are covered. I would recommend this class to another student if they are proficient in reading, speaking and writing and if they want to read more in french.",
    "I highly recommend FREN 170. Beginning with ancient French love poems and progressing to novels of modern era, the course is a comprehensive overview of the literary characteristics of the most important eras of French cultural history. The content of the class was appropriately challenging, and seminars were part informal lecture on the historical\/political context of the work and part socratic discussion of reading questions. Class was casual but substantive, encouraging students to practice and improve their oral French."
