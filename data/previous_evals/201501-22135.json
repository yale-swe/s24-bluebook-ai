   "comments": [
    "Similar in format and workload as L3. Just a bit more in depth.",
    "I found it much more rewarding than L3. Un Sac de Billes is a lot of reading especially for the end of the semester (50 pages\/day), but the rest of the course is definitely manageable.",
    "French 140 is a challenging, but very rewarding, class. You have to stay on top of reading, which can take up to a couple of hours a night. For anyone who is hoping to become more proficient in French reading and writing, I would highly recommend the class.",
    "This is a good class to take if your goal is to improve your French skills. Overall I found this to be a good course. By the end of it, my ability to speak, understand, read, and write French had all improved noticably. If your goal is to improve your French skills, and this is the appropriate level course, I would recommend it. If you're more interested in French culture or literature, this is not the course for you. The class is conducted almost entirely in French (perhaps 1 or 2 English words will be spoken per class). There is a substantial workload, but not more than would be expected for a 1.5 credit class. If you keep up with it, it should not be a problem. There also are audio excercises which in my opinion were essentially a waste of time, but I believe most students didn't do them consistently.",
    "It covers a lot of grammar that makes the difference between fluency and broken French. It is about the same amount of work as French 130, but it is interesting. I feel like I just need a little more practice to be fluent, but I am close."
