   "comments": [
    "Yes. For writers and people who don't like rules.",
    "AMAZING. Take this class if you've ever been interested in writing a play but have maybe been too intimidated by the prospect. You will laugh, you will be moved (maybe to tears), you will learn, you will end up with one great draft of a play.",
    "An excellent introduction to playwriting. I would recommend it to anybody interested in playwriting as a form of creative writing.",
    "YES! Because Deb is the best.",
    "Amazing. One critique is that I wish we could have shared writing every week. I think I shared maybe twice in class...",
    "If you're looking to write a play in a very open, free-flowing environment, take the class. If you're looking to improve your writing in a more structured, rigorous manner, this might not exactly be your cup of tea. The class is great because Deb is the wisest, warmest, and most inspiring person, but the class lacks rigor, structure, and organization. There are obviously both strengths and weaknesses to such a style, so it really depends on what you want. The class was definitely great for a kind of environment where all the students really love and support each other and talk about anything and everything in an honest, open-minded manner, but it doesn't really challenge you as a writer. I'd say that if you're looking for inspiration, exploration of yourself\/etc, the class is great, but if you're really looking for a rigorous and structured exercise of writing, the class isn't exactly that. Nonetheless, despite some weaknesses, I really enjoyed the class overall.",
    "Playwriting with Deb Margolin is a great introduction to playwriting for new writers and a great workshop space for more experienced playwrights. Deb creates a very supportive environment for her students. Deb's class is less formulaic or organized than a playwriting seminar. Since Deb's class is larger than a seminar, you have fewer opportunities to share your work in class. There are also fewer deadlines so it is up to the student to write independently every week. Deb is a wonderful and inspiring teacher and her support is invaluable as she helps her students cultivate their voices."
