    "This seminar is a good introduction to biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons from WWI to now. Readings are fairly long each week, but worth doing. The work for the semester is a brief midterm paper and a long-ish final. Overall it's well-taught and interesting, and covers a lot of ground on a very important topic. It's helpful if you have a decent background on cold war history before taking the class since general history isn't really covered--only arms development.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. There is a reason it is one of the most over-subscribed seminars at Yale...",
    "This is an important class to take if only for the material. That being said, there is a lot of material, and a lot of students don't do all of the readings, probably because there is so much of them. The midterm paper and the final paper are not onerous- especially as a history major. Graduate students definitely make up a significant portion of the class and tend to be the most active participants. Discussion section can be slightly boring, especially since it was held on a Tuesday night. It was definitely not one of the best history classes I've taken at Yale, but I took it for an IS requirement. It can be difficult toget in because it is often oversubscribed (I'm assuming due to the material). You have complete leeway on the final paper though which allows you to explore topics that are interesting to you. All in all, I'm not sure I would recommend the class to someone else unless they were using it for a requirement.",
    "Great course, truly interesting if you are interested in the subject matter. Most of the course is focused on nuclear weapons and US policy, which is not my thing, but if you like it, you will love the class. Kevles is brilliant and you'll learn a lot from him. Heavy reading, slightly difficult grading (midterm paper and course paper).",
    "I would recommend it. The material is pretty interesting and the papers are not too bad. Lot of reading though.",
    "This was a pretty sweet class. We covered the development, use, and containment of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Unfortunately there were too many people since it is cross listed as a graduate course in three different fields. Professor Kevles is great, and he really know his stuff."
