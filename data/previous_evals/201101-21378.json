    "This is one of the best classes I have ever taken. The material is interesting and broad enough to allow people from different backgrounds and interests to get something out of this course. Professor Eyerman is a wonderful instructor and is very approachable. Take it.",

    "Directly applied to my research but also opened new perspectives. First exposure to sociology and social theory. Trauma theory applied to literature particularly interesting. Thought-provoking beyond academic fields too--definite connections to current events, popular media responses, etc",
    "Great introduction to trauma and history writing.",
    "I touch the core issue of trauma study, 'Culture Trauma' would become an important research perspective in my further studies.Thanks, indeed."
