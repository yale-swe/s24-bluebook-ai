    "Looking for a cool, young professor who will make you laugh and think at thesame time? Looking to talk about Tyler Perry and listen to pop songs before class? Looking to see what black pop culture is all about? Or if you're like me...have no idea about black people and want to learn something? (I'm premed and do not belong in this class lol) Take this class! Great lecture course with 2 papers and a take-home midterm that will introduce you to modern black literature. It's nice to not read books by dead white guys. Read some by alive, black dudes, instead. They're better.",
    "The course is a quick survey of African American popular culture, concentrating mostly on novels and films. Texts vary from super funny to gravely serious. Discussion explores themes of race identity, sexism, queer theory, family ties, etc.I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "Laid back class atmosphere, just don't expect to feel like you learned a ton at the end.",
    "You'll learn about African-American literature and popular culture (blaxploitation films, the origins of hip hop, etc.). Readings are interesting, workload is manageable. You don't have to have knowledge of the subject, but be able to analyze issues of race\/gender\/sexuality.",
    "Amazing class. Great lectures, fantastic readings. If you have never taken an African-American studies or Literature class and have always wanted to ... TAKE THIS ONE!",
    "Very chill class with minimal work. Section head probably makes a huge difference, but Af Am grad students are cool so you're probably in luck. Three assignments other than section assignments for the whole semester. Take home midterm was challenging but do-able. This is the kind of course where you really get out of it as much as you put in.",
    "English296 is a wonderful class!! It's not to much work and that is what makes it so great. Without the pressure to have to memorize everything and the fact that you have the freedom to have your own opinion and it not be wrong is what makes the class great. And you learn so much in the process!! Definitely take this class!!",
    "Take this class!",
    "Yes. It's not too much work but you learn a lot. Especially if, like me, you don't know that much about the subject beforehand.",
    "I would recommend it. I learned a lot and had fun doing it.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 296 to another student if they're looking for a laid-back 5th credit.",
    "Great class! Highly recommend it. Jalylah was an AMAZING section leader.",
    "yes! take it! very enlightening and well taught course.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 296. It hits a lot of interesting topics and covers books that are must-reads.",
    "A great intro to afam lit in the post-civil rights era. If you're interested, take it.",
    "It is a basic overview of African-American film, literature, music, and art (with a focus on the literature) that cover much of the 20th century and a little of the 21st century. If you have taken many courses on Af-Am lit, it might be too basic.",
    "Take it!! Highly recommend this class. Not a lot of work, fantastic books, and a solid professor. This class is the trifecta"
