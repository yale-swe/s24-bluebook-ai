    "How to do research in a lab.",
    "Lab research for credit focused my project and helped push progress in my research. The research proposal, report, and presentation were excellent practice.",
    "This course obviously gave me the opportunity to conduct research, which I plan on doing in the future. Beyond just learning and applying research methods, I also gained significant practice in presenting and writing up my results, which are undoubtedly valuable skills.",
    "Enhanced and improved my research skills",
    "This course helped me develop lab and research skills that I need for my future educational and career goals, so I appreciated the knowledge that I gained from this course.",
    "I gained a lot of technical lab skills, knowledge about gene regulation systems, oncogenes, as well as critical reasoning skills. I learned a lot about how to interpret data, cell culture, how to present scientific data to people in a well-organized manner."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was clear guidelines on how to write a report, and what the expectations and requirements. Research for credit is highly dependent on the lab that you are in, and how much time you want to put in.",
    "The documents describing the organization and due dates were for the most part sufficient and thorough, although the date changes that were made near the end of the semester were a little disorganized (though, the presentation was pushed back a week, which was helpful for all students).",
    "This class really deserves to be worth more than 1 credit. Foreign language classes meet for 50 minutes x 5 days a week for a total of 4 hours and 10 minutes, and they're worth 1.5 credits. This class is over 2x the time commitment and is awarded less credit. I definitely spent more hours per week in lab than in any of my other classes by a substantial margin.",
    "I imagine that the students experience of this course varies greatly based on a number of factors. The overall course is a good system for allowing students to gain research experience, but it is hard to evaluate any of its objective strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: gives flexibility for performing research, gives practice in writing research proposals and original papers and delivering research talks Weakness: hard to complete a proposed project end-to-end at the end of a semester",
    "Logistics are well executed, it's great to work in a lab! My mentor gave me great feedback, but don't expect any feedback from the course director. It might be nice to have meetings with Prof Garen or someone else in which we talk about how to interact with our mentor\/advisor, how to get the most out of our experience in lab, and generally talk about being a research scientist as a career.",
    "There are no observed weaknesses of this course, as I came into lab every day and performed experiments under my assigned research associate.",
    "I think the strength of this course is its flexibility and how it just allows the student to choose something she finds interesting and learn about it rather than having a set curriculum. I think in the future, more guidance on how to write a scientific paper\/report well would be helpful for the final report. Feedback on the report\/proposal\/presentation would be nice.x"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Take this if you are doing research! There isn't a lot of extra work, and it's a good way to get credit for what you have been doing in lab.",
    "Research for credit is a great way to dive into your research project and write a few key documents (research proposal and research report), as well as present to your lab, that will likely form the basis for your next experiments and future work for your research projects.",
    "Research for credit is very rewarding, but DO NOT take it with a heavy class schedule. When they say this class requires 10 hours per week, they mean it. The general consensus seems to be that you'll always end up being in lab for more than the minimum hour requirements as well. Save this class for a lighter semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in conducting research anyway. The additional requirements that this course demands (such as the report at the end of the semester) are not especially burdensome. So, if you are already interested in doing research, you might as well receive credit for it.",
    "Yes - if you plan on doing research anyways get the class credit and grade for it.",
    "If you find a good mentor and an interesting project, yes!",
    "Yes, if you are a student in STEM who wants to perform research, this course is essential in gaining the experience and skills necessary for such work.",
    "Yes. It's a great way to just learn about something you find interesting. It's also great for flexibility in scheduling. Just make sure you find a really good mentor\/lab, or else I'm sure this class could be a bore. The amount you get out of the class is proportional to what you put in. It's also a super great way to finally see the things that you learned in 300 and 301 come to life."
