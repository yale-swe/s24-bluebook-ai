    "All the readings were SO interesting! Final paper was not difficult and pretty fun to write!",
    "Perfect balance of workload that is clearly the result of years spent refining the syllabus. Not a page or a moment of class discussion wasted.",
    "The class did not require much of us in work outside of class. The work that was required was reading. Sometimes it did feel that the reading was superfluous. Not often and not most of the time, but sometimes. By it being superfluous, I mean that we didn't always talk about the reading and so it felt that it was busywork. If we could thoroughly discuss all the cases and articles we read, or at least mention them in class in passing or as a note, that would change things.",
    "The readings never seemed too overwhelming",
    "The workload was pretty heavy during the first half of the semester and could be overwhelming, but once we got the hang of how to best read and evaluate the case studies the work load became more manageable.",
    "At times the reading was a lot to get done for each week, but overall I thought the workload was very fair.",
    "There was a lot of reading but it was all very interesting and supportive of each class lesson."

    "Very organized",
    "Class felt extremely structured, materials easy to use. Professor Channick struck a great balance between lecture and discussion.",
    "Everything was clear, easy to follow, logical, and tied back readily to the course. Towards the end of the semester, it did feel like the class became more of a lecture rather than a discussion. But that goes back to the basics of the class-if the class is indeed a lecture or a discussion. Usually it felt like a nice mixture of both.",
    "I enjoyed the set up of the class. It helped me greatly understand the subject matter and allowed me to join in in the discussion.",
    "Overall the organization of the class was very good. They syllabus and website were very easy to follow and reference. They power points in class were also simple and informative but could have had more information regarding terms and facts that we could relate to the case studies.",
    "I really enjoyed the logical profession of the course and how seamlessly Joan layer out the topics of copyright law and it's subsequent topics which made for such an ease of understanding concepts as well how they effect each other."

    "A+ for Professor Channick!",
    "It may be that we covered the commission contract in Managing the Production Process, but I found that class difficult to engage in. I really enjoyed the classes with examples, allowing for a lively discussion.",
    "Professor Channick is an all-star. She is a fabulous lecturer, a great listener, a thoughtful and firm moderator of class discussion, a fair grader, and on top of it all, extremely generous with her time outside the classroom and consistently receptive to student questions and concerns. Professor Channick also brilliantly manages the classroom dynamic, preventing the grad-undergrad divide which pervades so many seminars of this kind. I would highly recommend any class with her.",
    "It was very clear, with the Powerpoints and availability of the reading materials, that the class was well-prepared and taken care of. It felt that sometimes questions or answers to questions were brushed off and sometimes I got the feeling that a question was asked with only one right answer. That actually discouraged me from speaking in class. But this wasn't often.",
    "Clearly knew the subject very well. Was able to break down the complicated subject matter so it was accessible to those who were not familiar with law.",
    "Great! I always felt very comfortable in class and it was easy to have discussions with Joan and ask questions.",
    "Joan's expertise in the course and personal and professional work experience made the class all the more relatable and understandable."

    "Wow. I learned a good amount of useful information from this course. There was no way to take it all in, but its given me a nice foundation for my future career and a good sense of how to address concerns that may come out of copyright.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount in this class. Clearly articulated course organization and goals coupled with a dynamic professor and lively class discussion all contributed meaningfully.",
    "I definitely feel like I have a better handle on the basics of law and the arts, particularly copy rights. After all, how much can one really expect to learn and master in one semester? So for the limited time we had, we covered a lot and, I think especially because of the cases and articles we read, we were able to apply them to our world as artists and collaborators and people subject to laws and common sense.",
    "I gained a lot of insight to the law and how it affects my work in the theater.",
    "I gained a good beginner course learning to the material. The class gave me a basic understanding to certain laws that I know reference in my career.",
    "The contracts aspect of the course made a major impact on me and has taught me just how important it is to not only read your contracts carefully, but to understand what it means and how to ask the right questions when drafting a contract.",
    "I'm grateful for the lessons learned in this class. I had not thought about several of the topics covered in the course and I'm aware now of how beneficial the lessons will be in my future."

   "comments": [
    "My suggestions are incredibly minor, as my experience of the class was overwhelmingly positive. I do have two ideas that I think could really improve the class. First, a single consolidated PDF for each class's readings would have been really helpful. Second, I wish that Professor Channick published her own set of notes for each class, including references to related statute and cases. This would have made studying for midterms and finals much easier, as the PowerPoint files were pretty bare-bones. But these certainly did not detract from my enjoyment or learning in the class much at all.",
    "Tying the readings back further into our class. All of the readings, if possible.",
    "I would've like to have a guest speaker from say Actor's Equity to talk in depth about things like actor contracts or a producer to come in discuss playwright royalties and how they're distributed for a different view point on the topic."
