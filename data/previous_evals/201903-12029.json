    "I developed a strong understanding of questions of collecting, knowledge production, and information dissemination in the early modern period. I also became more familiar with some of Yale's collections and was able to think about how to analyze different kinds of texts and their visual components in concert. The course also very usefully taught skills related to writing and presenting that will doubtless be invaluable."

   "comments": [
    "Pro: intellectually stimulating readings, object-based discussions, close access to primary source materials Cons: the readings did not always help the discussions.",
    "The great strength of the course was the immediacy of the materialsthat we got to spend lots of time in libraries and museums with objects directly. I appreciated the format that allowed for a focus on developing our research papers and critiquing each other's work.",
    "The structure of Prof. Bass' course was, overall, extremely engaging. I enjoyed that our class discussions were grounded in a small, yet diverse array of objects which not only rendered the ideas presented in the assigned readings more tangible, but also challenged my peers and I to exercise our capacity to look closely. This said, in observing such a vast variety of objects, I often found myself losing track of the thread meant to unify our many conversations. In her weekly emails, Prof. Bass did a wonderful job of explaining why she had selected each of the texts assigned to us and how they brought to light certain themes that were prevalent in previous meetings. Such broad comparisons - between objects, as well as, texts - would have made our conversations in class even more compelling."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, the course provided a whole new way of looking at objects in the early modern period",
    "I would certainly recommend the course. The material was very engaging, but most of all, the professor's emphasis on the development of writerly and academic skills was productive and useful.",
    "Though I'm not sure if another version of History & Its Images will be offered in the future, I would strongly encourage any student to take a course with Prof. Bass. She is an incredible teacher, who thinks deeply about pedagogy and makes literally any topic or object intriguing."
