    "I enjoyed the student-led classes and, of course, the field trip.",
    "The field trip was invaluable.",
    "The field trip to St. Thomas was really incredible. Having it during spring break was perfect, because we had time to learn about it before going, and also time to discuss everything that we had learned while down there. I also liked the breadth of topics that we covered. I think that I have a holistic understanding of coastal development on the US Virgin Islands coming out of this class.",
    "Learning about material in class and then actually going to the Caribbean was great. We all learn differently and I think the trip did an excellent job of catering to that diversity. Also, the small class size (though I think it would be just fine at 10 or 12 students) was great for a close, congenial learning environment.Great to have the guest speakers come in. Jeremy Jackson was awesome, and the eel grass woman was great too. I would say the sewage plant lecture was probably one of the worst lectures I've seen ever...could we skip that one next year?The papers we read were just the right quantity of reading and were well chosen.I liked how we got to choose the topic of our final paper. While it was really hard to start anything before you actually went to the caribbean, I liked the flexibility we were given.MaryBeth is awesome."

   "comments": [
    "I think a few more days in the Caribbean and better planned stakeholder interviews on site could really make the experience that much more educational and insightful on the issues discussed in class.",
    "I might have liked to see a couple more guest speakers during the semester as opposed to mainly having student presentations.",
    "1) The fact that we didn't have class the last 3 week of school and were \"supposed\" to focus on our projects was pretty disappointing. I'm not at FES (and paying for classes) to have my professor decide not to teach for 3 weeks. In addition, I think Gabe and MaryBeth taught perhaps 2 classes of the semester and the rest were student run (or didn't happen as mentioned above). While I appreciate having student-led discussion, it seemed inconsistent with FES's mission.2) This class needs a TA or another professor who can help Gabe stay organized. From emails to the class to planning on the trip to the USVI, better organization is desperately needed. Some students missed certain activities because one car was needed to go grocery shopping and there wasn't a TA who could take care of such activities. On one particularly bad day, we didn't leave the house on time and were running late to events all day and didn't get dinner until 9pm. A TA\/other prof who can step back and consider students' energy levels and interest would be really helpful. And then Gabe could focus on the trip and the activities instead of logistics.3) This class has SO MUCH potential to engage in the social science aspects of coastal development. Focusing on nutrient cycling or coral reef health without thinking deeper about the social and cultural drivers behind environmental degradation is missing half of the picture, I think. We kind of touched on these issues but I'd like to see a humanities\/social science professor in the Caribbean studies group at Yale (yes, they exist!) be the co-professor for this class. At least have them come talk in class at FES?4) This was an incredibly popular class. Would be good to allow more students into the class. Also, the gender ratio was totally weird. One guy and 7 women? At least 1\/3 of the students applying to get into the class were men and while I recognize that qualifications should be considered above gender ratios most of the time, this class could be more diverse.5) Would be great to see improvement in Gabe's teaching skills- is there a faculty mentoring program? He just didn't seem to be very excited about the teaching side of this class, just getting his research and data collection done."

    "Yes; I wish I could have done more work on the ground. Once we were in St. Thomas it was clear that all the interviews the instructor arranged led to even more questions and knowledge; some of the stakeholders offered special opportunities after the fact (i.e., go out fishing) but there wasn't enough time to take advantage of these opportunities. Otherwise, this course covered all relevant literature for me and then some; it was great to learn from the other students as well.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I learned so much from this course. The field trip was especially helpful--I learned even more than I was expecting to (and I expected to learn a lot) about how environmental management works in locations that are so dependent on tourism.",
    "I definitely got a lot out of this class, despite the improvements that could be made as mentioned earlier. I can't say enough about the value of field trip classes at FES."

Planning ambitious data analysis\/research projects is setting yourself up for major stress during finals. Keep the scope of your project to something you can research online or ask some questions of people when you're on St. Thomas."
