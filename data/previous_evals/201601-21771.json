   "comments": [
    "The course is very formulaic, but our prof let us talk about things that interested us, including the diversity conversations at Yale. This was much more interesting than memorizing lines from Jules et Jim, but I understand why we have to do the films\/books more systematically. Sometimes the course feels more focused on the stories we're reading\/watching than French, and the fact that the exams require us to remember lines said by\/about characters seems silly and kind of impractical...but at least most of them are interesting.",
    "French 130 provides a forum to rigorously practice the language on a daily basis. The books selection, audio tapes, and worksheets, in addition to class discussions, all work to expand the students' understandings French language. My competency in French definitely improved over the course of the semester, and I would encourage any student to take this course who is I interested in improving his or her French speaking, writing, and comprehension skills.",
    "This is L3. If you need to take it, take it. It will cover basic grammar so if you're worried about forgetting some verb forms, take this level."
