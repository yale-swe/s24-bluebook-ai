   "comments": [
    "This class isn't easy by any means, but it's a good science credit with not too much math and cool cultural connections to astronomy. It's a really interesting class and not too difficult, though the grading of problem sets is sometimes a bit harsh.",
    "I definitely would recommend this as an easy science credit, not much work and the exams were reasonable.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are interested in astronomy or archaeology because it is truly fascinating to see how the two are related. However, if you have no interest in either, you will probably be in for a long semester.",
    "Interesting course but not necessarily worth your time. A good way to get a science credit but more enjoyable taken credit\/d.",
    "This has been my favorite class to date. The first chunk is basic astronomy, from the movements of the sun, moon, stars, and planets to constellations, phases of the moon, and measurements. Next, the course covers some of the historical development of astronomy, as well as its interactions in culture (think Stonehenge, Mayan temples, etc). It's a cool blend of scientific astronomy with some humanities-lean. I learned so much interesting archaeoastronomy stuff, as well as a ton of connections to other stuff in today's world. Also, the final paper was really fun--you can write about pretty much anything you're interested if it's in some way connected to astronomy and culture."
