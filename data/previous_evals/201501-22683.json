   "comments": [
    "Yes; gives you the freedom to pursue your interests and figure out how to do research on your own.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you're a psychology major, I'd recommend this course even if you don't plan on writing a senior thesis. You learn a lot of new skills that you wouldn't learn in other classes at Yale.",
    "Definitely! Research is so valuable to learning about how psychological research is actually produced, and being a part of the innovative labs here is such a unique experience for Yale students. I definitely think all majors should consider participating in research wherever possible.",
    "Yes!! Definitely. This class is probably the most fun\/rewarding way to get credit.",
    "A great opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of a faculty member. Depending on your advisor, this may involve some initiative on your part. Be proactive, and you'll get the most out of it.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in learning how to do research. It is a wonderful opportunity to learn how to think on your own and learn under the best.",
    "It's definitely worth doing research if you are considering a major in psychology.",
    "Yes. This course is beneficial to other psychology majors.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 493 to psychology majors who are seeking to do research or, more broadly, any students who are interested in learning about how research is conducted at Yale. It is a wonderful way for students to participate in psychology research at the labs on campus, connect with professors and lab managers, and meet fellow research assistants who share their interests.",
    "Yes, do research!",
    "If you are working in a lab and are willing tot dedicate a lot of time, this will be a highlight of Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would caution you not to get your hopes too high. Yes it's fun playing with dogs, showing them different toys and treats and getting to pet them. Yes you'll be able to design your own projects. But there is a lot of unused and\/or wasted time in the lab. Much of the work is cleaning up, talking with the owners, and dealing with logistics. Very little time is actually spent conducting research on the dogs. I'm saying this not to discourage you from joining this lab, but to give you a more accurate sense of what you're getting into. I have definitely had a very positive experience in this lab, and will be staying on to work on my own, independent project (which may turn into a senior thesis!!!). I just want to let you know: it's not as rosy as you may think it will be.",
    "good for fulfilling senior requirement",
    "Take this credit! You'll learn so much and its so much fun!",
    "You pick a PI (pick wisely, ask professors for recommendations, don't choose based on their research alone), then you work in their lab and write a paper at the end."
