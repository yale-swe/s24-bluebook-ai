    "I developed a deeper understanding of the importance and meaning of children's literature.",
    "I developed the ability to re-engage with the texts of my childhood in a comprehensive and enlightened way, reading for the elements that make children's literature so informative and essential across various perspectives-- and even from the viewpoint from different times throughout my life! I appreciated the knowledge I have further developed regarding concepts of world-building, as both fantasy and non-fantasy authors work to construct a space in which the truths underlying childhood might manifest and develop throughout the story.",
    "Definitely read more kids books, and had some practice reading \"simple\" books with a critical eye. Saw literary\/cultural movements reflected in the books, e.g. postmodernism in A Series of Unfortunate Events. Also learned a lot about the \"Trickster\" motif from the nonfiction book that we read over the semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course draws on an interesting range of works. Some works were not actually children's literature. Other works were parts of larger series, so reading one book did not allow for a full appreciation of the content.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the creative component, which is so often missing from writing courses. Both the literature and the assignments provide an opportunity to regress to childhood -- in an intellectual way, of course -- for a few hours a week.",
    "The selection of texts was amazing-- I loved every part of the syllabus and the way the texts were clustered to create themed weeks of reading. The books throughout the semester maintained a wonderful dialogue, and Professor Stepto led the seminar in such a way so as to keep this dialogue current and relevant in our weekly discussions.",
    "Better facilitated conversations and less reading so we can focus more extensively, also more interactive group activities.",
    "Strengths -- the reading list is awesome. Prof. Stepto is great; she clearly has a crazy depth of knowledge that she loves to share. On weeks that we had some direction on what lens to read through, we had great discussions. The flexibility of the projects was great, too -- I got to\/had to flex both my critical and creative writing muscles, which was a cool experience. It was nice that anyone who wanted to enroll could. Weaknesses -- it didn't seem like the class had a \"thesis.\" Discussion sometimes felt aimless, and dominated by a few people (who didn't necessarily have anything good to say, either). Or it was sluggish, with not much participation. I think this led to a feeling that one didn't need to do the reading, so fewer and fewer people showed up prepared, which made discussion more sluggish, etc. etc. While it was cool that there wasn't any competition to get into the class, I think it left the class too big (18)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "A pleasant class. As an English major, the discussions weren't as critical as I would have hoped. At times, discussions felt circuitous\/like a book club.",
    "Absolutely. It's a lot of fun and the reading material is enjoyable and nostalgic.",
    "Yes",
    "I can't recommend this class highly enough! If you have any desire to hearken back to the books you loved reading as a child in a new intellectual capacity, this is the perfect course. The readings are lovely, and the assignments are fun and also encourage you to engage with these familiar texts in new ways. Class discussions are interesting, and the themes are well-developed throughout the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to English majors and non-majors. It's a great opportunity to revisit old favorites, find some new ones, and take a critical approach to important works that are often overlooked. The workload is very manageable, and the creative assignments are a lot of fun.",
    "I would enroll, I think, if you find that having structure is helpful to you in completing projects. However, I don't think I got that much from discussion\/classtime -- the best part of the class was the reading list, going to office hours, and doing the creative projects. If you think you'll read these things and do the creative projects on your own, don't sign up. But this class provides good structure, and good guidance (if you take advantage of the opportunity to talk with the professor!). Also, this was a WAAAAY not intense writing credit. I did spend quite a bit of time writing the final project (could be critical or creative; I chose creative, as did most of the class), but it was very enjoyable, and the two shorter pieces (one critical, one creative) weren't super time intensive, and were also very fun to write (how many times do you get to write a paper on magic in Harry Potter?!)."
