    "A thought-provoking class that informs you on many issues. You don't leave the class with answers but with a wider knowledge foundation and basis to tackle and grapple with environmental issues. I think necessary to understand environmental issues from the nuanced perspective that this course provides.",
    "Students interested in conservation politics, environmental issues and politics as such should take this class!",
    "This course is very much discussion-based, so if you're not stimulated by your classmates from the get-go, it's probably not such a good bet. Nevertheless, the readings and ways of thinking are fascinating and make you question many assumptions that people \"trying to change the world\" make. Great material. Very knowledgeable professor - just make sure she talks!",
    "Honestly I wish I could take this class again on more subjects around the world. It was just soooooo interesting! I really loved it. Take it for yourself, you won't regret!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. I don't think you can really major in Environmental Studies without it."
