    "I would say you should take it only if you have a reason to. So, it's not the type of class you want to take \"just for fun\", or as a fifth credit. The reading load is insane, and the final paper is worth 50%, but it is doable if you try hard to keep up. It's interesting and useful, if you're planning on using the course for your senior essay\/major concentration, but if you're looking for a \"just because\" class, this is not it.",
    "Take this course! It's probably one of the best courses, if not the best, that I have taken at Yale. The professor is one-of-a-kind and the topic, while depressing, really opens your eyes.",
    "If you can get into the class, TAKE IT! Never miss an opportunity to take a course with Prof. Wood, she is one of the best in the university and in the department.",
    "This is a fantastic course. It's a tough subject, so you have to be willing to face very explicit material, but it is extremely informative not only for the information, but also for ways of studying this subject. I really learned a lot about how to form a research method, which I hadn't done much of in other classes. Be ready to be on your toes for the whole class, but it's worth the work."
