   "comments": [
    "Professor Jewiss is amazing! She knows everything about Rome. Her passion for the topic makes you want to come to class everyday. That being said, it is a lot of work. There are massive amounts of reading in the beginning, but they do get better towards the end of the semester. Take Jewiss's class if you have the time and the work ethic--it's an experience!",
    "Really interesting class and gives you a great background in the DS style classics without the DS stress\/death. Especially if you are going on the Rome program it is SO worth it. Just have to figure out what readings have to get done and what doesn't. Jewiss is a fair grader and just make sure to be paying attention in class because the material flies by.",
    "I personally loved this class because I've never gotten to read some of these texts before (e.g. Livy, Polybius, Tacitus, Gibbon), and Jewiss is very knowledgeable and passionate about the material so class is always helpful and engaging. There's a lot of reading, but it's all in books that you really need to read before you graduate. Also, yes the class is more fragmented in the second half, but it stays interesting and there's also no way around this structure because Roman history itself becomes fragmented after the Middle Ages.",
    "Fantastic course tracing Roman history from Romulus in 753BC to Mussolini. Reads only primary texts -- Aeneid, Divine Comedy, Julius Caesar, Annals of Imperial Rome, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, etc. Reading heavy in the first half of the semester, lets up after Spring Break.Professor Jewiss is very high energy and engaging. She teaches the course as a blend of lecture and seminar style, which I found to be a nice balance. Reading is expected and necessary; the course won't be any fun without it. Summer program designed to complement the course, but not everyone goes (I am not going, and I still loved taking it).If you love Rome, love history, or literature, or just want an excuse to study the Eternal City, take this course. Covers lots of Church History as well. Nice intro to Humanities for those less acquainted with the area. Coursework quite light -- one short paper, a midterm, and a final. The bulk of your time is spent reading. She takes participation into account on grading.",
    "Absolutely! Take it if you're remotely interested but be prepared to be challenged.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants to learn a little about a whole lot of Roman history\/architecture. No former knowledge required, although it seemed to help. A lot of reading should be expected. Not a lot of work but a whole lot of reading. Reading is interesting though and never felt uninteresting.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone, especially science majors who won't get to experience as much of Western Civ literature as humanities students because the course does a great job condensing it so one can appreciate it. Don't take this class if you can't do the summer part however; the class has a natural culmination in visiting the city that would make it less fulfilling not to go.",
    "YES! Great class. Really interesting... even if you don't have much of an interest in Rome to start off with, this class will really change your view."
