    "This is a great way to get even more out of the Yale experience by doing directed work with a faculty member.",
    "Highly recommended opportunity to study closely with a member of the faculty.",
    "This is a great class and I highly recommend it to everyone-- but it was an independent study! A continuation of Professor Lalli's intermediate ear-training and musicianship class (essentially what this study was) should be offered to students. There seems to be a lot of room for improvement in the musicianship classes offered: there is so much to learn and develop between the intermediate class offered and Professor Friedmann's ear-training class. I'm very happy I had the opportunity to do this with Professor Lalli and improve and build upon the skills I developed in earlier classes (something that should be offered to all the students!)."
