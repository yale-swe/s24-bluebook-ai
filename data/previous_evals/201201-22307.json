   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it, but I am nervous about my grade. This class requires minimal work, but that does not guarantee a good grade. It only meets once a week, and you only present every two or three weeks. It is a very chill, laid-back class, but that does not mean you will gain much out of it. Pick a topic that really really interests you, and the presentation and paper will be much easier to do. If you do not like speaking out in seminars or section, this class may not be a good fit. Also, you probably will only learn about your own topic and nothing else. It is all self-research.",
    "This class was actually ridiculous: there was no mandatory reading or homework and just one essay due at the end of the semester. A classmate of mine called it \"the golden gut,\" but it was -- for me -- a fantastic opportunity to take time and research a topic about which I feel passionately. You get out of this class what you put into it. And although it was a RELIEF in that it fulfilled a science requirement, it was also really rewarding for me. I would recommend this class to another student with one serious caveat: YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE GRADE IS. YOU ARE 100 PERCENT AT THE MERCY OF THE PROFESSOR. But if you're like me and desperately need a science credit, it's well worth it.",
    "This is the best science credit for non-science majors at Yale. Meets only once a week, not too much work (one 15 page research paper), and you can research a topic that interests you an actually learn something. Enjoyable and educational.",
    "Definitely take this course, especially if you are looking for an SC.",
    "Take this class! Although I'm concerned because I just don't know what kind of grader Professor Summers is, and the entire grade is one paper. But it's only one paper and attendance at weekly class.",
    "Once a week, we meet together with Bill in a seminar room. We take turns presenting our research projects and ask each other questions. Grade is participation (minor) and a 2500-4000 word paper on your research due at the end of reading period (major).",
    "I highly recommend this course for those in need of an easy science credit. The final paper is sort of hard but doable.",
    "This is a good science credit if you want something very easy, but don't be fooled by the choose your own topic thing. you will feel like you are wasting your time for 2 hours every week in seminar and then you will be annoyed when you have to write a 12 page paper.",
    "Seminar in which you research and write about a topic of your choosing."
