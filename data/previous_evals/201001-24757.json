    "It's a mandatory class for the HSHM major, but if it's not bad at all. I would definitely do it again. If you put in the work in the fall and follow all the deadlines, it will definitely pay off in the spring.",
    "I would recommend the senior essay to any student who wants to go into research, or on to graduate school after college. It was a very rewarding experience; and I derived an extreme sense of accomplishment from completing the essay. However, not all students would wish to or want to put in the amount of work required to turn in an adequate piece of scholarship."
