   "comments": [
    "I really became a better writer. Maggie helped me understand what good, academic writing should sound like. Moreover, the content of the class was very exciting and interesting. We applied our readings to current events and also read contemporary essays about current events. It was exactly what I wanted to take.",
    "My writing definitely became much better by taking this course. I think the best skill I learned was really learning to be better about criticizing my own work and reading my own papers more analytically. I would also say I learned a lot more about structure, and we actually got lots of helpful handouts about how to craft good introductions, body paragraphs, etc.",
    "I learned about gossip, scandal, and celebrity and the social implications of these driving forces in the media and pop culture. I learned that celebrity culture is superficial but also has deep implications in the way modern society functions.",
    "I learned how to write more analytically in a way I had not been taught to before. This course helped me through my struggle with organizing and repeating thoughts.",
    "To think critically about the points I'm trying to articulate so that the writing is more concise and clear. Also looking at pop culture through an academic lens was interesting and helpful",
    "In addition to learning about celebrity culture in America, I learned different styles of writing. Many of the papers we wrote throughout the course were written in styles I had not explored before. By writing in different styles my writing improved.",
    "I learned how to use the library facilities, the importance of diction and the way to develop an argument.",
    "I learned a lot of analysis and writing skills, as well as a lot about the culture of celebrity in modern society.",
    "I developed a sociological eye for the celebrity realm that I did not have previously, and I learned a lot about celebrities' personal lives, which I previously could not have cared less about, but were actually quite interesting!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength is the teacher. She's so engaging and ready to talk, which helped me feel more comfortable sharing ideas. Another strength is the class size. If it had been a bigger class, we couldn't have had such intimate conversations.",
    "The strengths were definitely the teacher, the readings, and the assignments. I feel like the lessons and messages we learned in class were applied very directly and clearly to the papers we were to write. The small class size also helped in making discussion more insightful, and the peer-editing and workshopping was also good. One small weakness I would maybe say is having papers due at 2:30 pm. That just kind of threw me off as far as managing my time.",
    "The strength of this class is most definitely the seminar conversations held in class. They are free-flowing and allow students to incorporate knowledge about celebrity culture, knowledge from readings, and opinions\/ notions to make important discoveries and incitedul conclusions about celebrity. The readings are fun and interesting. The weakness of the class is some exercises and worksheets seemed too elementary.",
    "I think that this course could improve by not being so heavily concentrated on the more academic readings in the beginning of the term and the more current and fun articles toward the end. I think a balance would be better. This course is very interesting because of both the subject matter and the class discussions. I really enjoyed the time we had in the classroom and I think that was the strongest part of the class.",
    "The readings by Gamson, Boorstein and Gluckman were among the best and were excellent tools in essay writing.",
    "My strengths came through in my papers. I did best when it came to writing papers because I could write on my own time and had many chances to revise my work along the way. In class, however, I could have contributed much more readily than I did. My contributions became more frequent at the end of the semester, but especially at the beginning I should have been more active in the class.",
    "The weakness of the course is the subjectivity in grading. I felt that our teach was less lenient in grading. That may be helpful in the future but it was hard to see other English section students receive higher grades for similar level work.",
    "I really like the structure of the course, and how it really incorporates the topic of the section into the general framework of building writing skills.",
    "There were some nights where we had a very small amount of reading, and other nights when we were assigned immense amounts of reading. Spreading it out just a little bit more, or trying to stick to readings that aren't ridiculously long would aid the students' understanding, their ability to complete the homework, and thus their ability to participate in class discussions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. That student must be interested in the subject topic, however.",
    "Yes! Take section 5. Other sections of ENG114 are sometimes horrible, but if you have Maggie Deli you are lucky. She is great and a reasonable grader and is genuinely concerned with your growth as a writer. I wrote three papers about Kanye West and the Kardashians and I did just fine.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. The class was fun, exciting, and filled with opportunities to learn about cleberity culture.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the subject is really interesting and writing papers on an interesting topic always makes it better.",
    "Yes most definitely. The topic is interesting and essay writing is that much better because of our content",
    "I would recommend this class to another because it helped my writing improve. That was the most useful aspect of this class for me.",
    "Yes because I believe it develops critical writing skills.",
    "I would recommend this course, because I think it is highly interesting and engaging.",
    "Y.E.S. It was such a fun and interesting course to take--it almost took the shape of a sociology course at times, which was fascinating! And then getting to write about that was enjoyable."
