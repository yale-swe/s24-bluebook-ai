    "Professor Mitchell is delightful, and you'll surprise yourself with how much you learn about the 18th century. The lectures alternate between chronological and thematic organization, social and political history, and are peppered with anecdotes and opinons about Britain history and modern life. Take it!",
    "British Politics and Society is a comprehensive look at the eighteenth century (and a little before and a little after). The course cycles through a number of different views of the time period to create a thorough understanding of what was going on from 1688 to 1832. Professor Leslie Mitchell was a dryly humorous presence who essentially lectured each class and supplemented the straight historical facts with interesting (yet relevant) anecdotes.",
    "British Politics and Society is an excellent introduction to British social history in the 18th century. Professor Mitchell is a wonderful lecturer who manages to keep you interested, entertained (and occasionally shocked) for the full two hours. Even if you never thought you would be interested in 18th century Britain, the course's focus on subjects as diverse as marriage, rioting, and parliamentary reform means it appeals to a wide range of students.",
    "Exactly what the title says.",
    "This was a very solid introduction to 18th century, and by association, modern day British history and culture. I felt that as American students the level of our education and our intelligence were at times written off by Professor Leslie Mitchell, but all in all he was a very knowledgeable and entertaining lecturer. The semester in London was definitely enriched by the information from the class.",
    "Take it if you love history or if you have never thought about taking a history class before. I have never had any interest in history because I thought it was just learning a series of facts and not doing any thinking. Professor Mitchell proved me wrong by consistently providing incredibly engaging lectures in which each random fact was used as evident in an overarching argument, which we would first prove and then endeavour to disprove. Most lectures take the format of the professor first presenting a thesis and providing evidence to back it up and then, for the second half of class, using different evidence to prove the opposite. Thus, the class is not about memorizing a series of chronological facts - it is clearly about using these facts as evidence for larger, more interesting claims. He also presents things in very logical ways that make the lectures easy and interesting to follow and remember even with no background information. The professor also focusses on a large enough range of aspects of history (marriage, social rules, mobs and violence as well as politics) to interest anyone. I feel that I have come away from this class with a very thorough understanding of the long 18th century and a totally different outlook on history as a field of study. This was one of the best classes I have ever taken.",
    "Leslie Mitchell is the ultimate English experience. His intense background knowledge of the subject makes for captivating lectures, and he covers a lot of material in one semester."
