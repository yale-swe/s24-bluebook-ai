   "comments": [
    "excellent class for anyone interested in diving into the world of immunology. highly recommended",
    "It works as the best course to provide and introduction to immmunology. I would definitely recommend it to any student.",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful class and I would highly recommend it to graduate students in both immunology and microbiology.",
    "This course's lectures are great and it's workload is mostly not very heavy apart from when exams are coming close, when you'll be spending a lot of time memorizing things. Some of the things you memorize will be worth memorizing because they're central concepts of immunology. Other things will be less memorable or central concepts and you'll probably forget them immediately after the exam. Some of the lectures are much better than others, but most are good. Definitely worth taking if you're interested in infectious disease, medicine, or host-pathogen interactions.",
    "The course is a great overview of immunology. It encompasses the biology, evolution, and applications of what you can do with a better understanding of the immune system.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It's quite a precious opportunity and very exciting to learn about various aspects of immunology from people who discovered them.",
    "An awesome introductory course to immunobiology and it is highly useful for anyone interested in biomedical research.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student-- while it was challenging due to the amount of material, it provides a good foundation in immunology. Also, the tutorials were helpful.",
    "Great introduction to Immunology."

   "comments": [
    "It has helped me fill in the blanks I had about some branches of immunology and provided me with new ideas for my research.",
    "Good overview of all the bases of immunology.",
    "Encountering the major concepts of immunology in a comprehensive setting was immensely helpful and I now know that I will be more prepared for reading papers involving immunology. Plenty of the details I memorized for the exams have immediately leaked out of my head and I'm not sure how useful it was to memorize material, but I feel much more comfortable with the field.",
    "yes, it set the foundation for my dissertation and research.",
    "Only helpful in that it's useful to know the immunology terminology included in papers in my field, but other than that, I felt like having to take an entire course was not necessary.",
    "I learned a lot and found the material very exciting!",
    "A really good foundation course for immunobiology students and it has definitely help me in my preparation for research in the field of immunobiology. By understanding what has been discovered and the unsolved questions in the field, this course is very helpful in determining my future research direction for my thesis project.",
    "I certainly learned a lot in this course and feel that it provided a strong foundation for further studies."
