   "comments": [
    "good class, you read a lot of interesting works and you come to see the world through a different lens which is awesome. the apollonian-dionysian dynamic is an important one for thinking about the world around us, even if after taking this class its hard to tell if its something that exists- thats kinda the point but dont get frustrated. i think you learn a lot about life in this class. really low-key, you just read nice things and think about them and occasionally write about them. you can take either writing or nonwriting, and george really just wants to make sure you do well on all of your assignments so he is super helpful and available and directs you to issues in your writing if you need it.",
    "If the material interests you and spending a semester reading about the Apollo\/Dionysus divide in art sounds like something you want to do, go for it! I would not recommend taking this class if you don't intend to actually do the reading (even if you want the writing credit!), since there are weekly reading responses and the class suffers a little when people fail to engage with discussions.",
    "Look at the syllabus. Is there a quorum of works you really want to read? Are you especially interested in the idea of the Dionysian for independent reasons? Do you just really want a chill lit seminar? If the answer to two of these is yes, take the class. Theres nothing wrong with it, and George Syrimis is a fun guy to have as your professor, but I did not find it to be one of the more profound or relevant classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely a different kind of course. It's all thematically focused around a (somewhat nebulous) concept, so the readings\/ films come from all over the place. There's a lot of Freudian interpretation going on, if you're into that. There's a good amount of writing involved-- weekly responses, 2-3 other short papers, a midterm paper and a final paper. If you do well on the midterm you can do a creative assignment for the final, which is a nice departure from the typical final research paper. Prof. Syrimis is wonderful-- so knowledgeable, very kind, and also can be pretty funny.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. The teaching as well as the material and the lens through which it is read are all eclectic and insightful.",
    "The reading material is wonderfully varied - everything from Aristophanes to Thomas Mann and Peter Shaffer. Though sometimes I feel Prof. Syrimis doesn't really respond fully to what his students are saying (or has certain fixed ideas of his own, which he puts forth very definitively), it was a thoroughly enjoyable, low-stress course overall.",
    "This class provides a framework on how to view the world. Once you see it, you can't really unsee it. A rewarding class, take it whether or not you need a writing credit.",
    "This course is pretty good overall. I went in as a senior Classics major expecting (or hoping for) a fairly sophisticated seminar. It most definitely is not that. Still, I got to read some pretty interesting things. Syrimis is a very good professor, and, I think, did a good job of integrating everyone despite the wide range of levels of all the students. But all around, he is great and cares a lot.",
    "Influences the student in an unexpected way; liberates certain desire flows by putting it into a mature discussion context, and encourages a Nietzschian play with life. Yup, I recommend it."
