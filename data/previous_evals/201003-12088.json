    "If you're serious about going into finance, especially private equity, then this class is a must-take!",
    "if you have the time, take it.",
    "I'd recommend this course, but only if you know what you're getting into from the start. Don't just take it because you plan to jump to PE after two years as an i-banking analyst.This is a business school course taught by a business school professor (who happens to be a very successful PE investor), so don't expect anything like you've had in your undergraduate coursework.Each week, you'll be assigned reading and a case to complete (most of the cases involve working as a team). The cases will be incredibly time-consuming and difficult. Most of the time they will leave you (and all of your classmates) in a state of utter confusion. You'll spend 10+ hours working on a model (this is NOT a course in modeling, so don't expect too much help on that front), applying the model, translating your results into meaningful investment conclusions, and then completing the assignment. After all of this time, you'll still be confused and frustrated; you'll come to class, Professor Schmertlzer will do a bit of teaching, in which he makes everything a bit clearer, but through the process, you'll realize that almost everything you did to prepare for class was wrong. The next week, it'll be the same thing, but you'll learn throughout the process.If you're willing to put in the time and effort (and deal with a whole lot of confusion), you'll have a very solid understanding about investing, business, and the private equity industry. It's absolutely a worthwhile course, but you should realize that it will often be a difficult, confusing, and frustrating experience.",
    "Only take this class if you are sure that you want to learn the material.",
    "This class is an intense class. The first few weeks brush up your accounting and modeling skills. But the real focus is a framework for private equity investing, doing deals and managing a business. I find this class useful to a future business career and intellectually meaningful.",
    "If you are considering going into business\/finance\/PE this is absolutely the most practical course you can take at Yale. In fact, no matter what you are going into, it's probably still the most practical class you can take at Yale. The professor really cares about his students and goes out of his way to make himself available to them. The downside to this class, is that although you will learn a lot, you must prepare to spend a lot of time not really knowing what you're doing. Every case seems completely overwhelming at first; you won't know where to start, you won't be able to figure out why your model's all wrong and the numbers don't make sense, and as you spend countless hours reading through hundreds of pages of poorly photo-copied SEC documents from the 1980's you'll wonder why you signed upfor this personal torment in the first place. Stick with it though, Professor Schmertzler has a lot of really interesting insights to offer and if everyone helps each other out it isn't so bad. Collaboration is key.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student. There are no lessons and the class is structured so that you fail on each case and Schmertzler can lecture you on what you did wrong in the subsequent class.In addition, I think there is a fundamental disconnect between what Schmertzler thinks he is teaching us and what actually goes on in the class. There was so little guidance for the assignments that it was unreal. At one point, Schmertzler told us we would be re-taking an old vocabulary quiz and proceeded to give us a midterm examination instead.People say there is a lot of work in this class and it is partially true. You could spend your entire week trying to decode the cases. However, because they are set up so that you will almost certainly fail, I would recommend doing much less work because with so little guidance any work you do is virtually useless and you will still come to class seeming unprepared.",
    "This class is a huge test. Not of intelligence or work ethic, but endurance. You must have an iron stomach to handle this class.",
    "You learn REAL things about finance and economics and modeling as they apply to investors and private equity funds. Don't tell anyone in the economics department, but you'll actually acquire useful knowledge that people outside of academia consider valuable. Once finished, you'll be able to through together a simple LBO model in your sleep and read through SEC documents like a pro."
