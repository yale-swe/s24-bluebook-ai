   "comments": [
    "Yes, wholeheartedly. It was a thorough approach to early modern historical drama from multiple critical and historical perspectives.",
    "This is an excellent class for anyone interested in Shakespeare's history plays and in questions of English Renaissance historiography.",
    "The course is a very interesting and detailed look at English history plays, primarily from the 1590s. Each week the students are expected to read one or two plays, usually one by Shakespeare and one by a contemporary dealing with the same subject. There is a lot of work to do, but also a lot of insights to gain from this approach, especially through the fruitful class discussions and Professor Manely's excellent comments, which are both textual and historical. The course should be of great interest to both English, Comp Lit, and History students.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - it's an excellent way of approaching history plays by Shakespeare his contemporaries, and also provides interesting insights into the entire period of English history."

    "It opened my eyes to a range of material which I had not previously considered very deeply, and to a period which I knew relatively little about (the late 1500s). Very insightful!"
