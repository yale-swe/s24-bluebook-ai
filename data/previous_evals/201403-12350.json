    "I would absolutely recommend it. I have enjoyed your course so much. The readings are interesting and challenging (both good things!), the assignments are very helpful in understanding the material and formulating an opinion about it, and the way seminar is organized is fantastic. The assignments for the course are: 5 readings responses (you can turn them in whenever in the semester, during class the week the reading is due), and 2 presentations on those readings. It has a lecture-style introduction, and then presentations from studentsI look forward to class every week. I have learned so many concepts about market regulation and politics in the economy. It is a must take if you are either an Econ or PLSC major.",
    "AAH SO BORING. Like, these topics could have been interesting (like talking about political coalitions built to deregulate certain industries, or talking about campaign finance reform and the drivers of it), but Swenson chose to focus exclusively on the boring aspects. He has like three words that he repeats in every single class meeting (\"rent,\" \"transaction costs,\" and \"asymmetrical information\") and he boils down every concept into one of those monotonous technical terms instead of talking about the political drama. Pretty disappointing.",
    "I like Professor Swenson personally, but I still recommend that you take another class. The reading list and syllabus had a lot of potential, and the reading list was good, but the class was too good to be true. As might be expected when the syllabus covers such a breadth of topics, Professor Swenson was not nearly an expert in many of the units we talked about. This does not necessarily doom the class--I've taken classes before where the professor had varying levels of expertise on the various units--but Professor Swenson did not handle this well. Unlike other classes I've taken where professors will obviously study up on things they know less about, Professor Swenson seemed to prepare for classes on topics he knew nothing about just as much (as little?) as he prepared for the other classes, and as a result it was often clear that he did not know as much about a particular topic as many of the students did, especially in financial and legal matters. He had many moments during the course where he'd say \"I have very limited knowledge on subject x,\" and subject x would be the entire unit for that discussion. He also struggled at times as a seminar leader; he lectured for the first 45 minutes usually, and when the class turned to a discussion, he seemed to lack the instincts to know when to cut people off because they were rambling and when his cutting people off just prevented people from finishing their points. Positive things about the course are that the workload was very manageable, the assignments were interesting, and he was very clear about what he wanted from them and gave helpful feedback. This wasn't a terrible class and not my least-favorite seminar I've taken at Yale, but I do think that you can find better ones and that there aren't a whole lot of compelling reasons to take this one with so many out there.",
    "I would recommend this course to any conscientious citizen. No matter what one's field of study is! It is just a fantastic, interesting course in which you learn about key topics such as the financial crisis, healthcare, and government oversight of firms, and we as a class come to new understandings about how and why corporations, laws, politics, and society are all interconnected.",
    "A great class if you want an overview of a lot of cool and very relevant topics. Definitely learned a lot. The 5, 2-3-page papers with 2 revisions at the end is really good.",
    "This class is a chance for students to discuss pertinent macroeconomic topics, though I wouldn't say I came away with a much deeper understanding of any of them because we only spent two hours on each one. This class really comes down to having smart students in the class with you- otherwise the two hours will go by very slowly.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. My favorite class at Yale so far. It'll give you a ton of knowledge about the major political issues this country is facing, and how private economic markets affect what's going on.",
    "Reasonably straight forward class, sometimes you're forced to just argue his views, but otherwise pretty easy class",
    "I would not recommend this course. I did not learn much from the course, and most of what I did learn was from the contributions of other students. Professor Swenson did not know much about any of the topics we covered, and while the reading was sometimes interesting, it was at best a cursory treatment of every topic on the syllabus. Overall, the course was disappointing and my least favorite I have taken at Yale."
