    "Yes- if you are interested in conducting independent research for credit, MCDB 475 is a great course. I would say that your experience depends on the lab you join, so it may be a good idea to get involved in a lab and learn about the science\/people in the lab before committing to 10-12 hours a week.",
    "would definitely recommend as a way to get some credit for research",
    "This class is what you make it to be. It's flexibility means that the responsibility lies on you to get work done.",
    "Absolutely do research for credit, though perhaps only if you really like your lab and PI. I suggest working in your lab of choice the summer before, get a feel for what you'll be doing and how you get along with your PI, and then decide. Research was never a high stress obligation (though of course it's annoying when your experiments don't work), and I enjoyed taking time away from the undergrad bubble (I worked in the med school). Make sure your PI is good with editing proposals and papers, otherwise you're on your own.",
    "Yes! great way to get research experience",
    "Yes! It is great exposure to lab work and definitely something to take advantage of at Yale!",
    "Absolutely, so long as you are working in a productive, organized lab.",
    "research for credit. your experience entirely depends on your lab and research mentor",
    "Whether or not you will gain anything from this course is entirely dependent on the research you are doing. This course requires that you spend 10-12hrs a week in lab, and that you write a proposal and final paper during the semester. I thought 1 semester's work was insufficient to warrant an entire report in addition to the proposal but that's what you have to do if you take this course.",
    "Research for credit",
    "Better than a class lab. Much more enriching and useful."
