    "Concepts are fascinating and the class is a great introduction to the power of machine learning, but if you don't have a solid linear algebra background and\/or exposure to computational biology, I wouldn't recommend this class. That being said, Smita and Chris are both great. They're clearly extremely passionate about the application of machine learning to biology, and have a ton of knowledge. However, there's very little transparency regarding what your grade is going into the final (3 psets total, a final project, and a final, with the first pset not being graded until after the last class)."
