    "This is a class about playwriting in which you are required to write a full length play. Along the way, you write other exercises and read a play a week. I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested in playwriting. It was great, and I would absolutely take it again.",
    "If you have any interest in playwriting, take this class. Margulies is a master. Expect to work - it's a lot of writing. But it's well worth it.",
    "Great class! Kind professor who knows how to structure the workshops effectively. Your work will be read out loud and critiqued a lot. The space feels safe and sharing is not uncomfortable."
