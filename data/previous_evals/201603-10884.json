    "Wrote my first literature paper in French! Learned to think about how a text is written and presented, more than just what the text says.",
    "A love of French literature!",
    "My French skills were greatly improved, and I gained insight into both French literature and French history (as well as the history of other French-speaking countries).",
    "I think I approached literature in a new way and I also got much better at reading and writing in French. I was able to practice and apply the grammar rules that I had previously learned. I also became more open to various ways to interpret and discuss literature.",
    "Very good survey course in French literature - excellent to refresh my language skills",
    "I came into the course only ever having studied the French language, so this was my first experience with French literature. I learned to read and write more comprehensively and think much more deeply about the texts we covered.",
    "This class gives a good foundation in French literature. Through the discussion set up of the class, I was able to improve my speaking skills in addition to my reading and writing."

   "comments": [
    "Very well organized, good context for every course. Should have more connections between texts.",
    "The course was wonderful - I don't think that it had any weaknesses. Apart from the brilliant works of literature that we read, the course's strength was the variety of assignments. Two essays, a presentation, and an oral tested many different French skills, which I found highly useful.",
    "A strength of this course was that it really got everyone engaged with class discussion and presentations. A weakness would be that we didn't always get to spend enough time on all of our readings.",
    "A little hard to discuss when you don't read\/read well - but not too worrying, depending on your professor.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. The readings were challenging but Professor Sanjabi really helped us understand them through discussion and presentation of relevant historical\/contextual information. The workload was not too taxing. The presentation and essays were interesting to research\/think about and to write.",
    "Difficult to do such a broad overview in one semester - would have liked more formal use of literary criticism",
    "The course's biggest strength was the incredible class discussions. Mme Sanjabi is super knowledgeable about the course material and truly made me think about the readings in a new way. The course's biggest weakness is the fact that there is so much to cover in so little time, so the class often felt rushed. In addition, there were instances where Mme assigned a lot of reading only to talk about it very briefly in class.",
    "This course was a great introduction to French literature. Because this course is a survey course, sometimes we didn't get the time to discuss everything fully, but we did in class get to the main points of the reading and Madame Sanjabi was always willing to meet with us to discuss anything we didn't cover or still had questions about."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, excellent survey of really amazing texts.",
    "If you don't know much about French literature, but want a greater appreciation of it, or if you want to read some fictional works in a class (which can be rare while at university...!) this is an amazing class. Mme Sanjabi is one of the nicest, funniest professors as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in French literature.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It was challenging but rewarding. The workload was not too high and the in-class discussions were so valuable and interesting.",
    "I definitely enjoyed this course, and Maryam Sanjabi is great. Accessible to freshman who haven't taken a course like this before; definitely recommended.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a motivated French student. Be prepared for a lot of reading that will take twice as long as you expect since it's in French, but also be prepared for amazing class discussions. Mme Sanjabi is such a warm and funny person; she really brings the class to life. The hardest part of the class is the level of analytical thinking Mme expects, but the major assessments (two essays, a presentation, and the final oral exam) are all very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the assignments were interesting individually and collectively. I liked how we also discussed how the texts relate to each other. Also, though one might assume that a literature class will be mostly reading and writing, the discussions in this class allowed us to speak a lot which really helped my French speaking."
