    "expect it to be like any other L3 language class. some people will actually like the material and some are just taking it for a language credit. Small class size of five ppl is great and you become friends with some nice ppl.",
    "Take it!",
    "If you want to take a class with a good chance of giving you free, and might I say delicious, food, take this course... But be warned. You will tango with students who have quite a flair for tongues. Not for the easily intimidated.",
    "Korean 130 is a challenging course that requires a high level of dedication. It's a course I would recommend only if you have a high interest in Korean.",
    "It is a continuation of Korean year one, truth be told most of the students in the class did not come straight out of year one so there was a lot of variance in the class in terms of skill level. It gets a little bit more difficult because of how the exam is structured and I felt the instructor was more strict than last year. But other than that it was a pretty fluid transition."
