    "It's group theory, ring theory, and module theory. It's fun. It's easy (okay, maybe not module theory). Casson may be slightly socially awkward, but his lectures are slow and clear, and they produce a *perfect* set of lecture notes. Like, seriously, his lecture style rocks. (Also, Casson is adorable.) If you like math, this class shows you a great way to view the world, and it's 1\/4 - 1\/2 as much work as 230 or 301\/305. If you're a math major, you have no excuse not to take this -- and if you're a non-math major, but you find this stuff interesting, then, hey, yeah, take it, see what a good, solid, college-level math class is like. (Also, I totally think that a freshman well-versed in proof-based mathematics could take this, though you should also take 230 -- it's good for your soul.)",
    "Great class. This course has a reputation of being tough, but it's really not that bad. The problem sets and exams are very doable if you keep up with the work and the material is really interesting stuff. The topics can get a bit abstract (hehe) at times, but Professor Casson really works to make sure you understand everything. He is pretty much the nicest professor around--really clear in class and helpful when you have questions. I'd definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in learning some awesome math.",
    "Necessary for the major. Not too interesting in and of itself, but I have heard Galois is worth it. Casson is definitely the way to go if you can take it with him - great lecturer.",
    "If you're a math major, this is a must take, even if you find it very difficult. I ended up not even taking it for the grade, but for the knowledge.",
    "Great course that is well taught. Covers the fundamentals of abstract algebra well. Once you are genuinely interested in the material and not a lazy bum, you should do well in it.",
    "I recommend this class for anyone who wants to take a good math course on proof.",
    "We learn about group theory for over half the semester, then we spend the rest of the semester working on rings and modules. There are weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final. Professor Casson is an excellent professor. He speaks clearly and is good at explaining things. I would recommend this course; I really enjoyed it.",
    "Abstract Algebra was a fantastic course. It moved a bit too fast for my tastes, but I never felt like I was lost. Professor Casson is a great lecturer, and he never skimps on the details in his proofs, which is a welcome change from some of the other math professors here. His lectures were good enough that I could almost always finish the problem sets just from reading over my notes from the lectures. Casson also gives tests where there are four problems and you only need to answer five (eight and ten for the final), which is wonderful.",
    "If you are interested in higher-level mathematics, I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. Professor Casson is the best math professor and one of the best professors I've had at Yale.",
    "The strength of the class was definitely Professor Casson. His lectures are outstandingly clear and instructive. If you go to lecture you will only need to read the textbook as reinforcement (although you probably should regardless). He was always available and helpful during office hours.This is a hard class though. Be prepared to spend long hours on the problem sets and a very hard final."
