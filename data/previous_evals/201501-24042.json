    "This is probably a moot point, since the grant for this seminar has expired. But if it comes back in the future, I have to say this: only take the course if you're ready to take on an additional workload on your way to your dissertation. This is not an extra year (as you have to fit it into your regular academic timetable), but extra work. If it is relevant to what you're doing, go for it. But you will not have the time to \"explore\" more distant fields and \"broaden your horizon.\""
