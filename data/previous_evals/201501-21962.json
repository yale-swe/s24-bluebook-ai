    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a wonderful introduction to essay writing, and a fantastic way to hone your skills. It's thought-provoking, you get to read wonderful works from a wide array of authors, and learn form the work of your peers.",
    "English 120 is a fair amount of work, but it is incredibly helpful. You will absolutely become a better writer in this course. No matter what your major is, you can benefit from this class. The skills you will gain will be very applicable, and you'll be so glad you took the course.",
    "ENGL 120 is a fun class to take as an alternative to the standard writing credit. You really improve your writing through writing essays yourselves. It was so refreshing to write about themes such as culture and animals. You really get to know the people in your section, as well as the professor. It may be a lot of work at times, but the emphasis is on making writing enjoyable, not tedious. Overall a must take at Yale.",
    "I highly recommend English 120 as a must-take class for everyone at Yale. No matter what your major is, learning how to write clearly and compellingly is a vital skill. English 120 covers a genre that not everyone tries in high school, so this class is a great way to get that exposure to personal essay\/narrative non-fiction writing.",
    "Low stress, very enjoyable--whether you like writing or not! The readings are completely manageable, and in all honesty, you don't really need to do them to more than get by. The instructor you take 120 with will completely shape your experience, so shop well.",
    "Take it take it take it!! One of the best courses you can take at Yale. There's weekly readings and almost a weekly paper, but the papers are super fun to write and super interesting. I'm definitely not an english person, but this was my favorite class this semester!! I've never heard a bad thing said about ENGL 120 and I can't say anything bad about it either. Professor Garcia is leaving so you won't have him but when you're choosing your section, make sure to have a good class (meaning the other students in the class) and a good teacher. Shop around if you have to, because those make all the difference.",
    "A interesting and helpful class for learning how to write. You read good essays to learn the tactics writers use and then you try and use those tactics in your writing. Our class had 5 essays, one due every 2 weeks, and reading for every class, so the workload was not bad.",
    "take it take it take it!",
    "It is a wonderful course, I would whole-heartedly recommend it!",
    "ENGL120 is a great class and feels pretty one-size-fits-all. That is, people who love to read and write thrive in this class (there's lots of reading and writing, as it turns out); and people who are still on the fence about the whole reading-and-writing thing are able to try their hand at it in a low-stakes, enjoyable seminar setting. The readings are quite diverse and, for the most part, pretty fun. The workload is steady and manageable. The essays give you a lot of flexibility, and the two-draft format allows you to take creative risks and develop your writing in response to your professor's feedback. Shop a few sections to see where you can get in and which professors you vibe with. I've never heard anyone say anything negative about an ENGL120 instructor, though. If you get in, shop it, and if you like the vibe of the class discussion, go for it. I don't think Edgar Garcia will be teaching at Yale this coming semester, but in the event this review becomes relevant in the future: Professor Garcia is phenomenal - brilliant, thoughtful, warm, a good listener, compassionate, etc. He facilitates discussion flawlessly, writes excellent feedback on your papers, and occasionally holds class in various cool spaces on campus like the art gallery and grad students' studios. [Extended side note for freshmen deciding between ENGL114 and ENGL120 -- ENGL114 will teach you how to write academic papers for college classes. ENGL120 is a creative non-fiction, reading-for-craft class. If you don't feel confident in your writing, definitely take ENGL114 before going for ENGL120 (not because ENGL120 will necessarily be too hard, but because the skills you develop in ENGL114 will be foundational for future writing at Yale). If you felt confident in your writing in high school but noticed an ENGL114 topic that interested you and you like the professor during shopping period, take it. (Again, foundational, low stakes, pretty fun, and ENGL120 will always be there for you.) If you were a kick ass writer in high school, know how to do research, and can write strong academic papers, congrats - go straight for ENGL120, it's an awesome class.]"
