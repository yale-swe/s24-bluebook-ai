    "The course was very interesting, though the topic was inherently confusing. Professors Pinango and Deo have incredible, inspiring enthusiasm for what they teach. Both Professors were very open to questions and helping you to understand the course material in and outside of class. However, the classes were often unorganized and we often did not get through the material that they intended us to."
