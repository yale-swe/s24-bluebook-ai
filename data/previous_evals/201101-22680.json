   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! It is a lot of reading, but class discussion is great and the books (for the most part) are excellent. I was always motivated to come prepared but also knew I could \"get away with\" not reading for class. But it was definitely one of those classes where when you don't read, it's truly your loss.",
    "It's a relatively stress-free writing credit. You only have 2 writing responses during the term and one final paper. Because Professor Pabst lets you explore topics that interest you in Morrison's works, the papers actually end up being really fun to write, andI think they are of higher quality because students really enjoy writing them.",
    "You read each of Morrison's novels in chronological order and then discuss them in class. I would DEFINITELY recommend this course.",
    "If you like Toni Morrison, take it. Even if you have never read her before, take it. The books are amazing and very enjoyable. Class discussion is based on going in a circle and sharing thoughts on the book. Minimal time for discussion. The class is as good as the group you have. This semester was filled with brilliant people making the class amazing and enjoyable.",
    "Good class - nothing revolutionary. A bit rushed (because you read ALL of toni morrison's books in the course of the semester) and a little \"superficial\" (with most of the books, you can barely scratch the surface because there just isn't enough time). But it was light on workload, and professor Pabst is awesome. So I would recommend.",
    "Great comprehensive look at Toni Morrison's body of work.",
    "this course was great! you just read all of toni morrison's books, which I really wanted to be doing anyway, so it didn't feel too much like homework! i would absolutely recommend this class. although it does sort of demystify morrison's writing, which is too bad in a way."
