    "i love genetics now..except studying for powell's part was painfully boring",
    "NO!! Not unless you absolutely have to take it for some requirement. SO boring and disorganized.",
    "If you are a bio major, this class won't be difficult, but you'll have to put in the time for memorization. I wouldn't recommend it for a non-bio major.",
    "It's not worth taking unless you have to, but it's pretty painless even if you do have to take it. Lots of studying right before exams, but the lack of final is definitely a perk! Watch out for the last test. It's all essay questions from Powell about vague things.",
    "Be prepared to study from the moment you step into class. Lack of homework or quizzes soon make you start skipping lectures and result in crazy cramming for exams. Be disciplined and do all the assigned problems. The exam is not bad but certainly you need to study hard to do well and beat the curve.",
    "This course is necessary for most of biology, so I would recommend it in that sense. However, I personally didn't enjoy how the material was presented. It was very piecemeal and often didn't engage me. However, if you are interested in biology, you should take the course; you'll need the information that is presented there.",
    "Potential reason to consider not being an MCDB major. A minor headache, mostly repetition of other, more well-taught material covered in other bio classes. Take it if you have to, but it's not going to be a groundbreaking experience.",
    "It's obviously pretty essential if you're interested in MCDB or bio. Some of the course is coherent and well-taught, and some of it is not, so be prepared to do more work on some sections than others.",
    "This is a good class if you are looking for a biology elective to fulfill a major or pre-professional requirement. There are a lot of upperclassmen in this class who are taking it to fulfill a biology elective, so a lot of people know a great deal about certain cellular processes that are covered in class. So, for a student that does not have a great deal of background in biology, a lot of time needs to be put in to reading the chapter and going to the optional sections. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you will do well in this class.",
    "MCDB 202 (Genetics) covers the basics of prokaryotic and eurokaryotic genetics. The class covers a diverse range of topics too diverse to be summarized here, but the curriculum follows standard pedagogy.The class is a very large lecture hall. The material is presented in powerpoint form, with three tests that each compose one-third of your grade. There is ungraded homework, and the tests take a variety of forms, including multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended word problems. There are three teachers that teach on different parts of the material.There are some important points to consider. First, the class is surprising mathematically heavy. Familiarity with combinatorics, probability, and statistics is very helpful at several points during the course. Second, preparation by taking some sort of broader biology course (such as cell biology) is also helpful. (As a freshman, I felt less prepared than my older classmates.)However, I would certainly recommend the course, not out of interest but out of utility,",
    "I would not recommend this class. Unfortunately, it's recommended. While the work is reasonable if you keep up, expect to put a lot of effort into understanding the material yourself and memorizing a lot of useless data on which you will be grilled in the exam.",
    "No. But if you're MCDB, you have to do it.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is boring and not very interested. that said, you are going to have to take it anyway if you are a bio major or want to go to med school. have fun.",
    "3 midterms, no final. Optional sections and problem sets. A great way to start off the MCDB major...as long as you attend lecture and understand the key points--not everything's in the textbook. Moreover, with 3 instructors teaching the class, it gets difficult trying to figure out how the exam's going to be structured. If you aren't an MCDB major, there are other better classes for that Sc credit you're looking for.",
    "This class is interesting although not one of the best biology classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Not a very well structured course as you have to deal with four professors. Expect to study a lot and do more or less heavy reading. Cram with time for the midterms and don't get scared away by the first one.",
    "Genetics is a decent class. The most helpful comment I read before taking it was to do Professor Roeder's problem sets because they will be exactly like her test questions, and this is true. I would also recommend reading the textbook, as it is sometimes easier to follow than Professors Powell or Garcia-Castro.",
    "If you're an MCDB or EEB major, you've got no choice, right? It's not that great of a course, but you can't really do anything about it, so make the best of it. Your grade depends entirely on how well you do on three midterms (no final), so you'd better do well on all of them. I screwed up on the first exam, because I didn't keep up with the readings and never went to section. Reading (or even skimming) the assigned reading before lecture is very helpful. And sections are very useful (depends on the T.A. though). Go to section, starting from the first one, do the problems, and ask questions! If you keep up, the class will be easy.The professors:Dawson--Good in lab, not so good in lecture. He was hard to understand since he mumbled a lot and his voice doesn't project. Also, the topics he talked about were more difficult to grasp than the other topics in the class were for me. The first third of the course was the most difficult, so it's important to stay afloat from the very beginning of the semester.Garcia-Castro--Went really slowly so we didn't cover a whole chapter (about two lectures). Test questions were basic and easy. Not a great, or bad lecturer.Roeder--Loved the easy-to-understand slides, and the problem sets she posts for her lecture are taken from previous exams, so they're almost exactly like the ones you'll encounter on your test. Although she explained concepts well, she isn't very engaging of a lecturer so you'll probably sleep through her lectures (actually, this happened to me throughout the semester).Powell--Confusing slides, and goes into too much depth when he talks about the population genetics equations, which you don't really need to know for the test. *Hint* The concepts are more important.",
    "MCDB202 is genetics. It's not that much work - there're only 3 in-class exams and they're noncumulative. READ THE BOOK BEFORE going to lecture and it'll make in-class comprehension much easier. The professors could be...better, though they're not that horrible. I couldn't decide whether it was the material, the professors, or the sophomore slump, that made the class boring.If you're looking to take genetics just for fun, I wouldn't recommend it. It's not too difficult or demanding of a course. Just do the practice problems that the professors assign, comprehend and do the reading, and attend the evening sessions and you'll be fine.",
    "take this class but hope dawson doesnt teach, best teacher is roeder, her portions on exams are almost word for word from p sets she posts. very good class in general, very interesting altho an hour and 15 minutes feels really long",
    "I have learned a lot during the past semester in Genetics. The only lecturer I really enjoyed listening to was Prof. Roeder - she was the most organized and professional out of the four. She always finished on time and covered all of the material she meant to cover, in contrast to some of the other Prof. Her lecture slides are so nicely organized that it was almost fun to study with them for the exams - do the problem sets she assigns: they prepare you well. I wish she taught this class all by herself. Then everyone could get more out of it.",
    "Roeder's lectures were very good. The rest ranged from ok to just plain bad. I hear that Roeder won't be teaching next year, so the one good segment of the course will essentially be gone. The class is not too hard if you have a strong bio background, because a good chunk of it will be review. If you're learning all the material for the first time in this class, I feel sorry for you. There's no final, which is a big plus in my opinion.",
    "Take this class if you have to. It's really hard to stay awake during lecture. the material is nice if you like it, but since problem sets are mandatory, you have to have a lot of self-discipline to keep up with the readings in order to understand what the professors are talking about. Also, the professors aren' great, except Roeder.",
    "Yes; I enjoyed learning about Genetics and overall I felt that the professors and TAs were ready to help clarify the material at hand.",
    "Don't take it if you've already taken biochem - there's too much overlap, and biochem is more in-depth.",
    "Do not take it unless you have to.",
    "Take it if required to, but don't if it is optional. It is so entrenched in the minutia of genetics that even enthusiastic geneticists would be frustrated.",
    "Not a good idea, though it's a requirement for most people. The curve is a bit scary.",
    "MCDB 202 is a thorough treatment of the major concepts in Genetics. You'll cover Mendelian inheritance, DNA \/ protein structure and regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and population genetics. The workload is manageable with one chapter of reading per class period and only 3 midterms, no final. The quality of the professors varies, with Professor Dawson the best and then Professor Roeder. Garcia-Castro and Powell were not very good. But if you're majoring in bio or have an interest in genetics, it's definitely a course worth taking.",
    "Overall, I'd recommend this course. If you're an MCDB major, you have no choice, but otherwise, it's still a worthwhile class to take. There are no psets, your grade consists of three non-cumulative exams (the last exam is before reading week, so you have no final during finals week). The professors were pretty good, especially Professor Roeder and Professor Castro. The material is interesting, and the time commitment is light; you mainly just have to study before exams. All in all, I've learned a lot of things that I ended up applying in my chemical engineering research.",
    "The material the course covers is useful and necessary if you're either pre-med or hoping to pursue a career in biology, but the course itself is not very well taught by most of the lecturers (there's 4) and you have to pretty much teach yourself the material. Each professor has a very different lecture style and they cover the material in the book to different extents. That being said, the TA's are very helpful and their review sessions definitely put the material in perspective.",
    "Don't take it. It's probably one of the worst biology course I've taken. If you're majoring in biology, good luck.",
    "Some of the material is fascinating and worthwhile, but a lot of the class is just memorization and fairly tedious. The professors seemed to focus on quantity of material, rather than quality of learning and teaching. The book was fairly helpful and the tests seemed pretty fair (although they involved huge amounts of memorization).Don't get behind on the material and expect to memorize and understand it all in the few days before the test. There is just too much to learn.This class would be much better if it had required problem sets and sections because it lacks a way to help students engage with the material between tests.",
    "The material for this class is very interesting, yet the course set up was a frustrating experience. It is another science class that is joint taught by 4 professors which leads to no continuity between lecture style and examination style. Each test is different which makes it hard to prepare for. The textbook is great, and I definitely had to do a lot of reading on my own (also statistics does help during one section of the course, but not necessary). Having said that, the material is good, but you have to work a lot on yoru own.",
    "No I would not recommend this course. Professor Roeder was the only good professor. The other two, Professor Powell and Professor Castro, were either disorganized or difficult to understand. I unfortunately do not think I learned very much at all. There are three major exams and that is all. While this initially may sound appealing, the structure of the class is useless if you are actually trying to learn something. If you have a choice, don't take the class. There are so many better ones here at Yale!",
    "It is a good tough course though I wish there were only one teacher. Jumping from one teaching style to another made it difficult to study because different teachers wanted you know know different things.",
    "I learned a lot in genetics and think that it is an essential subject to learn, especially if you're a biology major, but the organization of the course was poor and I would not have taken it if it hadn't been a requirement.",
    "good",
    "It's a requirement...unfortunately the class is not something that will get you excited about MCDB...but take it and don't give up on the major, because it does have a lot of great classes!",
    "Not the best bio class; don't base a love of the MCDB major on this course,",
    "I feel like this class gets a bad rap, and many people will tell you not to take it unless you absolutely need to. I didn't think it was that bad. The workload is great--three tests, some optional problem sets, and no final. The material is better covered in classes like MB&B 301, but most of the genetics lectures were decent.",
    "Take it because you need to as an MCDB major. Otherwise its not that interesting. To do well just be good at memorizing each slide. The class is curved at a B+ so its really not that bad, just remember that the kids sitting next to you are also hardcore bio majors (and probably premed) so study hard. Do Roeder's practice questions because it is really similar to what comes up on the final.",
    "Overall a painful class to sit through. Like many biology classes at Yale, it is taught by multiple teacher with multiplestyles, and it suffers because of that. The tests are often poorly worded, non-congruent or just plain overly difficult. Only take it if you have to, and good luck.",
    "Do not take Genetics unless you have to (it's a core course for the biology majors). Every one knows that it's a horrible class, but they still take it anyway because they have to. For those of you who think Genetics sounds fun, be aware: Genetics no longer means fun Punnett Squares. Genetics is much, much more complicated than that and also very hard to understand. Your entire grade is made up of three tests. You don't have very much work outside of attending lecture (the problem sets and sections are only \"recommended\"), but once the week of the test rolls around, you're screwed and in for a lot of cramming. So if you do end up taking Genetics, make sure you stay on top of reading the textbook, or at least doing the recommended problems and problem sets.",
    "One of the core classes for the MCDB major; the textbook is excellent, and most of the lectures are helpful.I think that what ends up making or breaking this class for people is whether or not they find themselves taking any interest to biology at all.",
    "Nope. Unless you have to take it, which you probably do if you are looking at it. It is a general overview\/introductory course, and doesn't really get into much interesting topics of genetics.",
    "The course covers a ton of material in one semester and moves pretty quickly. It's hard to keep up the reading but I would definitely advise reading the chapters before lectures otherwise you don't get much out of going to class.",
    "Well, if you have the endurance to stick through the exams and to reallly study the material, you will do well. Even if you don't do very well on the first exam, do not get discouraged. The first exam had a lot of random calculations; the second exam was pure memorization so if you have the endurance\/work ethic, you can do well. The third exam was not as hard as expected. It takes a lot of independent studying and memorization to do well consistently.",
    "Take it only if you need it to fulfill a major. Genetics is a hard class for a freshman to take, because you might not be ready for the large class, and the speed at which some of the professors move. It is for people who stay on top of reading weekly, and can attend section weekly.",
    "Very difficult, do the reading and practice problems.",
    "The course isn't anything special, and feels unorganized and poorly structured. I would not recommend taking it unless necessary for certain requirements.",
    "Take it if you have to fulfill pre-med requirements. Other than that, what it teaches you you quickly forget. What you learn in an intro bio course is probably good enough for a good understanding of genetics. The rest is nitty gritty.",
    "Yes \u0097 It honestly isn't too difficult of a class and if you like bio, the material is actually really interesting. Yes, sometimes the lectures are dry (okay very dry) but they aren't that bad. When I was reading the reviews last year I thought it would be absolutely unbearable, but it's not that bad. If the lectures are confusing, read the textbook. The exams are not difficult and the curve is very fair.",
    "The lectures were incredibly boring, and I fell asleep in a majority of these lectures. Roeder was the best lecturer, and her study questions were incredibly helpful for studying for the exam. However, the other three professors were rather confusing. Since the three exams were not cumulative, I do not think I learned anything substantial about genetics. In short, I would not recommend this course unless you are required to take it.",
    "I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS TO ANYONE. IT IS A PAINFUL PAINFUL EXPERIENCE. Also I can say is try to do the practice problems before the last couple days of the test. BUt really, you tell yourself you will and it just never happens. This class is brutally boring, the material is not helpful, and neither the teachers nor the book are helpful in actually teaching you anything. Sorry to say it, but just suck it up and pray the semester comes to an end quickly.",
    "If I had one hour left to live, I would spend it in this class. Because it would seem to last a lifetime.I don't really blame the instructors (although some are better than others). Rather, an intro genetics lecture does not really do well when each class is and hour and 15 minutes long. It seems much longer.But hey, if you're taking this class, you probably need to take it and whatever is said in any review won't change that. The material isn't hard to understand by any means (standard bio memorization of terms, techniques, etc. The mendelian\/population genetics material at least offers a break from this). Getting yourself to spend time on it is another matter entirely.",
    "Only if you are premed or a Biology major.",
    "Interesting subject, horribly taught.Be prepared for four bad teachers -- you need to put a lot of time in on your own to learn the material.Only take this if you have to...",
    "If you are considering this class, you probably have to take it, so this recommendation is somewhat irrelevant. Just keepup with the material - it's basically just AP Biology stuff in more depth - and you'll do fine. It's not too much work and is pretty interesting and useful.",
    "OH boy. If you're a bio major, you'll have to take this course. It's by far the worst science class I have taken at Yale. The class is not hard, but the fact that multiple professors teach the course makes the class very difficult to follow. There are definitely better bio courses....",
    "I hated this course. The only reason i took it was because Med schools favor it. FOr a course that is essential for MCDB majors you'd think that they'd put more effort into making it a good class. The lectures were more or less wastes of time with the professors rushing though everything, a chapter a day is just way too much - no student can learn well in those kind of conditions. The only way i learnt stuff was because of the review sessions. I also feel like we should have been made to do problem sets to make sure we're on track with the course. If youre going to take this course, you have to be on top of your stuff from the get-go. Go to all the review sessions and prepare for the bad curve.",
    "Worst course I've taken at Yale. By far! Only take it if you have to. I simply don't understand why they haven't completely re-structured this course given that it's gotten terrible reviews for the past 3 years. This course is completely unnecessary and redundant if you've already taken MB&B's year-long biochemistry.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Of course the only people whodo take this class are the ones who have to.",
    "Probably shouldn't take it. If you're thinking its just gonna be mendel and punnet squares you're wrong. Some have said its the worst class at yale. Its maybe not that bad, but think twice.",
    "Genetics is a fine course. It's interesting, but I felt a little like it was intro bio 120 all over again, with just a little more in depth. I almost felt that with so much overlay, they should just combine the two courses, or if a student has taken intro bio 120, and intro eeb, then he shouldn't have to take genetics. If I hadn't had intro bio, I would have really enjoyed this course, as it does cover many important points. The lecturers are fine. You might have to read the book to better grasp the concepts that Garcia-Castro lectures, but Roeder's slides tell you everything you need to know.",
    "If you have a lot of interest in genetics, it can be a good course. Otherwise, unless you are a biology major, take other bio courses instead. Powell is a boring lecturer, Garcia-Castro is okay and Roeder is definitely the best of them all as far as teaching and organization and clarity go. The last part of the course on population genetics is by far the most dry and uninteresting and most poorly taught. Everything else is better though. Also, not having a final is nice. However, it means you need to be on top of it for the three exams.",
    "Genetics is about 1\/4 of what you learned in highschool. It goes into detail abotu the molecular process, which is kind of interesting. About halfway through the course you start learning a bunch of stuff that is not interesting--lab procedures, etc. The last part about population is taught awfully and the test was unfair. Be careful.",
    "Yes ... generally a decent class! But, it felt more like a class to just learn the basics of genetics than really to spark interest or curiosity about the genetics field.",
    "Roeder is very clear and her test questions are very straightforward. Powell is clear but his test questions are very long open response questions and not as straightforward. Garcia-Castro's lectures and slides are very disorganized and test questions are extremely unclear. Roeder should teach the whole class.",
    "This class is a disgrace to the biology departments of Yale. It takes what could potentially be a perfectly interesting topic, or at least a fairly painless requirement, and butchers it into an abomination, complete with:1) boring or repetitive lectures2) incomprehensible lectures with lots of unexplained and\/or irrelevant material[I say these things as someone who knew much of the material before coming into the course]3) poorly prepared teaching fellows4) exams which don't actually assess what you've learnt; instead they test either a) your ability to regurgitate diagrams memorised from the textbook, or b) they're full of trick questions, where students more familiar with the material can do worse than students less familiar with it.Do NOT take this course. I repeat - do NOT. Save yourself.Of course, chances are, like so many others, you don't have much of a choice. You are part of their captive audience, like I was; students like us who have no choice but to take this course are the reason it's so bad.",
    "Team-taught course with 3 midterms, no final, and no problem sets. Lecture quality varies depending on who's lecturing, but all are decent.",
    "Unfortunately this class is mandatory for the MDCB major. Take it and suffer through it. I recommend taking the lab as at least that will force you to think about some of the material and might actually make it fun. The course is poorly taught and manages to sap all of the fun and excitement from the field. Do not take it if you don't have to.",
    "Genetics was a good introduction that covered topics from medelian genetics to gene expression to population genetics. There are different professors for different sections and although none of the topics are covered very deeply, some sections are better explained and meatier than others. Overall though, I would say genetics is a typical introductory course and was mostly enjoyable."
