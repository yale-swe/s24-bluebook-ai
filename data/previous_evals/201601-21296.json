    "Not the most interesting class. Not the most boring. The labs and homework involve a fair bit of busy work at times, but the homework also taught you a fair bit sometimes, so you win some, you lose some, I guess. Note, it wasn't clear from the course description for me, but the lab DOES NOT involve building circuits. It's programming an FPGA board which in turn \"constructs\" circuits for you on a microscopic scale. Thus, all it really feels like is copying code and running it.",
    "Absolutely if you are interested in EE.",
    "This class isn't the greatest, but its also not the worst. Working in a group makes learning the material much more fun. Jakub is extremely friendly and approachable, but lectures can be boring. I felt like I only learned the material on exams while reviewing the answer keys later posted: there aren't completed practice problems for you to look at. That's how I learn best, so I found that frustrating.",
    "good!",
    "DONT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is vaguely interested in how computers work. The course content is very interesting and I think it complements CPSC201 nicely. Jakub is the sweetest professor ever and he is super approachable and helpful. Labs are pretty cool, but involved a lot of copying code from screenshots. PSets generally don't take too much thought, but can be tedious at times when we have to draw or write the same thing over and over. Nevertheless, overall I think it is a pretty fun and cool course!",
    "You program an LED cube to light up! You program a counter! I thought these parts of the course were pretty cool, but the labs are allocated much less time than they should (the labs are long). Fun course with hurdles in my opinion.",
    "I thought it was an ok course. Very similar to CPSC 201. The labs were cool, except terrible. You would just type out whatever code necessary to do the lab given to you in pdf form. Then you just plug a couple things in and ta-da!",
    "Yes - a good intro to computer engineering.",
    "EENG 201 is a solid class. It's very interesting to see the connections between hardware and software, and I recommend this class to computer science majors as well, or anyone interested in learning how computers work. There is a weekly lab. Try not to pick the first session of the week if possible. This will give you some prep time to type up the code (or use an optical character recognizer) - but do be sure to look through the code and see how it works! It will also allow the first session to identify areas of confusion that will be cleared up for the next sessions. Jakub Szefer is a good lecturer, and his office hours are a good resource. He is understanding of students' struggles and open to extending deadlines. This last point is good, because he struggles to keep up with emails and may not see them until late, but is happy to give an extension.",
    "Necessary and informative for engineering majors- probably not very interesting for non-engineering majors."
