    "I would recommend this course to another student! Beware of the TF however, he's evil and unhelpful. Psets are great because they mostly help you to understand the material and tackle material presented in class. So you never feel like you're going to fail every week and will not be able to do the psets. They are also shorter than most physics\/math psets at Yale, so it's really refreshing. Prof. Humphrey is really amazing. He's incredibly clear and organized. He's also very available for office hours and extra help, and he's super kind and helpful. He rocks. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the paper however, mostly because you get caught up in the material and it's really interesting!",
    "Good class. Take if you are interested in the mix of mechanics and biology. There are a lot of derivations, so don't expect a lot of word problems (this actually makes the problems themselves more straightforward though). Workload is very low for an engineering class. Prof. Humphrey is really organized and a great lecture, passionate about the subject!",
    "Definitely take it, as an elective if you're not a BME! Great class, fairly easy grading.",
    "This is a really easy elective for meng majors who have taken fluids, thermo, and strength and def in my opinion. It's a fairly theoretical class and the psets aren't very standard (a lot of short essays and things like that), but nonetheless the material is interesting enough. Huge focus on derivations as opposed to doing actual problems, so depends how you feel about that, but it was a new approach I didn't mind too much.",
    "Basic continuum mechanics course with a lot of derivations, but the professor is very clear so you really get to understand the material",
    "Recommend as an easy elective particularly for ABET chemical engineers. It only goes over the basics of material you already learned in kinetics, pchem, transport, and fluids, and all in 1D.",
    "Definitely. Great elective for Mech E. Extremely engaging material and the professor is really sincere. Ends up being a fair amount of work, especially for someone like me with zero background in Biology. But it's well worth it in retrospect.",
    "Very well taught. Jay Humphrey is the best engineering lecturer I've had so far. Really understood the concepts and forces you to understand the concepts and then the application. TA was very helpful and nice. Learned everything from class notes and didn't need textbook because class was so well taught.",
    "I loved this class! Very well organized and well taught",
    "A great into to biomechanics that is interdisciplinary - my classmates were biomedical engineer majors, chemical engineering majors, mechanical engineering majors, and others. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Alright so essentially this is an interesting, but nearly unbearably slow course on intro mechanics (the bio-applicability is rather limited in scope) in which 99% of the lectures follow identically what is in the very readable, well written textbook by Humphrey himself. Humphrey's great, but I'd take his upper level stuff. If you're mechE\/chemE\/not-BME in general, take if you want an easy\/interesting course, not if you want to think hard or anything particularly stimulating.",
    "I would definitely recommend BENG 353 to any mechanical engineering student because it is great course.",
    "This is a great class, would definitely recommend it, if only for Professor Humphrey. Big emphasis on derivations, but a good class for MechE majors looking for something outside of the department which counts towards the major.",
    "Take it! It connects a lot of the things you learn in intro math and physics courses, and also shows you where more complex ideas fit into the theoretical framework of biomechanics.",
    "This class is really confusing until the end, when all of the patterns are clear and you understand why each step was taken. Until then, though, it's just a mess of derivations and confusion.",
    "I would recommend this course even for people who are not BME majors because it is non-intimidating math-wise, but still lays a solid foundation for the intersection of math, physics and biology. If your last biology class was in high school, I wouldnt worry about it. This is a great place to start exploring the BME major.",
    "This class is great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes derivations and is interested in how you can translate the mechanics you learn in physics to biological systems. Humphrey is a great lecturer and although there's a lot of material, he ties it all together pretty well. He does assign a lot of writing for homework, so be ready to write a couple of short 1-2 page essays, and the research project is very long.",
    "BENG 353 is a pretty solid engineering course. The class is entirely derivation\/proof based, but the tests are pretty easy so it's not too difficult to get a good grade. I didn't really learn anything applicable for the real world, however, so if you're not BME then I would recommend taking a different engineering elective because this one isn't very interesting.",
    "To BME students, this is a pretty challenging class. Don't take it so lightly. The students that give it breezy comments are most likely MechE or ChemE's who have taken classes on this material before eg Strength and Deformation and Fluid Dynamics."
