    "This course was well-taught and facilitated to improve student learning. The only weakness is the class size-- twelve or fourteen is much too large for a language section, compared to my Chinese and French sections at Yale (which had around 5 to 8 people.) Also, the seminar room in Pauli Murray was very crowded because of this high number of people.",
    "Very well organized course; fantastic professor; positive learning environment; peers were always engaged and so was I; the professor was more than happy to offer help; exams were fair; presentations were a great learning opportunity; overall one of my favorite courses at Yale so far.",
    "very good class.",
    "Great professor, I just wish we didnt rely on the textbook so much.",
    "More organized directed learning.",
    "Strengths: Engaging, humorous and eloquent professor. Provides an eagerness to have students improve and shows extreme patience with students which is important for a language professor. Grading was on-time and never deviated from the syllabus in fairness. Feedback always given. Weakness: Wish that assignment due dates were more clear. Test review were also clarified before exams.",
    "Very fun but could have had a more structured curriculum"
