   "comments": [
    "This class entailed an expansion of intermediate vocablary and grammar and the development\/polishing of a range of skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I would absolutely recommend it to any student seeking to attain even a basic fluency in the language.",
    "Spanish L4 is great! If you are unsure whether you want to continue with Spanish, you should take it! We worked out of enfoques for most of the year, but spent the end of the semester reading a short novel (VERY SHORT). The class is fun and interesting. We really worked on some of the grammar that we had seen before, but now I can say with certainty I know how to use the subjunctive!",
    "Try not to take a spanish course of any level with the course director as it is often more difficult.",
    "If you're at all interested in improving your spanish ability, you have to take this class. It's pretty grammar-focused, and you'll definitely be forced to speak every day. The workload is consistently moderate and tests\/quizzes are fair but sometimes challenging. It can sometimes be a little boring...but overall I'd say it was a class worth taking.",
    "Yes! Take Spanish 140 if you want to improve your grammar, speaking, and listening skills. Like the other courses in this series, it is a solid 5-day a week course, meeting for 50 minutes each. Although it seems like a lot of work for 1.5 credits, it is very manageable with only a little work to do each day (about 1-2 hours\/night). Take it with Profesora Leon!",
    "Take spanish 140 if you want to continue with spanish because it is a good background, but don't expect it to make you fluent.",
    "If you want to get a lot better at speaking spanish in one semester then take this course",
    "Great class- take it with R. Leon if you want to learn more than in any other L4 class but know that you will also be doing more work. Def possible to get an A but be prepared to do 45 minutes of work everyday. I took it even though I did not need it for dis req and I found for me (and many other people) that L4 was when everything really came together."
