    "Professor Plantinga is a wonderful teacher, incredibly brilliant, and wonderfully kind. He is a pleasure to have as an instructor. You should take the class just for an opportunity to study the classics with him - there is absolutely nothing like it.",
    "This is a great class! Take it!",
    "It's a class about music and its history from the 16th to the 19th century. I would absolutely recommend it if you're at all interested in music and would like to figure out how history figures into it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. While the intersection of intellectual history and music history is certainly one worth exploring, this seminar covers the topics too briefly to be useful. The course is roughly split between music and intellectual history. with classes being split between some (not enough) discussion on the sparse readings, some lecture by Professor Plantinga, and musical analysis. The musical analysis was the most interesting part, but one would almost certainly learn more in a music history course. The intellectual history was very shallow, with little primary source reading and lots of broad generalizations. That said, the course was not too much work, and I certainly learned and thought about things that I had not had the chance to previously."
