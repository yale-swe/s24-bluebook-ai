    "I have really enjoyed Professor Dannenbaum's course this semester. It has been one of my favorite classes of my three semesters here. Professor Dannenbaum facilitates really interesting discussions and practices a great balance between lecture and discussion. Armed Conflict has also been one of the best organized seminars I have been in. Every topic builds on earlier ones in a very clear way.In addition, Professor Dannenbaum has selected very good texts for the class. There is a perfect mix of theory and application, and nothing feels like superfluous reading. Professor Dannenbaum is also obviously very committed to the class. He is always willing to address students' questions in a thoughtful, thorough way, and he always makes himself available for helpful discussions outside of class.",
    "This was a superb course on every front. The materials were well chosen, and not too voluminous. But more generally Dannenbaum was just a first-rate teacher. He kept class discussion going well throughout the year (helped by a few stalwarts in the class), was very approachable, and is as intellectually impressive as a lot of the bigger names at Yale. Totally recommended.",
    "One of the best classes\/teachers Ive experienced at YLS. Id recommend anything Dannenbaum teaches in the future.",
    "This is an amazing course. The professor is extremely well prepared and he is always willing to engage in interesting debates. He is also available outside of class to provide guidance with paper topics and such. The readings are very well selected and they prove to be useful for the discussion in class.I recommend this course without reservations!",
    "Rising star in academia. Very gifted, and really knows the field. He's also easygoing and very accessible. Nonjudgmental, as well. I'd say the only challenge I had was not having the course materials put together in one pdf for printing. I had to print tons of material each week, which is time-consuming. Otherwise, if you care about this subject, take this course with Dannenbaum.",
    "This was a great class - the size and syllabus really made it as informative as a lecture but with the quality of conversation of a good seminar. Prof. Dannenbaum had an impressive ability to integrate a lot of info efficiently - only downside was that some lectures seemed to assume intimate knowledge of the statutes and sources of law could get confusing. Overall, though, a great instructor and excellent intro to armed conflict\/international law."
