   "comments": [
    "Yes, though my concern is that since the Jackson Institute is small, there might be demand for this course only on a two year cycle.",
    "I would highly recommend \"U.S. Policy Towards South Asia\" with Professor Alexander Evans. He is a true expert on the subject. He is an active British diplomat with close contacts throughout the U.S. diplomatic corps. Evans is also superb professor. He knows how to effectively lead a class and does not let students take the class on wasteful tangents.",
    "I strongly recommend other students to take the class.",
    "Great history course.",
    "This class will make you feel like a spy, a diplomat and a policy analyst all rolled into one and will grant you a insider's perspective into the applications and processes of US foreign policy to an increasingly vital part of the world.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students, though I'd also like to see some improvements in the course.I think the class does a good job in helping students gain insights into US-South Asia relations over the past few decades, but it would have been nice to start with a general overview of the historical timeline and major events just so that we can always keep things in perspective, especially since most of the people in the class had little previous experience with South Asia.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in South Asian affairs."

   "comments": [
    "very much.",
    "I never took a course on South Asia and I now feel confident that I have a strong initial grounding on the subject. I believe the course will advance my professional skill-set since South Asia has become an increasingly important part of U.S. foreign policy and can no longer be ignored by any serious foreign policy professional.",
    "I was able to deepen my understanding of US foreign policy and historical development in the region during and after the Cold War. I am very satisfied with the class.",
    "",
    "As a South Asian focused IR major, this class offered me valuable insights into the diplomatic history and processes of US-South Asia relations and also granted me access to the archival resources that provide the material for the charting of this relationship.",
    "One of the most important takeaways from this class for me is the importance of individuals in policy making. From both the documents that we have studied as well as from the guest speakers that we have listened to, it is clear that international relations are not an impersonal process. Rather, individuals, even their personalities, pay an enormous role. This is a very important realization, especially since my last semester of study gave me the misleading impression of an international political system solely on the basis of social sciences.In addition, this class really inspired my interest in archival research.",
    "Very helpful for my profession",
    "This course gave me a great overview of the most heated issues in South Asian affairs, with reference to historical background. This provides me with great foundation to analyze the current events related to US-South Asian relations."
