    "It is a great way to learn about the structure of the department of defense and possible career paths in the US Navy.",

    "A great introduction to the military. I would even recommend it for you if you were not in NROTC. You get the opportunity to hear some fantastic officers speak. Take the class.",
    "You will learn the basics of the Navy and Marine Corps. Much of the class is just rote memorization."
