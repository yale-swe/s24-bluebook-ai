    "Definitely recommended. Work is not little, but it is so enjoyable that it will not seem like a burden.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I don't care if you're not a lit or an Italian student, just take it. It will be one of your favorite courses at Yale. Why?- You learn a lot about really influential literature.- Your professor will be amazing. Awesome. Inspiring.- You will enjoy your assignments\u0097a few interesting papers, a Symposium styled speech, and a sonnet!- You will eat heart-shaped pizza and homemade tiramisu. Yum.",
    "YES, because you will learn tons and you will have lots of fun!",
    "Amazing.",
    "Yes- it's a fun class, pretty laid back. The assignments are not hard but you still learn a lot from them. The papers forced me to reflect on everything I read, and it was great that I got to pick something that actually interested me. Writing the speech on love and the sonnet was fun, and it also challenged me to do something different that I hadn't done before.",
    "This was a perfect senior year class for me. A survey of really interesting literature that, let's be honest, I was never going to read on my own, interspersed with creative work and genuine debate about love. A lecture that was small enough for class discussion but large enough to remain a lecture and justify having smaller sections, including one in Italian. A class that conducts a Symposium as part of its requirements. Everything was wonderful. Bravissimo."
