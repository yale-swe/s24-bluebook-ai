    "IF YOU GET IN, TAKE IT. Be prepared for a lot of work though, which you must be willing to do. Huge assignments twice a week. That being said, most useful and fun and fascinating class I've taken at Yale so far. Ehrgood is a legend- you won't forget him. If you are pre-law, this class is a must. I have spoken with law school students about this class, and they can't believe what we learn\/ wish they were taught this in law school or before! If you want to improve your writing in general, this class is also a must.",
    "This class combines plentiful work, the acquisition of concrete skills acquired, and often-incoherent class sessions. A good class to credit-D.",
    "Absolutely. This class will teach you how to think in a way that no other class at Yale will. Andrew Ehrgood is a charming to some and insufferable to others. You should get a sense of how you feel by shopping the class. If you're sure that you want to take it, write him a letter well before preregistration begins. It is a lot of work. The class changes every year, but we had three midterms, a final, and one paper that went through multiple revisions throughout the term (this was tougher than writing multiple papers, because Ehrgood's demands are extremely high). But you will take so much away from this. Take it.",
    "Even if you don't have any interest in law, take this class to learn how to write! And if you have an interest in the law, all the better.",
    "Take it! You will improve your writing more in this class than almost any other at Yale. It's totally worth it--whether you're interested in the law or not. (Particularly if you are.)",
    "If you want to improve your writing, take this class. Class discussions are fun. The daily assignments are a lot, but the course is front-heavy. There is less work towards the end of the semester.",
    "This class is full of great moves. The best one is that you will apply because you want to learn how to think and write about the law, but because you want to think and write about the law, you probably suffer on with the same stale entrenched moves in my repertoire. Professor Ehrgood will work with you little by little to break down and rebuild how you think and write. You will learn how to write clearly, think reasonably, and speak firmly. You will have a-ha moments. You will work hard, and it will pay off. You will get better. And you will use the skills you learn in this class in every assignment in every class for the rest of Yale."
