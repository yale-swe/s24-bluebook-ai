    "The Directed Studies approach to philosophy feels like the best way to be introduced to the subject. I really feel like I now understand how the dialogue of philosophy was established and progressed, and I also feel ready to understand how later philosophical ideas interacted with their early predecessors.",
    "DS Philosophy is a great overview of \"old\" philosophy-- Plato, Aristotle, through Aquinas. It is at times frustrating and the reading is difficult and time-consuming, but section\/lecture often helps to illuminate arguments that are particularly confusing. If you like clarity, this may not be the course for you: conclusions are often murky. Professor Pittard is quite good, especially if you like discussion that often centers around God\/religious questions.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in philosophy (read: the meaning of life and how we humans fit in the grand scheme), who can handle dense readings in large quantities, who can arrange his or her thoughts clearly and succinctly, and who is not afraid of voicing his or her views. Then this class is perfect.",
    "A survey course of ancient philosophers, DS Philosophy is incredibly divisive: you either love it or you hate it, but there's rarely middle ground. My observation is that it really depends on your section and whether you've been exposed to philosophy before. DS Philosophy was my first exposure to the subject, and I found it difficult to approach. Professor Pittard clearly knew the material well, but often had trouble conveying the basic arguments of each work, preferring instead to jump to the most complicated point of the text. While he's obviously an engaging teacher of upper-level, specified classes, I think he struggled with changing his approach to one appropriate for an introductory class. I didn't feel like I truly understood the material until I started studying for the exam using a different section's notes. Lectures were decidedly hit-or-miss; while some were fantastic (Parmenides, for example), others had the same problem of over-complicating a work without addressing the basics. I would recommend DS Philosophy with reservations, mainly because I wouldn't take the class if it weren't associated with the other two DS courses. Although the class covers an impressive amount of material, I feel that I could find another introductory philosophy class that better captures the approach needed for first-time philosophers."
