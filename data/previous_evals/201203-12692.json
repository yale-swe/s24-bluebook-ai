    "It's a really interesting class if you're interested in learning the general overview of different types of disabilities, mainly Dead, legal ADA related studies and mental disorders. The discussions are great!",
    "Great course, built like a lecture course but actually really an intimate seminar - one of the only courses that discusses disability and culture at Yale. These issues are really important.",
    "Don't take this class if you're a student who likes going to a class with a prepared professor, discussing the readings you did for homework, having relevant and cohesive lectures, and comments on your papers that are very helpful for your knowledge and growth as a writer and a scholar of disability studies. In other words, I don't recommend this class.For every positive attribute the course had in content, it lacked in structure. I'm still not sure if it was meant to be a lecture or a seminar. We started in a seminar room, and I went into the class expecting that to be my experience. It turned into a 14-person lecture with a section. Lectures BARELY touched on all of the readings I devoted HOURS to, and discussions of films were limited to a cursory comment about the beauty or talent of an actress. I left every day feeling frustrated at myself for putting so much time into the readings and not being adequately fulfilled in the classroom. The quizzes were so light-hearted that students who didn't do the readings could figure out the answer by process of elimination, which consistently irritated me. The lectures were often over in 40-50 minutes, and we would end up twiddling our thumbs as Karen did a jig trying to keep us engaged or entertained for 25 more minutes.This class needs serious restructuring. Compare the syllabus from Fall 2012 with the syllabus of the semester you're taking it; if it doesn't seem revamped, don't take it.",
    "DO NOT BELIEVE THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S COURSE EVALUATIONS. They were absolutely glowing, but this was the WORST class I've ever taken at Yale and I thought about how much I hated it every time I was there, as well as every time I wasn't there and remembered having to go back. It's poorly designed, absolutely disorganized, and a waste of time. The first third of the class starts off strong and really changes how you think about disability. You can stop reading for the next 2\/3 because you learn absolutely nothing new from then until the end of the semester. Except that you can't because there are pop quizzes that are insultingly easy, but still inspire anxiety to read the texts. The reading load is extremely heavy and there is a movie assigned every week, but NONE of it is ever discussed in class or in section, making every week a mental struggle over whether or not to waste your time and do the work, or to cast it aside and risk it being a pop quiz week. Even though some of the initial theoretical texts are really fascinating (if you're interested in the topic, buy and read the textbook assigned for this class--infinitely more interesting than the lectures--but don't bother with the course), the class never was able to rise to a high level discussion of said texts. Every class\/section always devolved into a sharing of personal anecdotes. I cannot stress enough how much I DO NOT recommend this course to a fellow student. That being said, I'm not an Anthro major, and maybe this makes a big difference since it's not my personal area of interest, but everything about this class infuriated me. It went beyond an issue of subject matter; the design and instruction of the course made it an absolute nightmare.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. You'll learn so much about perspectives on physical and mental disabilities from within the US and around the world. There's a ton of reading and a decent amount of writing over the semester, but it's worth it. The professor and TA are both fantastic as well. Take this course!",
    "This is a class on disability from a mostly anthropological perspective. Be warned, it's cross-listed with WGSS. If you don't like WGSS classes, you might want to think twice about this class. It is interesting, though--an important topic. I would also recommend shopping it to see if you like Professor Nakamura. She has a very specific teaching style.",
    "Take. This. Class. NOW.I came into this class not having a background in disability studies or anthro, but have come out of it so much more informed about major disability issues from around the world, seeing connections between disability studies and other fields, and have become a much mroe critical thinker about these issues. Karen is a splendid and challenging instructor (and a seriously awesome person that I kind of aspire to be - very open with a great sense of humor and sci-fi knowledge.) The class is really interactive and runs as half seminar\/half lecture many days. Since the class attracts such a diverse array of students, discussions were really wonderful.I took this class on a whim, and it was easily one of my favorite classes over my collegiate career. Give it a go! You won't regret it. (But it is a lot of reading and writing, yo, so make sure you balance out your schedule.)",
    "I think the material in this course is very important, and that everyone could TRULY benefit from being well-informed about disability. And having seminar with Karen is definitely a quirky experience. If you are interested in the subject, or think you could benefit from a more enlightened attitude"
