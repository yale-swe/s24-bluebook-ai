    "Question 9. Additional field and laboratory work would be very useful to visualize the concepts exposed in the lectures.",
    "I would like to preface my responses by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the content of this class, and find Graeme Berlyn to be a remarkable resource and source of knowledge. I think that there are a few changes that could help the course become more effective in what it is trying to accomplish, and attract more students to what in my opinion should be a much more popular course at a school of forestry with embarrassingly slim course selection in botanical nature. All comments are intended to be constructive.#2. Prof. Berlyn was very gracious in the responses and clarifications he provided, although I know our incessant questioning slowed the pace of the course from what he had originally intended and outlined in the syllabus. Part of the reason for so many questions was the lack of a strong base of knowledge in the jargon of the discipline prior to this course. As there are no prerequisites for this course, please remember that you are teaching to the lowest common denominator and be careful in assuming basic understanding of the concepts and terminology. I found that the professors' explanations were much more helpful and clarifying when he diverged from the class notes and provided more contextual and anecdotal responses.#3. There were few out of class assignments. I feel like there are so many resources applicable to the content covered in this course in Greeley and the greenhouse that the course would be much more engaging if these were brought into the curriculum more. I know that other courses, aka the methodology course, make more use of such resources, but it would have been interesting to maybe undertake an experimental project as a class. I was more interested in doing a project than writing a paper at the beginning of class, but didn't have a good enough grasp on what the possibilities were to make this feasible. Perhaps the option of an experiment in lieu of a final paper would be more appealing if it were a group experiment and the students could consult with the professor to design and carry out a project.#5. See response to #2.#6. I felt that some of the material could have been consolidated. Too many classes or slides dealing with the same subject matter got to be confusing because the lectures weren't clearly outlined and the slides weren't labeled on the powerpoints, so many of the concepts began to blur together even though they made sense at the time of presentation. I would recommend presenting an outline at the beginning of course lectures (as was sometimes done) to give a clear idea of the content that would be covered not only for our understanding but also to make things clearer when reflecting back over the notes. Also, I appreciate the use of powerpoint (as I understand this wasn't always used in past courses) and the color slides certainly helped- perhaps in the future labels for each slide could be applied so that when studying, we would recall better what the slide is of. Also, many of the slides were made by Prof. Berlyn and no doubt still exist in Greeley somewhere. Given the small class size, it would be fun to have one of the classes as a lab and look at the slides under the scope rather than on a powerpoint.",
    "We could have spent more time doing hands-on learning, perhaps in weekly lab sessions. There is an excellent set of microscopes and slides that I was not even aware existed until a few weeks before the semester finished. Looking through the microscope and seeing the sliced wood samples in the lab gave me a sense of scale and a much more detailed picture of the wood structures we learned of in class. I imagine that similar resources exist for other plant structures, i.e. leaves, roots, flowers. We also could have taken advantage of the resources right around the building--the trees and other vascular plants of the botanical garden."

    "The knowledge and expertise of the instructor. His ability of teaching in many different levels of depth on the topic, and integrating numerous sources of data.",
    "Learning from Graeme the anatomy of trees allowed me to piece together the living organism from a cellular level.",
    "Prof. Berlyn's tangents and Brents out of class lab sessions. I think these two elements could be expanded upon to drastically improve the class. I would strongly advocate having more classes devoted to hands on sessions in the wood lab, given the intimate size.",
    "Prof. Berlyn's encyclopedic knowledge of plant anatomy and physiology. He could answer virtually any question, was open to questions during and after class, and was able to provide an extensive reading list.I also enjoyed his engaging attitude and the perspective he provided on the development of research in plant science over the last several decades."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "The classroom could be updated.",
    "Presentation of materials made the subject matter difficult to process at times. It was often hard to make out the sketches and figures from the projector slides, and if it would be too much work i think replacing hand sketches with actual photos or microscope images would be more informative (intending no offense to Prof. Berlyn's artistic abilities). Also, it is extremely difficult to read over class notes when they are 93 pages of projector photocopies- perhaps in the future, a TA could type these up into a more manageable format?",
    "The organization of the semester and of lectures could be improved:We reached the end of the semester without getting to the section of the course on roots. I don't believe this was part of the design of the course, so pacing could clearly be improved in this respect. It should not be the student's responsibility to study roots independently in a course on plant structure, function, and development.With respect to the organization of lectures, the professor could spend time providing the big-picture context of each topic. He often discussed a plant structure without giving a sense of scale or relation in space to other structures already discussed.The readings could be made more manageable by creating a shorter list of required texts that give the general overview (including key terms). As it was the reading list contained more than I could read at any pace slow enough to take notes on or absorb. Because of this it was necessary to pick and choose from the readings, yet as a student I am less qualified than the professor to choose the most important readings.The professor might also define key terms and be sure that we have seen the words in print or on the board before using them in lectures. Not doing so made it difficult for me to take notes (not knowing how to spell a word) and made it necessary to ask to have terms defined during lecture, which interfered with the presentation of the material.The material on the course website was often difficult to read because of poor scanning and often seemed to be an unsequenced compilation of material from various studies with little to hold it together conceptually. Segments of it were often repeated in different documents and files were often not named appropriately."

Still, Ifeel like much of the information covered in the course could have been just as easily obtained from readings and text books and the internet- for this, I advocate for a more hands on, lab based approach to the subject matter."

The avid participation of students in this small course really helped me improve my own understanding of the material and I think helped stimulate participation from those of us who wouldn't have spoken up otherwise."
