    "I love to study German do I would recommend this class to anyone who asked for a recommendation. Truly a fabulous way to be introduced to the language and I can't wait for the next semester.",
    "A great way to begin learning German. Fun, engaging, and never overwhelming. The final project isn't bad at all if you don't procrastinate.",
    "It's tough but worth it. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend the course to another student. German is a beautiful language and Germany has amazing culture. The course is well paced and I felt like I learned a lot while enjoying the learning, which I think is really important.",
    "German is a great language to learn, and the German program is structured more easily than, say, the French one. I would recommend taking it.",
    "This course is most challenging during the first few weeks as it is conducted only in German. However, the workload is not overwhelming and the class is enjoyable.",
    "Would definitely recommend the course! Very interesting culture and language, and opens up wonderful study abroad opportunities!",
    "A must class if you wish to understand the German language and to build your more advance language skills on.",
    "The workload of a college language was surprising at first -- homework all the time, no English allowed in class -- but after acclimating, I found the class more than bearable."
