   "comments": [
    "Great class -- take it. But, do try not to fall behind on the readings or the final will be very unpleasant. Otherwise, it's fine.",
    "Take this course! Eitan Hersh is an awesome lecturer! The course is a little all over the place, but you'll learn a lot. If you are opting to write a final paper instead of taking the final exam, you will not have to legitimately read any of the readings, which drastically lessens the workload for this class.",
    "PLSC 229 is a very interesting examination of how election rules and regulations as well as the environment in which campaigns operate affect the strategic actions taken by candidates and political parties. Professor Hersh does a great job of explaining the concepts the govern elections. The readings are interesting and the work isn't too hard. The two papers and finals are a bit weird in their ambiguity. I'd say take it if you find campaigns interesting and want to understand the political science literature behind how campaigns operate. This is not a class for just people who are interested in elections but definitely for those that want to understand the literature and be able to take advantage of professor hersh's knowledge. The class is not a gut.",
    "Yes- but it is not an easy class to blow off by any means. The most will be gained if the reading is all done, and do not save it for the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Hersh is wonderful, and a great lecturer, and the reading are mostly interesting, and class is always interesting.",
    "A very good course! Don't be worried about not having a background in elections or campaigns. Some of the students in this class will have been campaign managers since they were 5 but don't let it scare you. Professor Hersh loves questions and has good office hours (so use them!!). That being said, you should probably have a desire to take a substantial but not unreasonably rigorous political science course. Be prepared to read Supreme Court decisions and some pretty dense political science writing with complicated statistical graphs. Professor Hersh and your TA will do their best to explain anything that confuses you, and a lot of the time, unless you have a familiarity with statistical analysis, that will be the various graphs. Honestly, I was surprised how much math there was in this course, but literally the only thing you actually need to know by the end of the semester is how to interpret a regression table (it's not hard!). The workload is very manageable, and Professor Hersh is THE MAN. If you can't take this class, take another one of his classes. He does an exceptional job of concealing his partisan inclinations throughout the class - I still don't really know whether he's conservative or liberal!",
    "Yes, it's a great class. You learn a lot and do a fair\/manageable amount of work.",
    "Definitely recommend, but not as a first introduction to political science. There is a lot of reading and if you don't go in with a basic understanding of the concepts, it can get difficult.",
    "Engaging class with a great teacher. The only weaknesses are that there's so much reading week to week that it was difficult to do all of it, which became problematic when the final rolled around. Otherwise, a fascinating and informative experience.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It looks fantastic on paper (or maybe not, but I am naturally interested in electoral politics), but it is not what you think it is. Weekly readings consist of numerous academic papers that are filled to the brim with data. Assigning the articles themselves was unnecessary as Hersh himself summarizes the key takeaways in the lectures. I will concede that Prof Hersh is an excellent and engaging lecturer, but the incoherent structure of the course (nothing really sticks together, and it is hard to get a clear picture with so many conflicting findings and results from the readings) weakens the course and his teaching as a whole. This year, there were weekly reading responses, two short papers, and a final. The reading responses and short papers were very manageable as Prof Hersh frontloaded the two papers. However, I found the final to be unreasonably tedious: 15 short answer questions consisting of at least 2-3 paragraphs. Studying for this final entailed of going over at least a thousand pages of dense academic readings. Unless you are truly invested and interested in the course topic, I would shop other options.",
    "Definitely a solid class. Strikes a good balance between being accessible to people unfamiliar with U.S. politics and being engaging for people who wake up every morning and read Politico. Hersh is a good professor - approachable, engaging. The workload is totally manageable. Also a lecture that seeks some seminar-style engagement, so be prepared for that (and do the readings!)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to broaden their perception of American politics. Election rules and their effects of campaign strategy ended up being much more complex and interesting than I had initially thought. Workload is relatively light, with a few reading assignments and a weekly forum post each week. It is really easy to slack off and not do the readings, but that both detracts from the experience of the course and will come back to bite you on the final.",
    "Definitely recommend this if you're looking for a good poli class. Because it's elections there's a lot of ddata and so graphs are in at least 1 of the readings each week. Don't be discouraged - all will be explained in section.",
    "Again, take it if you are interested in material, but otherwise, you would be very disappointed. If you have political passions, or are interested in election law, go for it. Not a ground breaking course by any means.",
    "I would only take this class if the subject is your thing. There are many really long, really dry readings. You could probably get by without reading them, but if you want to well in the class you should plan on reading everything or at least understanding what is gone over in lecture. Professor Hersh is excellent though; he is very passionate about the material and super knowledgeable.",
    "I loved the content of the course and Professor Hersh's lectures. It's a great class to gain foundational knowledge of election law. I think that the workload could be lightened. Definitely not a class you want to take lightly.",
    "This course focuses on campaign strategy and the way in which it is impacted by laws and political norms. This course relies on political science papers and court cases to examine these strategies, and there is also an additional focus on the statistics used to prove these arguments. I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in campaign strategy, especially those with a background or interest in statistics.",
    "If you enjoy studying court cases and election rules, then I would recommend this class. If you aren't really that interested in this, you might be bored.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 229 01 to students who are interested in elections, campaigns, and domestic politics in present time. I didn't realize that I preferred international politics more than domestic politics, so the readings were extremely hard to get through.",
    "The course covers its topic very well and offers interesting insights into how campaigns. Prof. Hersh is really knowledgeable and charismatic, and he knows his stuff. If you're interested in the topic, I would strongly recommend this class. That being said, the readings can be very long and tedious, and it's hard to know what you're supposed to take away from them, especially when they're really long. Some readings have sections full of statistical methodology, and I wasn't sure how much I was expected to understand until later on in the semester (turns out not too much). Every Sunday you have to do postings on Classes V2 about the readings which is sort of annoying and not helpful to the class. The essays are strange in that they require no sources, so basically they're testing your ability to predict outcomes solely based on your own reasoning. Average grades were high B's and low A's so not too bad. The final has a few ridiculous questions that I feel had little to do with the class content. Otherwise, it's pretty straight forward but hard nonetheless. Definitely KNOW the readings and take notes as you read them. Don't fall behind or you'll be in a world of hurt. Overall the class is great but strange, and you probably won't get an A. You'll learn a lot though.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, especially if they take it during an election cycle.",
    "Great course if you're interested in subject matter. Otherwise it can be a little dry sometimes. Hersh is a great, energetic professor who has great lectures.",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone who already knows a significant amount about American politics.",
    "It's a new way to look at politics and elections! We can scientifically measure the effects of public policy, and with that, we can actually take steps to solve major problems in current policy. After all, many problems are caused by a simple lack of information about the effects of said policies. So yeah, this is the best. I would recommend it on that basis. It's a new way of looking at electoral and political systems.",
    "Good comprehensive overview of various of election-related topics; SCOTUS readings were always interesting; managed to engagingly tie in many current events"
