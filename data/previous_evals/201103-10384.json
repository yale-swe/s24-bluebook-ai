    "MBIO 686 is taught by various professors, each week consisting of a lecture and article discussion section. The course covers various topics regarding bacteria and pathogenesis and I would recommend this course to those who are interested in this field.",
    "I would tell him or her that the class provides an overview of some major topics in Microbiology, especially those that researchers at Yale study. It is especially helpful for 1st or 2nd year students, those hoping to learn more about the field, or those wanting an introduction to the research of Microbiology PIs at Yale (very helpful for picking rotations). I would definitely recommend it; the class is interesting and informative.",

    "I enjoyed how we focused on reading papers and analysis, rather than memorizing information. These are the skills which we really need to develop at this point.",
    "As I mentioned previously, the course provides a good introduction to microbiology research, as well as a survey of research at Yale. I'm not sure how useful it will be for my eventual thesis topic, but it is definitely a helpful introduction for 1st and 2nd year students."
