    "Yeah it is really low stress but also interesting.",
    "Reading Poetry for Craft is a wonderful class. It's a low-pressure but really enlightening exploration of trends in contemporary poetry from the 1950s to the present, with a group of students who may not necessarily be English majors or experienced poets, but who nonetheless bring really interesting and thoughtful perspectives to class. If you've ever thought about trying to write poetry but been intimidated by the formidable talent on campus, this is the supportive, compassionate but rigorous environment for you.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Take this course with Edgar if you can. This was genuinely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The seminar atmosphere was really special--everyone was so invested in the poetry of their peers, volunteering helpful comments and exhibiting deep care for one another's work. Edgar's syllabus tracks the development of contemporary American poetry, from Confessional to Imagist to Cubist. I appreciated the diversity of the syllabus, especially the inclusion of many poets of color and voices from outside the \"canon.\" The readings were a joy--challenging, inspiring, and moving work. I grew so much as both a reader and writer of poetry; I became more aware of my creative process--how to articulate, cultivate, and challenge it, in a very organic way. I highly suggest meeting with Edgar to discuss your poetry individually; he offers great insights!",
    "This was the perfect senior year course (particularly Credit\/D). I feel totally enriched by taking it, and I know it will affect the way I look at language for the rest of my life. We wrote one poem a week and read 10ish poems a week max so the workload is totally doable. Also, take with Edgar Garcia if you can--he's wonderful!",
    "I developed personally, artistically, and intellectually in this class. It gave me the flexibility to explore my intellectual interests (bring in my thoughts from conversations, other classes, my life) while providing the perfect structure needed in order to develop my craftsmanship. My poetry has vastly improved, and I've even made personal changes in my life because of the insights gained from this class. Everyone at Yale should take it!!!",
    "This course was an introduction into 20th century poetry. It helped bourgeoning poets contextualizing and investigate the differing styles\/craft\/forms of modern and contemporary western poetry. The course encouraged poetic growth through intense worshipping, well curated course readings, and essay writing.",
    "if you like poetry or are even slightly interested in writing.. TAKE IT!",
    "ENGL 135 is an introduction to writing modern poetry. It's a little unstructured but a pretty fun class that will expose you to poetry from around 1940ish to today.",
    "Reading Poetry for Craft is a class in which students read and discuss works ranging from the early twentieth century (Confessional poetry, the Imagistes, the New York School, etc.) up to the present. The most important component of the course, however, lies in crafting one's own poetry, often responding to or incorporating elements of each week's readings. I think this is one the best ways to study poetry; by becoming invested in different literary movements as a creator, one gains a more authentic understanding of the sentiments and motives surrounding those movements."
