    "Best class I have taken so far at Yale. I have gained immensely from this course. I would take it again and again if I was allowed.",
    "Too much of the course was on the professor's personal theory (aka humans are chimps so all behavior can be directly linked between the 2 species) and not nearly enough was on actual population issues, like immigration, urbanization, food crises, etc etc. It was not a graduate level course and should not have been offered as such.",
    "This class was very poorly taught and disorganized. Despite having lengthy verbatim notes, the professor still managed to meander, re-tell pieces repeatedly, and veer the course off pace. I was very disappointed at the almost total neglect of environmental issues associated with population growth, which was my primary reason for taking the class; the one day that we spent on the topic the professor used to present evidence for increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. No one at Yale needs to be convinced of this. This was one prime example of a pattern of belaboring basic points and neglecting the larger, more challenging, and more interesting issues."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "I think it could do with better organization of material.",
    "More modern material. The vast majority of the articles were at least 15 years old and it would have been interesting to see some of the older case studies updated, like the Bangladesh case. It's weird to have so much material be significantly older than me (I'm 23), particularly in a class where so many topics are ongoing and past successes may have become failures and vice versa. Leaving things at the mid-90s assessment is ridiculous.Further, cut out the ape stuff. That was clearly a pet theory and should have been presented with much more qualifications instead of as gospel. Evolutionary psychology needs much better support than that to be appropriate for a (theoretically) graduate school course. It took up valuable time and was inappropriate by normal standards of psychology and primatology - no one talks like that about humans any more.Also, there are lots of interesting professors who could be brought in as guest speakers on some ofthis stuff. I was disappointed that, although Yale professors were mentioned as authors of studies, they weren't ever brought in to speak.Finally, the way the professor kept calling on non-Caucasian students to explain \"their culture\" was inappropriate and it made me extremely uncomfortable. Students could volunteer to speak about something if it seemed relevant to their own experiences but calling on students to explain long-outdated practices of a country they may or may not be from is extremely insensitive. I don't think he meant any harm by it but it was really inappropriate and would happen at least twice a class.",
    "I was often uncomfortable with the way the professor went about talking about subject matter by using personal stories and experiences. I don't think personal commentary is necessary, the professor should stick more strictly to the material.The class also seemed to be disorganized at times, often running overtime and still not completing the lesson for the day.",
    "The class, as taught now, just isn't a graduate level course. It's cross listed with MCDB, and is a sophomore level undergraduate class. The concepts that Professor Wyman raised, and the issues that he discussed, were interesting and important issues--but were mostly issues that graduate students would already be familiar with.It's also really not an environmental class. I understand that human population growth has vital impacts on the environment, but we barely discussed this aspect of human population growth (which is why I took the class). There were essentially two lectures on the environment: The first covered the basic of CO2 increase and global warming, and the second was essentially a wrap-up of the entire semester.As such, though the course is valuable to some people, I don't think it should be cross-listed with FES again, unless some changes are made to the difficulty of the course and the subject matter.",
    "The lectures sometimes had a lot of detail, making it hard for me to extract the main points out of the lecture. But having the lectures available later definitely helped.",
    "The professor's conduct during this class was apalling. I have never felt so disrespected as I have in Prof. Wyman's class. He was rudely dismissive of students that challenged any of his points (and his particular use of data and the sweeping conclusions he drew certainly left the door open for challenges). He spoke derisively about students in our class behind their backs to a student discussion session. I felt personally disrespected by the way he responded to my analysis in class, to the point that I fear retribution in his grading.He wants to tell a particular story in a particular way, and anyone who attempts to think critically about that story is rudely brushed aside. He also insisted on belaboring very basic points, and would silence students that tried to summarize the issue and move discussion along to the more pertinent issues. Finally, he made several problematic and\/or offensive statements. For instance, during one discussion session, he told us about how he once \"lived in the ghetto\" and took it upon himself to \"teach those little black children how to speak proper English\" and how he would then return to his white friends and \"talk black to them and they really got a kick out of that.\"The University needs to think long and hard about whether they really support this kind of behavior."
