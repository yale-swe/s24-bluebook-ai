    "This class is a fabulous survey of French literature that is relevant to the DS canon. I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in French who has taken DS, as it is a great way to see how the same influences that are carried forward in the literature of DS also apply to formative French works. Professor Duval is an absolutely fascinating and wonderful professor; if you liked DS, you will highly enjoy this course.",
    "I highly reccommend this course to all DSers with a flair for French. The readings are straightforward and beautiful. Because the class is so small, it forces you to read with a precision and a care which you might not find in other DS courses. Professor Duval is the most conscientious and brilliant instructor you could ask for in such a course. The name of the course doesn't really do it justice, in my opinion. The course is not about picking out little similarities between works from the DS syllabus and the French canon, no, it's an exploration of French Literature in its own right.",
    "If you want to read some great French literature and want to learn to present and talk about literary analysis with of the best professors at Yale, take this class."
