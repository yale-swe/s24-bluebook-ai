   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend L1 Spanish (especially with Maripaz). In-class exercises are entirely speaking-focused, with homework concentrating more on listening and writing. Classes are small, interesting and fast-paced, and my Spanish has improved tremendously.",
    "I highly recommend that anyone who wants to start a new language take Spanish. The content is very well taught, the homework load is manageable, and the language is fun.",
    "Great class. Fast pace, lots of vocabulary. Professor Maripaz is the best because she leaves no stone unturned and there are no surprises. She is fair, concise, and diligent. You simply cannot ask for more in a language instructor.",
    "Spanish 110 is a difficult, time-consuming class which requires a lot of studying, but is ultimately worth it, as it gives you an excellent foundation to build upon your Spanish skills. I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn (or re-learn) Spanish.",
    "This class teaches you the basics of Spanish",
    "Spanish is pretty easy for a native English speaker. We have a lot of words that are spelled and pronounced similarly. Some of the grammar is frustrating but manageable. Take this course if you don't have a language you prefer to learn. I was dreading my foreign language requirement and this class turned out to be my favorite class this semester.",
    "Great class. Expect to work pretty hard, but it is all super rewarding.",
    "Highly recommend!"
