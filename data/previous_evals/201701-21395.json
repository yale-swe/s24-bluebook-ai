    "That there are actually a lot of poets from before 1800 who offer a different life perspective than the usual ones I had become accustomed to in other English classes. I also improved my writing skills greatly.",
    "Practically, I'd never really gotten the point of critical essays (in theory, sure, but I'd almost never felt I'd gained anything from them) until I took this class. Beyond that, I see all canons more critically than I did before this course, and I always came away from our discussions feeling like I had some insight into whatever poem or subject we were looking at that I hadn't had before."

   "comments": [
    "The best thing about this course is the open conversations about everything ranging from the privileges writers enjoyed because of their socioeconomic status, their race, their gender etc to what this means for our academic syllabus as undergraduate students at Yale. The class environment was also not intimidating at all and extremely friendly and it allowed us to express our passion for different facets of the coursework during class discussion. There was a lot of guidance on what was expected of us in the assignments (2 papers and an Annotated Bibliography). This meant I had more of an idea what to do in the class and in the assignments in order to do well in the course, something that I often have a hard time in Yale classes.",
    "This was my favorite academic class I've taken at Yale. As far as strengths, Professor Nicholson was always incredibly engaged with our ideas, and I enjoyed how flexible the lessons were (how if a subject was interesting and relevant enough to the course themes, we would discuss it). As far as weaknesses, Professor Nicholson said at the beginning of the class that, given the nature of the class, there will always be other writers who could have been on the syllabus. I would have loved a bit of a sense of what was out there that we weren't reading.",
    "This course is phenomenal. The workload was very high but very rewarding. We read a lot of literary criticism, a facet of the syllabus\/plan that I thought I would hate, but I actually wish that had been a part of my Yale English experience a lot sooner than senior spring. (Only the really well written essays, though! We were pretty agreed as a class that the poems were the primary focus and that the essays were supplementary, for providing a way in sometimes or a surface for our discussion, so it was somewhat at each persons discretion to decide if an essay was good\/engaging enough to read the whole thing closely. That being said, perhaps a standard one good essay per poet and only a second one if both essays are good and different enough from each other.) The course is listed as a junior seminar and Prof. Nicholson was clearly quite intentional about designing it as such. Honestly, I think people who are pretty sure theyre going to major in English should sooner rather than later take a course designed with the kind of student-improvement\/-development oriented assignments and philosophy that Prof. Nicholson put together. We did an annotated bibliography project and abstracts and peer-editing writing workshops, which might sound like a bit of a pain but do legitimately get you thinking in important ways that I felt like the English major otherwise never directly taught or incentivized."

    "I highly recommend it. Class time is fun and engaging without being stressful. There was a lot of opportunity to express views whether they were fully formed and sophisticated or just attempts at understanding the work. Ms Nicholson is a great discussion leader. She is amazing for many reasons but especially because she is able to listen to your perspective and help you and your classmates make sense of it when needed. Assignments (2 essays and one annotated bibliography) are challenging but clear instructions are given on how to go about them. My writing improved a lot. Readings are amazing. This is a body of work you will likely not find in your entire time at Yale. As a senior English major, it was beautiful discovering the work of less known and mostly less privileged authors.Discussions are honest and one can address these issues of privilege in the body of work and in present day academia. It is also one of those classes where both the professor and the classmates care about the work you are doing outside of class if you would like to share with them.",
    "Absolutely take this class, or another class with Professor Nicholson. The discussions were engaging and challenging, the workload sizable but rewarding, and the degree to which she engages with her students' ideas is just amazing.",
    "Absolutely! For starters, Prof. Nicholson is the best teacher in the English Department. She was super deliberate about designing this course as a junior seminar to facilitate English student development (writing improvement, critical engagement, etc.). On top of that, the actual poets we read were SO AWESOME! And you're never going to find most of them on another syllabus. We were constantly reevaluating the course as we went, taking stock of terms like \"minor\" and \"major,\" comparing the various moves that \"minor\" poets have to make depending on what has somehow classified them as \"minor\" in the first place, in the course of history, in their own imaginations. Oh and we also went to the Reinecke a couple times and looked at some of the original manuscripts of poems we had been reading, some of which had been recovered and archived and discovered in WILD ways (pulled off burning rubbish heaps, found by chance after already having been saved and stored, etc.). Excellent class take it! (Also it's a pre-1800, but I guess that's not really a thing anymore?)"
