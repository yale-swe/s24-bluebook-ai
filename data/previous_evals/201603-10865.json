   "comments": [
    "My speaking and listening skills definitely improved. As far as grammar, I had seen all the L3 grammar in high school, so this class basically reinforced that knowledge for me. I also did much more reading in this class than any previous French class, which proved challenging but also, sometimes, rewarding.",
    "There was a pretty big focus on grammar and simple, somewhat old French literature and film. We moved slowly through real French materials in order to understand them completely.",
    "This class is very grammar intensive. It covers the present tense, how to differentiate the imparfait and pass compos, the future tense, the imperative and the subjunctive, along with many small grammar details like the possessive pronouns and articles. The course also focuses on vocabulary, with 30-60 new words tested on each exam. Three books are read: \"Le Petit Nicolas,\" \"L'tranger,\" and \"M. Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran.\" All three are thoroughly discussed and analyzed for their different insights and styles.",
    "French 130 solidified the concepts learnt in F110 and 120. We spent most of the class reading a few books in French which was great practice. Movies were helpful as well if more difficult to understand.",
    "This is the most French I've ever learned! Very effective program!!",
    "I was able to further my understanding both of the French language and of French literature and film.",
    "I learned basic French grammar, and also a way of analyzing literature"

   "comments": [
    "The class is really rigorous - seriously. French was the most work-intensive class for me this semester, especially because it meets every day and there's a lot of homework each night. That was new for me (high school French is very different than Yale French), but ultimately is probably a positive. The course also exposes us to well-known French literature, so it's good to become more aware in that respect. A lot of the exercises common to all L3 classes (i.e. homework worksheets and tests) are ridiculous. Some of the audio grammar programs are poorly made, and unfortunately, the L3 director seems to be uninterested in reforming the course at all, ever. Some of the parts of the unit tests are also ridiculous - there are many examples of parts of tests in the class that simply don't make sense, like memorizing a vocab list and then drawing upon that list in a fast-paced listening section (which is completely disconnected from how French works conversationally - you don't just draw upon some finite list of words). I hope that the leaders of the L3 program take a good, hard look at the usefulness of some of the exam parts and actually listen to the feedback both students and instructors have overwhelmingly been providing. Maybe there's a bit of arrogance to some French faculty, but theory and practice are very different things, and it would serve them well to recognize that.",
    "There is a lot of work in this course. An hour or so of homework every night and a test every week or so. The tests ask for a lot of minutia about the books we've read, which is my only major complaint. That being said, my French has dramatically improved from taking this course and my professor was engaging and good at her job.",
    "Since this course meets every day, students practice and engage with the language every day and really learn French. French 130 creates a solid grammar base through a thorough review of fundamental grammatical structures that allow the students to carry a full conversation or write a short essay. Recordings of the readings are very helpful and facilitate reading comprehension. The course's weakness is that it expects students to come into the course already knowing the grammar rules. There is no textbook, only a workbook with exercises for students to do at home with little or no explanation of how to do it. The recordings are sometimes too slow, making students waste time while they wait for the following exercise.",
    "The course is a good survey of basic grammatical and speaking concepts. I think the reading assignments were of reasonable length. The homework exercises were not so great. Some of the exercises felt repetitive and didn't help me learn, while others were too difficult and forced me to wait for the answers. The fact that the length of the homework audio programs varied so greatly each night was also a big problem in planning for work. I wish the audio programs gave answers in such a way such that pauses were not built into the audio file (so we could pause and go as needed). That would speed things up a bit. I also wish the course materials included grammar references rather than our teacher having to concoct them ad hoc as necessary. The concept on the homework should be discussed in class BEFORE it is drilled at home.",
    "The in-class aspects of the course was good, but some of the listening portions of the homework weren't very helpful. I often felt like I learned more from the supplemental material our TF provided us with. I know the listening material and course packet has been around for a while and would take a lot of work to update, but there were enough times when I found in frustrating or pointless that it may soon be worth the effort. That being said, I appreciated the use of novels and films, which improved my comprehension. (Not sure why we read M. Ibrahim before L'Etranger, though. L'Etranger seemed like a much more difficult read, especially after Le Petit Nicolas). Also, the feedback on the oral portions of tests was not always clearly explained, and since it wasn't graded by my TF there was nowhere I could go to ask questions. Probably the biggest weakness is that this course didn't do much to improve my speaking.",
    "Very strong.",
    "Weaknesses: While my professor gave us lots of comprehensive worksheets and concise, typed up explanations, other classes did not receive this, which I think is very beneficial. Also, I found the movies and audios to be very outdated, which sometimes caused them not to be taken seriously.",
    "I really liked how learning the French language was presented in a cultural context (via literature, film, etc.). I also liked the conversation and discussion elements of the class - it helped me solidify my knowledge of the language. I did not like the age of a lot of the materials we used. While they were fine resources, I would have liked to have an understanding of culture in France today (and not 30 years ago).",
    "The course was a good introduction to French grammar, however I'd recommend to make it more efficient - cutting back on the audio grammar exercises, which took a lot of time but weren't necessarily the most efficient\/effective methods of learning."

    "If you love French, I recommend it. If you want a language credit, there are much easier classes out there. If you okay with French and want to learn more, it'd fine as long as you recognize what the class will entail.",
    "Yes, I feel like I learned a lot and can communicate more effectively.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who want to solidify their grammar and vocabulary skills. Readings are fun and straightforward, teachers are helpful, and the workload is not unbearable.",
    "You're probably taking French 130 because you have to, but it's genuinely a lot of fun if you let it be and have a good class\/prof. The books are all good (reading L'tranger in French is especially exciting if you're into that kind of thing) and Jules et Jim is pretty rich for analysis. The audio program homework sure gets to be a pain, but you know what you're in for.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to put in the time necessary to become fluent",
    "Yes!",
    "If someone is looking to further his\/her understanding of the language, I highly recommend this course.",
    "I'd recommend it if you need to learn French! However, it is definitely not a course I'd take for fun."
