   "comments": [
    "A reading seminar about classic or groundbreaking work on Southeast Asia. Heavy on anthropology but with a considerable amount of history. Although cross-listed, the class is full of graduate students and the work is comparable to that in other graduate classes. Undergraduates without a background in Southeast Asia might not find the class easy.",
    "I would recommend it to someone serious about SE Asia, but not to the casual student who thinks it might be interesting to take an anthropology course. Some of the material is extremely dry, and only one who wants to understand SE Asia will stick with some of it.",
    "Will certainly recommend the course to other students.Reason: provides a holistic educational experience in terms of course content and academic guidance. offers an opportunity to meet students from a variety of disciplines who enriches discussions in different ways.",
    "I would say that, this course explores the dynamics of the \"politics of culture\" from a variety of methodological angles. I think the only disclaimer I would put out is that it would probably be advantageous and helpful if the student had previous experience in anthropology, but that is not necessarily required.I would recommend it in a heart beat and hope it's taught again in the future!"

   "comments": [
    "I was able to get a glimpse of some of the prolific SE Asianist writers, and some of their work. I feel that my own projects within the course, set up with the professor, were able to fill in some major gaps in knowledge I have about the Region.",
    "Instructor\/Course ushered me into the field of Southeast Asian studies (have never taken a class on SEA at Yale before this); has set me thinking about how to bring new intellectual resources to bear on my dissertation on modern Chinese literary studies in Southeast Asia."
