    "I learned a lot about the intricacies of healthcare in the United States and how we have one of the most inefficient systems among developed worlds.",
    "This course helped me appreciate the history behind the politics and economics of healthcare in a way I hadn't previously.",
    "How to think critically about the healthcare system in the US",
    "I learned the basics of the US health care system. I believe that I can now engage in meaningful conversations about health politics.`",
    "Learned a lot about the U.S. healthcare system.",
    "It teaches you the fundamentals of past and present phenomena and issues in American healthcare.",
    "This class provides an excellent overview of how the US Healthcare system works. As someone who knew very little about it going in, I feel like a have a very solid understanding of how it works, the history behind it. and how it came to be what it is today. Now, after taking the class, I have a better understanding of what the problems are, what causes them, and why they are hard to fix, which is relevant to everyone, reguardless of major and field of study.",
    "I learned about the waves of progressivism and conservatism that have swept the medical profession from the late 1800s to the 2000s, as well as about the wide variety of stakeholder interests and institutional structures that have shaped health insurance legislation over time."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Swensen is clearly educated on the topic, however incredibly, incredibly, to some degree almost laughably biased when presenting information. From the first day of class I knew I was in for a liberal perspective and only a liberal perspective on the topic. The conservative side of the healthcare debate was almost always presented with a smirky laugh or failure to explain reasoning. As a conservative myself, this definitely lessened my enjoyment of the course as I was hoping to at least see both sides of the debate, regardless of whether I agree with it or not. Jokes about the Bush family, Trump, and other Republican officials occurred almost every class, hidden between the praise for Obama and the liberal healthcare officials.",
    "I think this course would better function as a seminar. The readings were engaging, yet we did not discuss them at significant depth in class. The lectures should be revised before the next time the course is taught to reflect updates in the last couple years and better organize the principal themes.",
    "Central ideas were apparent and easily accessible",
    "Strengths - provided a good overview of the US health care system Weaknesses - very poorly taught, lectures were dry and excessively long, many of my classmates skipped class, very little feedback or guidance from Professor Swenson or the TA on the final paper",
    "This class is about a very interesting topic, and it's really important to have a firm understanding of this material. That being said, the material is often presented in a pretty disorganized manner. The professor attempts to balance historical narratives with present day issues, but it's often pretty difficult to follow. Part of the problem is the material itself; the healthcare industry and its numerous issues are very intricate. However, it definitely does not help when the professor comes to class and does not know what some of his own slides are talking about.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it teaches you a lot of relevant things about the current U.S. healthcare system, as well as the historic roots of it. However, one way it could be improved is presenting the material in a more coherent manner. The course had a lot of good material, but it felt a little all over the place.",
    "I wish the lectures were more lively, but otherwise the material itself is interesting. It has all the fundamental information for all who are interested in American healthcare.",
    "This class was very well structured, allowing for a logical flow of information throughout the semester. We started with the basics, and later applied them to current healthcare policy and legislation. Additionally, this class was presented unbiasley, allowing students to form their own opinions, which is often a challenge in policy\/polysci classes.",
    "Strengths: great reading list, great TF Weaknesses: professor's preparation level and ability to relay material while in-class"

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. It is poorly organized and the material, while interesting in itself, was not presented in a way that facilitated understanding.",
    "If you are a liberal, take the course. If you are conservative, strap in your seatbelts for one of the most biased, partisan courses taught at Yale.",
    "Not a bad credit\/D\/fail option, but it is somewhat difficult to follow because the course is not especially organized. The material is very repetitive and it is difficult to know what to study.",
    "Take this course if you want to better understand what it means to be a physician or patient in America. I know there's another course, ECON 170, that overlaps and you should shop both to compare. Take this course if you like history and reading academic papers\/books in history, political science, public health, etc. Don't take this course if you rely on lectures. I would definitely take this course if it's organized as a seminar.",
    "Material in the course is very interesting although lectures were a bit dry.",
    "I think it's important for everyone to develop a basic understanding of the US health care system. This class will give you that. However I had a terrible experience and cannot recommend the class. Professor Swenson is a very dry lecturer. His lecture slides were long, repetitive, and frequently had typos or content that was directly contradictory. He also presented an extremely one-sided view of the health care debate (essentially, praising the ACA and making disparaging comments against its opponents). The workload is light - one midterm exam, one final exam, and one final paper (5 pages). Attending lecture is not necessary to do well on the exams, as everything can be gleaned from the lecture slides. I don't think I got much out of the course. I think I would have been able to develop a more comprehensive, nuanced perspective on US health care (and put one of my 36 Yale credits to better use) by reading the NYT, Washington Post, and the downloading the assigned readings on the PLSC 248 syllabus.",
    "The course is interesting but not particularly engaging. I enjoy working on my paper and the lectures cover relevant material, but they were often hard to follow and relatively disorganized. The class offers a pretty good introduction to the world of health care in America, but I had to do a lot of my own research to connect the points Professor Swenson made with the assigned readings.",
    "This course is a pretty standard Poli Sci course, but be warned that it is pretty dull at times. A lot of relevant and interesting information to learn and a good overview of the history, politics, and economics of the U.S. healthcare system; however, the information is not taught in the most engaging way.",
    "Not really worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who wants to know the basics of American healthcare policy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Not only was it an interesting class, but it helps provides a strong foundation for understanding the US Healthcare system. This is something that is relevant to everyone, whether from a healthcare consumer standpoint, a taxpayer standpoint, or a policy standpoint. Thus, it is crucial to have a strong inderstanding of what the US healthcare system is, and this class definitely provides that.",
    "This course is an interesting sketch of the politics and history behind healthcare legislation and delivery in the US over the past century or so. If you'd like to focus more in the details of today's healthcare system and its economic ins and outs, take econ 170 instead. If you're interested in the history of how today's system got that way, this course focuses more on that side of things. Professor Swenson is not very prepared as a lecturer, thoughhe reads off the slides, which he updates from previous years' slides at the last minute from poorly-cited source material. He frequently fails to remember why he inserted such-and-such a graph or what the graph says, and he is easily confused by numerical data. The lectures really rubbed me the wrong way, but if this course were offered as a seminar where students got to discuss the awesome reading list (as it used to be), then it would probably be pretty good!",
    "This course is overall okay, but there's nothing really special about it. Low workload- one midterm, one final, one short paper. Professor wasn't super engaging, but the readings and overall content were interesting. I definitely learned a lot about the history of healthcare, just not necessarily in the best way possible."
