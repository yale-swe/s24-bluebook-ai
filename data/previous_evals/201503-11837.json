   "comments": [
    "It is a course designed to introduce you to college level writing, but if you think you've had enough exposure to high level writing in high school, look into ENGL 120 instead. The quality of 114 really depends on your teacher.",
    "The class is a great one to take for an introduction to some background economic theory, and really good for learning to read. The work load is fairly heavy, though if one is ever really pushed I believe they can get away with skimming the readings as long as they are attentive and engaged in class, and give essays their due in terms of time commitment.",
    "I would say it is a very interesting look at economics and capitalism and would highly recommend it. It was very interesting and contained a lot of theoretical and current information about economic systems that would be useful to know.",
    "This section is called \"Much Ado about Capitalism\". It covers philosophy about capitalism\/socialism, capitalism's exploitation on labor, and capitalism's exploitation of the environment, among other things. This is a great introductory course to writing at Yale; Professor Kreiner is very thorough with his feedback on essays, which allows you to significantly improve your work by the time the second draft rolls around. Also, he's a really chill guy and it's a pleasure to be in any of his classes. There are four papers, one of them being an extensive research paper. However, there is a lot of flexibility on all of these papers and the subject you can choose to write about. I'm not sure if my writing has improved substantially, but I'm glad I took this course because of 1) the material, 2) the professor, and 3) getting exposure to the structure of Yale papers.",
    "Difficult but rewarding",
    "Take this class in your freshman year so that you will be a better writer for your other classes"
