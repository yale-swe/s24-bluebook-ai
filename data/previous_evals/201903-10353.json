   "comments": [
    "I learned about non-human primate phylogeny, as well as behavioral, social, and physical characteristics of primates. I also gained general knowledge on scientific processes such as making predictions and hypotheses in conjunction with contemporary primate research.",
    "Learned so much about primates and developed an appreciation for primate behavior and ecology!",
    "I learned a ton of different things about primates. How different primates behave\/why they do so, primate classification, etc... a whole bunch of stuff that is not at all useful unless I was going into the field",
    "I learned about primate behavior but I mostly learned how to apply scientific thinking to every aspect of learning.",
    "It was mostly memorization. I didn't feel like I developed skilled.",
    "I definitely learned more about primates and their different behaviors. I already had some background in the subject but I definitely learned more about the biological background of different concepts. Applying the knowledge to a visit to the zoo was incredible.",
    "I gained specific knowledge of primate ecology and behavior and also a general different perspective on learning.",
    "I learned a lot about primates.",
    "I learned a lot about evolution, using primates as a lens. I also learned a lot about the evolution of human behavior. Professor Fernandez-Duque also taught me a lot about the learning process in general and stress management.",
    "I learned first a foremost about science and primates. I also learned a lot not only about primates and primate interactions, but about human social theories. Now I can better understand and analyze how human interact, and why. I also learned a lot about reading scientific research papers, how to most efficiently study course material, and generally, how to make the most and learn the most from a science course at Yale.",
    "You learn a lot about how evolution shapes behavioral and visible traits of primates. You learn how the evolution of primates can be used to deeper our understanding of human evolution, as well.",
    "I learned a lot about primate taxonomy as well as how different sociological and biological lens can be used to examine primate behavior.",
    "I learned primates, primates, primates. This class covered primate phylogeny, social systems, mating, and the works. Through this, I learned how to apply what I learned in readings to answer short answer questions critically.",
    "Knowledge of different primate species and characteristics as well as why primates do what they do.",
    "I learned a great deal about the taxonomy and diversity of primates. I learned about their evolutionary history as well as general evolutionary theory from a sexual perspective, socioecological perspective, inclusive selection, etc. The course did a good job of covering the field of primate biology and developing my skills for thinking critically about the range of topics.",
    "This is a great introduction to the field of primatology and to primate behavior for those who are interested! It provides a good review of basic evolutionary biology for biology majors and a solid foundation for those who may not have taken college-level biology before. Additionally, students will learn to read scientific papers and think scientifically.",
    "During this class I learnt about the different species of Primates and the range of characteristics and traits that each have evolved over time. I also learnt a lot of key words to do with talking about Primates.",
    "I learned so much in this class! I learned how to identify which family a monkey species belongs to just from looking at it, and I learned a lot about evolutionary theory. Professor Fernandez-Duque studies the evolution of paternal care in owl monkeys, so much of the class focuses on the evolution of behavioral traits and specifically on how sexual selection functions as an evolutionary mechanism. This class was rooted in the primary literature and introduced me to a lot of foundational concepts for how behavior is a selected trait, including the socioecological model, which I had never heard of until taking this class, despite being and E&EB major. In E&EB, so often the focus is on the evolution of specific morphological traits and the evolution of behavior is seen as more wishy-washy, but in this class Prof F-D really refutes this by strictly adhering to evolutionary theory and being openly critical of papers which strayed too far into the realm of postulation.",
    "I learned helpful methods of collecting data and conducting scientific research. I also was made aware of how diverse the primate species is.",
    "We learned about differences between primate species (primarily in regards to behavior) and how the differences can be caused by different evolutionary factors.",
    "Knowledge of primates, how they behave, and some key evolutionary principles providing the backbone for modern primatology. Discussion of a few key species such as owl monkeys, titi monkeys, saki monkeys, gelada baboons, chimpanzees, and some lemurs, although the course provided an introduction into the various taxa of all primates (there's a lot of them). A large discussion about the socioecological model (tracing primate behavior to the surroundings of the primates) and the merits and drawbacks of this theory. A thrilling introduction into all these themes!",
    "Broad introduction to major clades of primates, skills in statistically analyzing ecological and behavioral studies of primates. Scientific critical thinking and evolutionary theory. Learning and test-taking strategies.",
    "We explored really interesting material that I had not ever been exposed to before. I have gained a lot of knowledge about primatology (e.g. how research is conducted) and primates themselves. Focus on data analysis towards the end as we delved deeper into scientific papers.",
    "I learnt about primate behaviour and ecology, including primate classification, mating systems, habitats, traits, etc. The class was a useful introduction to ways of thinking central to biological anthropology\/ evolutionary biology.",
    "Learned about primates (of course) and scientific terms and practices in general. Learned a new approach to academics",
    "I developed very little knowledge or skills beyond what I had already learned in high school biology. I gained additional knowledge in the history of primatology and some additional knowledge of primates. Otherwise, the course was not very useful in any way.",
    "Understanding primate behavior and ecology using an evolutionary lens.",
    "Lots of knowledge about Primate behavior and ecology. Good skills for analyzing scientific articles and sources. Understanding scientific hypothesis, predictions, and methods.",
    "Learned about behaviors of different primate species and what social and ecological factors affect the development of such behaviors.",
    "Some evolutionary biology and interpreting scientific data",
    "I learned a lot about how to think of evolutionary mechanisms like natural selection and sexual selection. It made me view behavior as an idea in a totally different way - as an evolved adaption. I also learned a lot about meditation and how important it is for me to take the time to do that regularly.",
    "In addition to learning about primate behaviors and evolutionary concepts, I really appreciate Professor Fernandez-Duque's efforts to help students improve our learning methods. I learned the difference between the learning zone and performance zone and that makes the class a very unique experience.",
    "I learned about the ecological and evolutionary influences on animal behavior and reproduction"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The professor is amazing and stresses the importance of mental health and general well-being, and is clearly enthusiastic and very knowledgable about the class material. Weaknesses: The class lacks organization, and at times the TFs seemed just as confused concerning logistics (such as midterm topics, format, etc.) as the students.",
    "Strengths: Great class, healthy mindset, super engaging. Weaknesses: sometimes was a bit disorganized, unclear what midterm expectations were at first (but later was clarified)",
    "The beginning of the class didn't assert very well what the expectations of the class and homework were so it was a little difficult in the beginning to follow along and feel that you were doing the correct work and enough work. You would soon learn that Eduardo fosters an environment where making a few mistakes is alright and the flexibility of the class becomes an asset. That being said in his passion to engage with students if a question was asked in class he could sometimes go off on a long tangent and not get through the material for today. He would make up for it by not requiring the material not gone over in class.",
    "The reading load was not much if this had been a relevant class, but for a 5th class I was taking for a science credit, it was a bit much (even though it was all pertinent to the class). Section could be painful because most of the time nobody did the reading.",
    "It is not necessary for it to be 1hour and 15 minutes and also have a section. Otherwise it was a good and interesting course",
    "I loved the care Professor Eduardo put into the course. I wish there was better communication between the TAs and Eduardo on what is expected of the students.",
    "There was a serious lack of communication between the professor and the TFs. Review sessions were hardly helpful because TFs seemingly had no idea what would actually be on the exams. We also weren't allowed to discuss class material in section, even if it was because we were confused. That being said, midterms (even if you had no idea what they'd be like in advance) were always fair. The zoo trip was offensive.",
    "I definitely feel as though the lectures are engaging. It would be nice if the course was a little later in the day, but that is just scheduling. I do also feel that there was a lot of time spent establishing basic biological concepts like evolution and natural selection which I understand not everyone may know, but I would have liked to get to the meat more quickly.",
    "It was well-designed but could be improved with a smaller class size or seminar style.",
    "The course was great overall. It could have been organized a little better.",
    "I thought the sections of this class were the most useful and were where I found myself actually starting to learn the material. As for lectures, I thought they were fairly interesting, but thought they could do better at clearly connecting them back to the readings. Another main weakness was the lack of clarity around the topics. I often found myself asking the Professor and the TA the same question and getting varied responses, which made this class frustrating to study for, because I never knew exactly what I should be studying.",
    "Despite technically being a lecture, Professor Fernandez-Duque got the class involved in discussions which made it easy to learn and be engaged.",
    "I really loved the Professor! Professor Eduardo was incredible, and so so engaged in the course. He always taught with excitement and energy, and gave us a lot of terrific materials. He also made a point to allow both science and non-science based students thrive! The morning meditations were VERY relaxing, and even though it was unexpected, I really really enjoyed them. The professor overall just made the entire course experience an extremely enjoyable one that I was able to learn a lot from. In terms of weaknesses, I think the course could have used a little more structural integrity and organization. While as the course progressed, the professor made a point to make the course more structured, more general themes more abundantly clear at the beginning and end of every course section! That way, the takeaways of every section and every reading could be more obvious and evident. Nonetheless, I loved the course.",
    "The course material is sometimes dry, but Eduardo is such a great professor and makes the course so engaging nonetheless. The Bronx Zoo trip was so much fun and a great way to learn. The exams are quite fair, as well. I wish section worked a bit more to help us synthesize the class material.",
    "Strengths: meditation period, early final means class is over before other finals, zoo trip Weaknesses: It takes time to understand what is expected of you in this class. Lectures don't feel applicable to what's on the test--such material can be found in section and from self-study.",
    "Eduardo is a fun professor, but not the most detailed. He doesn't really seem to ever say what we should or shouldn't know, and consistently says not to worry about our grades but will then hand out C's and D's on the midterm and final.",
    "The course was well taught and generally engaging. I liked Professor Duque's approach to learning. The zoo trip was one of my favorite experiences of the semester. The assessments could be unpredictable at times and the feedback was not very flexible. I wish that the professor had taken the time to grade the tests himself and also that demonstrated understanding of key concepts had been prioritized on the tests instead of rubric-style grading.",
    "A large number of readings in diverse areas within the field were discussed, and I came away feeling that I had an improved foundation in evolutionary biology and significantly more knowledge about a number of primate taxa. The trip to the zoo was also an effective (and fun!) way to review some of what we had learned and make our own observations. However, the flow of the lectures sometimes felt a bit disorganized. The objectives provided at the beginning of each class helped, but I sometimes had a hard time connecting what we discussed in lecture to these ideas and understanding the bigger pictures of the lectures.",
    "The strengths of the course was the field trip which gave me a first hand experience of the different primate species after learning about them. I love the way the class was set up and how interactive it was. I think that the sections could be improved a lot in terms of helping us understand the readings more and discuss class topics rather than unrelated topics and random assessments.",
    "This class was phenomenal. Even though it was a lecture, Professor Fernandez-Duque engaged the whole class and facilitated a lot of discussions. He also welcomed questions and worked hard to make sure the class was comfortable with not knowing things. The lectures were well organized and his selection of readings made a lot of the evolutionary theory accessible while maintaining its rigor.",
    "Strength is how clear and digestible the lectures are and how relevant and helpful the sections are. One improvement could be to streamline the readings.",
    "Professor Fernandez-Duque is great. He is an engaging speaker and helps create a great learning environment through encouragement. The course could be more structured to force student learning.",
    "Strengths: THE PROFESSOR, hands down. Few professors on this campus can cater to students who are taking the class for a science credit with very little desire to take the class as well as to students who are serious E&EB majors who intend to work in this field as a career path. But Professor Eduardo Fernandez-Duque has mastered this skill. He turned our roughly 80-person lecture into a seminar-like class. In addition to his passion about primates, Professor Fernandez-Duque also is up to date on modern teaching techniques, and self-reflexively continues to update his teaching style to cater to his class. He deeply cares about the wellbeing of his students, and he created an extremely interesting, thrilling class that I don't think I would have enjoyed nearly as much as I did if it were through a different professor. Weaknesses: Communication between the professor and TFs. Both the professor and the TFs were wonderful, but alas section was sort of unguided, and often the TFs did not really know what was going on. It would have been nice to have a little bit more of a game plan going into section. However, that's perhaps the only flaw I could find in this class. And even then, this wasn't that big of a problem.",
    "Strengths: reading length and relevance to course subjects, Eduardo's style of lecturing and experience, very manageable workload, Bronx Zoo trip, interesting lessons and studies, reasonable expectations when learning or taking tests, morning 5-minute meditations Weaknesses: weekly blog questions that did not do much to further understanding, class size somewhat too large, 9:00 am classtime, weekly sections not really useful",
    "Strengths: Hands on learning through class field trip and guest lecturers (such as the very insightful discussions with young primatologists). The class was organized in a manner that was very conducive to learning. The objectives really helped guide my learning and made the concepts easier to grasp.",
    "I think Eduardo and the TAs worked hard to make the course accessible and interesting to students regardless of their backgrounds. Given that the course is listed as a biological anthropology course, and is also a social science credit for distributional requirements, I did wish that perhaps more time was spent thinking and talking about\/ working through the connections between primate studies and anthropology more broadly as a discipline. For instance, what the implications of having biological anthropology and cultural anthropology situated under the same broader discipline are\/ why the two have come to be seen as relevant\/ connected to each other. The course was also, at times, a little messy and the course objectives could be edited so they are clearer + not repetitive.",
    "Strengths: very fun, relaxed atmosphere. Weaknesses: the readings etc were unorganized. Sections seems unnecessary sometimes (even though my TA Emily was great)",
    "The course is INCREDIBLY poorly organized. I mean you have NO idea about anything that happens in this course. The lectures make no sense, and are totally unstructured.... there is some semblance of structure with the \"course objectives\" but these are notoriously unhelpful when preparing for exams. The required readings are hard to find, and its even harder to discern which part of the readings (which are incredibly dense - we all know how to read academic writing in our respective fields, but there's no reason we should have to do this in a subject that is not our discipline) are even needed. There is little to no preparation for the exams, which constitute the only significant part of the grade outside of participation. Participation grading appears totally arbitrary.",
    "Strengths: great professor who genuinely cared for this students. Weaknesses: the course was very disorganized, especially the presentations\/class notes and objectives, which made it difficult to study for the exams.",
    "Could be improved by having more organization\/structure. The course felt very unorganized and seemed to have scattered themes and information.",
    "Its supposed to be a class that students who dont major in a science course can take and appreciate, but the second half of the course took a different approach that was intensely scientific.",
    "Although this course was a lecture, the Eduardo focused a lot of class engagement and active learning. I think the emphasis on performance zone vs. learning zone was really helpful. There were a lot of readings that you were expected to answer questions on, and at the beginning of the semester it was just a lot of information being thrown at you. Toward the end it felt like it got more organized, but sections always seemed like a waste of time and we were just there to get participation points.",
    "Loved the teacher not many people seemed engaged though",
    "The biggest strength was the availability of the professor both emotionally and in meeting outside of class. He was very caring and interactive in class. He was very encouraging and positive welcoming failure and incorrect answers in class as a part of the learning process. Sections were also very strong for the most part. There were a ton of office hours - I felt really bad that I couldn't make it to most of them - but Courtney hosted an Exam Strategies workshop that was really excellent. Would have helped me a long time ago. Took a lot of the guesswork out of answering questions for points. Another HUGE strength of the class was the meditation that would start every lecture. It further emphasized how Professor cared about our individual growth more than anything else. By far the biggest weakness were the forms. It really took the fun out of the readings for me. It turned the readings from a relaxing, interesting thing to do on Monday and Wednesday evenings to something to stressfully cram on Monday and Wednesday mornings. Doing the forms actively decreased the depth of my reading as it felt like I was just grade-grubbing. I also heard other students say, \"There's no form this week so I guess I'm not doing the reading haha\". That conflicts with my experience so I'm not sure what the solution would be. The very beginning of the course felt a touch slow (esp. the What is skepticism? class), but it's because he's building the foundation for the hypothesis vs. prediction unit which was really interesting.",
    "The class synthesized very well conceptual learning through readings and interactive learning through classroom discussion and field trips. The class could be improved by having more structured sections.",
    "Eduardo is a great professor who cares about learning more than just memorization. He did everything to make us understand the material and methods for scientific enquiry"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, for students looking for a social science\/science credit, the course is very interesting even for non EEB majors (or other similar majors). The professor makes class enjoyable (especially with his meditations) such that the class had high attendance for the entire semester.",
    "Yes! Definitely would recommend this course if Professor Fernandez-Duque is teaching it. He is so knowledgeable but most of all, so approachable. He really cares about his students and is always willing to go the extra mile and help out with anything. You learn a lot, the zoo trip was fun, and the exams are fair. A great class if you want to take an E&EB class or want a chill science credit!",
    "Yes.",
    "I took it for a science credit and am satisfied with it.",
    "If the student was interested in getting a baseline understanding of primate ecology, then yes I would recommend.",
    "No, you can find a more interesting and engaging social sciences or science credit.",
    "If you are interested in primates, need a science credit for not much work, or just want to have fun learning a subject without grade stress this is a great course where it is easy to excel gradewise as the majority is participation and attendance. The tests are not difficult and the visit to the zoo made the entire course worth it for me. The Professor is approachable and relaxed. I really had a good time.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Fernandez-Duque is great, the course is interesting, and the workload is not too heavy. Take it, even if you don't have to.",
    "I would. The class was very interesting.",
    "I took this class as a \"science gut\" . After taking it, I would say this isn't the easiest science class you could get and I often found myself frustrated by the lack of clarity of what was actually going to be tested. However, if you actually spend an hour a week outside of class and sections doing the reading for this class you will do well. To be warned, studying for the tests is not just memorizing a bunch of facts to get an A and you will have to work fairly hard to understand some underlying concepts in this course. So, if you don't find this material very interesting and just want an \"easy A\", I would not recommend this course. That is sort of what I was looking for and I found it hard at many times to even do the readings or dive into the concepts because they were so far outside of my interests.",
    "Yes! This was a very fun way to learn about evolution. Professor Fernandez-Duque is great.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course. I personally was taking the course for a science credit. I found that even though the material is challenging, Professor Eduardo does a TERRIFIC job of making the material accessible, which allows students from all types of majors and backgrounds to do well. The course was really an enjoyable experience through which I not only learned about primates, but about more general skills like communication, research paper reading, and others!",
    "Yes, this was a class that I took for a science credit, but it was a class that I actually ended up enjoying a lot. The class environment was great and every class started with some type of mindfulness activity. I actually will leave this class with tangible material, which is so important.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a strong interest in primates but if not, another science course might be more fulfilling.",
    "If you want a traditional science credit where you most of your work comes from regurgitating information you may or may not be interested in two tests throughout the semester or you're extremely interested in monkeys, then yes. This is not necessarily an easy class, though; it's a primatology class.",
    "No, the grading is extremely inconsistent and it's hard to gauge whether or not you're actually learning what you should be. A friend and I made a google doc study guide for the midterm and studied together. He got a 98 and I got a 73. I understand that our grades shouldn't have been identical, but for two people to study the same amount of the same material and have two wildly different grades after feeling that we both did well doesn't make sense to me.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in taking a deep dive into a field they've never explored. I learned a ton about primate behavior and Eduardo made lectures very entertaining. However, I would caution that feedback is somewhat unreliable and the grading could be inconsistent, so probably don't take it if you absolutely NEED an A.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's very accessible for non-science majors, but it is still helps solidify evolutionary biology concepts and introduces lots of new information regarding primate behavior and ecology for biology majors and others with a strong biology background.",
    "No. I think the material was much more specific than I would have expected, although I do think that the style of teaching was enjoyable for a more relaxed class. Although last midterm result was much worse than expected after coming out of the exam feeling good about it. Others also felt this way and we feel like we were not guided into the last midterm as well as perviously.",
    "Absolutely, this was one of the most fun and most interesting classes that I have taken here at Yale! There was no reason for me to take it besides pure interest and it was totally worth it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it was an interesting course with a great professor: if anything it teaches you how to think about scientific literature (and how to be effectively skeptical). However, students with a STEM background might find the course too base level.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Take this class if you are remotely interested in primates, and even if you aren't and just need a science credit. I'm not a scientist and I don't love science classes and I am really a humanities guy, but this class made me rethink that whole framework. It's a cool topic with an excellent professor who cares about you, and in addition to learning scientific principles you gain critical thinking skills that too often classes assume you already have, developing them less. It's accessible to practically everyone, and I think it would be a pity if you didn't get to learn from Professor Fernandez-Duque during your time at Yale.",
    "Yes! While there are a few caveats to this course (e.g. sections, blogs, class size), this is a fantastic class that welcomes students of any major to learn basic evolutionary theory, scientific thinking, and a great deal about primate taxa and behavior. Eduardo is very understanding of students' workloads and stress, and is very engaging in his lectures and research. A very rewarding course that is not too demanding.",
    "Yes, the concepts are really interesting, class field trip was really fun and really educational, and it is very well taught!",
    "Yes! For any major. Low time commitment and pretty fun",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you don't mind suffering a little bit for a science credit. If you're looking for an easy, well-organized learning experience, do not take this course!",
    "No. I took this course only for the science credit.",
    "Yes. It's a great course to get a science credit but it requires significant work outside of the classroom just to make sense of what was given to you during lecture.",
    "If you want a relatively easy class with minimal work but a super caring professor take this class! Eduardo really cares about his students and wants everyone to get something out of the class, even if you don't want to be the next Jane Goodall (but tbh who doesn't wan't to be the next Jane Goodall...).",
    "Sure",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course given that you understand you won't be learning so much about specific species nor about their biological processes. This is a class on behavior and ecology, not on digestion tracks and brain makeups, as I think I was secretly hoping for. Instead this is a class that makes you consider evolution as a whole and it makes you view big concepts differently - like behavior is an evolutionary attribute just like claws. Readings are enjoyable, but the forms are not. At the same time the forms take like 20 minutes a week and if you just do them ahead of time they should be fine for you. Just take them seriously despite the fact that they're easy because they're worth a lot of your grade. The biggest strength was the availability of the professor both emotionally and in meeting outside of class. He was very caring and interactive in class. He was very encouraging and positive welcoming failure and incorrect answers in class as a part of the learning process. Another HUGE strength of the class was the meditation that would start every lecture. It further emphasized how Professor cared about our individual growth more than anything else.",
    "A great gutty Sc credit. Eduardo is a gem.",
    "Yes absolutely. It's a really interesting topic even if you are not there for the science credit",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in ecology or evolutionary biology, this is a great course to take to delve into a topic that many E&EB majors are not particularly familiar with. Eduardo is also an incredible professor who is willing to assist students beyond class; he is a great mentor figure. Also, the zoo trip is very fun to go on, if that is something you would be interested in."
