   "comments": [
    "Definitely!! Take it if you can get in!",
    "Want to be a better journalist? Take this class. While doing journalism at the YDN (or other campus publications) is a good way to get experience, Brill really puts everything into perspective and gives you a good grounding for thinking about your writing.",
    "Definitely, for anyone interesting in journalism or even media.",
    "Take this class! If you are interested in writing and journalism, Brill offers an interesting and technical look at the profession that is hard to find elsewhere at Yale, and he chooses smart readings and assignments that are never redundant. It's also not a huge amount of work given its rep -- its\/Brill's reputation are more a result of the neuroses of its students rather than its reality.",
    "If you are interested in being a journalist,TAKE IT. Brill has so much great advice, both about your writing and about how to pursue careers in journalism. If you aren't passionate about being a journalist this class would probably be a waste of time, since it is very focused on finding jobs in the industry for the summer\/after graduation.",
    "Instead of just \"Journalism,\" this course should be called \"Journalism with Steven Brill.\" Professor Brill makes this course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not the reading (you could find most of it by yourself if you were that interested), not the assignments (primarily a 2,000 word profile of someone else in the class and a 4,000 word final article), and especially not the 9am Monday time slot (I was terrified about being late the entire semester). It was the first time at Yale that I felt I was being trained by a course, and that my reporting and writing markedly improved. You also get to learn some of the business of journalism, including how the industry is changing with digital media, and how reporters, editors, and publications are adjusting. If you're even considering going into journalism, take this course. You will be a better writer and thinker for it. Brill will also help you find opportunities in the field.",
    "Stressful, but extremely rewarding. You may suffer through it, but it will all be worth it in the end.",
    "A necessary class if you're looking to pursue journalism. There's a lot of reading but it's all really good; some classic works you should definitely be exposed to and will enjoy reading anyways. If you just have a passing interest in the craft it's maybe not the class for you.",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course-- it will improve your writing, and help you to get a better grip on where the field of journalism is headed. The trip to the New York Times is incredible.",
    "This is a great course for those who want to do journalism as a career. It teaches you not only how to write but also all about the industry. I would definitely recommend it to another student!",
    "This course is a must-take if you want to pursue a career in journalism. If you aren't sure, this course will definitely help you know whether this is the career for you. It's intense work and at times competitive, but it's changed my life."
