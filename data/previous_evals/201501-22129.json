   "comments": [
    "I'd definitely recommend French 120 to anyone who's interested in learning French! You learn so much in just 2 semesters, it's amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It involves a lot of work, but you learn French incredibly quickly. This is an incredible program.",
    "Do not take this class. Unless you are dying to take beginner's French, this class has way too much work. The grading is super arbitrary depending on which section you are in (i.e. some section leaders are way more lenient than others). There is 2 hours of homework EVERY NIGHT. It's incredibly tedious. There are other languages at Yale which are easier...don't suffer through this pain unless you really have to.",
    "All in all French 120 isn't very different from French 110. It requires the same level of dedication day in and day out in order to be prepared for every test. The french program at Yale is pretty great, so if you're deciding between learning french someplace else vs. Yale, I'd strongly suggest studying at Yale (unless you'd be studying in France)",
    "A straightforward class with an easy workload, I would recommend Burton's Fren 120 to another student. She is a great instructor.",
    "FREN 120 is a LOT of work, but you will not regret putting in the effort. The 12+ weeks of the semester way seem long, but youll seem improvement. This is not the easiest intro language track to complete (certainly not, compared to Indonesian, or Hindi at Yale), so be careful when you sign up for the course. I daresay that this course may be more time intensive than Intro Chinese (because of the weekly tests). That said, you will see significant improvement at the end of the year. Compared to learning other non-Romance languages, where it takes 1-2 years to gain comfort in using the language, this is such a wonderful feeling to have. I highly recommend taking French at Yale. Just be prepared to put in the work! (Or take it Credit\/D, if youve already completed your language requirement at Yale.)"
