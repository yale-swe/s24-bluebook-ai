    "This course will occupy a LOT of your time toward the end of the semester. The first few classes are bug collecting trips, which are great, and the rest of the time will be spent preparing your collection. Each week you learn about a different taxon of arthropods and then have a quiz on it the next week, which can get somewhat repetitive in the long run.",
    "This is a great class to complement the course. The collecting trips are very fun and you learn a lot on them, and making your collection gives you a very pokemon-esque, tangible result for taking the class.",
    "Definitely recommend, but take it knowing that you will have to kill a lot of insects-which gets harder the more you kill, and that it is a lot of work to identify all the insects needed for the collection.",
    "You would get more out of it if you really appreciate the subject, and are not just in it to see pretty butterflies.",
    "Lab is great - if you take the lecture, I highly highly highly recommend also taking lab. You get to go out in the field and actually catch the insects you study, which gives you a much closer appreciation of them than just sitting in lecture. Making a collection is a really neat way to learn about bugs - and especially if you like getting out in the field, the lab is for you.",
    "Everyone who takes the arthropods course should take the lab as well. The arthropods lab is an amazing opportunity to see and feel (and even taste!) the organisms discussed in the lectures firsthand, and to understand how entomologists and other arthropod biologists actually work. If you like the outdoors at all, you will love the insect collecting trips (especially the trip to Florida!). Of course, the lab does require a lot of work (you are required to create an insect collection including 20 orders and 80 families of insects!), but the effort is all worthwhile in the end."
