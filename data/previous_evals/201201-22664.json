    "Basically the same material learned in L2, just more in depth",
    "This class is great for working on grammar, composition and speaking. It's not a big time commitment, but you should definitely use all the resources available to you. I'd recommend this class to someone who has a basic introductory-level background to Spanish.",
    "Yes because it really improves your understanding of the language.",
    "If you need to take the course for graduation credit, then you have to take it, but I recommend taking it with Professor Reymund. SHe is the best spanish teacher I've had. I learned more with her than any other spanish course.",
    "I recommend the class if you want to brush up your spanish and solidify your grammar, but you won't learn completely new concepts and topics.",
    "Great course. Worth taking, but definitely try to have Professor Reymundi. She is the best."
