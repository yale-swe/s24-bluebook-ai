    "If you are at all interested in law or politics this is a MUST TAKE. The readings are great and the discussions are always a lot of fun. You have a lot of freedom with the papers and Professor Highsmith really cares about making sure you understand everything and are prepared for the assignments. You'll really be forced to take a look at your own beliefs and opinions and the class is a great environment to try to defend them and grow in your own understanding of the political system.",
    "I would recommend this course. It details the history and evolution of lobbying and laws governing lobbyists. It also focuses on current scandals and topics regarding lobbying that are really fun to learn about. It is an effective mix of lectures and readings that give you the most complete picture of lobbying today.",
    "Absolutely, great course, very interesting, well run",
    "This seminar was really quite enjoyable. Even as a science major I found the workload straightforward and the readings quite interesting. Mr Highsmith understands the industry and does a fantastic job relaying his own experiences to the class. A whole-hearted recommendation to anyone looking for a law-related class in a very interesting area normally ignored.",
    "Yes, it was a great class",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It was a wonderful seminar with very interesting reading.",
    "This class was a great addition to my semester. Through a combination of readings and personal anecdotes from Mr. Highsmith, we explored the sometimes-shocking truth behind what lobbyists actually do. Readings were substantial but managable.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. We had a huge diversity of perspectives in the room - so it really helped to challenge my opinions. The work load is easily manageable.",
    "Yes! Great class with a great prof!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Lots of fun, you learn a lot. One of the best courses I've taken.",
    "This is a great seminar that gives students an insider perspective from a seasonal lobbying practitioner. Professor Highsmith is very experienced and has a lot of stories to tell about his field. If you do all the readings, which most people in the class don't, you will get probably 20 times more out of the class. Even if you don't, the seminar will still change your view on democracy and the legislative process.Take it if you want to understand how laws get passed behind closed doors! It should be a requirement if you are interested in politics. This is not the traditional useless, physics-envy fake course from the political science department.",
    "Amazing.",
    "TAKE IT IF YOU CAN!"
