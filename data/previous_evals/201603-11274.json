    "This course is unique among other MENG classes because it is tiny-usually under 10 people. This means that you can get almost unlimited attention with Juan, and he is generally happy to explain any concepts or answer questions if you visit him in his office. His lectures can be hard to follow because he moves very fast and often skips a lot of steps with math on the board. This is essentially an applied Math class, as it is entirely theory based. Some of the most fun moments are when we discussed more practical problems, but these do not come all that often.",
    "Strengths: strong emphasis on math and theory, which is an important foundation. Professor was always willing to meet outside of class or help clear confusion. Weaknesses: I wish there was more real-world application geared towards real airplanes and engineering. Notes and homework often lacked clarity and the students were often confused.",
    "The primary strength of this course is how small and personal it is. Prof. De La Mora knows everyone's name in the first class and will develop a positive relationship with everyone quickly. This also gives the class plenty of flexibility to move as quickly or as slowly as the class could handle, which greatly decreased the amount of stress that the subject would cause than if it was in a larger, more standardized setting. He will delay problem sets, schedule midterms and problem sessions for the convenience of the students, and meet with you whenever needed. Because of this, the intimidating subject that aerodynamics can be is much more managable, and it eliminates any excuses a student may have towards his or her learning. As far as content, the course is very interesting and Prof. De La Mora definitely teaches it his way. Most problem sets utilize Mathematica programs he has designed that allow for numerical and practical applications of a highly theorized subject. We learn airfoil theory in mostly complex form, which isn't in the text. The biggest weakness of the course has more to do with the general engineering program at Yale, which does not do a good job of building strong thermodynamics and mathematics backgrounds. Aerodynamics is essentially fluids II, and nothing clicked with the class until hours and hours of relearning old concepts had occurred."

    "Overall, if you aren't willing to put in significant effort, this class probably isn't worth it-you'll just be confused the whole time. If you are willing to put in the time, you can leave with a good theoretical understanding of Aero basics and Juan is a really nice guy with a fun sense of humor.",
    "This course has a strong emphasis on math and theory. You will often be confused on the homework, but Juan is kind and always willing to help in class or outside of class. It was a small class, so there is a collaborative environment where students help each other catch up if lost. This class is almost an extension of fluid mechanics, with an emphasis on airfoils, but it didn't get very specific with engineering airplanes.",
    "You have to be interested in the subject for this class to be worth it. It is very involved, very fristrating because of the lack of helpful literature, and requires meeting with the professor and or classmates often to succeed. However, if you are fascinated in the subject it's a much more worthwhile use of your time than another muddled engineering class."
