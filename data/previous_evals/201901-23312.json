    "- understanding of SDGs overview as well as more detailed information about each individual SDG - overview of linkages between SDGs - challenges of the SDG\/UN framework",
    "Really appreciated the insight from practitioners! It's always helpful to have people working on a set of challenges share their thoughts with you, because these insights can't be gleaned from textbooks or articles.",
    "I gained an intuitive understanding of all of the UN Sustainable Development goals, the negotiation process and different approaches to implementation. I also got some great contacts for career development!",
    "I developed a clearer insight on the interconnections between the various SDGs and the way in which climate change aligns and intersects with the other SDGs.",
    "SDGs and how they interact with each other.",
    "I gained knowledge of SDGs and skills to develop creative ideas for their implementation.",
    "-The SDG process and how diplomats reach agreements",
    "Global issues, SDGs",
    "I definitively learned a lot about SDGs and how to implement them in a very innovative way!"

    "Pretty well",
    "Very well!",
    "The class exceeded my expectations: I thought it would be taught in a strictly academic format by a professor with a few guest speakers, but the interdisciplinary and unusual class style - with a guest speaker for every class - was very refreshing.",
    "Well",
    "very well! I really enjoyed the course and got a lot out of it",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - most of the class speakers were excellent (the poverty, industry, and cities lectures were disappointing, but all others were great). - Gordon is very supportive of students and provides great advice for class projects as well as opportunities to get involved in global issues beyond the class Weaknesses - As stated above, I would get new speakers to discuss poverty, industry, and cities next year - Some of the homework readings could be improved",
    "I really enjoyed having engaging class speakers who brought entirely different perspectives on the SDGs. I think the course could have added more in-class dynamism, including group projects or simulations, to really underscore the complexities of SDG implementation!",
    "Did not find all the readings helpful. Also, some speakers were amazing, while others fell flat.",
    "The course does well at examining the Sustainable Development goals from many different angles, by bringing in a new speaker each class to focus on one individual goal. This becomes a weakness when the speaker isnt as engaging or knows less about their assigned goal than others, but in general the format works really well. Its also fun to hear about everyones term projects at the end, as the class is so diverse in terms of nationalities, subjects and approaches.",
    "Strengths: I enjoyed the diversity of lecturers who brought in new and different perspectives. I also really liked that the class focused less on theory and more on implementation (the focus of our paper as well as the fact that many of the speakers were practitioners). Finally, this was one of the very few courses at FES with a clear international focus. Weaknesses: I can't think of anything.",
    "Gordon and Courtney are very available. Readings should be made available sooner.",
    "Strengths: Opportunity to gain broad knowledge on SDGs. Weaknesses: Focus is too academic. More speakers that are actual practitioners could give important insights on SDG implementation.",
    "strength: different speaker per class makes course very dynamic, the format(presentation+ Q&A) was really good and keep me engaged",
    "The different speakers are a strength.",
    "More practical engagements are needed with the policy-makers eg. the UN, international organizations, conferences",
    "S: speakers; the project W: just one class for SDG might not be enough, and although we could learn from all the SDGs it was not in a very in-depth way."

   "comments": [
    "It's easy to coast by in this class, but if you put in the time on your own then you can get a lot of it. I'd especially recommend at least trying to skim each reading, and try to ask at least one question of each speaker, as this helps you stay engaged. Also, go talk to Gordon in his office! He's great!",
    "Go all out on the final project!! It's such a unique opportunity to get class credit to work on a real world issue. Reach out to organizations \/ causes that you are passionate about and give it a shot -- that's what truly made this semester worth it for me.",
    "Get started on your final project early!",
    "This is an amazing class, take it! You'll have the freedom to explore sustainable development issues however interests you the most, and your eyes will be opened to many other approaches and interventions.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if someone is interested in having a macro-level perspective on the different SDGs and their intersections.",
    "This class is most helpful when you have a project idea in mind related to SDG implementation.",
    "Read about the speakers before showing up in class.",
    "A good course for those interested in international development.",
    "It will allow you to create a project to implement in real life if you want to!"
