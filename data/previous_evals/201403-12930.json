    "I would definitely recommend finishing off your language requirement if you've already begun with GMAN 110 & 120. That being said, you definitely get out of GMAN 130 what you put into it.",
    "An alright class, which you probably have to take. Try to do the homework assignments on time. The tests are not too bad, and get a perfect score on the final project. There's a lot of busy work, but it's reasonable.",
    "Great class, and definitely worth taking if you want to (or have to) continue learning German. I would encourage you to shop multiple Professors and see who is most compatible with your learning style. But Anna is a terrific teacher. She is engaging and energetic, and she made learning German genuinely enjoyable for her students. She also went out of her way to explain tricky grammatical concepts in clear terms, and she was extremely accessible for help outside of class. Grading was fair and quite reasonable: just be sure to make a sincere effort on every assignment and double check any words or grammar you are uncertain about. Never trust Google translate. The class has frequent online homework, which could be tedious at times, but (in hindsight) was definitely helpful for the tests. We were also required to exchange emails with a German-speaking pen pal. These emails could likewise get tedious, but you'll get a ton of practice expressing yourself in German. The course's tests are quite reasonable as long as you study the material and diligently memorize the vocabulary. One tip: most tests had a short essay section at the end, and I highly recommend practicing an essay before the test, as it will make writing the actual essay *much* easier. Usually the prompt for the essay is pretty predictable based on the content of the chapter."
