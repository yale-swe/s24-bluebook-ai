   "comments": [
    "The class is well-organized and contains interesting discussions as well as essays that will definitely expand your writing skills. As long as you stay on top of deadlines and get the help\/advice you think you need, the class is easy-going and enjoyable.",
    "Engl 115 is a good freshman intro class. However, if you have a strong interest in English or a lot of experience writing papers, I would not recommend it.",
    "This class, like it sounds, is a look at different aspects of labor and leisure through literature. I really wouldn't recommend it to other students, unless they are extremely passionate about the subjects at hand. As wonderful as the instructor was, he could only do so much with the not-so-interesting material.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students at Yale because I think it combines reading and writing in a very convincing way. By this, I mean that by reading the Style Guide and great works of poetry and prose, students were shown the thoughts and personal style of great authors and writers. This helped to fine tune writing, and offer an early glimpse at the importance of literature and criticism when it comes to writing.",
    "I would recommend this class and would say that it poses an interesting perspective to studying literature. The literature studied is diverse in style, making the discussions varied and distinct."
