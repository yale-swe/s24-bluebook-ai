    "Take it!",
    "ENAS 335 (Professional Ethics) is undoubtedly one of the best classes at Yale. Easily cracks the top 5, and might be even higher. The course is full of rich content, interesting shows, and humorous banter. Professor Carreras will keep you on your toes! Make sure to bring your A game.",
    "You've got to take this class. Mercedes is a gem and this is an absolute fifth, or sixth class. It's such a fifth class it hurts. In the best way possible - because if you can get in, it's a gem. The demand for this class is so high that she rejects a lot of people but you have to try and get in. One homework assignment a week, which consists of reading an article and answering reading comprehension questions about it. Yes, reading comprehension questions. Not like what did the author mean by writing this, but literally what did the author say? Three take-home exams, which are the exact same thing as the homework, just answering questions about articles, nothing different. You have to print out and bring these assignments in to class every week though, you can't email them to her. This is your class students of Yale!",
    "Take it. Interesting and light.",
    "This course is a low-stress way to learn about professional ethics. The lessons are very interesting and you can learn a lot. The lectures are a bit disorganized, but Prof. Carreras is wonderful and always breaks things up with videos. The homework is very straightforward, but tedious and time-consuming.",
    "A solid fifth class. You get to learn about different philosophers and ethical frameworks. The final essay was fun to write, and Professor Carreras was very generous with her time in giving guidance for the essay. Attendance in the class was pretty low in the second half of the semester, but I recommend that you still show up for lectures.",
    "Professional Ethics is definitely a gut class - Professor Carreras said so herself the first day of shopping period. The homeworks and take home \"tests\" are extremely easy. There is a 10 page final paper but you can basically write about anything you want. Professor Carreras is a really sweet lady if you get to have a conversation with her outside of class, but honestly I did not get much from the class. Even if you're looking for an easy 5th I feel like there are other classes which would be more worth your time.",
    "Great Class.",
    "You apply moral frameworks to some interesting current affairs topics and Prof Carreras does a good job to make the class interesting and interactive. The workload is also pretty light - homeworks pretty much every week, 3 'take-homes' that are the equivalent of homeworks basically, and a final paper for which you have a lot of freedom to choose your topic. Take if you're looking for a somewhat interesting, albeit not the most riveting, 5th class!",
    "Good introduction to professional ethics for your future career.",
    "Take this class; the insights are very valuable and it's not too much work. That said, take it seriously. You'll gain much more from it. Also, it's kinda shameful when kids regularly skip ETHICS class.",
    "Professional Ethics is an interesting, informative survey course on philosophical and ethical theories with real-life, current applications. I really enjoyed how Professor Carreras integrated the course material with updated journal articles, which she always prints and hands out in class. The class is a lecture though only a percentage of the entire roster actually attends. That said, I really enjoyed going to class and listening to Professor Carreras, who is very knowledgeable about the material. She is also very approachable and accessible, making any conversation with her a lovely one. I would recommend this course as a good fifth course, especially to those who don't have any prior experience in the field!",
    "Professional Ethics was a great class and I learned a lot about ethics and professionalism. The readings were pretty interesting and the final essay offered a good chance to explore an ethical field in great depth. Professor Carreras was great and showed many very helpful resources.",
    "It's a very interesting course! The course load is not very big and the classes are a lot of fun! Worth taking it!",
    "A great introduction to the consideration of moral dilemmas and the teachings of philosophers such as Aristotle and Socrates, this class is one of the easiest I've taken at Yale. It's an interesting class that I thoroughly enjoyed, and though it did drag on at times and digressed to barely relevant youtube videos, it was a great course overall. I'd recommend to anyone entering the medical or business professions."
