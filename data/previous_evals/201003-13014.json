   "comments": [
    "French 130 is a standard intermediate French class that covers all of the topics one would expect (past tense, future tense, conditional tense, verb conjugation), but it also incorporates interesting literature and movies. The learning mostly centers on listening activities that are available online and the corresponding worksheets that are in the course-packet. I had never had a language class before that focused so heavily on listening and speaking, but now I feel more confident with my French than ever before. We also had several essays throughout the course that were fairly short and we always turned in a rough draft first so that we had a chance to correct mistakes before receiving a final grade. Yes, I would definitely recommend French 130 to another student. I loved Professor Wynant - she is definitely the best French teacher I have ever had. After taking this class, I am excited to take more French classes at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend French 130 02 to another student. It was just one of the most enjoyable language courses I have ever taken. It was fun while being academically challenging.",
    "French 130 is, obviously, a way to meet part of the Yale Language requirement. It's a lot of work consistently, but the work isn't very difficult fortunately. If you don't keep up, it will be hard to participate in class discussions and activities. As long as you put in some effort, however, you will be well prepared for the very straight-forward and painless bi-weekly tests.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who will want to improve their French.",
    "Great class, lots of homework every night but worth it in the end. I feel like I really improved my french.",
    "I would absolutely recommend French 130 02 to another student because it is helpful for completing the language requirement but it is also interesting and helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You become very familiar with the language and the emphasis on speaking helps a lot with pronunciation and fluency.",
    "I would recommend the course if you want to improve your French skills. I would caution that it is a lot of work.",
    "if you want to continue learning french yes of course",
    "You learn the main grammar rules of French. You also learn a lot of new vocabulary words by reading and watching films. I would recommend it because it's an enjoyable way to learn a new language.",
    "French 130 is a class that makes learning French grammar and vocabulary fun. The curriculum also includes a great combination of films and books that tie in directly with the homework and lesson plans. I never enjoyed French class in high school, but French 130 was one of my favorite courses this year. I would recommend it to any prospective French student who places into it."
