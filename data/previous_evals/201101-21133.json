    "Yes, it gives a good introduction to Hilbert space, Banach space, LCS, and then Banach algebra.",
    "I would recommend this course, but it is a very large workload.",
    "Yes, it's a good course that covers many important topics.",
    "It's a good survey of the various kinds of spaces arising in functional analysis.",
    "Yes, would strongly recommend, but only to someone who had previously taken a class in measure theory and ideally some commutative algebra. The stated \"prerequisites\" are less stringent than the prerequisites in practice."
