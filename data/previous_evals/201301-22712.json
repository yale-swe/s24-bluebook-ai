    "I've read many of the comments that say \"if you're premed, you have to take it.\" While it is true that you have to take organic chemistry, you most certainly do not, and should not, take it with Frederick Ziegler. I have never experienced such disorganized lectures in my life. While it is completely possible to get through this class by learning from the textbook (the Wade textbook is very good), that simply is not the way a course should be. If you are going to trek up science hill three times a week for an organic chemistry class, I strongly suggest you wait a semester so that you can take a course with a capable professor.",
    "This course is a very difficult course with a lot of work. You have to be dedicated to putting in a lot of effort for it. The averages on the tests will be pretty low. You will probably have to go meet with peer tutors or your TF or go to office hours. I wouldn't recommend this course to someone unless they have to take it for their major or pre-med.",
    "I would tell the student that Chemistry 220 01 calls for the ability to work well on one's own.",
    "You need to put a lot of effort into it to get decent results. Don't take it unless you're 100% sure you want to be premed.",
    "Chem 220 is manageable, but don't expect to learn much from Ziegler. If you do take the class, here are the keys to success:1)PRE-READ the chapters before lecture. Ziegler doesn't cover the basic material in any topic (i.e. the first half to 3\/4 of the chapter), and without that foundation his lectures are incomprehensible.2) Go to section: It's optional, but the TF's are pretty good, and they will answer your questions about the homework.3) When studying for exams, look at old exams and problem sets. Ziegler isn't particularly creative when it comes to writing exams. Chances are there will be very similar questions to last year's material.",
    "If you are taking it for the premed requirement wait for the fall term class. I wish I did.",
    "I took orgo because I wanted to, not because I had to. I found the material to be really interesting but the lectures were very confusing. Prof. Ziegler basically spent every lecture talking about reactions but didn't present any general concepts, which made the material difficult to understand. I suggest you take this course with a different instructor.",
    "It is Organic chemistry. It is fun if you are doing well and know how to do it, but at other times it is incredibly dull and painful, especially if you do not understand what is going on. With time and patience, anyone can do well.",
    "I would Recommend taking this class only if you need too, it is very difficult and you will have to put in huge amounts of work, and probably wont feel that it ever pays off. But if you do take it, a tip would be to study old exams more heavily instead of the book. The book is virtually useless for Ziegler's tests.",
    "I would summarize Chemistry 220 01 as a horrible class that should never be taken. I don't think I would ever recommend this class to another student if their purpose was to actually learn organic chemistry. Not only did I feel that I did not learn the course material, but it was set in such a fashion that my faith in the science department at Yale College has been questioned. If this course is an example of the teaching abilities of the chemistry department I strongly believe the entire course needs to be re-worked and reevaluated. The class lectures were completely unorganized, illogical, irrelevant, and unhelpful to the learning experience. The problem sets were too difficult and often included material that needed to be looked up online or was not discussed during the class. The difficulty level of the problem sets versus the tests was a vast difference that discouraged learning.",
    "I read all of the old reviews for Ziegler's class, and I came into this semester terrified of orgo. But, in my opinion, Ziegler's bad reputation is COMPLETELY unfounded. I think the reason why so many students get frustrated with him is that he tends to focus on difficult examples in class rather than teaching us the fundamentals in a systematic way, so unless you've read and understood the textbook prior to class, there's a good chance you'll be lost. His problem sets can also be kind of hard (although they're not worth much). But overall, I actually really enjoyed orgo, and I found it to be a VERY fair class with Ziegler. He's great. Here's why:1) He posts old exams and problem sets on his website. Do as many practice problems as you can from these; some questions pop up year after year.2) He has a million office hours -- like five office hours a day three times a week! Take advantage of these. He's great one-on-one, and I found that going to office hours regularly was essential for me to do well.3) Exams are overall, pretty fair, and you get to drop one. The averages on our exams this year were 85, 61, and 59. I think the average on the final was in the 70s. If you do a million practice problems from his old exams, you'll beat the average every time!4) Ziegler is a funny, nice person! He teaches this class because he wants to, and he seems to care about teaching undergrads (unlike many Yale science profs).Some other general tips for success in this class: Buy and read Orgo as a Second Language (the optional book); make flashcards for your mechanisms; and, most importantly, DON'T FALL BEHIND! Orgo is totally manageable as long as you keep up with it as you go along. It's only overwhelming if you try to cram last-minute. Like I said, I was so scared to take orgo, but my experience was not bad at all.The grading is also apparently generous -- I overheard Ziegler tell a student that approximately 40% of the class would get A's and A-minuses. So don't psych yourself out! You might actually enjoy it!",
    "If you're considering not taking this course because Ziegler is teaching it, then you're wrong. Compared to all of the other professors, I've honestly think that Ziegler is the best. He cares about his students, so he actually has several tools that he uses to help them, such as the peer tutors and his amazing website. Additionally, Organic Chemistry is something that you really learn on your own anyway, so your teacher doesn't have to be amazing. Additionally, he gave us so much partial credit on questions -- you could write almost anything and get a few points. It seemed that his TAs weren't looking to take away points to penalize students, but to reward them when they thought they deserved it (which is a big distinction).Honestly, there were only two times I ever felt stressed in this course. One was when we had the problem set on SN2\/E2 reactions after the first test, which was pretty ridiculous. The second was the third exam, which I only had one day to study for (and still did OK relative to the class). Otherwise, Ziegler minimizes stress by having the peer tutors and allowing students to drop their lowest score (which is usually the third exam).My advice is to (a) take the course with Ziegler (b) don't let anything that you've heard about Organic Chemistry freak you out -- it's really not that bad (c) take advantage of the peer tutors and Ziegler's office hours (d) keep up with work (e) don't freak out about the problem sets. They're worth literally 10% of your grade and they are much harder thanthe exams.Don't freak out. It's going to be fine.",
    "I would not recommend it.",
    "Orgo at 925 am is tough, but try to resist the urge to skip Ziegler's classes because you'll end up missing key pieces of information that show up on problem sets\/exams. Do the reading before class because otherwise you'll be lost. If you've done the reading the problem sets aren't too bad, but don't even try just skimming through the chapter before doing a pset because it'll end up taking you twice as long to figure out the problems. Ziegler's website is full of old problem sets and exams, so definitely look over those while you're studying. The Organic Chem as a Second Language book is great, definitely buy that.",
    "Wasn't a bad class, not as hard as people say it is. Probably easier than freshman orgo. Really important to read the text because otherwise you will be completely lost in lecture.",
    "If you're interested in chemistry, this class overall presents very interesting and elegant ideas and concepts. Be prepared to mostly self teach with Ziegler. However, I disagree with people who say his lectures aren't worth waking up for. Go to lecture-- Ziegler lectures on topics he finds interesting, and this is a really good hint for what mechanisms or reactions he's going to put on psets\/exams. He does go really fast in lecture, so if you don't know the basic concepts you won't be able to keep up with the applications he discusses in class. Don't be worried about other course evaluations. If you are a self-motivated student and you stay on top of the reading and material, you can succeed in this class.",
    "Lectures can be unclear, but Orgo as a Second Language and Ziegler's website (especially the practice tests and ORGO organic reactions go online) are extremely helpful.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 220 to anyone interestedin chemistry. Of course, if you are premed you have to take the course no matter what.",
    "Prof. Ziegler is a really nice person, but a terrible lecturer. His lectures are all over the place, and it's not usually clear why he's presenting an example. Lecture attendance was terrible, because everyone just learned from the book. But we were allowed to drop one midterm, which was hugely beneficial. Also, the p-sets are helpful and graded pretty easy.",
    "Orgo was not nearly as awful as previous years' reviews suggested. The attendance dropped dramatically as the semester went on. But that was mostly because it was disorganized. It was sometimes difficult to tell when we should be learning\/memorizing\/writing everything down and when we should just be absorbing cool anecdotes. The little study guide book on the syllabus really helps for the first half. Zeigler's website is essential for the second half (he has screenshotted problems from it and put them on exams).Make sure you get a good TF since going to section is often more useful than class for understanding mechanisms etc. If Apiwat teaches again, get him.",
    "Truthfully, this class is not as hard as everybody makes it out to be. However, it is difficult particularly in that often you cannot devote as much time as you need to really digest the material because of other courses. I actually felt that I learned a ton from the material, but not without a TON of time spent with the book and on old practice exams. Can't say it was the worst class I've taken in terms of difficulty, but it definitely was very stressful. Basically, don't take this class unless (a) you're extremely interested in the topic or (b) you have to.",
    "Duh, no.",
    "If you need to take this course try your hardest to take it with another professor. Taking it with Prof. Ziegler means you absolutely have to teach it to yourself, which pretty much no one has time to do if they are involved in any extracurriculars or any other demanding classes. Take it with someone else, and you'll probably be better off, even then, make sure you don't fall behind.",
    "I would not recommend CHEM 220 to another student.",
    "This is probably a class that you have to take, so just take it and put in the work that is required. Professor Ziegler is very helpful and has a lot if resources and office hours to help students who want to do well in the class. The grading is very fair as well.",
    "its pretty bad unless you are very interested in the subject and can spend a lot of time on it every week. I would not recommend it.",
    "You should take organic chemistry in the fall with another professor. The course lectures were hard to follow and the problem sets were very difficult and time consuming, even with the help of the peer tutors.",
    "If you're taking this course, you probably have no choice. It's not too bad but stay on top of the material because if you get behind, the material will accumulate quickly. TAs and peer tutors are your friends in organic chemistry so take advantage.",
    "If you have to take it you have to take it, but if you can avoid it please do. The curve is okay but averages are in the 60s and it is really disheartening to feel like you don't know the material.",
    "Orgo is hard, but I found it more interesting than I expected. The requisite Ziegler warning: he's very nice and obviously knows a lot about organic chemistry, but the way he teaches is EXTREMELY hard to follow. He kind of just throws whatever he feels like teaching at you. That said, if you have to take it with Ziegler, just study harder and it won't be horrible.",
    "This course isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. If you want to succeed 1) read the book before class 2) go to office hours (if only to make friends with Ziegler) and 3)DO ALL THE PRACTICE EXAMS. Seriously, they're a really valuable resource. Also, the ORGO problems (on his website) often pop up on exams. This class takes a lot of time (the psets take forever) but I feel like I have learned a lot. If you go into with the attitude of a self study then it will be fine.",
    "The class is challenging, and Professor Ziegler doesn't go easy on you, but given the amount of help available, if you put in the time it should be fine. And the material is interesting, in my opinion.",
    "Do not take it with Ziegler. If you're thinking about it, stop. I promise you, taking it with Ziegler is setting yourself up for a bad, bad time.",
    "A class in which you don't know anything until the day before exams.",
    "Hard course, but it definitely taught me how to study. I feel that I became a better student through taking this class and spending a ridiculous amount of time learning the material. Most people take this class because they are required to, but I truly enjoyed the subject material and the course itself."
