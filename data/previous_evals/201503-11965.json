    "Considering that this is Estys first undergrad course, its a pretty great one. Lectures are engaging. Esty is great he has really cool experience in EPA and as a climate negotiator and has a lot of good stories to tell. Hes not married to a specific political agenda and tries to be objective and data-minded. Exams (MT and final) are fair, and then there are three two page single spaced policy essays that can be tricky if youre not used to that style of writing, but you get to pick the topics and due dates that fit your schedule for these. On to the downsides: Esty repeats himself a lot. I guess this could be a plus, bc it makes studying easier, but just be ready for this. Also, the lectures are just that lectures, no powerpoints, nothing online, so you have to go to them. While Esty is a very engaging speaker, 75 minutes straight of anyone talking can get boring. That being said, Id recommend the class. No background in this stuff is required and its important for everyone to know. I predict this will dramatically increase in popularity a la Lathams Bioethics. Overall Id give it an A-. No A because it does get boring sometimes, but a pretty good survey lecture nonetheless.",
    "Yes, this class is must take, especially for someone who is interested in the environment.",
    "This is a great class for anyone who is interested in advancing goals of sustainability (what does that word even mean? - you get to learn that, too!). There's a lot of interesting reading and Prof. Esty, who knows a lot about environmental policy (for good reason), will teach you about the inner workings of policymaking. Basically, you learn what he thinks the 20th century lacked in terms of policy and strategies, what worked, and what he thinks we need going forward. You write three policy briefs. Midterm. Final. Kaboom. I enjoyed this class, and I'm sure the tail end will be better organized in years to come (this was the first iteration, I believe).",
    "This course is an introduction to a bunch of different environmental topics. It is good for people who don't know that much about environmental stuff. Overall, probably because this was the first year this course was taught, it was pretty disorganized and kind of hard to follow.",
    "Fantastic course all around. The material is pretty all encompassing on the subject of sustainability and very interesting. Professor Esty is an amazing lecturer and very experienced. The TAs are very knowledgable and were always willing to help. The take-home assignments were manageable and actually challenged me to think. And the exams were fair and very straightforward. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that thinks sustainability is something they are at all interested in",
    "I would recommend because sustainability is becoming very important in all industries, and this class shows the value of thinking and acting sustainably whatever a student's interest may be.",
    "Great course! Most courses about climate issues focus on all the problems, this one was about solutions. Esty is a great lecturer who really know the ins and outs of the sustainability field. Absolutely take it if youre interested in the future of the planet",
    "Take this course! You'll learn everything you need to know about environmental issues and will be able to articulately debate these issues with other people. Such important stuff to know! Esty is a great lecturer. Just three 2-pg single spaced policy essays in a semester, which weren't too bad. The exams were also very fair with IDs (get a choice of which to answer) and very broad essay topics. Highly recommend it!",
    "This course was a great introduction to policymaking for sustainability. It is not a science course, but you do get a bit of background on the important science. This is a course with a thesis: you will emerge well acquainted with Prof. Esty's idea of how things out to be done, but you will also hear and read opposing viewpoints. Although I highly recommend the course, it did get a bit repetitive.",
    "As someone who has never taken an Environmental Studies class, I really enjoyed this lecture. It was exactly what I was looking for a class that focused on *very* current environmental issues, with a focus less on the science and more on politics and current events. The course provided just that: a broad, yet sufficiently detailed, overview of the current state of climate change and other environmental issues from political, ethical\/moral, and public interest perspectives. (We even talked about the Paris talks, which happened at the same time as the course and which Professor Esty attended and told us about!) This is not a science course at all; instead, over-arching themes focus on the government's role in environmental policy making, and how we can better harness the private sector to jump-start green innovation and incentivize businesses and individuals to commit to more sustainable practices. I came away from this course with a clear sense of what \"sustainable development\" means in the 21st century, and how our current approaches to environmental challenges need to be different from those taken in the 20th century.",
    "This class has been a good overview of the issues in sustainability. I would definitely recommend this class to all students as the topics discussed in this class are very interdisciplinary. The course touches on many of the problems that needs solutions from many different fields - economics, policy, environmental science, international relations. The issues in sustainability cannot be simply solved with just Environmental Studies majors but will need experts in all other fields, so I would definitely recommend this class to everyone at Yale.",
    "Definitely take EVST 292. Professor Esty is awesome- learn a lot and lectures are great. I would recommend to environmental studies students and students not in the major. It's an intro course, so no prior environmental knowledge is needed and it's material about business, sustainability, innovation, and international policy that all Yale students should have a basic understanding of.",
    "The course is a whirlwind of environmental policy, and it would make for a great introductory class for Evst and Energy Studies students, though still worthwhile even if you have a lot of experience because Esty is a leader and an innovator in the field. Keep in mind it's a policy class, so it's not the most exciting topic, but it is still extremely important because sustainability is the way of the future. The class was a bit repetitive at times and the policy essays were annoying and often unclear, but hopefully those problems will be corrected when he offers the course a second time.",
    "I'd recommend it only in the hopes that they'll take these criticisms into consideration and change the structure of the course. Also if you know more about EVST than an introductory level, I wouldn't recommend it. I have faith that all 3 of the guys in charge of the course really care about improving.",
    "This is a great introductory course for the concept of sustainability that is tossed around so loosely nowadays. We learned about the natural, ethical and economic aspects of the issue and also tied in current events with the COP in Paris. The professor has been involved in environmental government policy for his entire career and is really the guy to teach sustainability in its complexity.",
    "Take it! No matter your major or year. This class is extremely relevant to current events, and the scope is so broad it would be impossible to not be interested. Professor Esty is an excellent lecturer and his experience in the field lends an invaluable perspective."
