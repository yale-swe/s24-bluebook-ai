    "Only if you are interested in the history of systems and the important papers that made significant contributions to the field of computer systems.",
    "Yes, I would recommand this course to all new system PhD students. It's especially important for system guys to know the why's from history of system study.",
    "Excellent opportunity to get acquainted with current research in systems, especially OS (and more especially involving parallelism, multicore architectures, distributed systems, clouds, etc.). Excellent opportunity to make headway on a systems project. I would highly recommend this course for students particularly interested in operating systems, as well as networks, databases, compilers, and programming languages, though I would caution students that they will need already to have a substantial background in operating systems.",
    "I would recommend this CS722 to graduate students.In this course, students will review the newest and hottest research works, proposes new ideas based on what other people have achieved, and finish a project generally independently."
