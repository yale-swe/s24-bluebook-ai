    "I would recommend this class to my fellow students.",

    "I would summarize the class as a seminar-style walk through several sensory systems and exploration of functional principles common through out. I would recommend the class to another student because the lecturers and topics were well chosen and the discussion lively.",

    "This course helped give me a deeper understanding of similarities and dissimilarities between sensory systems. As a student, this wider perspective will help guide future research directions.",
    "A foundation of study of sensory systems is beneficial to my development as a neuroscientist, because it provides breadth of knowledge useful for understanding basic operating principles of the nervous system. Some of lectures provided information relevant to my dissertation research, such as Len Kaczmarek\u0092s explanation of potassium channels in the auditory system.",
    "I have learned a lot about the visual sensory system in conjunction with myinterests in neurology."
