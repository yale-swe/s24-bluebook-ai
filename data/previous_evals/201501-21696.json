    "I highly recommend doing research if you are in an engineering discipline at Yale. It is one of the only ways that you can get useful and applied skills. If you are looking to engineering as a career, then this is a must.",
    "Do it. I easily learned so much more from this than from any Yale lecture. You get to choose what project you want, learn from hands-on application, and schedule your lab hours according to your own time. There's no better way at Yale to take care of your science credit and get experience.",
    "Great option for chemical engineering elective. Everyone should do lab work at some point in their Yale career.",
    "I worked with Professor Gentner - he is amazing, he cares, and he is brilliant. If you are interested in air quality and energy transition issues, he's the man.",
    "Yes. Do it. The hours are what you make of them more or less. It's either an easy credit or a great experience.",
    "CENG 471 is an independent study course for students looking to gain first hand laboratory experience. I would recommend this course to students trying to figure out if they want to pursue research or not."
