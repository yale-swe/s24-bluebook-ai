   "comments": [
    "Easy PoliSci seminar. Take this if you're an athlete. Not much reading, but very interesting topics. Recommended.",
    "A 7\/10 seminar with weaknesses, but generally fun and low-stress.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any student interested in ethics or the corporate culture. In addition to Professor Sethi's discussions, conversations with the guest speakers were also very informative and engaging.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in business ethics as looked at through case studies; if you are interested, however, in ethical, political, and economic theory, I would advise you to look elsewhere. That being said, Professor Sethi has tons of real-world experience in this field, having been a consultant for Mattel's code of conduct initiative, and your classmates will no doubt have much to offer intellectually on the subject. This class also isn't that hard; the reading load is very manageable, and the exams and midterms are straightforward. Sethi's very chill!",
    "If you like talking about opinions instead of facts, this is a good class for you. It often seemed more like a discussion group than a class. We never really talked about the reading and there were arbitrary assignments that we had to complete which seemed more like busy work than intellectual inquiry.",
    "Great class, great look at things for people who are interested in the corporate world and why things in business happen the way they do. Take it.",
    "Good class to take if you want an intro to corporate ethics with more practical applications than theory.",
    "A highly engaging and truly relevant topic taught by an inspirational teacher.",
    "Take it! Assignments and class discussions were interesting.",
    "Great class! Be prepared to have your ideas tested and to learn just how much unethical corporate behavior there is today."
