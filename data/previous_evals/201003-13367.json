   "comments": [
    "Excellent discussion. Usable information.",
    "The course was pretty good. We discussed the changes in the healthcare landscape due to health reform and learned how to write a policy analysis. The course was too discussion based and would have benefited by having some more structured lectures. Also, a case study format would have made this class SO MUCH BETTER, especially when discussing quality. The Harvard Business Case Bridges to Excellence, for example, would have made for a better discussion. The class is too theoretical. We need to learn theory through concrete examples to make it all more real.",
    "Would be much stronger as a smaller class. We had>40 and it was WAY too big. Additionally, was repetitive of the Policy and Politics class. Would be nice to focus less on health CARE reform and more on actual policy writing and analysis.",
    "The course is somewhat disappointing. The lecture topics mirror those in the intro policy course, and the other required policy course. There is clearly an issue with the policy curriculum - the repetitive nature and theoretical emphasis. Once you get to this class you have already discussed all these topics in-depth and the discussion is tedious. That being said, Keenan does try to salvage the course by attempting to introduce additional perspectives and current issues, which does not happen in the other policy classes. The final paper does seem like a worthy exercise and its nice to have freedom on the topic. I enjoyed listening to everyone's brief presentations, 5 minutes was plenty to get a gist, while not getting bored.",
    "It's a good class if you want to delve into a topic of policy on your own and get good critique from the professor.",
    "Strengths: Good, relevant readings. Course is organized well.Weaknesses: Sometimes too many readings? Class discussions could have been better if they were less controlled by Prof. Keenan or if we could have sat in a semi-circle or something. They felt too moderated sometimes and not \"free\" enough.",
    "Class discussions were not focused or structured enough. The class is too big and too homogeneous for such a lack of structure. There needs to be some lecture component, even if its brief. I found the readings disconnected from the rest of the course and stopped doing them pretty early on.",
    "This course should not be 100% discussion based. I would much rather have heard what the professor had to say about health policy than my peers and undergrads who have never worked before. There was no instruction at all and very little useful policy application. There should be more in class policy analysis instead of only the individual project. The presentations were a waste of 4 classes (the one minute pre-paper and 3 classes on 5 minute post-paper) which is too much for a class that only meets once a week. Overall, it overlapped too much with politics and policy. While not a direct criticism of this class, the policy program is lacking a course that actually goes through government structure and agencies that are relevant to health policy and implementation. It's a shame because healthcare reform introduced new agencies that people in a policy program SHOULD know about.",
    "Unfortunately, this course taught almost nothing about policy analysis. We only spent one single class period going over a basic overview of policy analysis. We were also given 1 handout with the basics of policy analysis and this was the extent that we learned about policy analysis during the entire semester. The rest of the course periods were spent discussing different parts of the health reform bill, but we did not use any \"policy analysis\" in these discussions. While it may be important for students in HPA to learn about the health reform bill, it should not have been the focus of a course that was supposed to teach us one of the fundamental skills that we should graduate from this program with and we will be expected to know as we enter the field of public health. This class was extremely disappointing, as it is one of the core courses for HPA and we by no means learned \"advanced applications of policy analysis\" (which is ironic since that is the title of the course).",
    "The health policy department really needs some help. This class was about as good as other policy classes I've taken, most of which have been sub-par. The readings for this class added little if anything to class discussion, and vice versa. I don't feel like I know anything more about health policy than I did at the beginning of the semester. We really need more practical and tangible knowledge. Speakers who can talk first hand about policy making, trips to see policy being made, etc. would really help. Aside from that, making class more interactive is really essential.",
    "Strengths: covered a variety of interest and important topics; the course paper provided a structured understanding of policy analysisWeaknesses: for a course entitled \"ADVANCED Applications in Policy Analysis,\" I did come come out of the course feeling as though I had an advanced set of analysis skills. The course was mostly topic-based, and we did not spend enough time discussing how to analyze policy options systematically. It would have been beneficial to read through actual analyses as to see REAL examples of policy analysis. More discussion of analysis theory and applications of analysis in Congressional settings would have been useful.The class size was also a major weakness and did not allow for an inclusive discussion. In the future, I would recommend 2 classes, with no more than 10-15 students each.Also, the fact that we had only 5 minutes to present a 20 page paper was not realistic and did not allow for an understanding of individuals' analyses. Even if Congressional testimony is only 5 minutes, an expert witness never presents the background of the issue PLUS a full analysis of different policy options when they testify. I know the 5-minute limit was in interest of time given the size of the class, but it was a little frustrating.",
    "I liked the fact that this course focused on health reform. This gave me a good working knowledge of contemporary health policy issues that I believe will benefit me as I move forward in my career.",
    "As every health policy student has come to expect, this required health policy course was yet another disappointment in our academic career at Yale.",
    "I love the class discussions, and I found handing in drafts of our paper very helpful.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics and readings; dedicated professor; small class size; useful and reasonable assignmentsImprovement: Each class could be much more structured in order to maximize productive discussion. For example, for the first 30 minutes of the class, the professor could give an overview of the week's topic; for the next 30 minutes, the students could discuss and analyze the topic (either as a whole class or in small groups); and for the final 50 minutes, the professor could conduct an activity that encourages the students to think about the broader implications of the week's topic for politics\/policymaking.",
    "I really liked that we actually learned about the reform law--it was the most practically useful class I've taken at YSPH. But the format relied too heavily on student participation. I would have enjoyed more lecture and a little less dependence on individual student opinion.",
    "I thought that the class at first was going to be a particularly engaging and finally, in the policy curriculum, we were going to really get into policy analysis and construction. After a few class session however, the class devolved into more of debate class, where lots of uninformed opinions were cast (sometimes the opinions sounded informed, but really weren't too!) The folks in the 5-year BA\/MPH program think that they are adding to the class by participating 8-times per class session, but i found their contributions generally naive (and i think the same for most folks who've actually been out in the hc world for a few years). I know that Prof Keenan tried hard, but I think it is difficult to have a seminar format with 30+ individuals with disparate interests. I think that if we really wanted to learn policy analysis, we would have had 6-8 smaller assignments in which each one attempted to practice one new aspect of analysis or construction."

    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Keenan is wonderful. Fun to talk to on a one on one level and a great professor. She's probably the best policy professor at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Keenan is a very impressive discussion leader, she transitions well and introduces perspectives and new information with a keen sense of the classes interest. She is fighting a losing battle though, as the topics are repetitive. Her resources and feedback on the policy analysis are very useful though, I appreciated her efforts.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0She's really nice, helpful and encourages independent and critical thinking.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Prof. Keenan gives great feedback on assignments. She is fairly clear about her expectations. Assigned readings were relevant.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Really nice. Smart. Needs to take a more active role in spurring discussion, asking critical questions. Also consider building in a way to motivate people to do more reading, such as less reading but more focused assignments...or a little more Socratic method.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0She was largely unresponsive and seemed more preoccupied with being pregnant and having a baby than helping students in her class.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0It is obvious that Dr. Keenan really knows a lot about health policy, but it would have been nice to hear her talk about it more. I do enjoy class discussion, but I'm not as interested in what my peers have to say as I am in what my professor has to say.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Strenghts: friendly, approachable, good at facilitating discussionWeaknesses: responses to email were always extremely brief; did not incorporate analysis enough into lecture",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Professor Keenan does a good job making the material engaging and relevant. She asks the class thought provoking questions, and isn't afraid to push students to think beyond their initial reactions.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Like each one of our required policy courses, the professor did not teach, but rather assigned extraneous course material and expected students to rely upon their previous educational background to deliver a product.I should emphasis Professor Keenan was no worse then any of the professors that have been put up in front of us for our health policy curriculum. It is the department that is clearly at fault here - not the professors.Also, in the future, it would be helpful if students could receive one grade per assignment. Receiving multiple assignments that have two grades (out of the four possible - H\/HP\/P\/F) does not help student recognize where they are (grade wise) in the course.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Professor Keenan is a fantastic instructor.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Strengths: knowledge of the material; dedication to studentsWeakness: could run a more structured class",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0I think that Prof Keenan tried her best and was a strong and informed lecturer. I think that her efforts would have been better served in trying to build new skills for us."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent course",
    "Decent survey of the major aspects of current health policy (topics, debates, challenges); as is, you get the most out of the readings. Class discussion offers opportunity to clarify occasional unclear topics, but generally lacks some structure. Upside: semester-long policy project allows one to develop significant knowledge-base and understanding of policy relevance of issue of interest.",
    "Overall, a nice course with a nice amount of flexibility in what you can focus on individually. A little too heavy on health care reform, but maybe in years to come, that won't be such a big deal.",
    "I did not learn a single thing in this course. It either needs to be significantly restructured or not mandatory for policy students. Based on the fact that this is the second required policy course I've taken that was a complete waste of time (politics and policy was the other), I am incredibly disappointed with the program as a whole and would tell incoming policy students NOT to come here for this program.",
    "HPA students are required to take it and I sincerely hope they improve it so that other students can actually be prepared in policy analysis when they graduate from the program.",
    "It's required for health policy students, but for those of you who aren't in health policy, I wouldn't recommend this class.",
    "Interesting course material, but disappointing if you're hoping to walk away with a strong set of policy analysis skills. I would still recommend it, though.",
    "Fabulous course. I know it's required, but it's still great and health policy concentrators should look forward to taking it!",
    "You've got to take it, so I guess you're not supposed to care how little you get out of the course. This is an incredibly sad state of affairs.",
    "Yes! I would recommend it!",
    "Overview of several relevant health policy topics (e.g. health insurance exchanges, medical-loss ratio)",
    "Another policy course in the curriculum that disappointed. I had high hopes, and some of the topics were interesting, but in the end, i just didn't come away with enough either new knowledge or skills in this class."
