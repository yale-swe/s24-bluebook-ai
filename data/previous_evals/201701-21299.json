    "I feel I truly learned a lot about Chinese society and the specifics of major challenges it faces. I also learned a huge amount of vocabulary and language skills, and gained ample practice engaging in high-level conversations in Chinese, giving presentations on specific topics, and writing formal-style essays addressing societal issues.",
    "I learned how to read Chinese news articles, deliver Chinese oral presentations, and discuss social issues.",
    "Zhou Laoshi has been enforcing the habit of regularly reading Chinese news. Additionally we have learned to use considerably more sophisticated grammar and vocabulary.",
    "Reading Chinese newspapers and other media sources Discussing Chinese social issues Familiarity and practice with formal\/high level Chinese writing style, including how to balance sentences so that they sound authentic and pleasing Extremely interesting high level vocabulary - you realize just how much imagery is in the Chinese language.",
    "I learned about various Chinese social issues, as well as advanced grammar, vocabulary and phrases that are often used in Chinese media.",
    "How to quickly read articles in Chinese and extract the main points and then have a discussion about them.",
    "Speaking about advanced topics and looking for higher level grammar patterns."

    "This course was interesting because it taught me how to synthesize information in Chinese and learn practical skills for reading Chinese in the \"real world\".",
    "This is a very good course. The work is very time consuming, which can be tough if you have a lot of other things going on. But Laoshi is understanding, and honestly all of the work is worth it for the greater understanding you get along the way.",
    "The material was always chosen very well, and professor Zhou always made sure that each article included enough new vocab and enough old vocab so that it was challenging, but still doable. I love that we didn't have a textbook and instead got to use the articles to create our own vocab lists.",
    "The course was extremely work heavy which allowed for us to cover a lot of activist causes in Chinese. Learning did happen. I do think the course was poorly organized as assignment turn ins were posted to canvas at the last minute which caused confusion among students as to whether there was something due or not. The final test review guide was also given at the last minute. This caused students to not have enough time to truly review and know the material; the midterm was fine as Spring Break was given as prep time. Homework grades seemed arbitrary and no feedback was ever given. Improvement was almost impossible in this case."

    "Absolutely! The course requires consistent effort, but is reasonable and rewarding. It gives a great view into China's challenges as a whole, as well as more in-depth inquiry into a few major topics. Discussions are engaging and productive, and assignments are reasonable and often fun. Zhou laoshi is very supportive and welcoming, and the course has a great atmosphere and tone. I learned a ton of high-level vocabulary and sentence structures I had never seen before and I have developed much better reading and comprehension skills after reading the many news articles and other sources this course provided.",
    "Yes! The teacher is great and the subject is very interesting. It is a great high level Chinese course.",
    "This is probably the best Chinese elective course. Zhou Laoshi is a fantastic professor and really cares for his student's learning. There is considerable work for this class but graded on one's ability to improve",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If you are at all serious about bringing your Chinese to a higher level, then this is exactly the course to take. You are exposed to sources that show you exactly the level of Chinese being used out in the world and you are able to learn from them. It is also a good course for better understanding China in general.",
    "The course covers various Chinese social issues, as well as advanced grammar, vocabulary and phrases that are often used in Chinese media. It's a good way to continue your Chinese studies at Yale, especially to strengthen your understanding of formal Chinese. The workload is doable and I would recommend it to other Yalies.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to keep up their chiense without having to put in an absurd amount of work. The topics are all super interesting. And you really get out of the class what you put in. Meaning if you really want to learn a lot, you can go above and beyond and make very detailed vocab lists. Zhou laoshi is amazing and he really puts a lot of time into making sure that the articles that he chooses are interesting and at the right level.",
    "Learn chengyus like it's your job! Prepare to work very hard."
