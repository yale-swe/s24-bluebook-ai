   "comments": [
    "Brief overview of history of immigration to the United States; economic\/social\/cultural\/religious\/political issues historically; immigrant identity; illegal immigration; gender and immigration; race and immigration; transnational identities; and lots, lots more! This was a great class. As with all seminars, your fellow students are really what make the class great or crappy--and we definitely lucked-out this semester. It was great. Everyone seemed to be in the class because they cared about the issues, and had something unique to bring to the table. I DON'T think this was a fluke; this is the type of course that draws people who are interested and committed. Sign up and have fun!",
    "YES I would recommend this class to any student interested in issues of migration\/immigration, legal\/illegal citizenship, issues of race, class, and gender.",
    "Very interactive. You get what you put into it. Definitely meet with her to discuss papers.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT IF YOU CAN! This is probably the best course I have ever taken at Yale. The people in this class come from various backgrounds but are all interested in immigration issues. The readings are very interesting, and class discussions were lively and thought-provoking. Professor Pessar really wants you to learn, and she is extremely helpful. It is one of the rare gems at Yale. If you are interested in U.S. immigration, definitely take it. Even if you are not, consider taking it (but you may have a hard time getting into the seminar).",
    "Great course--really enjoyed the topics learned. But not much info on actual immigration policy and reform.",
    "Great course on the social, cultural, political, and economic aspects of immigration.",
    "This course covers the major issues stemming from immigration trends since 1965. Does a great job at incorporating different disciplinary approaches and giving a solid overview of the topic. Professor Pessar brings a lot of enthusiasm to seminar and class discussions always reflect that. A fair amount of reading but an overall very manageable workload. Definitely recommend it.",
    "New Immigrants in the US is a great course! It's your standard seminar so there's a good deal of reading each week but every article is interesting and sparks a lot of discussion. You will be responsible in leading one class session; there are two papers during the semester. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in both immigration law and the clash of cultures.",
    "If someone is intersted in immigration, they would like it. If someone isn't, I'm not sure they would be motivated enough to do the readings and as a result, they would miss out on a lot.",
    "Great class. Not a lot of work. Eloquent professor. Very American Studies-like class i.e. emphasis on the immigrant\/migrant transnational imaginary\/experience, race and gender, etc; not so much emphasis on policy\/politics. If you're looking for an immigrant's understanding of immigration, take it. More of a focus on 'soft' issues.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who was interested in the topic-- you really need to engage with and enjoy learning from the readings in order to get your best out of the class. I would summarize it as a course on contemporary issues in immigration in the U.S.",
    "Overall this was a pretty good class. I feel better informed and better equipped to think about a relevant current topic coming out of the course. The workload was fair but not excessive. My only complaint was that because many students were immigrants or the children of immigrants sometimes the class discussion was more about sharing personal stories that discussing issues or concepts.",
    "Take this course! Especially if you have absolutely any interest in public policy. Great debates, discussion and really interesting readings. A very relevant and important issue that more yalies should be educated about.",
    "Yes take this course. It is a very interesting class and is not hard. There is a fair amount of reading and only two essays. And there are no reading responses, all you have to do is submit three questions on the reading each week. Professor Pessar is awesome too."
