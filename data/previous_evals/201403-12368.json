    "As someone who switched from 170 to 180 six weeks into the semester, I'd like to say that I find 180 far better taught and much more applicable toward MB&B than 170 is. 180 is as straightforward as AP Physics would have been had I had a better AP Physics teacher. The straightforward approach helped me to understand the concepts on a deeper level than the \"biological applications\" approach of 170. Make sure you shop all of the intro physics classes, though, because it really is about personal preference. If you do pick 180, make sure you keep up with the online homework. It's an easy way to boost your grade--but if you forget the deadlines, it'll come back to haunt you.",
    "The flipped classroom is the absolute worst thing that has ever happened to physics. The issue here is multifold. First, smartphysics sucks and is the bane of my existence. Second, lecture doesn't correlate AT ALL with smartphysics, and we never get enough information to do real problems. To explain further: smartphysics is meant to be a small intro with lecure building off of it, and we never get the build, so we're just really stupid now because the system is fucked. I wished to die on the way to class. Every time.",
    "Boring and bad, but take it I guess if you're an engineer looking for the easier intro physics sequence.",
    "If another student didn't have to take it as a prerequisite, I would not recommend this class. I have learned a lot, but I find the course to be poorly done and with material this difficult when it is poorly done it becomes incredibly stressful. I very much hope that PHYS 181 next semester is done more efficiently.",
    "Only take this class if you have to take it as a prerequisite for your major or for other classes you want to take. The level of difficulty in lectures (low--pretty boring) does not match up with the difficulty of the problems you are expected to solve on problem sets. Also, you are required to watch prelectures before each class, but then Professor Barrett proceeds to repeat everything you just watched rather than going into more detail or going through interesting\/tricky problems.",
    "AVOID AT ALL COSTS! The was by far the WORST course I have taken at Yale. The lectures were dull and added almost nothing to the prelecture material. The problem sets often included concepts not covered in class (I was under the impression that they were written by the TAs--who did not attend classes--rather than by the professors). The problem sessions were largely unhelpful as there is no way for 2 TAs to answer over 100 students' questions. Overall, this course was terribly orchestrated. DO NOT TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend it if you are strong in physics. Just some advice: learn to think in terms of variables right away. Solve everything in terms of variables. This strategy will help you IMMENSELY in exams.",
    "Average class, smartphysics (the online learning program we use) was really good, and I basically learned everything from there (going to lecture was kind of pointless). The problem sets were way too difficult and harshly graded - I don't think the TA's who write them or grade them are very familiar with smartphysics so the written problem sets were just really stressful and did not help me learn concepts very well. Definitely go to the \"optional\" weekly sections though - the practice problems you get there are very helpful. Exams were very fair.",
    "Barrett didn't (I think) grade clicker questions so you don't have to go to class. midterms are easy since they put up previous years' midterms for practice and the questions are very similar. I thought problem sets were hard but they don't take more than 2 hours.",
    "The lectures could be improved by teaching us how to approach physics problems. The problem sets did not reflect the final and I felt worse prepared for physics through this class than my high school class... We need more practice that's relevant!",
    "The bottom line: smartphysics (online physics textbook\/homework site) replaces lecture hands down. I got nothing from lecture and only went because you have to answer poll questions to show you attended. Psets are okay for the first couple weeks and then start ramping up in terms of difficulty. Use the TA-led study sessions. Exams are so-so, but watch out for conceptual multiple choice questions.",
    "PHYS 180 is a standard physics class. There are lots of small assignments, but nothing too major. Paying attention and doing the work outside of class is the most important part to doing well.",
    "Only take this class if its required for your major. Otherwise, go take a much more interesting class to satisfy the science requirement. However, if youre trying to decide between physics classes, Id say this one was pretty straightforward and structured with the SmartPhysics program they use. If youve taken AP Physics C, this class wont exactly be interesting, but itll be relatively easy to get through the prereq. There are daily prelectures\/homework assignments, but theyre not too bad since they help you completely understand the material. As for the lectures however, dont expect them to be at all helpful. I only went to click my clicker, and listen on and off, but if you do the homework during class, its not a waste of time.",
    "If you want to do a STEM major, just get through it. If not, find another way to get a Science or Quantitative reasoning credit.",
    "I did learn a lot of physics in this class, but it was overall a rather painful process. Smartphysics (the only lectures) are a great idea and really helpful, but you should definitely come up with some kind of a routine so that you remember to do the prelectures and homework problems each night. The lectures are rather long and boring, and the problem sets toward the end of the course got very difficult. Tests are challenging but doable. I'd assume that if you're thinking about taking this course, you have it as a class requirement - this course gets the job done, but I wasn't very impressed with the class.",
    "Feels like high school. Online homework every night with strict deadlines. Material is not too challenging. I would not take this class unless it was a requirement for something else.",
    "Wouldn't have taken this class unless I had to. Not too challenging, but also failed to engage or make me any more interested in Physics. Homework was relatively simple, but there was online homework and written homework to do, which made it frustrating to do. I hated Smartphsyics and the whole \"flipping the classroom\" approach. When done right, flipping the classroom can work very well, but Phys180 relied on prelectures waywaywayway too much. I didn't even need to go to lecture by the end of the semester since all the information I needed to succeed in class was in the prelecture online.",
    "I think the class was pretty decently challenging; it's certainly not as easy as your friends may suggest. I also think that the Smartphysics reverse classroom method has its merits, but I would suggest more targeted learning during class. A lot of the time, it seemed like we were going through the prelectures again in class or a deep proof of a concept that didn't seem completely necessary or informative. If we could go over the concepts that the class seems to be struggling on, as proven by the statistics you guys get on the checkpoint answers. Hoping the curve is nice. HERE IS THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE THE CLASS: WORK FROM A SUPPLEMENTAL TEXTBOOK IN PARALLEL WITH WHAT YOU LEARN IN CLASS. I started doing this after a poor-ish score on the first midterm and started doing much, much better.",
    "I took this class because I needed it for my major and it is my least favorite course thus far. The class is poorly organized and Prof Barrett's lectures are not worth going to. I didn't go to class for more than half of the semester. Tests are fair, but having to do online SmartPhysics every night is annoying.",
    "The actual lectures are horrible. The information is good. Study by taking old exams. I recommend it only because it is the class that covers classical mechanics in a way that prepares you for the MCAT. If you are not taking the MCAT or if you can place into another physics class then don't take 180. Also, sign up for Professor Ramos' section and not Professor Barrett's.",
    "I kind of wish I took 170. I am pre med but wanted a more standard physics class, so I went with 180. At first 170 seemed like too much bio and more work. But I think 180 ended up having just as much work.",
    "Pure hell.",
    "It's a good introductory physics class for non-physics majors.",
    "Worst class I've taken, and I would advise to anyone that it should be avoided at all costs. It is stressful, time-consuming, and incredibly frustrating. I felt that, although I understood the material, I never was able to prove that because the problem sets are graded so harshly and the exams covered different material than the rest of the class.",
    "I would not recommend PHYS 180 unless you need it as a prerequisite for your major or another class. The material is not interesting and it is poorly taught. Be prepared to find alternate avenues of instruction to understand the material.",
    "I would summarize this course as a difficult class that forces you to teach yourself nearly everything. I would only recommend this class to someone who needs it for his\/her major.",
    "An okay class; Barrett really cares about teaching and his students, which is unfortunate because the material is rather boring. If you have to take intro physics 200 or below, I would definitely recommend him. Workload includes an online prelecture and homework before ever class which take an hour each, and psets once a week that take 5-6 hours. Tests aren't particularly hard.",
    "Please dear god do not take this class, unless they begin to put an effort into differentiating the classroom experience from the online SmartPhysics portion of this course. It was worthless (and painful) coming to lecture, as most of the time there were no demonstrations, and the clicker questions were checkpoints that were due the night before. Lectures were essentially VERBATIM from the required prelecture we were forced to watch before class, with exactly the same proofs. For spending close to $10,000 tuition on this course, I could have easily gotten the same experience from simply purchasing the $30 SmartPhysics book or online course. I'm sure there are many of these comments, and I think that Professor Barrett is an extraordinarily smart and nice individual, but the course itself is simply not up to par.",
    "This course is most likely required for your major if you are considering it so you don't have a choice. You may wan't to consider Ramos as your instructor because Barret's class time wasn't the most effective. Also be prepared for assignments practically everyday and the class takes up far more time than you would initially think because of that.",
    "Dont take this course unless you must. The different assessments do not match up, and the problem sets are unnecessarily difficult. If you must take this, I would high recommend the weekly study hall before the problem set. Its a good way to meet other people in the class and commiserate and work through the problems together. The TFs who wrote the problems are also there to answer questions. Depending on how you schedule your time, this class could mean nightly homework, with the prelectures before class and homework after each class. In the end, this class was more frustrating than it needed to be.",
    "Not the best or worst class. I did poorly at first but gradually improved as the course went on. TAs were useless, problem sets were not representative of content emphasized on tests, tests were fair but challenging. Smartphysics, although it seems like a pain at first, will keep you on your game throughout the semester: embrace it as your friend and you will do fine.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's not a very well constructed class.",
    "I would not recommend it. I really wanted to learn physics, but the reasons mentioned in Question 1 made it very hard for me to learn.",
    "SmartPhysics was not a bad system to work with, and the material is easy. That being said, Professor Barret and the TF's make this class unnecessarily difficult as the professor did not teach, and the TF's did not care. For example, instead of learning how to apply different formulas, we only re-derived equations in class. On the problem sets, Sean did not write them; instead, the TF's wrote what seemed to be hastily put together problem sets that were non-topical and irrelevant to what we had learned and the type of questions we were asked on tests. Just pitiful.",
    "To be honest, no, I would not recommend this course. I just think you're going to be frustrated because you don't get the proper output for your input: even though I absolutely worked my ass off for this course, that time and effort is not reflected in my understanding of physics, nor in my grade. I don't feel any better versed than when I came into the course. The information shouldn't be that tough, but this is a really really tough course. If you can, I'd really recommend taking something else. If you can't do that, that's okay, just know that this is going to be frustrating... but if you can get through it, you are awesome! I went into this course as a freshman toying with the idea of double majoring with physics and something else. Luckily for me, I have instead decided that the something else is far more suited to my strengths and thus will probably not be pursuing physics again until I'm old. But if you are taking this course because you want to major in physics but don't have enough background to start at a higher level: I send you mental vibes of strength and blueberries and other awesome motivating things. It is a shitty undertaking, because you are going to have to work way harder than those other kids who can just breeze into 260 to end up at the same point by graduation. And that sucks, I know. But I believe in you. Moral of this story: if you really have to take 180, go dropkick it right in the face!",
    "The class sucks. It overcomplicates everything, the TA's aren't great and smartphysics is useless and a lot of extra work. I think it might be better to take PHYS 200 and struggle through that and at least have a proper text book, smaller class and more attention to help you than sitting in such a big lecture and struggling to figure out abstract concepts on your own that actually are pretty straightforward if you have someone explain it to you thorougly. Only take it if you really have to. It's awful.",
    "Absolutely the worst course I have taken at Yale, and hopefully the worst I will ever take. There is no redeeming element for which you should take this course. Choose either 170 or 200 depending upon why you want to take physics. Phys 180 is like a continuation of high school, but more insulting. The grades are based in large part upon attendance and time spent watching videos. For a school which claims that most of the Yale experience is outside of the classroom, it seems particularly inappropriate for a professor to require students to give up time every week to watch lectures in advance, do nightly homework problems, attend lecture to cover the same material, and then also go to mandatory section for the same material. Clearly the professor intends for this to ensure that the students learn physics, but it is an improper demand on student time. The physics department believes that mastery is more important than effort, as is shown by the policy of giving A's for good scores on finals regardless of other coursework. The demands on time reflect a lack of trust in the students to manage their own time and work on the material as necessary for their own learning, time is demanded regardless of ability level. This is a complete waste for students who could understand the material with less time invested and who would gain more from spending the time on other things, and is also demonstrative of a fundamental distrust of Yale students to be managers of their own time. On top of this issue, the problem sets are of very low quality. They are written by the TA's, not the professor, and are only loosely related to the material covered in class. It was virtually impossible to complete them without going to TA office hours, and even then the TA's who had not written the problem sets were often unable to solve the problems given. Mind you, I intend to be a math major and found the exams quite easy. To resolve this, simplifying assumptions were announced, often the night before the PSETs were due, further making it useless to attempt them independently. Although problem sets should push the students to extend the material learned in class, these PSETs required the use of the internet to find the proper formulas, which were often not used again in the class. It is my full intention to actively dissuade any friend of mine from ever taking PHYS 180 or 181 upon the basis of these issues and similar complaints from my friends in the class.",
    "I took this class purely for prerequisite purposes. I did not want to take 200 because I had heard bad things about it, and I was extremely pleased with my decision to take 180. I still feel like I have a very solid understanding of mechanics now, and the class was not too much work at all.",
    "Unless you need it for your major or you already have a solid understanding of physics (recently took AP physics and did well for example), I would not recommend this class. Even if you have the qualifications that I mentioned, I still wouldn't describe this as a good class, bur rather just bearable and something that wouldn't be took bad. I would describe this class as an introductory physics course with a massive disconnect between the lecture, problem sets, and tests, and taught by a good professor who just lectures on irrelevant topics in class. The online homework is informative, and likely where you will kern most of the course material, but it does get pretty annoying. So if you can avoid this class, do.",
    "Tough class only due to circumstance",
    "If you don't need to take it, don't.",
    "This class is the best of your intro physics options. A lot of people complain about it, but it's a straightforward class that will teach you basic physics. The other levels are either waaaaaay more work (phys 200 and 260) or seem to spend time on a lot of topics that are only tangentially related to physics (phys 170). The online work can be frustrating, but it also keeps you current with the material. The tests are fair; many classmates I know worried about them too much and over-studied for them. (If it helps to know, I'm a bio major.)",
    "Sean Barrett is an embarrassment to the University. I have never seen a teacher put so little effort into any class. It was not possible for him to physically care any less. This was the worst I have ever taken. I would be better off in class dead than alive because it was a complete waste of time. No one cared at all in this. Not the TAs teachers and eventually students. Unless this is absolutely mandatory do not take this class!! I repeat do not take this class. Commit suicide before you decide to take this class.",
    "PHYS 180 provides a good introduction into college-level physics. However, a significant portion of the course utilized SmartPhysics, which is an online program where students listen to pre-lectures and complete homework problems. The course relied heavily on students fully internalizing the material from the pre-lectures, which were often excessive and confusing. When deciding between the three introductory level physics courses (180,200,260), PHYS 180 might be the closest to a AP Physics C high school level physics course, where as PHYS 200 is a flipped classroom advanced physics course, and PHYS 260 is a highly mathematical introduction to physics.",
    "This class went about as well as an intro physics class can go, and the material is not noticeably different from the stuff you did in high school. That said, it's probably the best choice if you have a shabby physics background and want a primer in important key concepts. While Professor Barrett's lectures didn't usually illuminate concepts that I found confusing in the pre-lectures, he was himself a delightful presence, with a clear enthusiasm for teaching and physics, and that counts for a lot. He also provided tons of resources, making it as easy as possible to succeed if you took advantage of them.",
    "Unless you are positive that you want to major in physics, that PHYS 180 is necessary for your major, or you are just gifted at the subject, I would not recommend that you take this class. It is confusing, stressful, and the way that the material is presented in class and in the homework does not prepare you for the tests. In addition, you basically have to teach yourself the lesson the night before the lecture for homework, and then the exact information that you taught yourself is repeated in class the next day with little to no variation. It is a very poorly designed system.",
    "Absolutely awful. This is almost certainly the worst course I have taken at Yale. That said, if you're reading this, you probably don't have much of an option so here are a few more specific comments. (1) The course does not do a good job bridging the various means of evaluation. Discussion section presents questions in a different way than online homework which presents questions in a different way than written problem sets and a different way still from tests. Rather than reinforcing material, this just proves confusing and problem sets are often impossible to a degree that does not enhance learning but rather encourages failure. (2) Lectures are disorganized. Sean Barrett struggles to focus on getting through the material. (3) If you have never had exposure to physics before or have limited exposure to physics, it is hard to do well within the curve. Many people taking this course took AP in high school and are better at physics than they admit. (4) This course has a TON of homework that piles up. Not even counting necessary studying because the material was so hard, the homework alone was my most consistently time-consuming homework this semester. That said, I did learn some stuff occasionally. I would encourage you to shop around with Physics courses to see if you can take an alternative. If not, you'll survive I'm surebut be prepared to work hard. Best of luck!",
    "This is by far the worst class I've taken at Yale. Here's what I would do: If you're pre-med, take Phys 170. Medical schools won't care if there's a 7 or an 8 on your transcript and believe me Sean Barrett is not the guy you want to spend 3 hours with each week. If you're engineering, take 200. It'll probably be harder but at least you won't hate yourself twice a week. If you can somehow not take this class, don't take it. Honestly you only get to take so many classes at Yale, don't waste your time with Sean Barrett and PHYS 180.",
    "Don't take it. Horrible time with problem sets.",
    "You must be self-motivated to keep up with the material to be successful in this course.",
    "Lecturer is sometimes confusing. Lectures mostly repeated pre-lecture content and some explanations were unnecessary. A lot of work required - there are prelectures, online homework, written homework, and a lot to learn. The written homework problems were really far off from what's taught in class, so you have to go to study hall sessions on Sunday nights to answer them. Doesn't match well with class. Still .. you learn a lot and it was a fun class.",
    "If you enjoy physics, or want to do something with physics, it's a good class to take, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it",
    "Likely you are taking this course because it's required as a prerequisite and is unavoidable. This course is very frustrating, especially the PSETs because they do not help you understand the material, only confuse it.",
    "It's an intro physics course, hard to describe. It's a lot of lecture, a lot of problem sets and pretty unforgiving grading, but you get used to it. Lecture is halfway optional, and people treat it with a worrying amount of disrespect. We need some pop-quizzes or something!",
    "I would not recommend this class to any students who are interested in physics--very little productive teaching is done in class, and most learning is done at home from random websites.",
    "I took this course for a science credit. Problem sets can take a while, and the online work is sometimes repetitive and time intensive. However, it is helpful and you will learn a good amount if you put in the effort.",
    "A lot of unhelpful work.",
    "It's required for PreMed, so you have to take it. Good luck w\/ Barrett; the class will bore you to death.",
    "Take it if you have to, but it wasn't fun. Difficult material, smartphysics sucks really bad, and if you don't understand something you are left behind fast.",
    "Most often taken by students required to go through it -- I'd recommend substituting 170 if possible. I took 180 because I thought it would provide a better introduction to the topics of physics, and that's probably true, but it isn't worth suffering through this class just to learn that. Professor Barrett does a good job, and the class' weakness isn't his fault -- it's simply a large, difficult lecture course meant to give harsh grades. Be prepared for that.",
    "The flipped classroom is bad. The learning is based on the online lectures and not very much on the inclass lectures, which makes it very challenging. The professor is great. The problem set questions are prepared not by the professor but by the TAs and we end up trying to solve questions we haven't really learned in class. Some aspects of the course are weirdly structured, but you will enjoy it if you like physics.",
    "Physics 180 is an introduction to newtonian physics, kinematics, thermo, and fluids. I can not recommend it in it's current form until a proper balance can be struck between online coursework due and written problem sets."
