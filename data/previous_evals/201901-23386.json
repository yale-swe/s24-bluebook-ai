    "Nice overview of the most recent applications of quant methods, current debates surrounding them, and deeper understanding of some of them.",
    "I got ample practice reading and critiquing scholarly work on a variety of topics and became more comfortable talking through methodological questions with my peers.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of different causal approaches across various disciplines, and a newfound confidence in reading and critiquing causal inference papers.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "More lecture times (even 30min at the beginning of each class) would be useful. Lectures could focus on the methods used in the paper, to make sure that the method and the details of its application are understood. The rest of the class could be used for discussions and debates, but I think both the discussions and debates would be made better if we were all working from a common framework and understanding. The choice of readings was great, 2 papers a week is a reasonable number that allowed us to really engage with each of the readings, and the weekly emails were also very useful in understanding some less formal debates and backs-and-forths between different scholars. Maybe we spent a little too much time on some methods (DiD) and could have used this time to explore even more methods.",
    "I think that this course could benefit from weekly readings\/discussions that were slightly more structured. I think that sometimes in class discussions would get a bit off topic and lose some students (including myself at times). Giving more structure to the readings of the papers and the discussion itself would provide students with ways to re-enter discussion if they got lost or prevent that from happening in the first place.",
    "The greatest strength is Winston! He is such a thoughtful educator and does a great job leading discussions in class. I loved that the class was discussion-based, because it opened room for productive debate.",
    "Could have more assignments throughout the term to encourage internalization of concepts. Very thoughtful professor and listens to the students a lot."

   "comments": [
    "I think it needs to be made clearer to the students in the political science department that this is the class in the quant sequence where they'll be introduced to concrete applications of the methods. A lot of students are looking for more applied introductions to methods. This class, with a little bit more structure and lecture time, could come very close to what a lot of students look for.",
    "Absolutely! It's the kind of course where you get out what you put in. You can fudge your way through while doing very little work, but you will be bored and unfulfilled. If you come prepared with thoughts and questions about the papers, you'll be rewarded with a fascinating discussion."
