   "comments": [
    "I would summarize the course by listing it as a seminar, involving a different speaker each week (mostly from outside Yale) on the topic of global health. It is not an introductory course on global health, so one might do well to have some background in global health before taking this course. As the course stands, I would not recommend it to another student, unless there were significant changes in the way the course was facilitated, such that students received more feedback and instruction from the main professors, Pogge and Ruger.",
    "The class gives you different people's perspectives on various global health issues. There's no overarching theme but on the other hand you get to hear about a lot of different things. Some topics may not be as interesting but it's a tradeoff. I would recommend it to another student because its a good introduction to global health issues.",
    "I would recommend the course because it presents an opportunity to interact with quite an impressive array of speakers. However, students should not expect the professors to be very involved."

   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to new information in global health, but rarely touched on the other disciplines that I am studying here at Yale. This was not a drawback to the course, but I wish that I had received more instruction so that I could have established more of a backgroud in global health. The course has great potential, but I was sorely dissapointed in what I experienced.",
    "Since my field is International Development this course helped me gain a better understanding of the subset of health issues. I am planning to continue work in global health and so this course helped me in that regard."
