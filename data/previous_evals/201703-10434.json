    "I felt like I learned a lot in the first half of the semester about formal aspects of design. In the second half, it was harder to pin down exactly what I was learning. Overall, it was useful to be exposed to and get practice with designing different forms of media (logo, poster, etc.).",
    "One of the best classes i've taken at yale and I'm not an art major!",
    "This class is an introduction to the fundamentals of design",
    "This course is a very introductory level approach to graphic design. You DO NOT learn the programs used for design as you do everything by hand (woo hoo for cutting and glueing paper!!!). You learn how to think through design and the proper language to talk about design. I channeled a much more creative side of me than I even thought existed! You learn through critiquing each others work - you learn so much but looking at how other people approach the same prompt, what they suggest about your work, and what you think looks good on their work.",
    "I learned the principles of Graphic Design and foundational knowledge in visual marks, persuasive poster design, and typography.",
    "Intro to Graphic Design provides a comprehensive and functional vocabulary and principles set that helps to greatly improve design techniques and thinking. Through well designed assignments, students were able to use these skills to create independent work which would then be critiqued by the professor, classmates and oneself. This was a great structure to facilitate learning.",
    "I learned about the basics of graphic design",
    "Lots of designing and evaluating others design. You get a keener eye for it, and terms to describe what youre seeing.",
    "Graphic visual sensibility"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall the course was enjoyable, but I would have liked there to be a little more structure in the organization. Was often confused about when things were due and what the guidelines were. Maybe it was because I have never taken an art class before and am not used to the lack of structure.",
    "Lots of work but worth it",
    "The format of occasional lectures and alternating workshop days and critique days provided good variety and helped me stay motivated and invested in the projects. It was nice to spend lots of time workshopping but I feel like I would like to have more smaller projects to look back on at the end of the semester.",
    "The workload of this class, while very fun and refreshing from the typical reading or p-set, is very tedious. It takes a lot of time to think through, cut, and glue everything to make sure your project is complete and to the level you and the professor want it to be at. The timelines of when the projects are due gets a little unclear at times throughout the course - things are \"kinda due\" one day but also \"due\" another day. There are also times you have a large time span to bring in sketches and then two days to make a complete project. This isn't the end of the world, just something to be aware of to stay on top of the work. The projects are all very open ended though so there truly is not wrong way to do anything.",
    "Strengths: a variety of topics. Very applied, a good pacing Weaknesses: Would love more integration of the instructors work earlier in the course and insights into other designers works to draw inspiration from. Perhaps another lecture early in the course. The lectures were so great but I wish there was one or two more.",
    "The organization and approach to design education was useful. A project would be assigned and a given number of days would be allotted to work on it (typically two class days would be set aside for student work with professors input). Deadlines could be very tight, and many hours would be spent on given nights working solely on cutting, pasting, and drawing. But the amount of work really contributed to how much one could gain from the class.",
    "It's a ton of work but it does teach us a lot",
    "The course is very well organized and clearly well thought out. that being said it can be very time consuming.",
    "I felt like in class discussions were good but I wanted more concrete feedback from the professor."

   "comments": [
    "Yes- would definitely recommend. The course is pretty fun and the workload is not that heavy honestly. Would most definitely recommend taking the course with a friend or people you know as that would have made it much more fun. My least favorite thing about the course was that I was taking it credit\/d but ended up putting more work than necessary, because we have to hang our work on the wall and have it critiqued by the whole class. My suggestion is that if you're taking it credit\/d you need to be pretty shameless or just not show up to critiques. Henk was great though!",
    "take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, not necessarily just art students. Everyone can use some knowledge and experience with design and it will really affect how you look at the world around you as well.",
    "This has been my favorite course I have taken at Yale thus far. I 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in channeling a more creative side and interactive work load. I started this class credit\/ d but was putting so much time and energy into the projects regardless that I ended up switching - I would recommend starting credit\/ d though to give yourself wiggle room to adjust to the expectations and workload that you're probably not used to.",
    "YES YES YES. I gained new skills and was inspired by the instructor to work hard and produce high-quality work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in working with a witty and knowledgeable\/experienced professor and a group of like-minded, talented and artistic students. Youll gain a hefty amount of design vocabulary and knowledge.",
    "Yes, I think graphic design is important for a lot of interdisciplinary reasons",
    "Yes. It's good.",
    "Sure! It definitely isnt easy but I felt like it was worthwhile.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in graphic design or design in general, this course is a great start to developing an eye for design. It's focused less on the technical skills (e..g no Photoshop, mostly rubber cement etc) and more on how to translate meaning into visuals. Most of the time in the classroom is spent on critique and lots more of the \"doing\" is done at home! Also Henk's the best!"
