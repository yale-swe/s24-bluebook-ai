   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: Module. Get rid of it. Waste of time. This is a SEMINAR that assigns no credit.",
    "If it is required, it should be every other week. The module was good in theory, bad in practice. It would be helpful to have more speakers who are do public health in the field. In general, it just isn't a good venue for what it seems to be trying to accomplish.",
    "The global health seminar is a great way to understand what others are doing in the public health world, and really opens up a lot of interesting pathways to be explored. It could have been more interactive, which would have helped increase my individual learning, but it was an interesting course.",
    "I enjoyed the speakers and basic setup. The food was very appreciated and I think it provides an important opportunity for people who are interested in global health to chat informally together.The module was interesting, but I think the planners for the course should consider revising the assignment. I don't think it was possible for people to do what was asked of us during the time provided. Since the course isn't for a grade, there was a general lack of motivation to put effort into this when we all had many other demands on our time. I think a whole course on Program Planning and Eval would be great though.",
    "Give students more time to do the module, otherwise presentations were informative and great.",
    "The Seminar is good! But it is more focused on Infectious diseases and Africa centric. Would want to see other innovative approaches.",
    "Some lectures very interesting, while other (like GH infrastructure) seemed repetitive and long. Good introduction to GH and interesting to learn in an environment with students from other programs.",
    "This is a fine introductory class to issues in global health. The topics aren't particularly advanced, but the speakers are generally good and occasionally excellent.",
    "The speakers have been great. The seminar has kept me motivated to stay involved in global health despite division pressures\/requirements.",
    "Some really good speakers, some just-ok ones. Overall I learned a little but not as much as I was hoping to about health in other countries.",
    "Great course!",
    "It is good to learn about the architecture of global health and to have speakers that touch on all aspects of global health-both chronic and infectious diseases.The module is a good idea, however, it was vague and there was still a lot of outside work that had to be done for the module. It also did not come at a good time since most of the students are public health and had an exam the Friday it was due. I am also personally not that interested in program management.",
    "The global health seminar for the most part was really enjoyable! I loved the speakers that came from all over - they were very inspirational and wonderful to meet.",
    "Not a huge fan of the module... I felt that it was not adequately set up and my group was left feeling unsure about how to go about the project, and thus did so very inefficiently, which required excess out-of-class time.",
    "Fun and interesting! Although, a better structure of the course would be helpful.",
    "I was very disappointed with global health seminar. It really lacked depth and interesting topics. I have already provided feedback twice on this seminar already though.",
    "I really enjoyed the global health seminar. It provided a good understanding of the breadth of the field. It was also effective in illustrating practical applications of global health.",
    "The seminar was one of the most interesting components of the semester. The lectures from distinguished people in the field provided valuable insights to the pragmatic challenges of global health problems. The talk with Stephen Lewis was particularly inspiring.",
    "I think the most glaring strength was the fact that it gave students a good overview of the different avenues of global healthI wish the course tackled health policy and health systems in the developing world.",
    "Great opportunity to hear about current opinions and work in the global health field. I especially enjoyed the first few weeks of lecture on the history and structure of global health. Those were the sessions I hoped for prior to enrolling in the course.",
    "Speakers should be better informed about what past speakers discussed; many talks were greatly redundant. The first and last speakers (Kinari Webb and Stephen Lewis) were extraordinary--two of the best I've ever seen.The module was unhelpful; we did not receive enough instruction beforehand, expectations were unclear, and it was a generally frustrating exercise in futility."

   "comments": [
    "You go to seminar on Mondays. That's it really.",
    "It is required. Sometimes the speakers are interesting, sometimes they are not. You get free food.",
    "This is an interesting seminar, and I would definitely recommend taking it for someone interested in global health!",
    "The course covered a wide variety of global health issues and most sessions were interesting. You also get free dinner.",
    "Yes. It would be good for the primary instructor to structure some of the lectures as smaller discussion groups and not so much lecture from one speaker.",
    "Series of guest lecturers. Some more interesting than others, but all in all, a good introduction to GH.",
    "This is a fine introductory class to issues in global health. The topics aren't particularly advanced, but the speakers are generally good and occasionally excellent.",
    "I would recommend this to another student even if he or she were not interested in global health. The speakers and module have made me aware of other career opportunities and ways to incorporate research skills in new settings.",
    "Great overview of global public health issues.",
    "I am used to seminars where there are just guest speakers so the addition of a module was interesting and agood exercise that could have been better laid out. I would still recommend the seminar to those who want to hear what is being done on a global level in public health.",
    "GO and LEARN!",
    "Some interesting talks for the seminar days. Not all will be relevant to all interests. Unless required for the global health concentration, there is no reason to enroll, as you can attend the talks of interest any time you feel inclined to.",
    "Interesting if you like to know more in depth about global health issues and want to meet pioneers in the field.",
    "Perhaps students can assist some of the seminars.",
    "I would recommend the global health seminar to students who may work in the field as well as other students who want to understand the issues involved with global health.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to anyone who is remotely interested in global health, medicine, or international development.",
    "The course provides the framework for understanding the intricacies of health policy making process and the problems that health systems contend with. You leave with a good understanding of the role access, cost and quality in the delivery of health care primarily in the industrialized world.",
    "Great opportunity to hear about current opinions and work in the global health field.",
    "Interesting range of speakers but not an outstanding course as a whole. The module was unproductive and not a valuable learning experience.",
    "The seminar was a wonderful opportunity to learn about different facets of global health."
