   "comments": [
    "Take it Cr\/D\/F and don't go to class.",
    "Definitely take this course! Not too much work, a lot of fun",
    "Yes. Definitely take it.",
    "Take the course, cause why not. You don't have to go, but you definitely should, because its always entertaining.",
    "It's a really fun course, but if you're not interested at all in archaeology it would probably bore you.",
    "This is a good overview of archaeology and pseudo-archaeology with a relatively light workload. I would recommend this class to anyone who is even mildly interested in archaeology.",
    "It's a pretty easy class, you don't have to do too much work in order to do well.",
    "It's very interesting stuff so I would recommend it to any student.",
    "It's a fun engaging class, but not really intellectually stimulating.",
    "I would recommend the course as a fourth or fifth class.",
    "low work load but studying is necessary for the evaluations. papers are graded fairly leniently",
    "Gut gut gut, gutgutgutgut.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It is a fun class",
    "i would recommend it as a low-stress course, you have to do a little work but it's not too demanding.",
    "It's an easy class.",
    "Definitely recommend this class!",
    "Not a lot of work but need to study for the exams and papers graded fairly lenient. I would recommend this course to other students",
    "Take this class. If you are a senior, it's the perfect 5th class to balance all the other crap you have to do. It's easy, there's very little work (you can easily put off all the reading until right before the midterm, or even skip it altogether, although it's interesting stuff for the most part). You don't have to go to class to do well, but Honeychurch is hilarious and you probably ought to go just to see him in all his glory. I honestly don't have a single bad thing to say.",
    "It was a great class with interesting lectures.",
    "Honeychurch is ridiculously enthusiastic. Otherwise, it's a good 5th class, does not require but the slightest effort.",
    "Absolutely; it's a great and fun way of learning some very interesting facts and getting a segway into archaeology.",
    "probably one of the easiest classes at yale.",
    "yea, it's good for an easy class that is relatively interested, but it's not as fun as it seems, it can be pretty boring and scattered. still, honeychurch is great.",
    "Overview of not only archeology but a lot of the problems with analyzing and interpreting information",
    "Awesome class. Not too difficult. Highly recommend it.",
    "good class. not too much work! entertaining professor. sometimes lectures are hard to follow- difficult to see how things relate within the class",
    "If you're looking for an easy class, this is it. If you're looking for a serious archaeology class, this is not for you. But either way, you'll definitely find some interesting material.",
    "Yes it's an easy A+",
    "Not necessary to do all of the work, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. it is a waste of time--the tests have a lot of memorization, and there is little motivation to work at this class.",
    "A reasonably easy course with interesting material. The professor is one of a kind, and you'll be glad to have taken a course with him.",
    "Read the course title and that's what you get",
    "great",
    "This is a low stress course that you can learn a lot from, but be aware that the course is not just about hoaxes in archeology. You also learn about archeological techniques, so it's not all 'fun and games, but it is still an enjoyable class.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student looking for an easy class or a good social science credit.",
    "I am not sure if I learned anything but you can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need. And I needed this type of class.",
    "It's a hilarious course with very little work, and the work you do have to do is really fun, take it!!! A MUST BEFORE YOU GRADUATE!!! Professor Honeychurch is crazy and makes the class really fun since he runs around the whole time, so you're never bored. Excellent senior class, but he doesn't teach it every year so take it while you can!! And he's sooooo lenient, take it!!",
    "Dude, DO NOT take this class! It's not really a gut. I mean, sure, it KIND OF is, but you're gonna get so annoyed at all those assignments, trust me.WORKLOAD:-you have to go on a field trip (way out to Sachem St.)-then you have to write a 5-page paper on some unrelated topic (like race and genetics)-then you have to write another 5-page paper \"critiquing\" some websites (it's harder than it sounds)-then you have a mid-term (with a huge list of terms to memorize)-and then you have a final (same deal; oh, and it's not cumulative, which oddly enough sucks)You're going to have to cram like hell the night before the mid-term and the final, and then you're going to have to do two papers, plus wake up for that field trip... It's a lotta work, bro. You'll get super annoyed by all this stuff because you'll miss every lecture (after the first couple, it's hard to care).I don't recommend it, unless you're taking it with 5-10 friends, who will have your back the whole time and save your ass with study guides.",
    "yes, if you are interested in the material",
    "Very good introduction to archaeology in a fascining, hilarious, and engaging lecture. Not a lot of work.",
    "good class- take it if you like to learn about the truth of legends and myths",
    "Great class",
    "Easy class and low workload. Have two short papers (each less than 4 pages), a midterm, and a final. The professor is extremely enthusiastic but kind of scattered. Pretty interesting overall though.",
    "Take it. Not really a gut, but it's easy and interesting.",
    "It is an extremely enjoyable class that I would recommend it you are the in the slightest bit interested in archaeology.",
    "Yes, definitely. It is a very interesting class and any educated individual should at least have some basic understanding of archaeology.",
    "DEFINITELY.Not too much work, and even if there is work it's quite straightforward and interesting.Lectures are great, and no section. Essentially, you'd be signing up for a class that's interesting, not too much work, and so much fun!The midterm and finals are pretty straightforward, and Professor Honeychurch gives you a list of terms you need to know -- which was extremely helpful. Going to lecture will help with the exams, because there are things that weren't necessarily in the sllids\/books\/terms etc.",
    "Well, this is definitely a gut. A midterm, a final, a short paper, and a field trip paper. The readings are not necessary AT ALL. I shouldn't have even bought the books. Some lectures are more interesting than others. I would recommend at least going to lecture if you don't do the reading, so that you don't have to do so much studying for the midterm and final. Take some notes in class, and you'll be fine. You get review sheets, so work with other people to fill it out and you're golden. Just know what to expect out of this class.",
    "Entertaining, easy and a class every Yale student should take Senior year.",
    "It's a good intro arch class with a great professor. I'd recommend it if you are interested in pursuing archaeology as a major or even if you just are looking for a fun, extra class to add to your schedule.",
    "Waste of tuition",
    "It intends to be incredibly easy, and it succeeds.",
    "It's a gut but unless you're actually interested in Archaeology it probably will not be very exciting.",
    "It is a must take at yale.",
    "Great class. Considered a \"gut\", but to tell you the truth, IT IS NOT! There is work, reading, field trips, and papers. A gut is a gut because its not neuroscience or some other ridiculous class.",
    "This class is about great hoaxes and perhaps the greatest hoax of all is this class. I do not recommend taking unless you have a serious interest in anthropology or archaeology. The class sounds interesting and Honeychurch is a real life Indiana Jones, but the material is actually bone dry. The first half is primarily a general survey of archaeology and no one actually knows what the second half is supposed to teach you. This being said, the class is very easy. For the final and midterm you really only need to memorize about 150 terms that Honeychurch gives to you a week or so before the test. The short papers you have to write are graded very easily, but there are probably more interesting guts out there.",
    "This class is not just looking at hoaxes, you learn about many legitimate archeological sites and processes as well. A lot of what you learn is a bit disjointed, but it is interesting none the less. Take this course if you want an easy class that is enjoyable, and dont mind learning about things that probably wont apply to your life in the future.",
    "AWESOME! TAKE TAKE TAKE",
    "This class seems interesting at first, but falls flat. I am one of few who took this class not because it was a gut, but because I was interested in continuing in archaeology. The class ends up feeling like an 8th grade history class--copy down notes\/terms furiously, memorize and regurgitate the terms on the midterm and final. I don't feel like I came away from the class with much except how to define terms like \"ethnoarchaeology\", which, let's be honest, can't be applied or used too many places in real life.",
    "Anthropology 172 is sort of like \"Intro to Archaeology\". You aren't just learning about hoaxes and fantasies. You are learning about some archaeology terms and concepts. I'm a little hesitant at recommend it it though because it was not what most people were expecting. The midterm was actually harder than most thought. This class is not as \"GUT-ty\" as most thought it was.",
    "I would definitely recommend this as an easy 5th class. Not too much work and interesting topics.",
    "I would certainly recommend Anthro 172 because it is very interesting, you learn about many different cases in archaeology. It is also relatively easy, but dont leave learning all the terms for the exams to the night before!",
    "Very enthusiastic teacher who really tries to get you interested in archaeology.",
    "Hoaxes is what you make of it. The material is interesting and makes for great dinner conversations, but it's not particularly difficult to grasp and therefore a lot of people put off studying and going to class, in favor of cramming for the exams. Cramming works, but you don't feel like you get much out of it.",
    "ARCH 172 is a great introduction to the interesting parts of archaeology. It's high-energy, low-workload, and super fun. It's also not strictly archaeology--a little earth science, a little forensics, a little conspiracy theory. SO MUCH GREATNESS.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are looking for any easy A but a class that is enjoyable and fun to take. The professor is great and the material is very interesting. Professor Honeychurch believes that everyone should have at least a basic understanding of archaeology, which is more or less the point of this class. So, if you are looking to learn about archaeology more in depth, this is probably not the class for you.",
    "This class is like SKYNET, in that it has become self-aware of its own gut reputation and threatens humanity. Things could have been a lot better if the course was taken a bit more seriously by Prof (and students). Great material, great energy, high school rigor.",
    "yes good class not too hard",
    "No. It's not worth it.",
    "Hoaxes is the best second semester senior class you can take. As a political science major, I found it incredibly interesting and fun! However, it's not imperative you go to class, nor that you do all the reading, or any if you're taking it credit\/d. Though it's a great class to take seriously, it's also super fun and can be as much work as you make it, literally.",
    "Great intro class to Anthropology. Learned a lot about hoaxes.",
    "I would recommend this as a 5th class for students",
    "Definitely recommend. You get out of it what you put in. I'd say most people take it because it's notoriously easy but pretty interesting. I wish I had maybe done more of the reading and paid more attention.",
    "This is a fun intro to archaeology class. Most people don't go to lecture, but lecture was a lot of fun. Honeychurch is an awesome lecturer. He is fun to just watch and you learn a lot in class (even if it doesn't seem like it at the time). There were two 5 page papers (one based on a field trip), one midterm, and one final. A list of terms is given before both tests, but it is a lot easier to find them if you went to class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! If you have any curiosity in you, you'll like this course. Who doesn't want to learn about Atlantis and whether or not Aliens made the Pyramids?",
    "Take it! Even if you do not know anything\/dont think you are interested in archeology, just take it to see Honeychurch lecture.",
    "This is a very easy course and it is sometimes amusing. Take it if that's what you're looking for.",
    "If you need a class with less work but need another credit, take this class.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material or want an easy class.",
    "This is an introduction to archaeology course. It spends a lot of time talking about humans not pots.",
    "I do not recommend this class. No one takes the class seriously. The readings are not very interesting in comparison to the lectures. You will learn some about archaeological methods, but the hoaxes begin to sound the same after the third or fourth lecture.",
    "If the subject is interesting to you, take it. If you just want a gut class and are not even interested in the material, you shouldn't take it because you will get nothing out of it.",
    "Everyone should take this class! It's so much fun, and it's not a lot of work. I also feel like it made me look at the world and the past a little bit differently. Professor Honeychurch is hilarious, and you'll want to go to class just to hear him speak.",
    "joke",
    "Yes. If the course stays as is, it's an easy A if you put in a teeny bit of work. Go to the lectures though, otherwise, you don't really deserve the A you'll get. There are so many study guides floating around for this course -- anyone who puts in effort can do well. Lectures are entertaining and Honeychurch is awesome.",
    "I recommend this class because it has a light work load and is fun\/interesting. Not a gut class but stressful; this class should definitely be taken seriously though because the midterms cover a lot of material.",
    "It's a great introduction course to archaeology and anthropology. After the first midterm you sort of shift and discus other things in more detail, like Atlantis.",
    "Archaeology 172 is a fantastic course. I very much enjoyed every lecture and the material is quite engaging. It really is a crash course in Archaeology and the guest lecture series is truly something not to be missed. Professor Honeychurch also makes this class what it is. He is very enthusiastic and was the reason why I decided to take this class. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic in the slightest.",
    "It's an easy fifth class. It's kind of boring though. But its not much work so meh.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Honeychurch is easily one of the best lecturers at Yale.",
    "Beauty",
    "this class is fun and interesting and easy.",
    "This is a great class to take. It is really interesting and fun and not too difficult. Professor Honeychurch is absolutely hilarious and insightful.",
    "TAKE IT!!! I loved the class. I really enjoyed the course content and Professor Honeychurch is amazing!",
    "Take the class if you want a 5th class with a light workload. Go to lectures and you'll get all the information you need.",
    "Anth172 (Hoaxes) is a good class to take because there is not a ton of work and Honeychurch is pretty hilarious. But if you don't go to class, be prepared to study a lot for the midterm and final. The two essays are easy and everyone gets good grades on those.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course to another student. The topic is rather interesting and the workload is decent (although there are a lot of readings). The strengths of this course are Professor Honeychurch, the ability to learn about both real and pseudo archaeology, and the fun field trips. The weaknesses of this course include the lack of organization, the fact that we never had section or were even assigned to TAs, and the really dry guest lectures.",
    "take it",
    "Don't try and do work for this class. You can skip class the whole semester and still do well. That being said, lectures are really fun and worth going to. The midterm and final weren't a big deal at all-- you didn't have to do the readings but could just make great flashcards and do well. Beware of the true\/false though!!",
    "Very exciting. Professor Honeychurch is an excellent lecturer. I enjoyed the field trip and the paper was fun to write as well.",
    "If you are looking to fulfill a social science requirement, this is a good class to take. It is fun, interesting, and the professor is truly one of a kind.",
    "This course covers some pretty interesting material and Honeychurch is great in lecture. Take it.",
    "Fun and interesting. Would make for good conversations. 2 tests, field trip (w\/ short paper), short paper. If you attend lecture, you can get an A.",
    "Loved it, interesting lectures and in general a fun class.",
    "YEP YEP YEP",
    "Take it. Honeychurch is amazing.",
    "Take it if you're looking for something fun and not too taxing",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yeah, easy A interesting material.",
    "I would recommend Hoaxes to a student who will legitimately enjoy it and not approach it as a gut. You will get nothing out of the class if you don't take it even a bit seriously. The material is interesting and the work is very limited, but the tests and paper are not graded easily. That being said, the class is overall really fun and Professor Honeychurch is awesome!",
    "fun, easy, interesting",
    "Best. Class. At. Yale.",
    "Definitely an interesting course worth taking if you enjoy professors who are energetic and passionate about the subject. The guest lectures weren't as stimulating, though.",
    "Take it",
    "It is an intro to archaeology taught in an interesting way.",
    "Love it. So fun, so fascinating. Professor Honeychurch should get a teaching prize soon. Listening to him talk is like seeing a play because he has so much energy and fascination about whatever he talks about. Not a lot of reading at all, but if you do the reading you'll see that they're really fun. Also, the class got better and better over the course of the semester as we focused less on archaeological methods and more on hoaxes.",
    "Take it credit\/d and it'll be an awesome class that you don't even have to think about.",
    "I would recommend it to those interested in anthropology\/archaeology or to those who do not have a lot of time in their schedules for flexibility.",
    "I would recommend to help offset a heavy courseload or if student has any interest in anthropology",
    "I might recommend it to a student looking for an interesting course in a completely different discipline, to balance their schedule.",
    "Total GUT, but informative, too, I guess.",
    "Pretty good course - very interesting and entertaining, workload is very manageable, professor is passionate about the material which makes the course amazing.",
    "Don't take it. It's more work than you think, and not as interesting as you think it will be. Honeychurch is great, but when you're studying, you'll realize that most of the content isn't about exciting or interesting hoaxes, but really just archaeology 101. It's not many assessments, but the tests are actually reasonably difficult and you actually have to study.",
    "Take this course. Hands down the best social science lecture I've ever taken. Prof. Honeychurch was absolutely awesome! Such an engaging lecturer and so much fun to attend lecture. Some of the guest lectures were unhelpful, but I think I got a much better perspective on archeology through this first introductory archeology course.",
    "Oh my goodness I had no idea the class would be such a gut! But it was fun. Once I got over my embarrassment at being in lecture, I learned a lot. The assignments were fun and engaging, the reading very, very manageable. Honeychurch is absolutely fabulous.",
    "YES. Great class!",
    "You should definitely take this class. By far the most entertaining lecture I've ever been too and some of the most interesting content. Professor Honeychurch is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale and he makes the material really fun. The little work that the class requires is definitely worth it!",
    "Yes. Take it, you might as well. All your friends are going to, so it ensures that you'll all have the same 1-215 period \"free\" to skip class and eat lunch together.",
    "Take it.",
    "This is a fun class that isn't too much work. Don't get too complacent for the tests though because there is a lot of material on them but you learn a lot of interesting stuff and the professor is great!",
    "Very interesting class and a great professor.",
    "It feels like being in sixth grade again.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in learning how to distinguish the practice of archaeology from pseudoscience.",
    "This course was wonderful in that I learned a lot about archaeology from lecture, which was always interesting and even fun, and from the interesting readings. Professor Honeychurch is a great lecturer and makes each class enjoyable.",
    "I would for sure take this class.",
    "A lot of people seem to take this class Credit\/D and never show up to lecture, which is the stupidest thing in the world, because this class isn't terribly hard on its own and is super fun. Even if you're not interested in archaeology, Professor Honeychurch's fun\/funny lectures will draw you in. He's seriously great. Really fun lectures, readings that you can get away with not doing, two pretty easy tests, and two short papers... why would you take this class Credit\/D and not show up? Take it for a grade, get your A, and have fun doing it!",
    "Very easy, effectively no work required. Two hours of revision is all that is needed for the two exams",
    "I thought this class was kind of a joke class until the DUS of the Anthropology Department told me that it was Introduction to Archaeology repackaged so as to be sexier. It was sexy, but it was also jokey. I never knew the meaning of a \"gut,\" or understood what it meant to be a reading-or-lecture class, until I took this course. There is no section, and the only assignments are two five-page papers, plus a midterm and final exam. Don't skip lecture - it is really fun! Professor Honeychurch is wonderfully entertaining. I did the reading for about half the term, and of course that is the best thing to do, especially because the two exams draw on material from both the book and the lectures. But since this class has no section, and the papers are not based on the readings, it is very easy to forget that you should be reading, and to fall behind. I'm not sure I would recommend this class, because there are so many other classes at Yale that you will get so much more out of. As an anthropology major, I was happy to have an excuse (major requirements) to take an easy and fun class like this, but I would not have been able to justify it to myself otherwise.",
    "Fun and easy in the sense that class is optional, however the tests are not very easy.",
    "Almost no work and lots of fun. Honeychurch is the best!",
    "First things first: this is NOT a gut. The exams are based on LOTS of memorization, and as of the midterm, there wasn't a curve (aka 85% = B). Some TAs grade a lot easier than others, so try to get your stuff regraded if you think you got one of the strict TAs. Take it if you want something fun and relaxing, but be prepared to at least do a good deal of memorization for the exams.",
    "This is a class where you learn a lot about archeological methods, but also there are interesting tales of hoaxes thrown in there. This makes it both instructive and interesting and I definitely recommend it.",
    "Some of the course material is interesting, but just be prepared to wade through a bunch of stuff that feels pretty meaningless (do you really care which crackpot made up which hoax?) Professor Honeychurch is a lot of fun though - shop the class and you'll see how energetic he is. The assignments were sometimes silly (20% of your grade is determined by your response paper for the class's field trips), but the grading on the papers and the midterm seemed all right.",
    "Study for the midterm and the final and you will do fine.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for a scientific approach to topics in everyday popular culture.",
    "Great 5th class to take - very light and entertaining and easy material; but beware that the tests (midterm and final) are not as easy as people think they should be. You still have to know your materials well.",
    "Yes but credit D not grade",
    "Take it if a 'gut' class where there's little material of substance and little need to attend lecture appeals to you. Otherwise, spend your time more productively.",
    "The class is definition gut. I attended most classes, but know of students who appeared for the midterm and final, only (the only two examinations, might I add ...) and still did well in the course. It's a good 5th class in that sense, if you're simply looking to fulfill a requirement. But it's also rather dull after the first few lectures, and honestly, I didn't get much (if anything) out of it.",
    "It is an entertaining and interesting course. The workload is not huge, but a fair amount has to be done for the midterm and final. Honeychurch is an excellent lecturer and makes the course very engaging, I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "I would say that previous interest in archaeology is necessary for this class to be enjoyable.",
    "Hoaxes is basically intro archaeology with a slight twist. The readings can be tedious, though they are not necessary to do well in the course because his lectures pretty much cover the info well. Honeychurch is a joy to listen to and has wonderful stories. It is not much work and well worth taking.",
    "It is a fun class, but by no means a gut. There is very little structure and little instruction from TAs. I felt pretty in the dark the whole time. Interesting subject matter though.",
    "I think that this class is pretty easy, but not as easy as you would like it. The exams this year were a bit more tricky than one would have thought and there are 2 short papers to write as well. But, Dr. Honeychurch is such a fantastic instructor that it makes going to class and taking the class entirely worth it. His energy and enthusiasm is infectious",
    "Yes",
    "Yes if you are looking for an easier but still interesting class",
    "Definitely recommend. Relatively low course load, interesting topics, professor is on crack (his level of energy and enthusiasm makes it seem like it anyway)",
    "This course is a really interesting and low stress-survey of archaeology. Professor Honeychurch is utterly phenomenal. He could make learning about anything hilarious and fascinating. His booming voice and infectious charisma might be flashy, but beneath it all, he is a wealth of archaeological knowledge and a very seasoned professional in the field. I have the utmost respect for him, and I cannot sing his praises loud enough. His lectures are highly energetic and engaging and helped make sometimes boring\/dry material come to life. The class delves into interesting case studies, but guest lectures can be hit or miss. The workload is so minimal (midterm, final, and two short papers), but you get out what you put in. You can go to every lecture and really get a profound look at the discipline, or you can skip and cram for the tests. I recommend the former. Take this class credit\/d, for an anthro distribution requirement, or just as a fun fifth class. Some of the material can be repetitive andquite dry but on the whole, Hoaxes is a great way to learn about a topic one might otherwise never consider. I genuinely approach arguments differently now, and I am now skeptical when I watch History Channel documentaries about aliens!",
    "Easy class with field trips and essays. Pretty much just an intro to archaeology class with a lot of emphasis on the history of archaeological schools of thought. Guest lecturers are awesome, Honeychurch is too."
