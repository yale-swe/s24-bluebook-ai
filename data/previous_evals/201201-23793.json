    "This course was incredible because it wasn't challenging in the sense that it was full of busy work, but it was challenging due to the pressure to think strategically about various problems and topics. I loved that I continually felt challenged to produce creative work. In other courses it is really easy to figure out what the professor expects in terms of assignments and be able to regurgitate information and prepare deliverables that fulfill their requirements. This class is different in that Dr. Tol seemed most impressed by things that were outside of the box and reflected innovative thought.",
    "There were great reading selections and guest lecturers.However, I would have liked more group activities and more structured class discussions.",
    "The course would be better if each class had a clearer content.",
    "I felt that the class was very engaging, and really opened up my mind to the humanitarian disasters that are taking place around the world and the how we can create an impact in these situations through psychosocial support. I really enjoyed the interactive nature of the class and learning from my classmates.",

    "Instructor: Wietse Anton Tol \u00a0Dr. Tol is an incredible professor. I have never had a better class at YSPH. He acts as a leader in the sense that he facilitates great discussion rather than talking at the students.",

    "Instructor: Wietse Anton Tol \u00a0Where to improve:be more sensitive to the flow of discussion and lead it back if discussion goes to the irrelevant direction.",
    "Instructor: Wietse Anton Tol \u00a0Excellent instruction -- brought great expertise. Class discussion sometimes wandered but generally class time was engaging and enlightening.",
