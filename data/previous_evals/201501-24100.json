    "The ecology of global change is a strong, discussion-based summary of the current literature on global change and its implications. Students read papers from the primary literature and complete a research project related to global change. Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because it enhanced my knowledge of global change and helped me with my own projects, old and new.",
    "Typical upper level seminar course with moderate weekly reading and a term project that, if you put the effort in, could result in a publishable project.",
    "I would summarize the seminar as a solid introduction to all things global change. I would definitely recommend the course, so long as the student was willing to put effort into the readings every week.",
    "Giant final project is a large part of the course. If you're not going to read, don't take this course."

    "This course really deepened my knowledge of global change biology, which is background that will be very important for my research.",
    "Yes, this course did deepen my knowledge of my discipline. Some of my work is directly related to climate change and this course gave me a wider perspective on global change that will improve future research and (hopefully) manuscripts."
