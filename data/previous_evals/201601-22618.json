   "comments": [
    "I will definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants knowledge in this field or to add on to their professional experience. It is an eye-opener and makes you aware that humanitarian work is not 'cast-in-stone'. How does one perform his\/her duties without compromising these principles?",
    "GLBL791 is a unique opportunity to learn about humanitarian ethics and the realities of working on the ground from someone who has really been there and seen it first hand. I would recommend this course to anyone considering a career in humanitarian work",
    "yes.",
    "Students who take this course must come into it with the expectation of learning through other students. The readings provide an excellent framework for discussion, but ethics in of itself is not black and white, and requires discussion and thought. Recommend for students interested in humanitarian aid or confused about going into development or humanitarian aid.",
    "I would say that it is a course that truly lives up to its name and makes you think deeply about all the ethical concerns related to humanitarian work. I would recommended it as a required course for any student going into the field. I would HIGHLY recommend this course, but only for the type of student who is already interested in these issues.",
    "Yes, I would recommend",
    "This course introduces students to contemporary moral issues faced by humanitarian actors, although it also critiques the development arena. It is a good course for those interested in development, humanitarian aid, public health, crisis management, etc. I would highly recommend the course to another student because the instructor is very knowledgeable and fair, and the class is challenging intellectually."

   "comments": [
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the profession as I have never taken any course in Global Affairs. Dr. Unni ties the principles beautifully to the dilemmas and could speak to specific incidents enabling me to draw from his experiences and learnings. If I don't get to work in a humanitarian setting, the knowledge gained will be remembered.",
    "This course allowed me to learn about humanitarian book beyond theory and tectbooks - but with real world experiences and examples from those working in the area. This deepened my knowledge more than any other course could have",
    "Provides a framework from which to make ethical decisions in the humanitarian aid field.",
    "Yes, it did. It helped me clarify my future career goals.",
    "I came in knowing nothing and left with a serious understanding of humanitarian action.",
    "This course added a theoretical and practical layer to my understanding of humanitarian issues and managing conflicts abroad. As I was mostly focused on government policy and development policy, it introduced a set of ethical considerations that are not necessarily exclusive to humanitarian actors and should be considered more in these other contexts."
