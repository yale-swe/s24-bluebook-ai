    "Intro to Electronics is a solid class. Your mind (if it is anything like my mind) will experience two conflicting emotions during this class: One is excitement to learn about all of these awesome things that underpin the workings of every gadget and gizmo in our world. The second is boredom, as most of this stuff is sadly pretty boring by nature. BUT it's still very much worth it to learn this stuff, so do it! TP Ma brings a lot of humor to class, which is important since it partially alleviates the boredom. The book is also good so you shouldn't have a problem learning everything. The only burdensome part of the course was the labs, which could be kind of stressful sometimes. However, even the labs were well put together and you will learn a lot in them. Overall, this class is a somewhat large time commitment, but it's not too hard and you learn a lot of important stuff.",
    "Take it if you have to, but unless you\u00c2\u00b4re interested in designing computer chips, it may not fascinate you. Also, be aware of lab! You dno\u00c2\u00b4t get credit but will still spend 7 labs x 2-4 hours per week in the lab.",
    "If you want an overview of the potential EE has as a major, take 202 instead. If you have to take this for EE or MechE, suck it up and do it. Nothing is that difficult. Work to stay on top of the concepts at the beginning of the course because the knowledge accumulates and you have to understand each step. Don't worry about the final - everybody doesterribly, and you might cry afterwards.Focus on getting 100s in the lab and don't blow off any problem sets because they're a big part of the grade.",
    "The class is extremely time-consuming so take it only if you really want to learn electronics or you are a mech\/eeng major. We go through the chapters at a stellar speed so most of the learning is self-study. The class has 3 (two of which are more difficult that psets) tests and a final. Good luck (you will need it)!",
    "Interesting course material. Dry lectures. Good distribution of midterms , psets, quizzes, and final so it's not hard to get a decent grade.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in basic electronics. The course and lab give you enough knowledge to go on and make your own circuits. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend electrical engineering to anyone that enjoys tinkering with electronics and wants to know the theory and math behind it.",
    "EENG 200 is a good but sometimes frustrating course. It is very interesting, and the material can be mastered; however, there are some aspects which I did not enjoy. There is a weekly lab session. It is frustrating that we don't get a lab credit for it, but it helps with our grades if the effort is put in.",
    "I would only recommend taking EE 200 if you want to major in electrical engineering. I wouldn't say that the class is good, but I dont think I would say it's bad either. Lectures were fine but often hard to follow. Book is unhelpful. Class is 20% labs, 24% hw, 24% average of 3 midterms, 8% average of 4 or 5 pop quizzes, 24% final exam. Final is brutal. Absolutely brutal. You can get 100% on hw if you go to the TA office hours. You can get 100% on labs if you know what you're doing or find a partner who knows what (s)he's doing.",
    "decently tough class but manageable if you stay on top of it. it has a lab attached which is annoying since its only 1 credit but it helps your grade a lot. final was hard but on 24% of the grade",
    "EE200 is a course that you should really only take if you have to. That being said, it is a pretty straightforward course which means that you can study from the book and the problem sets and it shouldn't be too bad. The lectures are rather boring and are hard to pay attention to. However, you need to go to class because you don't know when he will have a pop quiz. T.P. Ma tries to make jokes that are more entertaining than funny so that makes class a little more interesting. Also, there is a lab that meets 6 times during the semester but the course only counts for 1 credit total. Kind of annoying, but the labs arent too difficult and the TAs are always ready to help.",
    "The material is pretty dry, but that is the nature of intro electronics. There is a lab that goes on for 6 weeks (at about 2-3 hours per week) that is part of the course. There are occasional pop quizzes which are meant to keep you coming to class, because in reality, you can just read the book and be fine. It can be boring, but by the end of the course you will understand basic electronics and have the background knowledge to take higher courses, which is the overall goal of EENG 200.",
    "Do not be deterred from the dryness at the beginning of the course. Once you build the building blocks, it will get much more interesting, especially the labs.",
    "You learn basic analysis of AC and DC analog circuits, and get into transistors and a bit of digital stuff at the end. T.P. Ma tarted the course by saying \"if you're not willing to put in extra work, I suggest you make room for those who are truly interested in learning about circuits,\" which doesn't seem like a good way to start an introductory course. I wouldn't take it unless I had to (ABET Mech E). The lab was fun, though.",
    "Horrible course. No way to introduce a student to any major. The professor writes circuits on the board and provides very little motivation for the problems done in class. Poorly written tests, boring lectures, and tedious algebra for psets- no wonder there are so few EE majors.",
    "You learn linear circuit analysis very well. Some of the non-linear stuff I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely clear on.Prof Ma is a great character.Though he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have office hours and the TA hours are crowded.Labs are fun. Though it means that the class takes 3 hours more per week, to a total time spent on that class of about 6 + 3 = 9hrs per week.",
    "If you want to learn more about how to analyze circuits, then take this class. The workload is average and the tests throughout the semester are pretty doable. Be aware that there is also a lab portion of the course which you don't get an extra half credit for.",
    "The material in this course is rather shallow, but a good basis for understanding how most electronic circuits work. The lectures can get somewhat boring, but the lab component (20% of your grade) is very easy -- if a bit tedious -- and ends up being quite rewarding at the end (we actually got to build an ECG and test it on our own pulse). The homeworks rarely take more than 2-2.5 hours a week, and tests are fairly graded and not too hard. A warning to anyone that has done circuits in the past (either in an intro physics course or in high-school): the first month or so might seem easy to you, but it gets quite a bit harder after that. I found that I could do the first month's HW without paying attention in lecture or reading up on the material, but after mid-October it just wasn't possible. That being said, the material is easy enough that you can learn it all just by reading the book.",
    "Yes",
    "Electrical Engineering 200 is a broad introduction to electronics, modern and obsolete. The fundamentals taught in this course are very useful for circuit analysis of any electronic circuit, the basis of every device. I would recommend this course to any student interested in technology, although it is really useful for EENG and Mech E majors.",
    "Honestly, i definitely would not recommend this class unless you have to take it. I didn't mind some of the early material, but by the end, I barely understood anything and really did not enjoy the class. The professor, TP Ma, is not engaging at all and it's difficult to focus in class. The lab sucks too because you don't get an extra half credit for it. It's so easy it's barely a lab but it's time you could be doing something else. The tests are impossible.",
    "This is a good course to take if you are actually considering pursuing Electrical Engineering as a major. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend it if you are majoring in electrical engineering or I you have a real interest in electronics. Otherwise it's a bit dry and a lot of work because there's 3 midterms.",
    "Good class. I would recommend it. The lectures can be dull, but the material is interesting and worth knowing.",
    "This class is an introduction to analog circuit analysis, and minimal digital circuit analysis and design. I would recommend it thoroughly to prospective electrical engineers.",
    "An interesting and difficult course you learn all the details of how circuits and devices. It it worthwhile if you are interested in EE or MechE. The professor can be funny at times.",
    "EE is a rather predictable, and at times challenging class. The assessments and homeworks are all problems - usually more than would normally seem fair. They're all \"doable\" given the material and also somewhat repetative. I would recommend this class if you want to learn about electronics, but go in very focused on being prepared for quizes, not overthinking the material, and spending your lab time really learning how the circuits work."
