   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It isn't too much work to handle during your first semester, Professor Butler is very fun and approachable, and the work is genuinely interesting.",
    "It is a course on colonial America from the mid 17th century until just past the Revolution. I would recommend it to someone who is already very interested in early American history and how it is connected to colonial times (if not it could certainly be a bit boring at times)",
    "I would sya that its a great subject and a great professor but the classroom dynamic was not the best.",
    "This class has allthe benefits of a Freshmen Seminar (small class size, intimate discussion etc.) and the added bonus of being taught by a real celebrity at Yale\/in the field of American History. That said, I would urge students to evaluate the course based on the topics it covers not by the professor who teachers it. Professor Butler, at least in my experience, was not that engaged during class and ended up acting more as a facilitator of discussion than an active participant himself. I was often disappointed because I was very eager to hear his opinion on the questions he raised, but he rarely shared them. You\u0092re probably better suited to this class if you don\u0092t have a very extensive background in American History, although since it covers the colonial period (which most high school courses give short shrift too), you\u0092ll probably discover that you learn a fair amount of new material. If you do end up taking the class, definitely take advantage of office hours\u0097especially as you plan your research paper. You don\u0092t want to discover that you have embarked on a boring or unfeasible project just because you didn\u0092t discuss it with Professor Butler beforehand. There is quite a bit of writing in this class, but since the assignments were fairly open-ended and Professor Butler is a pretty easy grader, I didn\u0092t feel the work was too arduous\u0097it was actually very good practice for college writing.",
    "If you want a course that will interest you, and want the chance to work with one of the smartest (and nicest!) professors at Yale, then take this course. You will be so glad you signed up for it!",
    "The readings are very interesting and Butler's book is very clear, as is Bernard Bailyn's book. I realized that Benjamin Franklin was much more complex and interesting than he appears on the surface. The course is nice since we all know the general outline of the revolutionary era but this course really goes into depth about the thoughts and underlying ideas that created the revolution or did not create the revolution.",
    "I was surprised by how interesting I ended up finding Revolutionary America. I think most of that is due to a great professor and a constantly engaged class. I would absolutely recommend taking the course to other students, it was by far my favorite class of the semester, and I think that as a freshman taking a seminar is a good decision.",
    "Day-to-day: class discussions virtually every class. Some very neat field trips to places such as Beinecke, Manuscripts&Archives, Yale Furniture Study, and the Art Gallery in order to experience a variety of primary sources and original articles accompanied by interesting commentary from ButlerAssignments: significant reading for each week (reading prepares you for both of the week's sessions) as well as writing assignments. No outside knowledge or preparation required, although you may be inspired to do so.",
    "This class is an intensive immersion into the world of Pre-Revolutionary America in which you get exposed to primary texts from the time period as well as secondary works by historians (including Butler himself). You learn how to talk and write about these texts as well as conduct research and write a research paper.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to deepen his or her understanding of what colonial American society was like. If you want to read some great works of early America or better familiarize yourself with the writings of America's founders, this may also be a good course for you. However, if you are interested in the history of the Revolutionary War itself, this is not the course for you, as that really is not covered in the course material. As Professor Butler clarifies on the first day, the course is \"Revolutionary America,\" not \"the American Revolution.\"",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are especially interested in the colonial period since this course requires previous knowledge and delves into particulars. Professor Butler is a great teacher and is willing to help in any way. It should be remembered that this course counts as a writing credit and requires a significant amount of written work. Overall, the discussion format of the class and the numerous outings make it enjoyable and fun."
