    "Spectacular class. One of the few engineering classes at Yale that are actually worth taking. GO FOR IT!!",
    "There are really two subjects in this class: learning the professional design process, including tolerancing, modeling (on SolidWorks), and thinking about manufacturing processes; and several areas of physics useful for designing mechanical parts. There's not much room for creativity except for the last project.",
    "185 is worth the time commitment. There are 2 lectures a week, but you also have a lab once a week (and toward the end, for the final project, you'll have to come in a lot more). You learn a lot, though, and it really helps to give you an idea of what Mech E is like, so I'd recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it, whether MechE or not. It's fun to get into the shop and do some hands on work and then see your design actually work.",
    "Yes--very fun projects if you can put in the time.",
    "I would recommend meng 185. If you are a mech e or potential mech e major this is an amazing class. However, you spend many hours in the lab each week so be prepared for that. Otherwise the material is not hard and the projects are rewarding.",
    "Good introduction to Mechanical Engineering. Definitely worth taking if you're considering the major.",
    "It's a lot of time but the opportunity to build so many cool things, it reminded me why I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineering major. Definitely take this if you're thinking about being a MechE major.",
    "If you're MecE or if you want to learn to build things, take the class! It's a time commitment at the end of the semester, but worth it. Lectures are dull but labs are good."
