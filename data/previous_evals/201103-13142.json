    "Yes. Its a lot of reading some weeks but it is overall a very good class",
    "- RECOMMEND -Class dynamics can make or break this course and the responsibility is on you to make it a great experience.I would recommend that you know the chronology of the Russian Revolution, especially between 1905-1917. This course covers an extremely short period of time, but a lot of things happen in that short period. Know your chronology and your general ideas so you can have a meaningful discussion in seminar rather than just trying to sort everything out in class.",
    "A close look at the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917. It's a solid class. Engelstein rocks. Our discussions sometimes were slow but it didn't bother me because she was great at filling in the gaps.",
    "I very much enjoyed the content for this course, but the weekly discussions were not consistent and could have used more direction from the professor. Likewise, the cutoff of 1918 for the end of the course left something to be desired. It does offer a good variety of primary and secondary perspectives though.",
    "Maybe. This class is a bit hard to grasp without an understanding of Russian history, as the readings don't give a very comprehensive view and are sometimes too convoluted. Discussions can stagnate a little as a result."
