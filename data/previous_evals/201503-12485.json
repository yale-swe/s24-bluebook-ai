    "I would recommend it to students wanting to learn Spanish",
    "A wonderful, fast-moving introduction to Spanish.",
    "Apparently the quality of this class depends somewhat on the particular teacher you get, but the baseline structure of the class (textbook, homework, classwork, and other things that are standardized across the course) is very well planned. You will learn a lot of Spanish, have some fun, and not have to put in that much work at all. Wouldn't call it a gut, but it's easy enough, and if you don't slack off you'll get a ton out of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's a great introductory class to Spanish, and your knowledge will improve remarkably over the course of the semester. It was one of my favorite classes.",
    "Good intro class. Good intro to basics.",
    "Its a good course. Great class to learn spanish.",
    "A good place to start for people interested in learning Spanish."
