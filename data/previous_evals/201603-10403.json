   "comments": [
    "In this course a lot of what you learn is very technical: how to process and develop film, how to use a film camera. You also learn (through osmosis from TA\/ Professor\/ classmates, lectures, and art gallery tours) quite a bit about famous photographers. Finally, you start to develop a sense of what makes a good photograph or why you like certain photographs as opposed to others.",
    "I developed skills in shooting photographs using a manual camera and in developing 35mm film and then printing enlargements from those negatives. We learned basic darkroom skills and were also exposed to famous photographers' work throughout the years. The insights I gained into photography have really made me more appreciative of the work put into a single photograph, and how a photograph is so much more than just an image."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know that there is anyway this course could be improved. It would have been nice if we could get more critiques in but at the same time two already felt like a lot and you need time to develop technical skills. Its a lot of work but its hands on and quite satisfying \/ totally worth it. One thing I might suggest is getting a little bit more specific feedback from professors -- one on one or outside of critiques. I wasn't really sure at all how I was doing in the course, and could potentially be very surprised by my grade.",
    "This course took a while to get going because there were lots of basic, introductory skills that had to be demonstrated to us before we were comfortable doing things on our own. We were also held back by the time it takes to order supplies online and be ready to work in the darkroom. If it were possible to have the Art Department buy all supplies for us and have them ready, and have us pay the department directly for supplies, we would have been able to work more efficiently."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!! Anyone can take this course you don't need to be an artist, you just need to want to take good pictures. It also helps to have some interest in art.",
    "Introductory Film Photography is an indispensable area of study if one is interested in photography. Slowing down and attending to every aspect of the process in such great detail is extremely beneficial, and gave me a much greater appreciation for each piece of work, and for photography in general. I highly recommend this course."
