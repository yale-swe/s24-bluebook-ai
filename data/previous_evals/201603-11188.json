    "Added to my knowledge of European history. Gave a basis for understanding history of Jews in Europe.",
    "This was the first history class I'd taken at Yale, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, especially considering the fact that it was taught as a small seminar. Obviously, I learned a heck of a lot about Jewish political history, but Professor Sorkin's analysis was just forceful enough to help me build my own connections without being so overbearing that he dictated how I should think. His feedback on my essays was robust and thoughtful it helped me become a better writer.",
    "I learned a lot about the subject matter. I think I also learned how to evaluate individual primary sources better, and also how to make connections between them."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of the course was how many primary documents we used to study events and historical actors. However, there were some weeks when we mostly or only used primary documents, in which it would have been helpful to have a secondary source or some other resource to set the context for the week's events and the primary documents we were reading.",
    "I liked the format of the course, and how we focused on individual cities\/countries in each lecture. Also, I liked how Professor Sorkin turned the lecture into a seminar-style course, and actively engaged the students by asking questions and our opinions on the readings.",
    "I loved the balance between instruction and participation; he demanded enough participation to keep everyone engaged and thinking, but it still felt that he was firmly in control. The readings were interesting, although I found the lectures much more compelling: it often took his analysis to bring everything together. The class would consistently run over its allotted fifty minutes, which, for the most part, was a blessing, although it did confuse my schedule a bit. Overall, it was a fantastic experience.",
    "I think the course could be improved if the lectures were more balanced between the primary and secondary sources. Sometimes we spent too much time on the primary sources and it didn't feel as productive as if we had moved on to something else. The strength was the mixed lecture\/discussion\/q&a format."

   "comments": [
    "Take it only if you are absolutely interested in the material because it's a lot of reading of primary sources that can be tedious and sometimes simply undoable, given the amount he assigns.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Sorkin is an amazing professor, and the material is so interesting. I learned so much about European Jewish history.",
    "Yes, absolutely! I would take this course again in a heartbeat. If you get a chance to take one of Professor Sorkin's courses, do it! First of all, he's a genius, and it's so incredibly cool to hear his thoughts on the material. Second, and probably more important, it's abundantly clear that he enjoys teaching and truly cares about his students. Even if you're not (yet) interested in Jewish history, it's a fantastic lens through which you can view European political history. The course demands a fair bit of reading, and there are five drafted essays (including the final), but it's all very manageable and absolutely worth it.",
    "Yes, I certainly learned a lot. The professor is really knowledgable and approachable. There's quite a lot of (short) writing assignments though, which is, you know, good or bad depending on your perspective."
