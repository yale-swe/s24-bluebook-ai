    "I would recommend Spanish 120 to another student, especially with Professor Tortora. She was very helpful and understanding throughout the duration of the course. The workload is manageable and the professors make themselves accessible if you are struggling or need help in a particular area.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to any student interested in spanish or simply trying to fufill a credit. I have heard only good things about all the teachers. The class is not too overwhelming and is very effective at teaching the language.",
    "Great course in expanding basic knowledge in Spanish that incorporates oral presentations, homework activities and in class speaking that stimulates fluency in non native speakers."
