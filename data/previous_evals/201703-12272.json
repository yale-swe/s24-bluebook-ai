    "Foundational Spanish skills and language studying skills",
    "Spanish 110 has taught me how to learn quickly and how to stay on top of a fast-moving course. It has given me insight into not only a different language, but also a different culture.",
    "I learned some elementary Spanish- I started with no knowledge at all!",
    "I got better at speaking spanish.",
    "This course provided a foundational knowledge of basic Spanish grammar and structure. The curriculum varies little from what one may study in their first year as a high school Spanish student. The pace is brisk and demanding; the everyday class structure helps facilitate basic fluency.",
    "This class does a great job of teaching as well as reviewing concepts you might have learned before in high school.",
    "I began to build a foundation for my ability to speak and understand Spanish. I learned a lot of introductory Spanish speaking, writing, and listening skills. I also developed useful study and work habits.",
    "Fairly self-explanatory: a grasp of the fundamentals of Spanish (in all four areas of listening, reading, writing, speaking)."

   "comments": [
    "I do not think that the range of final exams accurately tested out knowledg of the language and material to the extend which and in the way that we were taught it and had practiced it.",
    "The course is well orgniazed and progresses in a manner that is easy to understand. It provides you with a very strong basis for understanding. However, the course does move quickly and so you have to be prepared to put in significant work outside of the classroom to remain on top of things. There is also a lot of homework and regular testing to help encourage you to stay on top of work.",
    "I thought the course was very well designed and engaging. I think if I had better managed my time I would have gotten a lot more out of it.",
    "Very good course.",
    "This course is extremely well laid-out. The syllabus providesin addition to basic textbook requirements and grading proceduresa detailed outline of every topic to be studied on each particular day, with all homework assignments listed as well. Our professor, Maripaz, did an amazing job of engaging with us strictly in Spanish after week 4. Her native ability, coupled with a strong linguistic knowledge of Spanish, made the class a multi-disciplinary experience. Learning how the language is formed on top of its simple grammar structures provides for a more solidifying experience. I would say the primary weakness of this course (one of only a few) is the in-class layout. Students who struggle with the language daily bog down the class pace and hinder discussion capacity. While the grading system is rigid in order to curb this behavior, it still happens and can easily derail a day of learning. I would suggest more immediate tutoring possibilities (maybe even mandates) for these students, as I feel we could've practiced speaking a lot more if the class did not have to halt for those who didn't put in the work. I was disappointed to see this in a language course atof all placesYale.",
    "pace of class is hard to keep up with. class everyday is a beatdown",
    "This course was structured well and was very clear. We moved through material quickly, but the nightly homework and reviews in class made it easy to keep up with and understand what we were learning. The tests were also helpful because they forced us to review and memorize the things we had learned in the previous weeks.",
    "Well-organized."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has the intention of learning Spanish. It is a great basis and considering I had never spoken the language before, it was manageable. Be aware of the quick pace and work load, but this is expected in any language class.",
    "Yes! This is a great intro to Spanish. However you do need to be good at managing your time.",
    "Great course to learn spanish.",
    "If you would like a solid foundation of the Spanish language, and you're willing to put in the work, certainly. A small previous knowledge of the language helps significantly as the class gets started (and reduces workload), but you can make it doing 1 hour a night with no prior ability.",
    "I would. I loved this class and the professor, and Spanish is highly applicable in the world.",
    "If you are interested in learning Spanish, I think this course is a great way to start. I feel as though I learned much more than I have in other language courses I've taken.",
    "It does what it says on the tin. You should take the course if interested."
