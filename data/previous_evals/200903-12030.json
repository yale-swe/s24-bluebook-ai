   "comments": [
    "Semantics was more fun than I expected. It wasn't necessarily an easy QR, but it was a lot more engaging than a straight-up math class. I'm glad I took it.",
    "I would summarize Linguistics 263 as an interesting and well-taught course about how meaning in formal and natural languages is built up compositionally. This is not -- as both the professor and the textbook make clear -- a course in lexical semantics, but rather one in truth-conditional, model-theoretic semantics. The quantitative reasoning that the course involves is of a logical nature, and those avoiding actual calculus need not fear the lambda-calculus of semantics, which is much more conceptual than mathematical. The workload was reasonable: ten homework assignments (which were surprisingly fun for those who enjoy thinking about language), a mid-term exam (consisting of both an in-class and a take-home section), and a take-home final exam.",
    "Okay, so I thought this class was going to be an easy QR that related to language - something I want to do (Literature, English, etc.). This is not the case. Don't go in here thinking about \"semantics\" as you know it. Semantics is really all about breaking down sentences quantitatively, making VERY elaborate grammar trees where symbols stand for words. It is pretty interesting now that I look back on it, but this class was really a pain to take. 9am = no good either. If you're taking it, do it because you love linguistics, not because you love English.",
    "A very slow paced treatment of relatively uninteresting material. Easy Social Science credit, extremely easy QR.",
    "Only for linguistics majors and math lovers. Not really accessible or terribly fun for the casual or curious.",
    "Intro Semantics is a no-prerequisite-necessary introduction to semantics, the study of the meaning of language. It uses math and logic to determine the meaning of language. The class had weekly problem sets and a midterm and final, so the workload was definitely manageable, especially if you get a head start on the homeworks. I would recommend LING263 to any student interested in getting a QR, linguistics, semantics, or logic at all.",
    "This class is pretty boring. The material seemed like it had potential to be interesting, and at times it was, sort of, but it moves really slowly. Prof. Deo is not that exciting and she gives you detailed handouts, so you don't really have to pay attention in class. I learned a lot of stuff during class that was not related to semantics by virtue of this fact.Also this is the kind of class that the material is easy but it's also quite easy to do badly in - the homeworks involve a lot of pedantic details that you probably will not know how to do perfectly unless you go to section.",
    "If you're not particularly interested in linguistics, take it because you'll want a good challenge and a great set of resourceful people who will provide any support you need. (Without a TA, though, I'd say it's a bit harder.) Take it with a bunch of friends!I had an interesting relationship with this course. The content was sincerely difficult and different for me. However, it presented a challenge that I learned to love and that this course made extremely easy for me to actually WANT to tackle. Professor Deo is a wonderful lecturer. The only problem I had was that it was so early! I fell asleep a lot even though I did not want to. Also, be warned, this course may result in tremendous amounts of giddy laughter once you encounter semantics-related jokes in your everyday world. \"Every baby cries\" will be engraved in your mind.",
    "Do you like transitive verbs? Do you like QR credits? Do you like laughter? Well, take it, then.It was only a real struggle a couple of times during the whole semester, since the problem sets can turn a tad tricky (so many trees, so many lambdas, so many questions), but otherwise, it was a joy. It's a class that gives back a lot, because you gain a new way of looking at and talking about WHAT YOU MEAN when you speak a sentence. Ashwini Deo is incredible at explaining things so early in the morning (if it is somehow not at 9, I can't even imagine how great it will be \u0096 that's the course's main weakness), and you will love the way she hops around when she is holding chalk.It's all very logical.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, though I don't regret taking it.",
    "Its a quick intro to formal semantics. If you don't want formal analysis don't take it. If you want a gut QR this is only half way there, the stat 100 series or intro programming are better gut QRs. This one is a really solid class though, I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.",
    "Intro semantics is surprisingly hard to explain or summarize. It is about understanding meaning in natural language -- how each word contributes compositionally to the overall meaning of a sentence. It covers a bit of predicate logic (but if you've already taken predicate logic, you won't at all be bored) and then a more systematic way of capturing the compositionality of sentences through type theory. The last section of the course is on tense and modality. There are weekly problem sets and a mid-term exam (part of it was a take home) and a take-home final. The assessments are very fair and are geared toward making you explore language more fully.I would definitely recommend the class -- for a QR or just for fun! It was really interesting and will change the way you think about language, and will leave you with a lot of questions to ponder. I had never taken a linguistics class before this but now would love to take more!",
    "This is a course in (one branch of) formal semantics largely meant for linguistics majors. It is not in itself that fascinating, though it's involved at higher levels in fascinating things. It's no easier than other QRs, contrary to some students' expectations, and in fact the problem sets are time-consuming and often brain-contorting.",
    "This isn't a gut QR class, you will be learning the nuts and bolts of semantic theory, and though it's not extremely mathematical it is symbolic. Are you here to learn about a basic, quantificational approach to meaning in natural language? If so, take the class and you won't look at the meaning of expressions and words the same way again. On the other hand, you won't be sitting around discussing the meaning of a certain word, you will be modeling its behavior in a sentence. Not a class for everything, but can be fun if you're into it, or a linguistics major.",
    "This course was an introduction to the principles and formal language of semantics. I would definitely recommend it as a compliment to any program of study because it makes you think about how our language is organized and why putting words in certain orders is effective. It is very interesting for those studying linguistics as well as those who are just taking it for the QR credit.",
    "This is an intense and difficult class, and its applications (except possibly in the further study of semantics) are not immediately apparent. Still, if mathematically breaking down the structure and meaning of sentences seems interesting, this class certainly provides insight into the complex processes by which sentences derive their meaning.",
    "I would suggest taking the class if you are interested in the structure of sentences and the nuances of word usage. This is a intro course in Semantics, but definitely not a intro course in linguistics or logic. I would suggest taking this course with some experience in linguistics.",
    "Semantics was a cool class that exposed me to something I had never really considered before. The topics were complex but Prof. Deo proceeds at a pace that people who are new to the subject can follow. I liked the combination of theory and mathematical modeling of a language. A good class."
