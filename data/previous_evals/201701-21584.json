    "Learned so much about institutional forces influencing environmentalism in America. Extremely interesting stuff. Sharpened my writing a lot, as well.",
    "This was one of the most valuable courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Swenson thoughtfully designed the course and assigned relevant and interesting readings each week that gave an interesting variety of perspectives: I genuinely looked forward to doing them each week. His feedback to our assignments was incredibly thorough and helpful. Class discussions were interesting because of a variety of backgrounds: some had done environmental organizing in the past, while others were taking their first course on the environment.",
    "The complex dynamics of the American political institutions, business interests, and grassroots movements, around environmental policy actions.",
    "A better insight into the politics of environment I guess? The focus of the semester is mostly whether or not public opinion matters for decisions at the legislative level. Issues we looked at included an overview of U.S. politics (polarization), environmental justice, communication strategies, business collaborations all the way to the current administration. Walking out of the class I can't think of a single thing that I really \"learned\", but I can only say that I \"looked into\" these issues."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great readings, supportive classroom dynamic. Weaknesses: not so much opportunity for discussion. Mostly expository.",
    "The course's readings were fascinating, Professor Swenson's commentary during class was always valuable, and I learned a lot from my classmates' presentations. I wouldn't change much about the course--if anything, I would build in a bit more time for class discussion about certain topics.",
    "Strengths: small class, good engagement and discussion, very helpful reading, and great feedback from papers. Weaknesses: the class is very much a monolog of professor Swenson whose main area of research was healthcare politics. His experience is nonetheless very helpful, but I could expect more focused expertise. The discussion was very obscured, aided by the fact that Prof. Swenson often catches up with one or two students with heavy involvement in the politics and environment, leaving the whole class wondering what was going on. The syllabus was also nonexistent in that it changed all the time. There were also a few students with background in science, but their voices were generally drowned out or dismissed when in fact science is very important for environmental politics. The difference was clear whenever slightly more quantitative aspects were brought up in presentations, when Prof. Swenson would looked slightly disengaged and doubtful.",
    "This class had an excellent syllabus. I think that Professor Swenson's approach to the material was really intriguing and think the class was well designed to survey the field topically. I think the structure of class-time could be revisited. I think that the amount of presentation time took away from the ability to really dig into the readings with the attention that they deserved more time to discuss readings together would be a primary suggestion."

   "comments": [
    "So interesting, but be prepared for a lot of work!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was one of my favorite at Yale, and I learned a lot about a subject I knew all too little about beforehand.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you're interested in how elements of the American society interact to construct or defeat environmental movements.",
    "Unless you are very invested in politics and environmental ACTIVISM, this class may not be for you. The learning should happen over discussions, and the only way you can join the discussion is when you understand what's being discussed. The class is also a LOT of work. Dozens of reading assignments every week, several short papers and presentations throughout the semester as well as a final exam hide behind this class which seems deceptively easy."
