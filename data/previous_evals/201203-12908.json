    "If you're willing to walk up science hill before 8:20am three times a week, this is a solid survey of quantum mechanics as it applies to spectroscopy, and probably as good as an advanced p-chem lecture course will get. If any of the physical chemistry professors' research interests you, this will lend you most of the background you need. The class notes are thorough and well-written, so having to miss a class due to illness, laziness, etc. won't be too cataclysmic. Psets are assigned every week and become quite challenging, but they are purely for learning purposes as they are only graded on completion. Exams are straightfoward and mimic the homework for the most part, but that makes the class average in the 90's for each test. However, you will need to be fairly comfortable with calculus and matrix notation, since summations, integrals, and derivatives make up about 50% of the lecture notes.",
    "Chemistry 440 is an excellent introduction to the theory of molecules and radiation. I would recommend this course to any chemist interested in the theory behind spectroscopy. The course is not just useful for spectroscopy, but also very useful for a quick introduction to topics such as matrix math and group theory.",
    "This is a challenging course but not as bad as I think people make it out to be. If you can get to all the lectures (he provides lecture notes which are extremely helpful, but I still think the context of lecture is essential to understanding) then it is certainly doable. It definitely helps to know other people in the course as they will motivate you and being able to talk through the material on the homework is helpful if you are stuck. However, you should absolutely make an honest effort on each homework as you need to learn all of those problem solving techniques to be successful on the exams.",
    "Yep! Good class - Zilm's notes are great and it's really interesting. Don't be intimidated if you're an undergrad!"
