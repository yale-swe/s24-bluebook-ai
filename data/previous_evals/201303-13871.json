   "comments": [
    "Yes-take this for your research credit class if you're a psych major! It's a very clear class that will help you gain some useful skills and it's also a WR.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of work. However, this is one of the better research methods courses you can take. Professor Kim-Cohen makes this course so much better.",
    "Even though to class is a requirement for most, I actually learned a lot about giving presentatns, reading psychological literature, and research writing.",
    "Amazing class, I learned so much! I loved the structure of the class, though not everyone might. There were quizzes almost every day for a while, some lecture, some group work, some individual work. Some might call it \"busy work\" but I enjoyed it so much. This class really teaches you a lot about how do to research. It's also amazing in that you actually get to do two of your own research projects, which is the best way to learn it. So grateful I took this class! I would highly highly recommend it for a Research Methods class.",
    "Research Methods in Psychology is a fantastic course. It allows you the chance to truly engage with the nature of research as it is conducted in psychology. You conduct the experimental process from start to finish yourself...twice. There is no better way to immerse yourself in the discipline of psychology than to take this course. Professor Kim-Cohen is an incredible professor. She truly cares about helping her students engage with experimental research. She makes herself very available to students to discuss ideas and work through experimental designs. She gives very detailed, extraordinarily helpful feedback on papers, working with students to improve their writing. Simply said, Yale is very fortunate to have her as a professor.",
    "If you are interested in doing any kind of psych research, yes I would recommend it. It was actually very interesting to learn about how to design a useful study.",
    "This section was really strict and honestly I did not have fun going to class. I think the class in itself can be very helpful and teaches you useful things but not in this section. Quite a bit of writing and readings, we had a quiz almost every class at the beginning of the term. I had to take this class for my major, and wanted to drop it half way through but couldn't."
