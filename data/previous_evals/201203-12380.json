    "Definitely worthwhile. It can really take as much work as you're willing to put into it. All English majors should undertake a project of this size. It's great to be able to really dive into a subject you're interested in and take it wherever you fancy.",
    "Do independent tutorial if you want one-on-one advice from someone passionate about your topic and can help you make your paper compelling and well-written. It was difficult to stay on track and get the drafts turned in but if you choose literature you know you wouldn't mind reading and reading about, it is truly a rewarding experience. Plus, your thesis will be done before your last semester!",
    "I would recommend this to another student if he or she has a clear idea of the subject about which they want to write and doesn\u00c2\u00b4t feel they will be able to accomplish a similar product through a class. It provides a great opportunity to really take ownership over one\u00c2\u00b4s academic interests."
