   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of work and you'll probably want to cry every wednesday night. But if you wanna take multi, he's not a terrible teacher.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who actually wants a strong foundation in multivariable calculus. I would not recommend it for someone who wants an easy grade or has to take multivariable for a requirement of some sort.",
    "Only take it if you already learned multivariable in high school - otherwise, save some time by taking MATH 120 instead.",
    "If you truly do the lengthy psets and read the textbook, you should be alright. It is a lot of work, so make sure not to get behind.",
    "In order to do well in this class you need to do a TON of practice problems",
    "I would, so long as that student had plenty of time to devote to the course and a great deal of mathematical creativity and a strong sense of doing problems as quickly as possible. Highly useful computational knowledge for a broad swath of disciplines.",
    "Professor Beigi lectures well enough; I felt I had a good understanding of the material and did well on the p-sets. However, his exams are incredibly hard and he grades them very harshly. This one of those C means average courses. Don't expect to get an A unless you are the top of the class.",
    "Acceptable course if taught by somebody other than Sohrab. I've heard great reviews of ENAS 151 when taken with other professors.",
    "This is a very difficult class. Math 120 is probably easier if this is being taught by Sohrab. However, you are going to learn the concepts and how to apply the math much more in this class with Sohrab. This will take up much of your time studying and doing p-sets. However, as difficult as this class is I recommend it. Multivariable calculus is a good skill to know and, more importantly, this class and Sohrab teaches you to think.",
    "I thought this course was challenging, but Sohrab definitely makes it doable. I would highly suggest this course over Math 120 (especially if the Math 120 section you get is with a TF) You cover a lot, the workload may be a bit rough at times, but you'll live.",
    "When I signed up for ENAS, I heard it was going to be an easier alternative to MATH120. Maybe it was just because of my professor (Sohrab Ismail-Beigi), but the class was far from easy. I learned a lot of calculus, but it was probably my hardest class.",
    "Completely, unquestionably better than Math 120. Take this class if Sohrab teaches it--you will never find another professor as clear, capable, or invested in any other introductory math or science class. While I don't consider myself one of those people who \"unconditionally loves science and math,\" I came out of the class with a newfound appreciation of calculus. Trust me--in the context of Yale's other intro STEM courses, this one stands out.A bit of a warning: his tests are designed to be somewhat soul-crushing. Unless you are a true GPA fiend, don't let this factor into your decision to take the class--the curves usually work out nicely anyway.",
    "ENAS must be better than MATH 120. Take it.",
    "This class was a bit tougher than Math 120 I believe, but interesting because of some of the other things taught because of it. At least with Professor Sohrab teaching the class.",
    "Sohrab is something else. The Psets will take you hours; you probably won't understand the last chapters; the midterm averages will hover around 63%. Since you're decided between this and 120, I'd say go for 120. Sohrab makes it harder than it needs to be.",
    "I think it is better than math 120.",
    "Yes, great class, great material, great professor.",
    "This is an extremely challenging course, but you learn a lot. Weekly problem sets often took more than ten hours (even when working with other students), and there were online quizzes before each lecture. The exams were brutal-- they demanded a high-level integration of the material and an ability to conceptualize and execute problems very quickly. Don't be discouraged though... the prof is an articulate lecturer and would stay very late at office hours the night before psets were due. Take this course if you genuinely want to learn multivariable calculus and are willing to spend a lot of time doing so.",
    "Definitely would recommend. If you're looking at ENAS vs. Math 120, I'd go with ENAS. It may be a little bit harder than Math 120, but it's definitely worth it, especially if Sohrab is teaching.",
    "In one word: horrid. This class is unnecessarily challenging. To be fair, I look back on the semester and smile. Smile because I am SO happy to be done with this class, but also because I've learned an insane amount about math. To not provide mixed messages: I found this class much more difficult than it needed to be, but also incredibly in-depth. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it because each pset took around 10+ hours to complete and completely killed my hope for sleep. Students who took ENAS 151 in the fall semester couldn't understand why our Spring ENAS 151 was as vexing as everyone in the class made it out to be. This primarily has to do with the teaching. Sohrab is a brilliant man, but he doesn't seem to know how to take his brilliance and bring it down to a level to help students who are learning this material for the first time understand it. If you want a REALLY thorough and challenging math class, take this and not Math 120. If you're interested in math, good at calculus (by AP BC calc standards), but aren't able to deal with annoying arithmetic, take Math 120 or ENAS 151 without Sohrab.",
    "Math onsteroids and long nights at Bass. If you're premed with a more quantitative inclination, take it. If you think you like math, take it. If you're into engineering, you need to take it.",
    "Really hard. You feel awful throughout the whole semester.",
    "Yes, I would. I found the material of this class to be enjoyable, even though an 1 hr and 15 min lecture can be hard to sit through. It's really interesting stuff that DOES have an application. I promise. Note that you will need to spend a lot of time studying for this class. You also need to be able to commit at least a few hours a week on problem sets.",
    "Exams are hard, but they are not impossible if you actually understand the material on a conceptual level. Sohrab is a very ecstatic professor.",
    "Compared to math 120, ENAS 151 definitely focuses a lot more on practical applications of multivariable calculus which I think is good since it makes the concepts more intuitive and easier to understand. If you take this course with Sohrab, expect it to be difficult, but I feel that you understand the material much better than if you took it with the easier professor. It is a challenging class and don't take it expecting an easy A.",
    "Do not take this class with this professor. The class is required for many majors but try to take it with a different teacher.",
    "No, I would not recommend ENAS 151 to another student. The class is unnecessarily difficult, and I would suggest they look into taking MATH 120.",
    "I would recommend this class.I like the prof's grading policy (drop half the quizzes, two psets, and different weights for your 3 exams). Prof Ismail-Beigi has a pretty clear lecture style (though his handwriting is rather difficult to read).(Don't expect much help from the TFs.)For this class, you definitely know what kinds of problems\/topics you'll be tested on. Expect low averages.Suggestion for studying for test: PRACTICE\/SUPPLEMENTARY PROBLEMS fromt the book \/ psets \/ online",
    "This class is a pain. The psets take forever (about 12hrs), the exams are ridiculous, and the lectures are far less than stimulating. Don't recommend this course.",
    "ENAS 151 with Professor Ismail-Beigi was definitely a challenge. The material was rather difficult. But the class's pre-lecture quizzes and weekly psets forced everyone to stay on top of the material, which in the long run, helped immensely. The fact that half of the pre-lecture quizzes were dropped, two psets were dropped, and the exam grades were weighted such that your worst test was worth 15%, middle test 20%, and the best one 25% was more than fair. The exams were on average pretty difficult, but looking back on the course, Professor Ismail-Beigi was extremely helpful and accessible and really did care about us as students. ENAS 151 was one of those courses where you get out as much as you put in. And the resources for you to do well are certainly there. I would recommend ENAS 151 only to those students who must take multivariable calculus and has to choose between MATH 120 and this class.",
    "I came into this course not realizing how much work it would be and how demoralizing the tests would be. These exams were the first exams that I'd ever approached in a way trying to get points rather than worrying about where I would lose points. Overall though, I would recommend this class. Professor Ismail-Beigi is really awesome. Go to his office hours, they help a lot. Also, this seems like common sense, but don't wait until Wednesday to start the psets. The psets would routinely take more that 12 hours to complete. My piece of advice for this course is to READ THE BOOK. Coming to class having prepared the chapter makes such a difference.",
    "Very difficult conceptual based tests. Only take if very comfortable with math skills.",
    "overall it is a great course to take if you want to expose yourself to multivariable calculus. i took it because i heard it was easier than math 120, but that was with last semester's professor. i would recommend the course, but not with this professor since you will probably end up with a low grade with him.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking the class. It's got many applications to real-world phenomena and problems.",
    "Better than Math 120",
    "ENAS 151 is an extremely difficult class. The professor is a great lecturer but you will probably find yourself struggling through many of the problem sets. Many of the T.A.s do not put effort into preparing for the office hours or are actually unavailable during these times. Fractured communication between the professor and the students makes it difficult to understand how grading in the class works. However, the class is mentally stimulating and will prepare you for the kind of advanced problem-solving skills you need in any Yale class. However, I would only take ENAS 151 if you have too. Don't expect it to maintain your GPA.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless he\/she needed it, or if another more experienced professor teaches it.",
    "It is a course that is designed to teach you multivariable calculus, and I am unsure whether I would recommend it.",
    "Taught by Sohrab, ENAS is difficult (the test averages are very low), but definitely rewarding. You may not leave knowing everything about multivariable, but you definitely have a better conceptual grasp of the material, along with an appreciation for the application of math. It is worth taking it over Math 120 because Sohrab is an effective teacher- just beware learning math in a large lecture, as it may not be your style.",
    "Hard as shit.",
    "Professor Ismail-Beigi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ENAS 151 class is extremely conceptual and quite difficult. The professor was always very clear and well-prepared in class, but the exams were brutal with averages being in the 50-60% range. No explicit curves were given, either, which made determining your grade quite difficult.",
    "DONT TAKE IN SPRING",
    "ENAS151 is really boring but you are forced to learn the material well because of the difficult problem sets. If you need to take multi-variable calculus for whatever reason, think carefully about the professor teachingit, as MATH120 may be a better option.",
    "Take if you know that multi-variable calculus and comfort with working with vectors will lead you on to bigger and higher things. Since the class is NOT a physics class, you won't really see the course material being used for what it generally is most important for, and will have to wait until you take later classes to find it actually interesting and elegant. On the other hand, if you like pure math and want to relish the various theorems we learn for their intrinsic beauty, then you can probably learn them and their proofs on your own. Take the course name seriously--it's Multivariable Calculus *for Engineers*, and will be taught as such.",
    "ENAS 151 is basically MATH 120 with more applications. The class was interesting, but at times extremely conceptually difficult, and very unclear. Students should be prepared to supplement the lectures with a lot of time reading the book and finding other sources for instruction. Avoid the class if you can.",
    "Course was difficult but rewarding.He was very open to feedback and overall a very good teacher. He posts his notes online with audio making it accessible to everyone. His grading and tests were very hard though.",
    "hard",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS 151 to another student. It does require a decent amount of work, and the tests are hard. However, Professor Ismail-Beigi is very understanding and extremely helpful if you ask him questions. The explanations and lectures are usually clear, and the pace, while brisk, is still eminently manageable. Naturally I can't speak to parallels with Math 120, but ENAS 151 is perfectly viable as a substitute and absolutely worth looking into."
