    "Basic Japanese, but realized really how much room there is to improve and grow.",
    "I learned basic knowledge of Japanese language and grammar.",
    "I learned a lot about pronunciation, became able to read write Hiragana\/Katakana, and started to become introduced to the basics of Japanese grammar.",
    "I gained the ability to read and write in Hiragana, Katakana and some kanji. I developed my speaking skills in Japanese and learnt grammar and how to survive in basic conversations in many different settings.",
    "Basic conversation skills and cultural etiquette.",
    "I significantly improved my Japanese reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills to the extent that I became able to engage in simple daily life conversations. I gained insights into Japanese culture and lifestyle.",
    "I had already taken some elementary Japanese when I was much younger, so I already knew hiragana and katakana, but this course was incredibly valuable for the face-to-face speaking time I got every single day. I learned how speech patterns in Japanese work, and basic grammar and some vocabulary. I also learned 75 Kanji which I did not know before.",
    "basic Japanese grammar and vocab",
    "Japanese basics",
    "I developed communication skills. I learned how to learn Japanese in an interesting way and with other students. I like group studies. I think I have learned a lot from this class, especially about how to learn a language in an interesting way."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's an extremely demanding course, but I think it's warranted.",
    "The only way I think this class could be improved is if the final exam wasn't a partner exam. My partner and I had different opinions about how to study for the exam.",
    "The class started off moving at a very good pace but felt quite rushed by the very end of the semester. Also, the fact that we had one textbook and one text packet with some duplicated materials was a bit confusing at times.",
    "I think there could be more mandatory one on one conversation practice. More clinics. More history and culture content.",
    "Too much content, hard to retain at the end. Could have less material or extend advanced material in Japanese II.",
    "I think having different types of assessments ( short quizzes, Kanji tests, lesson tests, skit presentations ) was a good way to diversify the class which also supplemented our learning by helping us focus on different aspects of the language one at a time.",
    "Strengths: Saito sensei is an incredibly engaging teacher. She is very very kind but still genuine and not too lenient. I like the amount of speaking time practice we have in class every day. Although having class and homework every day is a lot of work, it gets through the material very effectively. I learned a LOT of Japanese relative to the classes I took when I was younger. Weaknesses: since there were about 15 people in my class, and only 50 minutes per class, there was very limited teacher-student direct attention. The clinics help with this, as well as office hours. I do not think that the media assignments are very helpful, maybe they would be more engaging if we did them in class instead of on worksheets.",
    "It seems pretty well organized. I don't know what I would change, if anything.",
    "I think if teacher could explain the vocabulary in more details, it will be much better for me to understand, or if there were more readings besides the textbook."

   "comments": [
    "I would if you're genuinely interested in learning Japanese, at the cost of it becoming a major priority in your use of time.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this class and my professor amazing!",
    "Yes, Japanese was a great course with an amazing teacher!",
    "Yes for beginners, but must be willing to spend the time.",
    "Yes, definitely. Learning Japanese has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my semester. It allowed me to immerse myself in such a unique and interesting culture. Every class made me feel as if I was traveling to Japan since I wasn't only learning the language but so much about the Japanese culture too. Even though I had no previous exposure to Japanese or any other Asian language, I was able to improve my skills significantly and now I can easily converse in simple daily life situations.",
    "I would, if they are serious about learning Japanese. The learning curve is pretty steep for someone who has no Japanese experience, but you learn a lot in just three months. The workload isn't too hard, but it is homework every day. I also thought it was pretty fun.",
    "Yes, Saito Sensei is very patient in answering students' questions.",
    "Yes, very good intro course",
    "Yes, it's a very well-taught course.",
    "Yes, I think it's very interesting and challenging."
