   "comments": [
    "I would say Islamic Social Movements is a course that allows you to gain more insight into a very relevant and widely debated topic. I would definitely encourage other students to take it, provided they had some background on the Middle East.",
    "Good class - definitely accessible to people with no background on the Middle East. The seminar format is not intimidating, even though there are some people with a lot of personal experience with the region. The material is something important to gain exposure to, as the Middle East continues to figure in U.S. foreign policy.",
    "Take this class if you already know a lot (beyond that of most Yale students) about the politics in a Middle Eastern nation. The class is very interesting (particularly in the first few weeks), but it tends to be dominated by those from or who have other experiences in the Middle East. It adds an interesting dimension to the class that helps you learn a lot, but it also makes participation stressful.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking to get an in-depth look at the Islamic social movements that are so frequently in the news. The course provides an academic look at these movements that is free from the bias that is often seen in society.",
    "This is a great course for anyone who wants to learn more about social movement theory. This class analyzes many terrorist organizations as social movements, utilizing social movement theory. I really appreciated the refreshing take on controversial issues and how much we were encouraged to critically think about motives, resources, power structures and more. Take this class if you are at all interested in the Middle East. Wyrtzen is a great professor and the content is very interesting and provocative."
