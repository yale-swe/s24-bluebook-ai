    "My goal in this studio was to learn how Professor Gehry worked through a problem set in architecture and relate that you how I work through my own architectural problems. The result was a stressed studio where I felt that happy accidents had a higher rate of success than well constructed arguments. This was difficult for me since I rely heavily on logical progression and technical sense of how things work in the real world. If anything, I will chalk this experience up to learning that sometimes you just don't fit in certain settings and its best to do what you are good at than try to reinvent yourself for the sake of a project.",
    "I expected to learn a process in designing a theater. I learned a great deal about theater design from precedents and the individuals Gehry introduced us to.",
    "This was by far the best studio I took at Yale. It was even more fun and exciting than I could have imagined. I only feel bad that just 10 students every two years have the chance to be in it. I know that I was really lucky."

    "Yes they were adequate.",
    "Adequate.",
    "Library lending policies and late fees are reprehensible.",
    "Yes, because the studio is fairly low-tech, privileging physical models over digital ones, and I think I learned more working that way."
