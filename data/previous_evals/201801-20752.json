    "This course was structured to convey the magnitude of unanswered questions there still are within the field of plant ecology and ecology more broadly, which I thought was an incredibly helpful structure. It was also mathematically rigorous, demonstrating how math can help in tackling some of these questions.",

   "comments": [
    "This courses strengths were that it conveyed how much there is still to be learned in the field. Its weaknesses were the assessments, which were difficult to study for given this structure.",
    "Maybe organize field trip ideas before hand, it was tough for people with no experience to come up with ideas.",
    "Carla was engaging and the subject was interesting. I wasn't expecting as much math as there was, but they did a good job of teaching and making sure we had the right resources.",
    "I don't think the textbook was very helpful--which is consensus at this point. I really enjoyed having the guest lectures so frequently and appreciated how they were also used as lectures to reinforce concepts we had previously learned. I was frustrated with some parts of the problem sets because I felt that: (1) the questions were often unclear and\/or just too open-ended; (2) the questions weren't really representative of what we had learned in class. I learned a lot about savannas from this class, and while I really enjoyed that I would have also liked to focus on different biomes. Finally, I think that the field trip would have been better if we had spent one Wednesday class working in groups and planning out an experiment, and then just spending one night at Yale Myers instead of two."

    "I would, with the caveat that this course should be viewed as an advanced level course, after youve already taken general ecology! Also expect math!",

    "yeah! It's worth taking and really interesting. The field trip was fun as well. Just make sure you take general ecology first."
