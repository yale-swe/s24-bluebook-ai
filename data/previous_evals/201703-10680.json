   "comments": [
    "I love the format of the course: each week reading Vergils poetry in Latin and accompanying English secondary sources. The long classes gave us time to get into a rhythm of discussion where I learned from my classmates as well as my professors.",
    "The courses strengths were its people: two instructors of unmatched expertise and charm, smart and engaged students, and a Latin author of inexhaustible richness. The weaknesses were few, but were mainly that there weren't always clear expectations. It would have been nice to have had an online discussion forum where we needed to post weekly reading responses, so that students could be more engaged.",
    "More substantial opportunities for student-led discussion may have helped stimulate class conversation. Perhaps, shifting student presentations away from secondary literature and toward fifty or hundred line chunks of the poem would do this."

    "Of course! If you want to learn about Virgil, or Latin literature more generally, there are no better people to learn from.",
    "Yes! The opportunity to read a wildly difficult text slowly with two experts is not to be missed."
