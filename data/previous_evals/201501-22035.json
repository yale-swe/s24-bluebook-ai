    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "This class is the BEST, definitely the best I've taken at Yale. Anne is an amazing professor--so kind and so willing to spend time to get to know you and help you improve your writing. I liked most of the readings (you read some wonderful old and new things) and the essay topics were broad enough that I always found something to write about that fit. Anne meets with you every other week in her office (whenever you just turned in a paper) for an hour to go through and edit the piece, which was probably my favorite part of taking this class. Classes are well structured and don't seem long at all, and it was fun doing the author's report! I could go on and on but I will end just by saying APPLY TO THIS CLASS! Also even if you don't take this class, you should get a copy of Roget's Thesaurus. Just saying.",
    "Obviously this is an incredible class someone in a previous review said \"believe the hype!\" and that is very true. That said, it is also a lot of work. But the work is worth it; Anne is a great, caring teacher who selects a strong community of students and (I think \/ hope) really believes in their potential. Some of the older readings are a little dry, but that honestly does not matter because everything else makes up for it. Take this class take this class take this class! I applied like four times to Anne's classes before I got in and this was such an important part of my senior year.",
    "Obviously I agree with everyone else: (1) Anne is incredible, (2) take her class, and (3) if possible, make it your number one priority for the semester. If you do, your writing will improve (probably a lot), which is the coolest feeling ever.",
    "Yes! For the writing tools, for the reading, for the students, for the professor. Do it!",
    "WaO is a personal essay writing workshop that focuses on craft.",
    "Writing About Oneself is one of the most important classes I have taken at Yale. It not only helped me read with a more critical eye, write with a better sense of craft and style, and learn the power of concision in story-telling, but also gave me a safe space to be myself and reveal parts of my life that I had never shared before. I recommend this class to anyone who wants to write in any field\/style\/genre in their future.",
    "You'll make new friends, you'll write some of your best work, you'll get one-on-one time with an incredibly knowledgeable, caring editor and fellow writer. What's not to love? Applying is a pain (as with any creative writing class), but WaO is a gem!!"
