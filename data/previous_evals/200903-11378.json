   "comments": [
    "This class is fairly time consuming, but the work is enjoyable. You definitely don't have to be good at art to take this class! Class drags on sometimes when it is critique format, but other than that Color is a good experience.",
    "The first half of Color is driven mainly by academic exercise and is very structured. The second half of Color incorporates more free study and enables students to exercise their creativity. The class has a nice balance between guided work and free work. As a non-art major, I found the class to be quite technical, but I enjoyed the more academic approach to color. I would recommend this art class to other students. It is a challenging course that is very rewarding!",
    "Color is a class that explains the modern and contemporary purpose of color in art in the boundaries of academic theory and practical exploration. I would recommend the class to another, under two conditions:1) This class should be taken during a semester when other classes' workloads are relatively lighter. The creative process is time consuming, from thinking of a project to realizing it, and it is difficult to make an effective and clean project under tight time constraints.2) Be prepared to face criticism and the possibility of not making an A. This is not a gut course and no one, from the instructors to the other students, will stroke your ego. It is my understanding from art majors that the class crits for Color are relatively mild, but as a non-major the entire scenario can be very intimidating. It is a very humbling experience.",
    "If you take this class, don't forget that it is called color. As long as your pieces are about color, you'll be okay.I'd recommend this class to someone who enjoys experimenting with materials and found objects.",
    "The class didn't change my life, as I hoped it would. I feel like my intuitive understanding of color and color relationships hasn't really improved as a result of taking this class. The assignments sometimes revealed surprising relationships, but I'm not sure that that alone makes the class worth it: if you're an art major who's interested in color or a non-major who's aware of the heavy time commitment art classes require, take it. Be aware that 95% of the work is collage and that the more time and work you put into the class, the more you'll get out of it (as with any art class here).",
    "Wonderful class. Very much an academic exploration of color and not merely an \"artistic one.\" Clint's taken over the reins well. Highly recommended.",
    "I think this class was interesting, specifically in the beginning when we focused on technical studies of color. As the class was given more freedom, I found it hard to really gage what the instructor was looking for. I never knew if my project was going to be a success or a failure. I probably would not take this class again, even though I learned something about color. Also, the work load got progressively more intense to the point of insanity.",
    "A very important course to take, probably especially for the painting concentration. Not a lot of fun though.",
    "I would recommend color to anybody art major or not. Wonderful course"
