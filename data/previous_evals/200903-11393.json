   "comments": [
    "This class mainly consisted of collecting and identifying insect orders and families. The field trips were fun, and creating your own insect collection is really the best way to learn about insects. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, not just biology majors.",
    "As a non-science major, this lab was an unbelievable fun way to get some hands-on experience with field collecting and some exposure to a scientific discipline. The lab ended up being a lot more work than I expected, but I would recommend it to absolutely everyone.",
    "TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT. Without a doubt one of the most interesting, new, strange, gratifying things I have done at Yale. Becoming familiar with and learning how to identify such surprisingly amazing creatures -- ubiquitous, definitely under-appreciated and sometimes much maligned, but actually extraordinary and shockingly beautiful, cool things -- will continue to serve and satisfy me for the rest of my life. I used to hate bugs. Now I love them.",
    "The class was incredibly interesting and worthwhile to take. There was a lot of rote memorization, but it got easier and more fun as we really worked on our collections. Marta was incredibly helpful and enthusiastic, knowledgeable and supportive. The best professor I could have hoped for."
