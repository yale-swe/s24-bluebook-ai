    "This class provides a comprehensive understanding of the first half of Roman history during the republic.",
    "I got a detailed overview of the history of the Roman Republic, with a good focus on the current issues and controversies in contemporary scholarship.",
    "I understood, in great detail, the history of the Roman Republic. Throughout the semester, we looked at not just the historical chronology of events surrounding the \"big men,\" but also the cultural development in Rome.",
    "A deep dive into the history, politics, and culture of the Roman Republic.",
    "I learned how to close read primary sources and a lot about the Roman Republic.",
    "This class was a survey of Roman history from around the 7th century BCE to the late 1st century BCE. We studied Roman religion, political institutions, military, and culture.",
    "A lot of knowledge of the history of the Roman Republic.",
    "This class was extremely informative and engaging, but Prof. Johnstons ability to integrate primary sources constantly throughout lecture and illustrate historical controversy and the evolving historiographical process completely changed the way I think of history. Ive never quite seen a professor identify and explicate the questions of history that remain unanswered and their modern repercussions in a way that helped students actively engage with the material like Prof. Johnston does.",
    "Learned about the effects of social memory upon ancient history (covering topics such as mythology and etiology), learned to consider the historiographies of texts as well as their histories, developed stronger analytical skills with regard to working with primary sources.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the origins and development of Rome. I also learned how to look critically at ancient texts and compare them to other sources of evidence such as archaeology.",
    "On the level of basic content, I gained an understanding of the history of Rome up to the fall of the Republic. The course paid particular attention to the different types of sources that we can use to understand antiquity -- Greek and Roman historians, ancient literature, archaeology, etc. -- and the benefits and difficulties of using each. I also developed a sense of how the field of Roman history has changed over time, both through contemporary political developments (e.g., Italian fascism) and through new directions in humanities scholarship (e.g., postmodern theory as a historiographical method).",
    "I learned about how to use received traditions, mythology, and hard fact (archaeology, etc.) to parse out the truthful \"kernels\" of history.",
    "This class was amazing. I learned a ton about specifics but also learned a lot about important themes. I feel like I really understood the Roman people and the nature of the Roman republic.",
    "I was I feel vastly more knowledgeable about ancient history and methods of ancient historical research. The course is a survey of the republic but that doesnt mean you dont feel immersed in that time period.",
    "This course focuses on the role of social memory in shaping and misshaping ancient history. I came away with a strong sense of Roman Republican history, both as we currently understand it and as the Romans told it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Johnston is the best",
    "The information and way in which the class is taught is great and very easy to follow and understand. Professor Johnston also does a great job incorporating primary sources which is then helpful later when writing papers and just generally in understanding this time period.",
    "Some unnecessary material in lecture meant we were always behind. Probably dont need to start every class with three or so quotes by either modern politicians or old historians\/poets\/etc., especially since the lecture handouts have another eight or so. Also, it would be better if we spent section going over the material instead of doing silly activities like writing a letter to a historical Roman figure (a real thing we did). Likewise, breaking into sub-groups of two or three partners is not inherently helpful. If there isnt a good reason to be doing it, were probably better off just learning from the graduate student TA than from each other.",
    "I think the greatest strength of this course was the interesting and engaging lectures; had I not taken the course for credit, I still would have wanted to come just for those. The syllabus was well put together, and it didn't seem like there was too much or too little time spent on any topic. While there were not many weaknesses, I did feel that the quiz grading system was a bit arbitrary, with seemingly equally detailed answers only receiving partial credit. This was not a major issue, however, due to the relative weights of the quizzes. I also think that the \"submit two questions for section\" thing should be potentially reevaluated, as we got to receive the questions of other students without and answers. Perhaps a \"submit one topic you would like to discuss in depth\" would be a better way to guide the discussion without just accumulating unanswered questions.",
    "It's one of the best courses I have taken here at Yale. Professor Johnston lectures in a very methodical and clear manner, often drawing from multiple lines of evidence for his lectures. The workload is manageable, and the readings are always relevant to, and are expanded on in greater detail in, the lecture. Sections were meticulously planned, as each week we are given a specific theme to prepare for, so the discussions in section thus always feel relevant and I always look forward to the sections. The two writing assignments were both interesting, with one looking at the aetiology of monuments in Rome and the other allowing you to writing on any final topic.",
    "Strengths: Professor Johnston, my TF Chris, the assigned secondary reading, the variance of material explored between section and lecture (ie it was helpful for the lecture to move chronologically, and for the section to investigate bigger themes such as \"ethnicity\" or \"culture\" or \"army\"). Weaknesses: none",
    "The class was excellent! Good content, insightful analysis, great discussion. Professor Johnston was a very engaging lecturer and made each class informative and entertaining. The only weakness I can think of is that the pacing of the course could stand to be improved. Due to the volume of material covered, lectures would often run over the allotted time and I would have to run to get to my next class on time.",
    "Strengths: the teaching staff is wonderful and so caring! The lectures are super interesting because Prof. Johnston structures them well. The exams are also reasonable and a fair assessment based on the course material. Weaknesses: the amount of reading and coursework is maybe a little too high. There was a lot of reading to keep up with, plus weekly quizzes, plus having a paper and exam for each assessment was a lot.",
    "This was a great class! The lectures were always very engaging and informative. I liked that we mostly listened to Professor Johnston, but also had time for questions and a little discussion. I am impressed with how much I learned in one semester. I learned a lot from the paper assignments, and I really enjoyed that we could pick any topic for the final paper. The readings were really interesting too. The class was very well organized with well-written handouts and good slides. One small suggestion: I wish the midterm and the deadline for paper 1 had been a little more spaced out (they were within a week of each other). I would say the same with the final exam and paper, which were also within a week of each other, but I think that's hard to avoid.",
    "Strengths: great material, covers a lot, interesting topics Weaknesses: lectures are long and we often fell behind; readings sometimes dull, esp secondary ones that felt unnecessary given background in lecture; too much text on lecture slides",
    "The most obvious weakness was simply the fact that the material assigned to each lecture was not often covered in the allotted time, but thats completely due to Prof. Johnstons passion for the subject and extensive incorporation of sources and images that make the lectures worthwhile, which really just speaks to the courses strength.",
    "Strengths: Excellent and information-packed lectures, good selection of readings, great discussions during section, coin room visit at the end of the semester was a unique and informative experience Weaknesses: Professor Johnston's regular office hours were packed into one block of time during the week, which limited the number of students who could attend for reasons of schedule conflicts",
    "Professor Johnston is an excellent teacher: his passion for the subject in all its myriad angles -- from the broad strokes of content to the nitty-gritty of methodology -- shows through, as does his deep knowledge of it. Often, Professor Johnston was just a bit too excited. The course was chock-full of content -- including substantial required readings for section each week that were not listed on the syllabus -- and often felt like information overload. I think the best way to improve this course would be to prune it just a bit. For instance, the slide decks are massive; while every quote of Livy or Cicero certainly bears the attention Professor Johnston afforded it in lecture, I wonder if cutting here and there would help the next crop of students feel less overwhelmed and more confident in the excellent content he delivers.",
    "Very strong overall. I would only suggest that it be more clear which readings are suggested vs. required, as the syllabus indicates a few different things in different places--although maybe this is intentional, so students can choose what to focus on.",
    "No weaknesses. This course is amazing. Prof Johnston is an incredible teacher, super engaging, and the lectures are fascinating.",
    "The lectures were a pleasure to go to since professor Johnston is an amazing speaker. Going to lecture ans section while doing the readings was enough work to soak up a lot of the information that was needed for the tests so review work was minimal. The readings are often a long haul but theyre interesting and engaging so the time doesnt feel wasted."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Professor Johnston is a great lecturer and the material itself is really interesting.",
    "This is an excellent intro history\/classics course, equally enjoyable for those with a strong background and for those who are new to the topic. The lectures given are some of the best and most entertaining that I've seen at Yale, and the pacing of the course is very regular and fair, with there never being too much of a workload or pileup. In addition the historical content, the course also spends a fair bit of time discussing the challenges of interpreting and teaching history.",
    "Absolutely. Regardless of whether you're looking to major in the field, it is still a fascinating subject in its own right and Professor Johnston's teaching style just makes it even better.",
    "Indeed. By far the best humanities class I've taken at Yale. Great lecture and lecturer, but the crown jewel of this course is the section, which is not the case with humanities classes in general. Every one seemed willing to learn and engage each other in section--so much so that I would've been okay if the section was 1 hour 50 minutes instead of just 50 minutes.",
    "Highly. The course required no previous acquaintance with Roman history, but provided a comprehensive exploration of the topic through entertaining and thought-provoking lectures. A fair amount of work is necessary, but well worth it.",
    "Yes, if you're genuinely interested in the material and are willing to do the work. The class has a lot of assignments (reading, weekly quizzes, two papers, two exams) so you need to keep up. Professor Johnston is incredibly committed to teaching and his students. His lectures (though they run long every time) are engaging to attend and the TFs he brings in are great. That being said, if you don't genuinely like history\/Roman history, you might get bored.",
    "Yes totally take it!!!! I am a Classics major, so I was especially interested in the material, but I think this class would be great for anyone. You will learn a ton. I looked forward to going to each lecture and I enjoyed them a lot.",
    "Not really, unless theyre really interested in Roman history. Workload is huge for a lecture - readings, readings for section, ID quiz each week, midterm, final, 5 page paper, 10-15 page research paper! Professor Johnston gives good lectures that are usually very interesting, but I wish that the lectures had more flair and personality - sometimes they felt kind of bland (particularly given the amount of text on the slides).",
    "Absolutely. For a student who is ready to prioritize this class above others, Roman Republic is highly analytical and engaging, especially for a lecture. I learned so much about Ancient Rome of course, but also about how relevant and impactful Rome remains today. It was really fascinating to see how the United States reflects back on Rome constantly, often striving for mythological, fantastical ideals of the Roman Republic that never actually existed. If you take this course youll learn as much about the present as you do the past.",
    "Yes! This is a great course taught by a great professor. The course is structured in a way that encourages exploration of both historical narratives and their applicability to the modern day. By the end of the course, a student will gain a decent understanding of the overall history of the Roman Republic, in-depth understandings of specific areas (thanks to the two papers), and new questions and ideas about the role that history plays in cultures.",
    "Yes, absolutely",
    "I would recommend this course, only be advised: it is a significant undertaking! There was a lot to do, from a heavy slate of readings (including section readings not included on the syllabus) to a paper prompt that required comparison of at least six different passages from at least four different historians (whew!). On the other hand, Professor Johnston is a superb teacher. His version of Roman history includes the Punic Wars, of course, but also Mussolini and (especially) contemporary theorizations of social\/cultural memory. This could rightly be labeled a course on the history of Roman history, or on how to do any sort of history; there, you'll get a two-in-one! Just make sure you're planning your semester to handle it.",
    "Yes! This course is a must-take for any Yale student with a modicum of interest in history, classical civilization, or Rome. This course made me think about history and historical methods in entirely new ways, and Professor Johnston is an incredibly engaging lecturer and caring professor.",
    "Yes definitely! This course is amazing. Prof Johnston is incredible and super engaging. PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. Professor Johnston is inspiring and brilliant while being a great teacher. Ive never absorbed as much information as I did from listening to him speak. The material is thrilling as its Roman history and the Romans were crazy.",
    "Yes. It's great background for any classics\/ancient history majors, but it's also really solid training for a responsible way of doing history, which everyone should have."
