    "If you can get into the class, I would definitely recommend it. I think this question is a bit strange, because for the most part, fiction courses at yale aren't about trying to get people to take them, it's about the students trying to get into the courses.",
    "I think MC is a great professor, I have very much enjoyed working with him, have learned a lot. I really appreciate the way he thinks about fiction. Plus just take the class cause you get to write stories, ya know.",
    "Take it if you're honestly interested in creative writing and are going to give your best to the class.",
    "A great class! the current iteration had only one story due which was very little workload and a lot of fun. Cunningham is an invaluable resource. He might not \"teach\" you a lot about writing, but this is an awesome opportunity nonetheless.",
    "Absolutely take it if you get in!",
    "Take it if you want to know if you are any good.",
    "Great for those who want to apply themselves to the art of writing a short story; not so great for those who simply want to dabble in creative writing. One will certainly get out of this course what one puts in."
