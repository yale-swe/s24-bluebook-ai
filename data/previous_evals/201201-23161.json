    "This class has you read many ancient myths and tragedies. There is a lot of reading but only two papers, a midterm and a final, which is about right. Lecture is long-- 75 minutes-- but Professor Robinson is a sweetheart. It definitely helps to be familiar with mythology already-- I wasn't!",
    "Take this course if you are very interested in the subject. I love Greek mythology and that is one of the reasons why this course was a good fit. However, if you are planning on it being a revelatory course take something else.",
    "Very good class, you read some great works of Greek and Roman poets.",
    "The syllabus bizarrely omits the Iliad and the Aeneid, but the reading material is mostly excellent regardless.",
    "I really loved the readings for this class, but Professor Robinson is sometimes hard to follow, and toward the end of the semester, I'm not sure any of our class was listening. That said, you get to read really cool stuff, and I actually enjoyed section, something which happens rarely. The papers and the midterms aren't bad at all. If you need a WR credit, this is definitely a good class to take.",
    "Take it if you have an interest in Greek and Roman mythology. It is not easy though!"
