   "comments": [
    "It's great to learn about Matlab, but I wish there was an easier way. I guess if you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "It is hell. Never take this class.",
    "This course is definitely a challenge, so you should only take it if you're majoring in Biomedical Engineering and have to or if you're not afraid to take a really difficult class (maybe Credit\/D\/Fail). Section attendance is optional, but the additional resources that the TFs post are really helpful.",
    "Here are some tips and general observations for ya: 1) Carson attempts to teach too much in too little time. Be prepared to know a vast breadth of material but not so much depth. I felt like I walked away with a decent knowledge of applicable Matlab but not so much the theory behind it. 2) A little bit of knowledge with statistics and linear algebra will go a long way in this course as the midterm and final focus on the mathematical theory behind what you do in Matlab and not so much the actual programming itself. 3) Carson records his lectures (both voice and screen). This is good because you probably won't understand later lectures at all in real time. In addition, the TAs usually make weekly summaries of the material covered; these are lifesavers. 4) The final has a strong focus on derivations. Know the logic behind them and you'll be able to answer a good number of the questions.",
    "You take this class because you have to. This class is pretty difficult, though, and the final was pretty difficult. Material was not particularly interesting to me",
    "A course that combines an intro to MATLAB with an intro to statistics. Both of these things are extremely valuable skills to have, but neither of them are fascinating in and of themselves. However, I absolutely loved this class: Professor Carson is engaging, and the problem sets are not too difficult. You're probably taking this course because you have to, but I actually really enjoyed my time in the class.",
    "I thought this was a very difficult class. It was not taught well and I was basically confused the entire semester. The psets take a very long time. With the help of other students and the TA you end up doing well on them which is good because they count for 40% of your grade. However, I never felt like I was actually learning the material and that showed on the tests because I found them to be very hard.",
    "BENG 249 is an extremely well taught class which covers a lot of 'non-biology' material. The bulk of the course revolves around statistics, model comparison and the like, which makes sense because they're necessary prerequisites. Although the class can be overwhelming, I think this a necessary component of moving through so much material and there are always resources (TF's, professor, lecture notes, etc...) to help manage it. It will likely be a difficult class, especially if you have no statistics background but considering the amount learned, it's absolutely worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course because it was a useful introduction to programming. I am a graduate student in molecular biology, and I know that this course will serve me very well in my work. I think it's a great skill for people to learn, and Dr. Carson was a dynamic lecturer that did an excellent job of showing us the tools at our disposal.",
    "Take this class, even if you aren't a BME major. I was at first doubtful if I wanted to still be a BME major, but this class, through it was challenging, has shown me the light. BME is the right choice for me.",
    "It's a great but difficult survey of important topics in mathematical biology.it may be hard but it's such a rewarding class and professor Carlson is very passionate about teaching it. You come away learning a lot!",
    "This class was incredible difficult because of how much statistics there were. There was a lot of material, and Carson taught pretty quickly. MATLAB is pretty fun to use once you get a hang of it, but there is a bit of a learning curve in the beginning. The psets are incredibly long and the midterm\/final is pretty difficult. All in all, a useful course, but difficult.",
    "I would recommend the course if they are interested in basic computational methods related to engineering. It might provide them with a useful understanding of the assumptions made in most qualitative analysis.",
    "Good luck!!! Try to understand the material from early on because it just keeps building.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are up for the challenge, and are ready to spend 10-15 hours on weekly psets. This class is taught differently from most other classes in that lectures really only exposure you to concepts, and your learning really comes from psets and self-reading of lecture notes. That being said, the material is REALLY COOL I dont know anyone who wont tell you that in the class. Matlab is super useful and just good to know in general. Id also suggest though, not taking this with Differential Equations ENAS 194. It was a lot together with two weekly grueling psets.",
    "This class moves very fast, and you will get out of it what you put in. Overall, it is very interesting. The problem sets are hard after the first 4, but very doable if you have a diligent study group to work with every week. Exams are hard, but everyone has trouble, so the class is curved. Keep up with the notes, and review them on your own time. Otherwise, you'll feel like you're learning three classes worth of material when you study for the final exam. If you are a BME major, you have to take it. I would recommend it to others as long as they realize it is a ton of work, and you probably won't come out of it with mastery of most of the material. Instead, you go a mile wide and an inch deep.",
    "Honestly, don't take this course unless you have to, even if you are genuinely interested in the material. It has potential, but the information is not presented well--in a dry and incoherent manner. The lectures, problem sets, and exams also seem to interrogate three different information sets.",
    "Only take this class if you have to (if you are a BME major). Otherwise, not only will you be frustrated the entire time, but you will get very little out of it.",
    "Although this is probably the toughest course for the BME major, you just have to struggle through it. It's not as bad as it seems.",
    "Would recommend. Matlab basics"
