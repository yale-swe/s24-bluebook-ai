   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the course was very valuable and well-taught. This is a credit both to Dr Nembhard as well as a kudos to the selection of cases that students were presented with. As a future Health Care Manager, I have appreciated reading and considering other organization's attempts to improve quality of care, decrease costs, and position their organizations for success. The classroom composition is also an interesting facet of the course. While the course is a capstone for HCM students, there is a considerable section of the course who did not complete many of the pre-required courses. (Which may be justified since having the diversity of likely outweighs this aspect.)",
    "Strengths: great, caring professor who discusses very relevant and important issues related to health care management Weaknesses: the reading list was often redundant, so I would recommend culling it a little more carefully. Also, we were given links to the readings, which often did not work. In the future, I would recommend actually downloading the articles and storing them on ClassesV2. The same goes for the cases. In no other class, have we had to purchase our own copy of the case, so it was not clear to me why we had to purchase cases for this class.",
    "This course is perfect in any aspects, it demonstrates the best class of Yale.",
    "Strengths: it is one of the only case-based learning courses offered at YSPH. Weaknesses: As a HCM \"capstone,\" however, the assignments were not reflective of such. Consider allowing students to work on a month-long project that can present twice on. The presentation topics were too rushed and did not offer the opportunity to have a capstone-esque, long-term critical thinking project. The class size was quite large for the classroom. The layout of the room was not conducive for good discussion.",
    "Allow students to evaluate team presentations. Make us the \"management team\" we ask questions and evaluate teams. Our evaluations can be a part of the grade along with your own assessment. This gives us experience on both sides of the table.",
    "Strengths: like how it was a case-based course and taught in the Socratic method, real world applicability with final project, know that I will take these lessons beyond the classroom Weaknesses: sometimes felt like during presentations, there was not enough time to provide adequate feedback for my peers I would have loved to take this class in Fall as it would have been very useful for recruiting since many of the concepts covered (problem-solving frameworks) are applicable for interviewing.",
    "Professor Nembhard seems very knowledgeable however I found the class discussion lacking. I think she should start cold calling it is clear most of the class didn't prep. Also the room is terrible for discussion.",
    "(+) pulls in ideas from other HCM required courses - competitive strategy, marketing, negotiations, finance\/econ\/policy, accounting. The discourse style is engaging and interactive and Ingrid corrects if we go off course. Ingrid also knows us all on a personal level, so we are comfortable speaking our minds. She establishes camaraderie among the class even between the AP, Policy, HCM and non-SPH students -- we all know that it is a safe place for learning. Ingrid has high expectations for us and motivates us to take more risks, try harder, and think about the bigger picture. And she inspires us every week to see us as we are: future healthcare leaders. (suggestions for improvement) - Since the cases are available by reserve at the library, have the TA appoint someone to scan the cases and email the class. Or post to classesv2. The HCM students all got the cases in the binder because I scanned them and emailed them out. - We could have used another email or in-person reminder about the barriers to entry regarding the 2nd Paul Levy\/BID case. If the TA had set up time(s) like Wednesday, 2-3 pm, Friday 3-4 pm, during which we could all come and see the 2nd case and work on it together, I would have definitely done that.",
    "I think the midterm and final presentations the professor should just let the class know that we should expect to leave 30min past the regular allotted time. I think this would have been respectful of our time as students especially if we have plans post-class. As a student you don't want to walk out unexpectedly but it helps us plan our evenings accordingly on those days. Also, I think purchasing the course cases were definitely a weakness, I would rather that the price be included in the course as part of tuition fees at the beginning of the semester. This definitely deterred many people from being able to participate. Otherwise, I like that it was a culmination of our management courses thus far but with a healthcare focus each week: quality, management, etc",
    "Weaknesses: I wish there was more analysis rather than summarization of the cases. Would have loved to do more critical thinking in the class. Strengths: The content of the ACO lecture was great.",
    "Really really good course. I liked how it was case based and touches upon a lot of topics taught in the health care management curriculum. The class was very integrated with what I know. I really liked the various healthcare topics we discussed as well as the cases.",
    "I truly enjoyed the structure of this course. It was thematic in nature, and very applicable to what is happening in healthcare today.",
    "There were so many good organizational concepts and research in the PPT's that were not covered in class. While the case method is very interesting, I think it would be effective to tie what was learned through the cases to what the research says in the PPT. (Essentially the PPTs were too glazed over when in reality they were very interesting). I loved this course- great capstone course!",
    "Strengths: A great way to synthesize material I've learned over the past 2 years. Not only does the casework allow one to apply concepts\/skills from other classes, but there is also a lot of new concepts re: leadership, problem-solving, management, etc. that are new. Weaknesses: Sometimes the discussions were controlled by the students, rather than the Professor. Improvement: I think it would be better if students were expected to provide thoughtful remarks consistently. Oftentimes, students could get away with no answering questions or answering them in a comedic way.",
    "It requires a lot of energy for each class (prep & discussion). But if you keep doing it, you'll enjoy later.",
    "This is a wonderful course that helps students apply management approaches to real cases. Professor Nembhard is a wonderful teacher and she always keeps the class entertaining and on point.",
    "It is a great course for those interested in working on leadership positions in the healthcare field. The case based format is engaging and illustrative",
    "The course was largely centered around cases. However, the case discussion in class often times felt like a regurgitation of case facts rather than an analysis. I would have preferred if we had just spent an hour on analyzing the case and the second hour a lecture from Ingrid. She would often squeeze a lecture into the last 20 minutes of class and I felt like they contained substantive information that I wish we would have had more time for. I thought that the midterm and final projects were good but the final project could have used a little more guidance. The timing of the final case write-up and final group presentation felt a little close. Considering that this was the capstone for my program, I was expecting more. Overall, I was somewhat underwhelmed largely due to the fact that the case discussions were not engaging. I also think that the Professor should buy the rights to the required cases and provide them to students rather than asking students to purchase cases. This was my only class at Yale where I was asked to purchase the individual cases.",
    "Very good course. Ties together a number of concepts. Could benefit from perhaps breaking up the presentations and write ups so both aren't due the same week. Peer feedback is helpful, but perhaps video recordings would be more productive.",
    "Excellent course. Strengths: high value coursework, case-led",
    "Strengths: course is a great survey of various topics in health care management; understandable by both HP and HCM students; interesting diversity of topics covered; use of HBS cases for learning and teaching Weaknesses: cannot think of any",
    "Definitely a great learning experience. Ties together everything I've learned thus far in my coursework at YSPH and SOM electives. Though not an HCM student, I did not feel lost in the material. The professor did a great job of walking us through the essential management theories, concepts, and frameworks.",
    "Excellent course, very informative, step wise approach to management, a whole variety of learning subjects, very very well organized course.",
    "A well structured course which ties together concepts of healthcare management. Case studies were very innovative and the greatest strength was the experience and knowledge of Prof Nembhard.",
    "Fun to work in teams for the cases. Write ups help crystalize thinking.",
    "Amazing. It is truly the capstone class."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Professor Nembhard is an excellent professor, kind woman, and brilliant academic. It is clear that she invests a great deal of her time and energy into us, as students and future colleagues. I believe her greatest strength is her ability to deconstruct complex issues and make them approachable. For future healthcare leaders, this is a critical skill to possess. I believe an area for improvement would be facilitating classroom discussions. I believe Professor Nembhard creates a environment that is comfortable and conducive to sharing ideas. This is greatly appreciated. However, I sometimes feel that the quality of discussion and student's contributions wane and decrease due to this -- students simply 'throw out ideas' and shout out only half-conceived thoughts. Compared to other discussion-based courses, I think this occurs more often than in others. It is certainly a delicate balance to foster a classroom culture, but this is an observation.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Knowledgeable, thoughtful, and very committed to student learning.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0She is a legend, I enjoyed the time listening to her class.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Very well planned out classes and thoughtful preparation. There were times when the class would get off-topic and ended up being unbearable as students would blurt out random answers and not act as professionally as a course should warrant. It would be helpful to improve ability to shutdown these comments and set a more professional tone for the course at the beginning. I found these comments extremely distracting and detrimental to the course material and learning objectives.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Clearly passionate about material. Allow more flexibility in frameworks etc. Many ways to crack an egg.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Strengths: lovely personality, liked her method of teaching with the Socratic method, discussing the case, and then discussing high-level insights and real world applicability, professor was open to discussion and diverging opinions Weaknesses:",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0She seemed well prepped. Should do more calling. Didn't really feel like much of a capstone. Perhaps students could work on a real problem throughout the semester then present as a final.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Amazing. Very engaging in a way that makes students comfortable.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is the best professor I've had in my entire two years here. (+) Really personable way of talking to us made me feel seen and included, and willing to contribute. I liked it when Ingrid challenged people (or me) to go deeper about what makes a a healthcare organization so successful - she has good discretion about when to ask people to reflect more vs talk herself. Class concepts are taught in an organized fashion without being dry, because she allows spontaneity in the room to occur. She has a wicked sense of humor and memory. I will miss this class and Ingrid very much. (opportunities) I liked the slides but wish we had more time to look through them and hear Ingrid's thoughts on them, over having in-class discussions. Overall I think there was a good balance between discussion and slides though. Also I think Ingrid can be EVEN STRICTER (in a nice way)!! So that people know in the beginning that this class is not a joke and to do the readings besides the main case. Even if it's just to skim the abstracts. There has to be incentive for us to do the additional readings. A stern word at the beginning and then at the very moment you suspect students are not doing the readings would do the job. I also wonder if some of the cases could be updated as they seem outdated, in particular, the BTE case.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0I think Ingrid is definitely an authority in the field and knows the complications and difficulties of managing healthcare organizations. I think the cases she chose represented many different aspects and well as regions in the world.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0She led discussion and engaged the class well.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0She is an outstanding academic and healthcare professional. I would strongly encourage others to take her class and even find opportunities for personal advice and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is one of the most genuine professors that you'll ever meet. She is amazing! One thing that can be improved is classroom control. People say and do a lot of dumb and inappropriate things. Instead of reprimanding, Ingrid would laugh it off or play along. It made the class seem less professional and serious than it should have been. Secondly, when asking for answers to her questions, Ingrid would allow all that wanted to answer to answer. Some people would say obviously wrong answers, instead of saying they were wrong, Ingrid would add them to a list on the board. It would be better if Ingrid would highlight what some of the most important and best answers are.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Strengths: Very knowledge about healthcare management and leadership. Forces students to think critically about healthcare cases and also connects cases to research articles and academic literature. It is a nice combination. Weaknesses: Often will laugh along with students and accept any answer that is thrown out, which led to a relaxed environment. Improvement: The Prof is very smart and should expect students to rise to her caliber, rather than going with the flow of the students.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Proactive, approcahable, and excellent teaching.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Professor Nembhard is one of the most talented educators at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Very well informed. Engaging and concern about the quality of the class.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Professor Nembhard definitely cares about her class and engaging students in the discussion. I think she should restructure the course so that she can lecture a little more and revisit how she leads case discussions. Finally, at times it felt like she lost control of the classroom. While, I think it is important to create a relaxed environment and this class is unique in that it brings the HCM\/Healthcare students community together in a classroom (a community that is friends outside of the classroom), at times it felt unprofessional. I think that Professor Nembhard should make sure that students maintain professionalism despite their familiarity with each other.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Extremely intelligent and engaging. Wonderful to learn from.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0One of the best instructors I've had at YSPH. She is incredibly engaging and talented at portraying information. She is motivating and interesting. She is also very fair, grades wise.",

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Excellent professor. Clear, articulate, insightful, engaging. Her teaching style made me want to really learn the material and participate, even though I'm quite shy.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Outstanding. She is extremely dedicated, very involved, amazing teaching style, takes the class together, starts with a broad question and scopes us in to the crux of every theme. Ingrid puts her heart and soul into teaching. Spends great amount of time preparing, grading, giving feedback. Having a completely zero background in management and economics, this was a huge learning step for me and Ingrid surely made it worthwhile.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid was amazing and it was a privilege to study under her. Her knowledge and experience were the highlight of the course.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Thorough and well researched.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is an amazing teacher and an amazing mentor. She's an expert in the field and knows so much. She delivers the lectures well. She also makes herself readily available for help too. Thank you so much Ingrid."
