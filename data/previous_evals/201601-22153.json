    "I wrote my senior thesis under this class and it really allowed me to find the nuances of a subject that I knew much about, but not necessarily too critically. I appreciated that Professor Smith understood the \"rage against the machine\" mentality but still pushed me to find the intellectual pieces that brought my thesis to the next level. He was incredibly helpful in office hours and the class material greatly aided my research, but he allowed my ideas to take shape without constraining them to the course. It was a fantastic class and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to write my thesis with it."
