   "comments": [
    "I will recommend. We learnt from the readings on mental illness, homosexuals, and many other social issues. We can also develop our own opinions toward these problems.",
    "This is a great course for improving your writing. It is designed for freshman and sophomores so there is plenty of time between each writing assignment to work on the essays. Most essays are completed in stages where multiple drafts are due so that students can receive feedback. I found this to be very helpful in the writing process.Professor Gutkin was extremely helpful throughout the semester. He was available to read all drafts of essays and provide feedback for improvement before the final draft was due.",
    "English 114 07 was a very interesting and entertaining course. I enjoyed the subject matter very much and it was very helpful in learning how to make and support well-structured claims.",
    "A lot of work, but beneficial overall",
    "It taught me a lot not only about outsider, but also how to write.",
    "English 114 with Prof Gutkin is a good intro English class. The readings are interesting and aren't too long, and the discussions in class are usually fun. Prof Gutkin is always willing to give feedback and meet with students to help them with their writing.",
    "Straightforward English class that focuses on the craft of argumentation with an awesome and down-to-earth professor.",
    "There's nothing special about 114- it's just a basic intro writing course. You only have 4 papers all year and if you put effort into each one then you'll likely get a good grade in the class. 114 wasn't particularly entertaining or interesting, and the discussions for my section were lacking. Overall it's a useful writing course, but nothing more. Last thing- don't be fooled and thing that this is a literary analysis course; it's not. You write papers in which you critique the writing stye of the authors, and spend no time on the actual content. If you want an awesome literary analysis course where you read amazing novels and have great discussions about the content in class, then don't take 114.",
    "English 114 was a decent introductory English writing class. I took the \"Outsiders\" section, and your experience may vary depending on your professor and section."
