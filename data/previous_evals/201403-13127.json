    "I would describe it as a class on how to write personal essays. I would recommend it to another student because I felt like the course allowed fro a lot of creativity when writing.",
    "English 120 is an ESSAY writing course. I'd never written or knowingly read an essay before taking the course, and I doubt I ever will again. It teaches many techniques of writing in an area I will seldom if ever use again. I would recommend this course to someone who enjoys writing for fun. It's not, as I expected it to be, useful for writing research papers or other, more useful, papers.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. The class gave me a little bit of anxiety in terms of grading (it seems that everyone got the same grade on each of the earlier essays so everyone freaked out together), so I decided to take it Credit\/D\/F. In the end I learned so much, read great essays, and improved my writing to a noticeable level.",
    "I had to choose between ENGL114 and ENGL120 and I ultimately chose ENGL120. Some of the sections in ENGL seemed really cool, but I felt that ENGL120 would help me more with personal essay writing and it'd be more diverse in regards to topics. Looking back I really enjoyed the course. The personal essay writing skills that I gained in this class are definitely applicable to any other writing-related assignments that I'll have in the future. Part of the reason why I loved this course was because you got to write about yourself. In ENGL120 you write a total of 5 essays. One week you'd write a draft and the next you'd write a revision. Each essay is around 1000 words. The class meets twice a week and each class lasts an hour and fifteen minutes. The homework is very doable and enjoyable, at least for my section it was. A lot of the essays I read were beautifully written, a few of them were long, a few were boring. What's great about this course is that I felt my writing improve overall. For a lot of kids your improvement won't be immediate, but there will be improvement in the end. I took ENGL120 with Shifra Sharlin. This was Professor Sharlin's first year teaching ENGL120 at Yale. ENGL120 meets two times a week and each class is 1 hour and 15 minutes long. In the beginning of the semester class started out somewhat slowly. This was partly due to the fact that there were only seven kids in my section. In other ENGL120 sections (there are a total of 14 sections) there were 10-15 kids per section. Shifra is probably one of the nicest and chillest teachers you will meet at Yale. Kids in other sections of ENGL120 had to read 5-6 essays for each class. Shifra made her students read either 2 or 3 essays for each class, and in class we'd just talk about the essays we read for homework and analyze some of the techniques that the authors used. Sometimes we'd have to write short reading responses in which we talked about something we really liked in an essay we read. Sometimes we'd have to write a blog post on Shifra's blog; you can talk about anything on this blog, what you learned in class discussion that day, what technique an author used and how you want to incorporate that technique into your next essay, and even post your own essay onto the blog for other students to read. Shifra assigns her own essays to her students for homework - other sections have to read 5-6 essays for each class but Shifra picks 2-3 essays for her students for each class. Most of the essays that she picked for her students were amazing and really eye-opening in terms of techniques that authors used to write a powerful essay. A few essays were long and sometimes boring, but overall the essays that we read were enjoyable. I'd say that reading the essays we had for homework is what helped improve my writing most in ENGL120. Workshopping my essay in class and meeting with Shifra personally and reading her comments were both helpful, but, at least for me, reading is learning, and I learned a lot by reading the essays Shifra assigned. Overall, Shifra is a very insightful and chill teaching. She's very understanding of her students and, although class discussion dragged at times, I couldn't have been happier with my choice to take ENGL120 with Shifra. I experienced my first semester at Yale with a great teacher and saw my writing improve with each essay, perhaps even finding a consistent voice for my personal essay writing - my writing voice. I'm glad I decided to take ENGL120 and not ENGL114, and I'd make the same decision again if I were given the option."
