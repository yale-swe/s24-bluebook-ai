    "I would summarize PSYC 671 as an in depth exploration of theory of mind. I would recommend the course to any student who is really interested in theory of mind. There is a good amount of reading each week, but it is easy to get through if you have a vested interest in the subject.",

    "I learned the core literature of the field.",

This helps with my own research, which I believe overlaps tangentially with this literature, I think by being able to pull in more insight from this line of work it will strengthen my theoretical perspective.",
