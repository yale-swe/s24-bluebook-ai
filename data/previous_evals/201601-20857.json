   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it. Professor Harkema is a wonderful professor who strikes the perfect balance between her own talking and the class's involvement. The content, despite its focus on a single author, is highly varied and engaging. A caveat: you may want to consider doing an introductory course to Spanish literature before going in detail into one author, especially if you are a person who enjoys knowing the broad historical context of the works you are studying. It's not that you will not learn about the immediate historical context of Unamuno's writing in class, but you might find it helpful to have read, for example, Cervantes, Vega, or Lorca.",
    "This class is a thorough, in-depth look at the life and work of Miguel de Unamuno from many different angles. I really recommend it even if you think you are not particularly interested in this author because you will learn a lot about Spanish literature and culture as well. Professor Harkema is also wonderful and the class has a fairly manageable workload.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you know you really like Miguel de Unamuno, and that means all aspects of his life, not just a portion of his work. Also, make sure your reading comprehension is good, or it will be too difficult \/ not worth the time it takes to do all of the reading. If you're a huge Spanish lit fan though, then it's probably fine.",
    "This is an excellent class if you're comfortable with reading advanced Spanish literature (a lot of it!) and enjoy it. It's definitely the best Spanish class I've taken at Yale in terms of practicing oral skills\/really close textual analysis. You will get to know your classmates well too!"
