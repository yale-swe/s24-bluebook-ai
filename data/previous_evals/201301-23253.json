   "comments": [
    "English 120 is a classic Yale course and a great class. It's well organized, with interesting and engaging readings, a fair but rigorous workload, and well-spaced essays. Moira Weigel is a wonderful, competent, and engaging professor. She's fair and clear about her expectations without being overly domineering or demanding. She facilitates and competently guides class discussions in a way that feels natural and encourages student participation. I really enjoyed learning from her and she challenged me to think creatively about writing. This was a great class and I do think I've improved as a writer.",
    "Definitely take it, but it is very important to have a good teacher\/classroom dynamic. After all, there is a lot of \"sharing\" in this class, so you have to be comfortable speaking your mind",
    "It is a lot of work for little payoff. Enjoyed the readings but not the actual course. Don't take it unless you have the time to put into deep analyses of readings, otherwise you'll find yourself wondering why we're wasting so much time on such little details.",
    "English 120 is a great course to work outside of the box and test yourself. It is not very heavy in reading - maybe around an hour for each class, sometimes less and sometimes more. Class time is spent discussing what we've read and how we can apply it to our own writing.I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to work on their writing, and especially anyone who doesn't want too much reading to do.",
    "It's a great class to try your hand at creative writing. Readings were very interesting, although sometimes quite long. Even if writing isn't your thing, this class will help you develop as a writer and expose you to many modern writers. Moira gave great feedback on drafts.",
    "English 120 is true to its reputation as being one of the bestwriting courses at Yale. Through writing essays ranging from a personal essay to cultural critique and satire, I learned specific tricks from authors like David Foster Wallace and Joan Didion while learning how to utilize word choice and sentence structure for heightened effect. I would encourage a student to take this course if at all possible; the communication skills gained here will be helpful in a wide variety of contexts later.",
    "I found the course both enjoyable and valuable, even as a senior humanities major who has taken quite a few writing-based courses in my time. It's a pleasant and interesting way to improve your writing and learn to be conscious of the craft that goes into the things you read.Anyway, really great - take it with Moira Weigel. She's a brilliant teacher and editor and manages to make the classroom and workshop environment friendly and non-threatening. She's also worked as a magazine editor and writer and can help you shape your prose for that kind of writing, if that's what you're interested in!.",
    "Take this class, Prof Weigel is great.",
    "I would definitely take English 120, but I would make sure that you LOVE the teacher before you commit to that section. I think my English 120 experience would have been better had I waited another semester, and taken it with a teacher with whom I could better connect.",
    "Take ENG 120 if you want to think about English in a different way. I learnt to critique articles that appear in the New Yorker and the Atlantic, as well as to think of ways to make them better. I am not a person that is drawn to English classes, but I found this course very practical. It avoids all the traditional literary device\/feature\/thesis state aspects of literature analysis and teaches you what is at the heart of a good essay: conveying info in an entertaining and flowing way.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to any student as a way to quickly develop essential writing and critical skills. It is a great class!",
    "English 120 is a classic Yale English class, and I feel like you should take it before you leave. As for Moira, she's quite good. We read a peculiar selection of essays and other things, but I enjoyed the vast majority of them. Class discussions were interesting, and my writing definitely improved. I shopped another English 120 class before deciding on this one, but I'm glad I switched.",
    "I had high expectation of English 120 based on other course evaluations saying it was the best course ever, one that you cannot graduate Yale without taking, etc. While it was a great class, I wouldn't say it was as amazing as a lot of others say it is. I don't feel my writing improved that much, but I am happy that I wasable to write essays of so many different genres. The readings were short and great, and workshopping other people's essays (and having them workshop your own) is a valuable learning experience. Take this course, but by no means feel like you have to."
