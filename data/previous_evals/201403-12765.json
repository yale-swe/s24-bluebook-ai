   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course! I loved learning about animation as a medium (something I initially knew little about) and as a diverse and constantly evolving art form. Professor Gerow was very knowledgable and engaging, and films were well-chosen. There was quite a lot of reading for this course, and Professor Gerow expected students to be able to articulate arguments made in the readings during class. Though numerous, I thought these readings (for the most part) were helpful, and enhanced my understanding of the subject.",
    "Take it!",
    "Excellent course if you're new to film studies. Professor Gerow explains important film concepts through the lens of film studies, and it feels pretty natural and intuitive. Because of this, the class moves a little slowly at first if you've already taken Intro Film, but not so slowly that I wouldn't recommend the course. Aaron Gerow does an excellent job of teaching to a wide range of backgrounds (from grad students to first year film students), the content is interesting and varied enough that there's something exciting and interesting for everyone, and the course is overall quite enjoyable. I'd highly recommend it for anyone looking to take a film class."
