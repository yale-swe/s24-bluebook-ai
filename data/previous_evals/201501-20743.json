    "Would definitely recommend if you care to learn how to use the machine shop tools and might need to make something yourself for research\/project etc. The time commitment is reasonable and provides a nice, rewarding escape from the classroom. A good investment of time if you're at all interested!",

    "This course gave me a deeper understanding of the work and precision that goes into fabricating metal parts, ultimately increasing my understanding and appreciation for scientific instrumentation as a whole. I expect that I'll be able to use the skills I learned (and access gained) to fabricate\/modify necessary parts in the lab for either mine or even a labmates' future work.",
    "Machine skill did not help me directly but I know others who have taken this course and then applied the skills to their own research projects.",
    "I'll probably be using the machine shop a lot for my lab. This makes no direct contribution to my research, but knowing how to make the tools used in my research makes it possible in the first place."
