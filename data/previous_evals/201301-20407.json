    "As I said above, I feel like we really got to delve into the works of specific women with the \"great works\" approach, but I would have appreciated the opportunity to read more broadly in the field to get a better sense of the different strands of black feminism and its major debates and change over time.",
    "This class helped me develop a stronger black feminist and womanist lens of analysis, especially with regards to erotic practice\/methodology, a concept I have begun to work with this year (beginning in Professor Allen's class) in my analysis of artistic production and visual\/material culture in America from 1890-present.",
    "This course gave me the tools and readings I needed to further my current research interests."
