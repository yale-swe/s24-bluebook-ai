    "I learned the second part of single variable calculus.",
    "Got better with integrals and learned about series and sequences.",
    "Essential calculus II topics, including: Integrals, Sequences, Series, Taylor\/Maclaurin Series, Differential equations, etc.",
    "I learned all the basics of calculus before the multivariable level. This entailed working with quantitative thinking, graphing, mathematical reasoning, calculator usage, and other elements for understanding calculus.",
    "I think this class helped me strengthen my study skills and time management, which was something I struggled with when I first came to Yale. Because most of the learning was left up to me, I had to learn how to figure out what learning style was best for me.",
    "I helped harness critical thinking skills in relation to calculus.",
    "I solidified my basis in calculus and obtained many useful tools for the future.",
    "Basic calculus skills like integration, testing sequences and series for convergence, and dealing with differential equations.",
    "Taking this course forced me to learn the concepts behind the math then simply remember when to regurgitate formulas which I do think will benefit me in the future (I plan on taking higher level Econ courses)",
    "I learned how to solve improper integrals, series, sequences, area and volume, parametric equations and polar graphs.",
    "I learned how to integrate, evaluate series, find arc lengths and everything math 115 covers. I also learned how to communicate with my instructor and go to office hours.",
    "This course delivers exactly what it promises. I came away with a solid understanding of integral calculus.",
    "A thorough understanding of Calculus that I believe will prepare me for my next math courses",
    "Insights on infinity. Lake is a human person. We are sad. I am an artist."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The set-up of this course is terrible. It is supposed to be a flipped classroom but it results in student just having to do double the work: both at home and in class. The videos are helpful, but the amount of additional work outside of the classroom is to a ridiculous level to be considered anything under the name 'flipped classroom.' All it really does is make the teacher irrelevant. Since we are watching lectures at home, doing problems at home, and doing problems in class the teacher becomes a glorified proctor. I think I could have benefitted from this course far more if it held the set-up of a normal classroom (lectures in class with maybe a worksheet and p-sets at home) or of a true flipped classroom (solely lectures at home and facilitated learning with teachers and students in the classroom).",
    "It's a flipped classroom, which in my opinion, is a really, really bad format to learn math. It's hard to try to learn new topics without an instructor to ask questions in real time.",
    "I am not a fan of the reverse classroom setup, so I think that that could be changed.",
    "I really did not care for the flipped class setting. I wish it was like the other calculus sequences where the professor taught the material first.",
    "Strengths: The online videos were helpful at explaining concepts, the instructor had many office hours available, and the pacing of the course as well as the questions on the hand-out packets were effective in teaching me the subject matter. The video projects and the maximize-score grading system were also well appreciated. As for improvements, there is not much I can say here.",
    "I think I would have had an easier time understanding the material if it had been more of a lecture-style class.",
    "I think the flip lecture is very difficult and requires both a high effort from students and teachers. I think I fell behind at places for both my own lack of diligence and lack of reaching out from my teacher.",
    "The online lectures were sometimes not sufficient.",
    "Strengths: Coursera lectures generally made topics easier to understand. Weaknesses: P-sets were hard, and the flip classroom was not always the best method for learning content.",
    "I don't think I met anyone who liked the flipped classroom though admittedly it allowed me to skip class without falling too behind. I like the emphasis on the process rather than the outcome. I appreciated getting credit for well done work even if I made a computational error along the way. The midterm videos we made weren't beneficial though and I wish there was a study guide for the final",
    "I thought the class time was very productive. However, coursera and the media part of it could be improved because at times it was hard to follow and\/or malfunctioning.",
    "The course was well put together, the only problems that arose were with the coursera software.",
    "The online quizzes were due before class that went over the material, and I wish that they could be attempted before class but if there was still uncertainty, it would be nice if they could be due after class."

   "comments": [
    "No, not unless the structure of the class was greatly reworked.",

    "Absolutely. It is necessary for not only higher-level mathematics but also many STEM courses.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have to take a math course. I would not personally take the course unless it was required or you really like math.",
    "Absolutely. You will learn the calculus well and the instructors will help you along the way.",
    "Yes, it was a difficult class, but it was a rewarding one.",
    "Only if they need to take it to fulfill a requirement; otherwise please don't torture yourself.",
    "You really only take this because you need it for some requirement. It's an ok class. If your just trying to get a QR I'm sure there are better ways.",
    "i think that the flipped classroom made this course especially hard",
    "I would recommend this course. It is required for many majors and not terribly difficult.",
    "Yes, it can be really great, depends on the instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in the material or needed to fulfill a requirement. There are no surprises here.",
    "It prepares one for future math courses."
