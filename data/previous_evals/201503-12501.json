   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any native speaker that would want to become fluent in Spanish.",
    "Definitely not an easy course, but the Professor makes everything easy to understand. The material covered is covered well and tests are very fair.",
    "I would definitely recommend the Heritage Spanish curriculum to anyone who grew up with some Spanish spoken with their family. I gained such valuable tools in a single semester. Even if you aren't sure if the class is right for you, shop it. Professor Alexandrov is a fantastic instructor, and I always looked forward to going to class.",
    "Good if you've never taken a formal Spanish class but are fluent in Spanish. Yes, I would highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course because it fills the gaps in your Spanish in a way that is tailored to what you already know instead of through a general sweep of knowledge.",
    "Spanish 132 is the first course offered for heritage Spanish speakers -- that is, students who grew up in Spanish-speaking households but have never taken any formal Spanish classes. This class is a mix of filling in grammar holes -- that is, gaps in your knowledge of various grammatical points -- and introducing you to the vocabulary and skills needed to speak Spanish comfortably and in a professional setting. If any of that sounds remotely interesting, TAKE THIS CLASS! Profesora Alexandrov is AMAZING."
