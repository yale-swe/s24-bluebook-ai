    "If one has the opportunity to take a class with Professor Brodsky in the future, I wholeheartedly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The work load is moderately high, but it is a great chance to interact with a lot great music, and explore it in-depth from the very interesting perspective of intertextuality.",
    "Shop it to make sure the professor and other students are interesting people with interesting ideas; that is the most important ingredient necessary to make this class work.",
    "A weekly discussion based around the idea that all music can be traced to other music. The focus is on 20th century modernists, though we looked at a few Reich pieces and like, Revolution Nine by the Beatles. A true seminar, in terms of the amount of talking you should expect to do. If you treat the class as an opportunity to talk about whatever really interests you about 20th century music, you'll like it."
