   "comments": [
    "A great anthropology class! You really come away from this course with a better idea of contemporary Japan and where it is headed. Readings are extremely reasonable and relate to lecture quite well. You have a lot of support in writing your three papers- one long, one medium, and one short. Weekly writing assignments are generally only around 250 words. Lectures are also very engaging! Would recommend.",
    "Awesome anthropology class! I took this class for a writing credit, but I'm genuinely glad I took it. Professor Kelly is a brilliant teacher, and you will enjoy being in lecture. 10\/10 would take again",
    "YES. Take this course for a really fun writing credit. You'll come away with a whole new appreciation for modern Japan, but also what it takes to evaluate a society and culture holistically. Super fun. Definitely recommend.",
    "Professor Kelly has a much better teaching style than most lecturers at Yale. He knows just about everything there is to know related to the class. Take this class if you can. The essay assignments are very flexible - you can write about whatever interests you.",
    "Definitely has to be one of the best writing credits out there.",
    "Good course to learn about Japan and it's position in society today. Easy weekly writing assignments and three longer course essays that were fun to write. Take it!",
    "A great course for anyone who is curious about Japanese culture. I knew very little coming in, and I learned quite a lot about how social norms and national identity has changed and continues to change since the postwar era. An intriguing course with a very manageable workload and a great lecturer; perfect for a non-major who is looking for a fifth class that gives them something totally different to think about.",
    "great anthro class that challenges to you to reconsider your pre-conceived notions about other societies. take the class, especially if you are interested in Japan. It was a great class that gives you a big-picture sense of Japan over time.",
    "Reasonable workload, interesting material, shop it and if you enjoy it, take it.",
    "If you want to learn more about anthropology, I recommend this class. Focusing on Japan and applying anthropological tools on one area helped to keep the class organized in my mind. After taking the class, I definitely want to take more classes related to Japan.",
    "Definitely!",
    "A highly interesting course. Looks at Japan through a perspective not based in history, but rather, through the economic\/social\/political implications of changes in social structure since WWII. The lectures run slightly long, but because of the amount of material covered, it makes sense. Take note though, you can only take this course for the WR credit. Also there is heavy reading involved - at least sixty pages per night plus additional work for section.",
    "A very good course taught by one of the leading anthropologists in the field. It turned out to be a lot more about anthropology itself than I expected, but that was still very interesting. The course material about Japan is a really cool blend of things from all over Japanese society. Professor Kelly is extremely knowledgeable, and even though I found it a little odd to talk to him, he was extremely fair. The course has a lot of writing, as it is a writing credit. You will have short writing assignments just about every week, and three ~8 page papers. Having a TA you don't care for can negatively affect this class.",
    "A great way to learn about Japan, anthropology or a means to explore different forms of writing. In light of the events on campus this semester, I would say that this was one of the most appropriate and transformative courses I have taken. It will challenge you not just to learn more about Japanese society, but to questions your own cultural beliefs and ideologies.",
    "I would highly recommend ANTH 254. Very informative class on Japanese culture and the social issues that the country faces. Professor Kelly has a rich knowledge in the field and backs up claims with his own experiences. Many of the articles we read were written by PhD students that he worked with. Though it's a writing class, the reading material did not feel burdensome at all. I looked forward to the articles and videos assigned each week. There were three essays, one 3 pages long and two were supposed to be 10 pages long but the last one was shortened to 6 because time was short in the end, so Professor Kelly is a very fair to students. The second one was a creative writing assignment that wanted us to tell a story in the eyes of a Japanese person. Take the class if you're curious about a different culture, and you may end up learning a little bit about your own.",
    "Basically, there was not a lot of writing for a writing credit course, in my opinion. The readings were all really interesting, one entirely about ramen, and did not feel like readings at all."
