   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this class with Mme Koundi. There is a fair amount busy work but it is not that hard and there are no real surprise questions on the tests: it is all material you should be familiar with.",
    "This class does exactly what it says on the tin: it's Level 3 French. I was frustrated a lot with the class because it uses a lot of really interesting material (Jules et Jim, L'etranger) but never really does justice to any of it; we spent most of the time discussing what happened on a surface level in each assigned reading rather than actually going into any depth on the significance of what we were discussing. There was a lot of work and you have to do all of it if you want to keep up. You might not have a way around this, and it wasn't enough to make me want to stop French, but it could have been so much more and I can't say I'm coming away from it having had a fantastic experience.",
    "This class is a review of most of the tenses and the typical grammatical rules. I think almost everyone taking this class is taking it because they have to, not because they want to be French majors.It was a lot of work. I'm okay with a lot of homework if I learn a lot in the process, but I don't think my French improved enough for 2-3 hours of work per night to be worth it.",
    "it is a very enjoyable course even thought it meets everyday, if you have the right professor and Soumia Koundi was a great one. I recommend it without reservations.",
    "I would recommend taking French L3 to another student to fill a requirement with Mme. Koundi. The course is straight-forward and you do improve your french quite a bit. It is some work but it is worth it to improve your language skills. Otherwise you will not get any better at French."
