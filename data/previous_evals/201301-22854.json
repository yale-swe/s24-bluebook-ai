   "comments": [
    "Great crash course into epistemology and skepticism. Definitely a must take for any philosophy major.",
    "A wonderful course on Epistemology that provides both survey and depth. The readings are picked well and efficiently: they are quite short, but super interesting. Professor DeRose explains the material well and adds his wonderfully unique humor to it. I can only recommend the class.",
    "This course is rigorous, but rewarding. The readings are generally somewhat dense, but not too long. DeRose is an engaginglecturer, and the TA this year, Alex Worsnip, was really kind and good at clarifying things in class. While you can expect to be regaled with great examples to help illustrate theories of knowledge and arguments about skepticism, I would still really recommend some background in philosophy before taking this course (particularly logic). But if you are ready to commit to the class, it can be a great choice.",
    "I would highly recommend Epistemology, especially to potential philosophy majors. Much of the course material has shown up in my other philosophy courses, and I think it was very helpful to concurrently receive this background. That being said, this course is not easy, especially when compared to intro-level philosophy courses. The readings are short, but they are dense and sometimes difficult to wrap one's mind around. Reading responses require a good deal of planning, unlike in other classes where you might be able to simply offer one or two comments or questions about the reading. The course is really interesting, though, and definitely worth taking!",
    "I am a sophomore philosophy major, and all of my classmates in 270 this year were upperclassmen philosophy majors. I do not recommend it as a first course in philosophy. Why? Previous experience in the kind of rigorous analytical thinking of the sort (objection+counterexample -->response+evidence -->counterobjection+example) will be helpful in keeping up with the fast-paced twist&turn lecture style of the professor.It is important to know all of these for the midterm and final- It is more important to GET DOWN ON NOTE everything the professor said, even if you might not be 100% clear on how it fits into the larger pattern of argument. Then, I would strongly recommend for him or her to follow up with the TA (Alex is excellent in this regard and all others) in clarifying and getting a solid grip on the material.",
    "This is a course EVERY philosophy major should take, and I suspect that students in many other departments (especially the sciences and religious studies\/theology) would benefit from. It is a class that has informed the way I look at the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094after all, knowledge plays a fundamental and crucial role in our relation to ourselves and the world around us. I also think that the course helped sharpen my thinking about philosophical issues generally, i.e., not just those in epistemology. Prof. DeRose is FANTASTIC. Take advantage of this class!"
