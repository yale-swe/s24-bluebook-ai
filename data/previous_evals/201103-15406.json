    "The class itself can be a bit disorganized and lacking in structure, but when I took it, the class was brand new, so I guess we were the guinea pigs...",
    "It's fun and very relaxed. Take it.",
    "English 114 will teach you how to effectively put the argument in your mind onto paper. It will also teach you how to analyze extremely dense pieces of literature and how to organize and navigate writing large pieces.",
    "Lot's of writing and critiquing. Don't know, though, how much better a writer it makes you.",
    "I would recommend this class if this topic intrigues you.And even if it doesn't, it's a really good topic to chew on in your head. The class makes you look at the news article you read slightly differently.",
    "I would say that this is a typical introductory English class. It teaches basic essay writing skills. I would recommend it because it is a good introduction, and you can learn more in depth of whatever topic is covered by your seminar.",
    "For those who like critical theory, excellent!"
