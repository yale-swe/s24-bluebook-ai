   "comments": [
    "very good",
    "Learn a lot",
    "strengths: the topics covered are very relevant to public health work in real world. good exposure to what I'll be doing in the future.weaknesses: please post slides more promptly before class, maybe talk more about different measurement methods instead of talking about specific studies too much. (studies won't help me about my future career as much as the methods)",
    "One thing I liked the most was having guest speakers to come talk. I learned a lot through applying the concepts in the specific field of epidemiology each speaker represented. I also really enjoyed the group projects. I learned a lot through thinking through the study design for our proposal and by hearing others.",
    "Liked hearing from a variety of speakers",
    "I enjoyed the seminar structure of the course with a different topic being covered each week. It helped to further my understanding of many different public health issues.I would have appreciated it if the midterm and final exams were more structured.",
    "good course, but similar to epi, data management",
    "Covered a broad range of measurement issues and applied them to different disease\/ study design settings which made them easier to understand, and forced you to really be a better critic of research. The group assignment was great in that in designing your own study you are forced to think about all of the small details that need to be sorted before you can conduct research",
    "I enjoyed this course very much. The guest speakers were excellent and from a variety of backgrounds. The assignments were enjoyable and I looked forward to doing them. The course material reinforced what we are learning in other courses and helped me to think more critically about study design.",
    "one of those classes that gives a general overview, but nothing specific enough to be useful. maybe a class that focused specifically on bias\/confounding\/effect mod would be more helpful.",
    "This is a pretty good course.Strengths: learning how to critically evaluate literature. Learning a wide variety of methods used in epi studies.Weaknesses: seems geared towards nutrition and cancer topics with little attention paid toward psychosocial measurement issues. Some of the readings were difficult to access (links take you to the wrong paper).",
    "Excellent course that has a lot of tremendous application value. The professor is wonderful, and the material is helpful for anybody who wants to conduct research or understand research papers at a higher level.",
    "I thought the course provided very useful practice and reinforcement of epidemiological concepts. I found it to be a bit disjointed with the many different speakers; some lectures seemed to focus more on particular research projects rather than the primary focus being on the measurement issues inherent in these projects, but overall I enjoyed hearing a variety of perspectives.",
    "Good.",
    "general introduction, but papers chosen for mid-term exam and final exam are a little boring....",
    "the course is good in providing general overviews of measurement issues in estimating various exposures and outcomes. However it may be improved by having more focused discussions on measurement issues involved in each of the lectures."

    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Having a variety of lecturers provided depth, as experts were able to talk about their own research and measurement issues that have come up in a real life context. The questionnaire development lecture was also very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr Ma is an excellent instructor. She is extremely knowledgeable, a good speaker, and very professional. She was very open to giving feedback on assignments and was very available to the students for general support.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0very monotone, but really sweet and kind.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma did a great job. She selected knowledgeable guest speakers for a variety of topics. The lectures she gave were great.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Excellent - they cares about her students and cares about teaching. She will meet with you after class, and loves speaking with students. She is also wonderful about providing advice on projects not directly related to her class. For example, I spoke to her about quality control measures for a project that I was conducting, and she always provided insightful advice and spoke at length about the pros and cons of various options. Since her class focused on Measurement Issues, she was more than happy to see students apply the knowledge they were learning in class.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma provided us with very valuable and helpful feedback regarding papers and presentations. She also graciously offered to help us at any point in the future, which I was particularly grateful for.",

   "comments": [
    "very good and required",
    "Interesting",
    "good for CDE students, but may not be relevant for students from other department",
    "The term \"measurement issues\" is a quite vague and perhaps confusing term, but the content in the course is very applicable to epidemiology and is very useful. It helped reinforce concepts from Epi I and II and was instrumental in building critical thinking skills and aiding in the process of study design.",
    "This was a valuable, interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in designing your own studies\/ or if you want to be a better critic of research. It really forces you to think outside the box",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to reinforce epidemiological concepts and to strengthen critical analysis of study design.",
    "ehhh",
    "This class prepares you to think critically about measurement issues. If you are interested in smoking, drinking, nutrition, exercise, biomarkers, cancer and mortality, it is great. If you're interested in psychosocial epi, there's relatively little in it for you.",
    "A must take class that prepares you to initiate real world research projects. If starting a research project is not a goal, the course provides wonderful insight on who to understand the limitations and strengths for research that is out there. Overall, a very practical class with enough theory to allow students to understand the best way to answer a research question.",
    "Useful",
    "a good course to get a deeper understanding of the very measurement issues involved in epi studies"
