   "comments": [
    "If you have any interesting in Vikings, early medieval Europe, or the work of an historian, this class is fantastic. It emphasizes a lot on primary sources, and in some ways is more like an English class than a high school history class. It helps a lot if you have some background knowledge (even pretty basic stuff) or enough interest in the material to go and get some.The papers are many but not too long or hard.",
    "The Viking Age is above all a writing course. With five short essays and one final paper, you will improve at coming up with and supporting persuasive, text-based arguments. Be prepared to read lots of primary sources on the internet. If you want to take a real history class, look elsewhere.",
    "I learned a lot about improving my writing - Professor Winroth was very good at concentrating on short essays and helping us clean up the prose and present logical arguments.It was also very interesting to read only primary source documents and to get a glimpse of how a \"real\" historian thinks about sources and arguments and writers, as opposed to just reading a textbook and taking that as historical truth.However, the topic was a little overspecific - I would much rather have studied more than just Scandinavia and the Vikings. The readings got a little tedious and were all very similar to each other.The classes were always very interesting and Professor Winroth was very good at engaging the class in discussion and having us think for ourselves. I really loved learning from Professor Winroth, but the texts got a little dry and boring and repetitive.Just be warned - this is not a survey course about Vikings! Professor Winroth is much more interested in teaching how to analyze primary sources.",
    "More of a how to approach history class than a history class",
    "Take this course if you want a good, solid background in how to write a good scholarly historical paper. Professor Winroth spends a lot of time making sure all his students know how to improve their writing, and I feel that my writing did improve as the semester went on. The end of the semester is great -- a field trip to see the Vinland Map, guest speakers, and, my favorite, an actual Viking raid on the Old English class upstairs in LC. Warning, though, don't expect an easy A; you'll have to work for your grade!",
    "The course was rather boring, but Winroth is a great professor and often makes it worth it.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you're really, really sure that you're interested in the material. Otherwise, it can be very boring. The papers aren't too bad as long as you follow Craft of Research. It's a bit difficult to understand what Professor Winroth is looking for. However, Professor Winroth was great, it was clear that he really cared about his students, which was really nice and comforting as an incoming freshman.",
    "The Viking Age is about the Viking Age as it truly happened. I entered the class thinking that the class would be cool, and it was, but it wasn't the Viking History I imagined. The class is not so much about Viking Raids, as Viking culture, religion, and trade. I would recommend this class to anyone who is genuinely interested in the Viking Age, as the subject matter, though not what I expected, was still engaging. Expect to read many primary source documents, some of which can be difficult to read through. Also, I recommend the class for the professor, as Anders Winroth is great.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. The best professor ever, a wildly interesting topic, and vast effortless learning. The seminar structure made it even better; everyone contributed. We read and analyzed many primary sources, wrote nunumerous short essays, aad received vallaa feedback.",
    "YES! Viking Age is an amazing class that really improves your writing! Some of the readings are boring, but it is best for your papers to read all the documents. This class does ask you to write papers, but Professor Winroth is nice in his grading and really helps you improve your papers.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in early medieval Scandinavian culture, which is a not-frequently-addressed and interesting topic. Do not be misled by the title of the class, however, and think that it is focused on military matters; warrior culture and some military matters are addressed, but not in great depth. Be sure you can commit to waking up early enough for this class every day though... 9am may sound late for a high school student, but it's the crack of dawn in college.",
    "I think this course's workload is very manageable and interesting to those who want more knowledge about the Vikings. I would recommend this course to those who can work with vague prompts, because I found that to be my main difficulty in the course.",
    "An excellent course, it teaches much of the methodology of history."
