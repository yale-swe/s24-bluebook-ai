   "comments": [
    "This is a very interesting class. You spend the entire semester reading from anthologies of Hamilton's and Jefferson's letters (that's it), and you get really good at reading 18th-century mail. Most of the work of the semester goes into a 20 page research paper that is HARD. She holds your hand through the process, though, and won't let you drown. Basically, Freeman teaches you how to read and write history more than what happened in the time period, so don't expect to know anything about the chronology or details of the history of the early American government. Overall, I think I would recommend this class-- it's a good atmosphere and Freeman really cares about her students. But, like I said, don't take it for the sake of widening your historical knowledge. Take it for the sake of honing your skills as a historian.",
    "Great class, learn a lot about the time period, very paper intensive",
    "This course is an absolute slam dunk, exploring the fun side of Early American history. If you haven't taken a class from Joanne Freeman yet, DO IT. Joanne Freeman is simply the greatest. I've never had a professor so openly and enthusiastically passionate about their work. She's one of a kind, and I'm lucky to have taken a seminar with her.",
    "Excellent American history credit if you are like me not enamored of American history.",
    "This was a really fun class, great to get to know Hamilton and Jefferson as people. It's pretty informal and you pretty much just read their letters and discuss whatever you find interesting, which makes it pretty low stress for most of the semester. The final paper was much more involved, and can be a little stressful in the middle of the semester (a full rough draft is due early November) but it is extremely helpful to get so much feedback on it. I've taken several history seminars at Yale and never had a professor taken so much interest in helping us improve and learn to write a true research paper before. Everyone should have the opportunity to work with a professor like Professor Freeman before writing their senior essay.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I came into the class with an interest in the early republic. I felt that I left the class with a better understanding of the period, and I learned a lot about Hamilton and Jefferson by reading their letters.",
    "This was a great course the professor is nice, looking at primary sources is a drag and can make you totally exhausted if you dont know what you are getting yourself into. I had less to say in class as a result. Also, while the professor is very dedicated and reads our first drafts, you can meet with her exactly twice because she is busy and too famous. You get the experience of writing an ok paper but very little feedback. I found history people in the writing centre to help.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's interesting and fun--I laughed nearly as much as I learned, and I learned a lot. A word of advice -- work steadily on the research paper from the beginning, because you just won't be able to get it done well if you wait until the last minute."
