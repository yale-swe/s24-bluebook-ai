   "comments": [
    "Lots of reading. Great course. Take it.",
    "YES, do Directed Studies, and cherish Lit class. Especially with Karin Roffman. It's obviously a lot of reading, so it's not like you'll have a bunch of time to mull over and re-read the literature, but it's incredibly rewarding anyway. Discussion is really fun, just because there are so many weird, incongruous, emotional, funny, vague passages, sentences, chapters that throw everyone for a loop. And then you talk about it, and it can be hilarious, or profound, or irritating. I loved DS Lit. You might love it too.",
    "Great class, definitely would advise if the student were in DS.",
    "Anyone interested in the humanities should take it. Timeless texts, crucial to understanding the western canon.",
    "This course goes through material less quickly than the other two DS classes because we usually read the works in their entirety, so I found it a lot less overwhelming than philosophy and H&P. I feel like I gained more from the works because we went through them more slowly than the books in the other classes.",
    "DS Literature is a great course. Out of all the DS courses, I am so glad I took this one. The reading is very manageable and enjoyable, and if you have a professor like Professor Roffman, you can expect thoughtful guidance for your papers.",
    "A survey of classical literature which I would absolutely recommend to any student regardless of major--these are really the essential texts.",
    "Directed Studies: Literature is an intense, reading heavy overview of major works in the Western canon from Homer to Dante. It teaches you how to read a text and recognize within point of interest, potential for further discussion, and themes that help you as a reader better understand a text and the many ways one might interpret it. The essay assignments allow you to take those skills and use them to argue for a reading, reinvent a work, and explore in depth what most intrigues you about what you're reading. I would recommend DS Literature to any student interested in or accepted into the Directed Studies program. It was personally my favorite class in DS, both because of the nature of the coursework and the excellent professors and lecturers I was learning from. However, I think Directed Studies is a very specific program which means some students will love it, others will find its not how they learn best. My advice would be to shop it and trust your instincts - if you really love those first weeks, stick with it! If you have doubts about whether or not it's a good fit for you, don't be afraid to reevaluate and make sue your reasons for doing DS will be enough to get you through an intense, but rewarding, semester!",
    "Literature in DS is difficult, most of all because you have to read the entire text to get the most out of it - in H+PT and Philosophy, you can get something from having read most of it carefully even if you couldn't finish all of it, but Literature requires that you read everything carefully. But it's worth it because this is the part of the course where how something is said matters more sometimes even than what is said. It's priceless.",
    "Yes. DS Lit gives a tremendous base in classical literature and also gives interested students small sections which allows them to voice their opinions. Also the lectures were pretty cool."
