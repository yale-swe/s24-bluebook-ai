   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you are not familiar with some of the most fundamental issues that face American public school education today. The professor brings in guest speakers to help us contextualize the events we are learning about in the literature. The speakers are often phenomenal! For example, we were able to speak to the leader of New Haven's teacher union, and he lended a fresh perspective to our debates on the viability of teacher's unions. The lectures can be a little monotonous at times, but overall, the course is fun! I walked out of it having learned a lot more than I expected!!! TAKE IT IF YOU CARE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN!!!!",
    "I would recommend EDST 110 to students who are interested in pursuing the Educational Studies program or need a social sciences credit. Beyond that, the course is pretty simple and an excellent survey of public education in the United States. It is pretty much exactly what I expected.",
    "Great survey course if you are interested in getting a background in just about everything concerning education. The reading material is great",
    "Good if you're already interested in the subject material, probably not worth it if you're just looking for an extra class.",
    "EDST 110 is a great introduction to education policy if you've never had any before!",
    "This is a good lecture, but is not particularly engaging. I enjoyed the readings but didn't feel required to read them.",
    "If you think you might be interested in education, take it. It is engaging and extremely helpful in reviewing a really wide range of topics. Lizzy is also super available and helpful. She really cares and tries to make the class as relevant to current issues and interesting to students as possible, take a class with her if you can!",
    "Great course. Everyone with the slightest interest in education should take this class. Everyone who has ever attended school should take this class. Everyone should take this class.",
    "If they change the format to a seminar and you are very interested in the themes, take it. If not, you will find it hard to keep engaged throughout the term.",
    "If you already know something about American education, this course may be a waste of your time, as it was of mine. The assignments (of which there are actually quite a few) can be somewhat rewarding if you put some time into them. Or so I've heard.",
    "Yes! I would encourage any student to take this course who is interested in the K-12 American Education system. Although the class is very engaging, students must be dedicated to the readings and assignments of this course.",
    "A very superficial overview of issues in education philosophy and policy. With the exception of the classroom observation, there was very little focus on education practice (understandably in an intro course). About a third of the way through the course, there was an undercurrent about issues being too complex and politically charged for us to really understand, and that was frustrating.",
    "I think this is an important course to take for anyone interested in the field of education. And I think everyone should be interested in the field of education. There's so much at stake.",
    "This class is amazing, and I really enjoyed it. I am very interested in Education Studies so my interest in this course came naturally, but I still believe anyone would enjoy the class. The Professor is very helpful and engaging, and if you are ever unclear of what she wants from you in an essay, she offers plenty of opportunities to come and meet with her. I found her office hours to be very helpful and I feel I was able to develop a personal relationship with her, which is always nice to have with a professor. I learned a lot in this class and I am so glad I took it.",
    "Good overview of the American education system and an analysis of some of its problems. The class is focused on policy.",
    "An introductory class to the studies of American education.",
    "This course is exactly as advertised. If you already have a strong knowledge-base in the subjects you may find it slow or not engaging enough, but if you are interested but ignorant (as I was) this is vital vital stuff to know and Professor Carroll synthesizes and summarizes well.",
    "A good class for those who want a foundation before taking more advanced education-related classes, or for those who would like to apply to the Education Scholars program. The workload is very reasonable. You can get as much out of this class as you put in--how much of the reading you do (it's easy to get away with doing very little) and how often you attend the optional discussion section can really impact your experience. Lectures can be engaging, although sometimes the information can be too vague or seem pretty obvious. Prof. Carroll is very knowledgeable about education policy and related topics, and is always happy to answer questions. She makes a great effort to get to know students.",
    "It's a survey courseso by nature there will be some topics that interest you more than others, course material covering everything from SEL, to teacher's unions, to the accountability movement. The class doesn't go too far in depth for any of the topics, so it's up to you to delve in deeper. Lizzy Carroll is warm and approachable, although occasionally a sluggish lecturer. Her passion and knowledge of education matters is great though. Our class was roughly 40 students, but she still made an effort to know everyone's name. A good way to get to know her better is by going to the discussion section (which for our class was optional).",
    "No.",
    "I definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in Education Studies. It is a good overview of the American education system. The class consists of readings and reading responses (which you have to do for about half of the readings), four written assignments--three short ones and one research paper. The big strengths of the class are the research paper, which can be on any topic, and the guest speakers. The last few weeks of class were devoted to guest speakers who are involved in many aspects of education in New Haven. The class is not too difficult and is very interesting.",
    "This is a semester long exploration and discussion of education related issues. It is fast paced and gives you space to form or sharpen a dynamic opinion. A must take if at all interested in education as a profession, research topic, or policy issue."
