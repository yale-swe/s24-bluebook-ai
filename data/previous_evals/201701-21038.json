   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the semiotics of gender portrayals and image composition. I also learned how to design my own content analysis and work with psychological parameters.",
    "Content analysis skills, critical thinking, and situational awareness",
    "I learned a lot about gender theory and how pervasive gendered images are in our society. I also learned a lot about how analysis of these sorts of phenomena are undertaken, and how we can talk about them in precise and scientific ways",
    "This course helped me hone my critical thinking skills and enabled me to better engage with source material. Taking PSYC 414 has also helped me approach material from many viewpoints and challenge my own assumptions.",
    "In this class we learned how to talk about gender images in things like advertisements or television. It was also valuable to learn how to conduct and complete a content analysis, which was part of our final project."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic course, but a little bit more guidance on statistical measures for the final paper would be helpful.",
    "The material is redundant for anyone who is a psych major\/has taken research methods. Even for those who have not taken psych or research methods classes, the material is intuitive and not challenging.",
    "Strengths: The class provided scientific support, research, and context for gendered situations that may seem to be a one-off phenomenon. Weaknesses: The class discussions would go off into tangents. It would be helpful to lead students back to the text or source materials to engage in scholarship rather than anecdotal experiences that do not tie back to the class text or topic for the day. Learning objectives may help frame the main takeaways from the course.",
    "Professor LaFrance is a very dedicated professor, and she encourages all students to engage with the coursework. We had varied and interesting readings, and our class discussions were thought-provoking. I would recommend that the course delve more into data analysis regarding the final project, and that final project assignments begin even earlier in the semester, to fully give students the opportunity to delve into their chosen topic.",
    "This class provided a valuable outlet to talk about gender issues from a psychological perspective, which is something that often gets overlooked. However, it was also difficult to cover everything that I would have wanted to. We were not about to discuss some of the readings that I found most compelling."

   "comments": [
    "This is a really cool class to take. Discussions are always very spirited and everyone is respectful of others' ideas. The work is tough but very rewarding.",
    "No. Professor LaFrance was aggressive and stubborn with regard to subject matter. Moreover, the material was intuitive and could be learned without taking this class. I would not recommend this class.",
    "Yes, if there is interest in psychology and gender issues.",
    "I enjoyed this course and learned a lot, however the final paper is a huge challenge for anyone who does not have experience in organizing and evaluating a psychological study. I didn't know how to undertake any of the statistical analysis, or do silly things like formatting, and a lot of those answers I had to get on my own.",
    "Definitely take PSYC 414 with Professor LaFrance! She is a wonderful teacher, and the material is intellectually stimulating.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in talking about gender and psychology. This class does focus more on media, however, so if you're looking for a psych class about gender, this is a little different. Participation in the seminar is very important and the professor does not often lead class discussion, so you need to come prepared."
