    "Yes definitely! Even if you don't have an interest in the topic, or have any idea what the topic even is, you should shop this course because you will probably take it after sitting in for the first class",
    "Prof. Alexander is great. Interesting, engaging, and important material.",
    "This course was an interesting overview of aesthetics and iconology in today's society. The first half provided a theoretical (i.e., philosophical) basis on which we could base our discussions in the second half, which involved specific applications like advertising and architecture. I didn't like how the bulk of the work was due during reading week and finals week, but it did make for an easier semester as a whole (reading was roughly 100 pages per week). Although I don't have a lot of seminar experience, this course has definitely been my best one so far--the professor was very encouraging of discussion without dominating it. I'd recommend it.",
    "I wrote my final paper about the iconicity of Gatorade and Michael Jordan. Enough said.",
    "Pretty good class. It can be fun to read about topics like cigarettes and celebrities in an academic class. I found some of the theory to be dry, but other things are quite interesting. You spend a lot of time discussing the relationship between surface and depth meanings, which can get old, but in general I thought it wasn't too bad. There's not too much work and you can do a fun topic for the final paper, which is nice."
