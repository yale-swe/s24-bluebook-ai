    "i would recommend itOk look it is not a pure gut but it is also not too hard. As much as you might think oh my god i don't want to learn about bugs the teacher is so enthusiastic and the stuff you actually learn is amazing. I went into the class not expecting much and it turned out to be so cool. It is 2 test a final and one 15 page paper. don't worry about the paper though it is on whatever you want and the teacher is chill.Teacher is great, material is fun especially the many mini videos she shows in class. I would recommend this class",
    "This is one of the most wonderful classes at Yale, especially when paired with lab. Though the lectures are a bit disorganized, Marta could not be a more wonderful, engaging, knowledgeable professor. She shares visual, audio and anecdotal evidence of the arthropodal marvels that surround and support us--this class was pure joy.",
    "This class is awesome. Marta is the most passionate professor ever, and her lectures are so interesting that you'll want to come to class. Definitely take the lab at the same time because you'll get so much more out of the class.",
    "I would say take this class because you learn a lot about bugs, but more importantly you can take the lab which is AWESOME!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. If you're remotely interested in arthropods-- particularly insects, but spidersl and other non-insect arthropods as well--take the course. It's a general overview of the biology of these organisms, from reproduction and physiology to behavior and social systems. It's really an enjoyable class. There are a lot of planet-earth style videos that get woven into the lecture. So don't expect just a powerpoint and straight lecture; it really breaks up any potential monotony.",
    "This class is pretty awesome. Marta's great, and the videos of bugs are great. The lectures are passionate- though sometimes can feel a little dry (due to subject matter). But it's really nice, now, to know so much about bugs. If you're not in the lab, it can feel a bit alienating, because most of the class was in the lab - so there were a lot of inside jokes and stuff that I felt weird about. Plus the lab has a first-hand experience advantage with all the material. It can feel pretty abstract without real contact with the organisms. But either way, still a great class. This was my second science-credit, and I'm glad it was!",
    "If you have the slightest interest in bugs, take this class. You will learn something amazing every class. Your friends may be bothered by your insistence on telling bug stories at the dinner table, but it's completely worth it. Marta is wonderful.If you come to lectures (which you should) and do some studying it's also a perfectly reasonable Cr\/D if you want to get some sweet arthropod knowledge without screwing with your grades.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student provided that they aren't scared of bugs (because if they are, it might be a miserable class). You have to really want to learn about arthropods because you go very into depth into how they function. I loved the lectures and Marta is the most amazing professor. She is incredibly nice and funny and really cares about the subject. I would recommend that you take the lab with the lecture if you have the time because it makes the material easier to understand and also makes it seem more relevant as you get a veryhands-on experience. Together the lab and the lecture are my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale.",
    "A straightforward lecture about arthropods, covering interesting material in powerpoint format. Take it with the lab, though, for an amazing, memorable experience!!!!!",
    "I really really loved this class! The subject matter is fascinating, so there isn't much that could go wrong. Bugs are so cool. The TAs were nice, Marta was the BOMB and super enthusiastic about everything she taught. I was never bored, and for those who get drowsy at powerpoints, there are awesome videos sprinkled in every few slides. She even let my friend and me (neither of us are taking the lab) go on one of the lab trips to the Yale forest. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale so far.",
    "Super great, fascinating class! Marta talks about the most interesting things at a good pace."
