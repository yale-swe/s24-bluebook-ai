    "These poems are incredibly bad. So, so bad. Victorian Poetry is this strange era in English Literature when it feels like everyone got drunk off god knows what and thought that venting their saccharine feelings about the world would be the best way to connect with it, when in fact it all came off as disgusting. I had no idea what I was getting into. Read anything at all by Robert Browning and ask yourself if you are even remotely prepared to tolerate what is about to go down.",
    "Maybe. The poetry is just so difficult. It was sometimes hard for me to understand and enjoy it. That being said, you read some important work. Good for English majors.",
    "Yes, take this course. Especially if you have already taken Romantic Poetry. It's a really good follow up. As you can tell from many years of course evaluations, Prof Brisman is one of the best you'll have the opportunity to have at Yale. He leads a great discussion (he tells good stories) and is extremely kind. He is also very helpful with essays.",
    "Take this class! Brisman is the best English Professor at Yale.",
    "Terrific course. Lots of great poems, really interesting poets, all under the guidance of a caring, brilliant professor."
