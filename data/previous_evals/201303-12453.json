   "comments": [
    "Course provides a broad introduction to the field of organic synthesis. Recommended for anyone planning to study reactions that deliver regio- or stereospecific outcomes, but the tools of analysis a student gains fromthe course would be useful for any research involving organic chemistry.",
    "Yes, this was overall a great course and I learned a lot in it. Students should be prepared to do most of the learning on their own, reading from the Harvard notes, etc. But I did learn a great deal in this course.",
    "The topic is a must-read but this course is not that worth-while taking because reading all the three sets of notes on your own will make little difference.",
    "The course would only be recommended for graduate students and not undergraduate students. Undergraduate students would have difficulty keeping pace with the material.",
    "This class is essentially just a summary of physical organic\/synthetic methods lectures notes that can be found online (mostly from Harvard). You will be expected to learn the material on your own from these online resources. The class is set up in a competitive manner and is very stressful. Not one of the better grad classes offered.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to next year students.",
    "The next year I think it will get much better. I'd recommend it (especially if the student has a decent background in the material).",
    "If you are able to devote about double the time of most classes to this class every week, you will be forced to learn an extraordinary amount from the class in order to keep up.",
    "Absolutely, one of the best chemistry classes I have ever taken."

   "comments": [
    "Sink or swim course. If you don't learn the material on your own you won't do well.",
    "Extensively contributed, I learned the most of all my courses in this class this semester. I enjoyed the topics and we learned an extensive amount of synthetic techniques and physical organic properties.",
    "The course gave me knowledge in organic synthesis that enhanced my interest in synthetic chemistry. It will be useful for my research.",
    "This course definitely deepen my knowledge. It would make a great contribution to my future research.",
    "Gives a sunthetic chemist all the tools necessary to learn lots of chemistry throughout the course of a PhD."
