   "comments": [
    "strength: professor makuch. he has so much experience\/knowledge\/stories and is very personable-- loved that he took out our entire class for beer and pizza at bar to get to know us better! Content is also fabulous-- variety of statistics, policy, etc. Wish there was a part II cons: slides... hard to follow on some of the bigger lectures, often times would have x2 the number even possible to go through during class!",
    "Epi prerequisite required. Hard to understand for first year students.",
    "I enjoyed this course, though I did get bored at times. I never felt too stressed about it because the course is designed in a way so as to not require insane memorization or doing a bunch of calculations without resources (more in line with real life). Learning about the different kinds of clinical trials was interesting, and the lecture slides were organized and easy to follow. I do think it was sometimes difficult to follow along in class, since the professor often went on long tangents, but even the tangents were usually interesting. And I think having this class be two hours long in one sitting is excessive, so I had trouble focusing (especially with no break).",
    "Very reliant on textbook and slides - didn't really actually learn anything I can take with me, as it was all search-and-find.",
    "While Clinical trials is an important course, it is mostly review from Epi 2 and Biostats 2. Dr. Makuch has a ton of experience and tells great stories, but reads his slides. I find lecture to be hard to get through.",
    "It's very poorly organized, but is on an interesting topic.",
    "The course was overall kind of dry, especially the content towards the end of the course. I enjoyed the math-based parts of the material, but the concepts were too boring to read.",
    "Class was all right. The material is not especially interesting and some of the principles and methods Makuch refers to seem a bit dated. The course could have been structured better. The beginning was very qualitative and then it was just math. At the end it became qualitative again. I also did not like the exam format. There were so few number of questions on the exam and no partial credit was awarded. I also did not like how the class would only held once a week. It was often disorganized in terms of powerpoint formatting.",
    "The course material was interesting, but the lectures got mixed up during the semester and the material was sometimes difficult to follow. The exams did not always reflect main lecture topics well.",
    "poorly organized. slides\/lectures poor",
    "I found this class largely ineffective. A significant portion of the class was spent reviewing material from introductory epidemiology and biostatistics classes. When we finally moved beyond that review, the new information was poorly delivered. Between the copied slides and repetitive information between the different lectures and the frequent repetition of lecture information, it felt like little new information was given class to class. Additionally, it seemed like at least 20 minutes of each class was wasted due to lateness, technological errors, and general rambling. I understand the frustration behind the technological problems, but if you encounter them class after class, it might be wise to try and get there early to fix them.",
    "Strengths: provide an overview of topics in clinical trials, broad scope Weaknesses: lack details of specific topics",
    "Strengths: you will really learn from a true expert in the field. Exams are open laptop which is so nice. Weaknesses: Disorganized; little informations on what the exams will be like",
    "Dealt with lots of information but the exam was only focused on mathematical calculation.",
    "A lot more analysis than I expected. The course could be more interactive. Could have gone over previous week's HW at the beginning of each lass.",
    "Honestly speaking, I didn't learn much from this course. Most of the contents have already been covered by Epi I, Epi II and Biostats II. The course design is not what I expected. The course only covered a little bit about how to design a clinical trial in different settings and situations, which I think should be more practical rather than only teaching about how to calculate sample size.",
    "Course needs to be more organized; exam material did not proportionally reflect material covered in lecture. Increased time teaching quantitative aspects rather than qualitative aspects of the course would be helpful in the interest of leaving this course with increased skills.",
    "I felt the low pressure approach to the material was conducive to facilitating understanding. I liked that homework was ungraded as it put more focus on engaging with the material rather than just trying to find the right answer. My only suggestion would be to include more real world examples in the lecture to help break up the monotony of straightforward facts and encourage students to think about the applications of the information we are presented with.",
    "The is a very informative course introducing me to the field of health issues. Even though I lack the background knowledge, I could still grasp the main points and basic computing methods we are expected to handle. Contents involved in this course are more than adequate. The course would be even better if primary and important methods are highlighted.",
    "- Too much weight on two exams -Professor is very difficult to reach outside of class -Course material is interesting and I see how it is pertinent to the study of regulatory affairs, but it should be more explicit from the beginning that biostatistics will be more important in the latter portion of the class.",
    "This course was a good overview of Clinical Trials; however, the organization of the course and how it related to the readings and homework could be improved. The math in the homework did not always correspond to the examples in the lectures, or the timing of the assignments was such that we received problems that we were taught how to do two lectures in the future. As such, I found myself looking up lectures from similar classes at other universities to find out how to do the homework. Also, in general, the book was not very helpful--and I did all of the readings. Its approach is not very straight-forward or well-organized. I really enjoyed the lectures and learned quite a bit, they just didn't always match up with the readings or homework. With that being said, grading was very generous\/reasonable, so I suppose I can't complain.",
    "The instructor mainly focused in his own experience in the knowledge world of clinical trial, but ignored the basics of the course. I wish he could be more specific on the basic concepts and have a better arrangement of the slides.",
    "Strengths of this course are the instructor, Dr. Makuch has real world experience within regulatory and thus actual examples. The weaknesses of the course are the presentations, many in the second half of the course began with the same opening slide and it became difficult to distinguish which slide deck pertained to which topic, and what the overall learning objective of the slide deck and lecture was.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0It's might be my personal feelings but I really think that the teacher is not devoted enough. For at least three or four lectures he was late for like ten minutes. But the lectures were fine.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Great professor. Again, he has so much experience\/knowledge and went out of his way to get to know our class (since we are in winsolow with a lot of students, I thought it was great of him to get us out of the class and interact with him and each other for dinner!). He is very hard to track down outside of class\/doesnt respond to emails, but you can always catch him right after class so not a huge issue.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Humorous and smart guy, has a lot of experience to share.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I enjoyed the professor. He made an effort to get to know his students by hosting a get-together which was much appreciated. In class, he seemed knowledgeable and he told a lot of stories about working in the industry, which kept me engaged.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Nice, but not very accessible",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr, Makuch needs consistent slides. It seems as if he found the 12 best presentations he could find in a google search of the material and then reads them off to us in lecture. It is very clear that he is very experienced and knowledgeable, but has a hard time relaying the information in a lecture setting. He is also never on time, often showing up to lecture 10-15 minutes past the start time.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He has very interesting stories and clearly knows a lot about the topic, but the course is very poorly organized (topics are covered repeatedly in different lectures that are just slightly different from each other so that it's difficult to find information).",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Makuch is a great guy, but his teaching style is not attention-conducing.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is very knowledgable and kind, but he was not the best at presenting a lecture in class. I would've liked case studies or a project that made everthing in the class come together. Things felt very disjointed.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Friendly, personable, and available to answer any of your questions",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very knowledgeable and cares a lot about his students.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0be more organized",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch has a tremendous amount of experience within this industry on all sides, and was more than willing to share this information with us. Unfortunately, in communicating other information to us, he frequently directly read off of the slides, even if they were not completely coherent. While I appreciate the volume of information available on the lecture slides, I also wished that the information had been coherently taught, as opposed to given to us.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Clear and nice",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a riot! Very fair and extremely knowledgeable. I really enjoy his relaxed attitude and he is very fair in lectures, homeworks, and exams. He seems to cares about his students; our dinner at Bar was very generous and he was willing to give back points after a typo on the midterm. One suggestion would be to avoid saying in lectures things like \"read this on your own\";\"i won't really go into this in depth\"...being more clear on exactly what slides he will review would be helpful so we're not swimming through 60-80 slides per lecture. Though I do appreciate having the supplemental material, I would appreciate him being clear on what he plans to review.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Hilarious. Entertaining.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr.Makuch is passionate and thrilled when explaining the topics related to course. I believe lots of students were highly motivated by his lecture.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Clearly very knowledgable about the field and very passionate!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I barely know Dr. Makuch's expectations on us.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I really like Professor Makuch's approach to teaching this class. He is approachable and very informative about the course topic. I also appreciated the party he threw for the class mid-semester.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch taught in an appealing way. He was patient with questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He is a great instructor. He is able to describe the concepts well and give great real world examples.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very friendly but the course was taught a little haphazardly",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Enthusiastic, well versed in the topic, great anecdotes, passionate about trials and teaching. When asked questions, provided very good, complete answers.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a great instructor with real life experience within the FDA. That he runs the regulatory affairs track and teaches many of the courses himself, coupled with the availability of this track to students from any disciplines, is a real asset to Yale, it's students, and future regulators.",

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "Worth it for Makuch's stories and a more interdisciplinary look at clinical trials. You will likely get more stats elsewhere (or already come in with most of the knowledge if you are a second year), but the best part of the course is how it blends together the concepts with policy\/regulatory affairs (aka that it is more interdisciplinary and applications based)",
    "Take it at the second year if you have no knowledge about public health.",
    "You learn what makes up clinical trials and different tests that are conducted for different types of trials. I would suggest taking it because it is pretty fundamental to public health, and is also a relatively stress free class.",
    "Only take if you have to",
    "I think it could use some work on the fringes. The textbook is a waste of money in my opinion. The slides need work. I like the homework, they are challenging but manageable and the grading scheme fits the course well.",
    "A class on an interesting topic that could be improved greatly if it was better organized. Evaluations and homework are very straightforward.",
    "I would generally not recommend this course unless you really need to learn more about clinical trials. Even so, you could read this material out of a textbook rather than take an entire course on it.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class to another student unless they plan on working in clinical trials.",
    "subject matter is interesting but course poorly run.",
    "If you had taken a second semester of Epidemiology or Biostats, it is likely a waste to take this course, as much of the same information is repeated here. If you have not taken either of those, this class will be a deluge of confusing information, since it is not effectively taught. If you want to go into clinical trial management or regulation for your career path, this class is perfect for you.",
    "Recommend it.",
    "This course is perfect for students who want to continue learning about methods and biostatistics without having to take the daunting Categorical or Linear analysis. Its a great review of material with the perfect amount of new info. Its also a great resume booster for anyone interested in working in clinical trials--we definitely don't get enough info in the intro courses.",
    "Great class if you are interested in working in industry after graduate school",
    "As it stands, this course is an introduction to students who are interested in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials. I would recommend the course for those interested, but would suggest students have some prior statistics background.",
    "If you don't plan to enroll in the regulatory affairs track, just don;t take this course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Needs improvement in organization.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Despite being one of the least strenuous courses I took this semester and perhaps not being the most thrilling topic, I still feel as though I learned a lot of useful information.",
    "Good course that gives a solid background to how clinical trials are performed and their basis.",
    "over all satisfactory",
    "This course is good for providing an overview\/introduction to clinical trials; however, it is only an introduction. You do not acquire any particular skill set, and it simply prepares you for further courses on the subject or to be a better informed consumer\/participant in clinical trials.",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student, unless the student did not take the Biostats 2 class, and this course would be a good substitution.",
    "This class is really valuable, I would recommend the course, especially for those interested in learning the basics of clinical trial design. We learned that it's not a straightforward process, and that the situation changes depending upon the drug, indication, and type of trial. This information is invaluable in the face of developing new and novel drugs and identifying disease targets. Thanks for offering it and I hope it continues to be a component of the curriculum.",
