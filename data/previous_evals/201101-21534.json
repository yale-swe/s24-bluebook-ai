   "comments": [
    "Pretty much a fast-paced version of BC Calc.",
    "If you can take it with Tryniecki, I highly recommend this course. He's a very clear teacher, and the material is not too challenging.",
    "I would not recommend Math 115 unless it's a requirement or you love math.",
    "Good, solid intro math class.",
    "It is a hard, but usually necessary evil. I would not take it if it is not some sort of prereq or requirement for a major. The first half is deceptively easy, but after the first midterm it gets much harder. Be prepared for exam questions that are much harder than your homework problems and that integrate complicated computations with new and difficult concepts. If you can, get into MICHAL TRYNIECKI's section. He is the best. I shopped a lot of sections, and without him, I do not think I would have understood a single thing!",
    "Calc 2. If you took BC, go straight to 120.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. Most people will be taking this class because they are required to, but it was fantastic! The tests were all extremely fair and the work was completely manageable (one problem set per week). Make sure to get into the section with MICHAL. He is hands down the best teacher in the whole math department.",
    "It all depends. If a fellow student wanted to pursue a mathematic or math related path at Yale, I would urge him to take this class because it is a package I believe one should have before engaging in any more complicated mathematics. If it is a fellow student who just enjoys mathematics and wants to take it for fun, I would probably tell him it is not the most fun mathematics he could take.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who want to learn about calculus.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is a fairly well taught calculus course and covers all the essentials.",
    "Definitely take it, not too challenging a course, and if you need it to fulfil a requirement it really isn't that bad. It is better than 112",
    "NO. If you do not have to take this course, don't take it. It is poorly designed and will just ruin your semester. If you have to take this course good luck.",
    "Take this class if you need to fulfill a requirement or take it as a prerequisite. I think there might be easier ways to fulfill the QR requirement, though, so I would not recommend taking it for that reason. It is a comprehensive and standard overview of the second semester of calculus. It is very much what you would expect out of an introductory course.",
    "If you can get into Michal's section, take it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone if they had to take it. I would never recommend to fill a distribution requirement. Everyone in the class takes it because they have to, and we really suffered through it.",
    "It's a basic intermediate level calculus course. Take it if you like maths or if you need it for a requirement. I personally enjoyed it but I know calculus is a love\/hate relationship.",
    "Math 115 is a great introduction to integral calculus, but you MUST plan ahead, look at instructor evaluations and wake up early on the day when you pick your section, because which instructor you get is absolutely essential to your experience with this class. Unless you already know all the material perfectly or are great at teaching yourself, your grade will probably be affected negatively if you end up with one of the instructors that is not good at teaching. If you do get a good instructor, you wll enjoy the class.",
    "Standard Calculus 2 course. Fast-paced, but manageable.",
    "Know this going in: the tests are hard. Speaking as someone who did well on their first midterm and got rocked on the second one and final, I can say that the difficulty of the exams ramps up severely, especially at the end. While the prospect of having your final grade count for your semester grade may seem redeeming, don't go in with that expectation if you can't handle some disappointment.Despite all the gloomy grade things, I really enjoyed actually going to class. Michal is a fantastic teacher (don't be put off by the Polish name, his English is fine except for the occasional misused word, but that's more funny than disorienting). He moves at a fast clip, but is always willing to go back to look at something with you or invite you to do the problem with him at office hours. Also, he doesn't coddle you with easy problems only to surprise you later, he picks tough homework problems and hard quiz problems to get you ready, which is really appreciated in retrospect. So get Michal!",
    "Math 115 is a good course that i recommend to everyone who places out of 112. It is fundamental to know basic math."
