    "It is required but I actually found myself excited to go to class. I think in my recommendation to students, my advice would be that, especially for this course, you're only going to reap what you sow. I think ethics in science is interesting and important and I found that the course was engaging. But attitude is important.",
    "The course provides a good foundation of what we need to know as graduate students and future scientists. I would recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "The first two or three were helpful discussions about lab culture, publications, and similar worries that we'll actually encounter in lab. The others--not so much.",
    "I think this class was almost an advice class rather than a knowledge class - we were told what was absolutely not allowed, and then given some guidance and wisdom to apply to our research. I liked the class a lot more than I thought I would.",
    "we dealt with several dilemma situation, which i think helped deepened my understanding of what is supposed to be done under such situations.",
    "I broadened my understanding of conducting an honest research career and how to best prevent bad experiences.",
    "It aided in knowledge of the practice of science, generally, because I was able to discuss the expectations I have when I encounter ethically untenable situations in the lab and in my life as a science (which I hope is long). I don't think that there are many open forums to discuss such a broad range of ethical issues in science, and I found it to be very instructive because of the format.",
    "The course provided me knowledge of the science profession that isn't typically learned in a classroom, and yet is critical to know as a graduate student and scientist."
