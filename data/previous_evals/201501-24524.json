    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students. If you want to get an in-depth summary of slavery, this is the class.",
    "This is a great course that traces slavery from Aristotle's idea of natural slavery to slavery in Judaism and Christianity to slavery in America. The readings were great and I came out of the class with a better understanding of the topic. It has been one of my favorite seminars. Definitely take it! Also Professor Fraistat is fabulous.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone who has an interest at all in slavery and the political thought around it.",
    "Absolutely reccomend - interestingness subject"
