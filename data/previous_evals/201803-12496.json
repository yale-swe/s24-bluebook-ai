    "I learned how to formulate a research question, how to write a research prospectus that other people understand, and what is necessary in the upcoming future to complete my senior thesis.",
    "I learned about the importance of clarifying and defining terms early on in the paper.",
    "- Research methods - Writing intensive",
    "Understanding of quantitative and qualitative methods, how to develop a research question, how to conduct research, different methods, how to give good feedback to others.",
    "I learned how to tackle my thesis methodically and refine it over several iterations. I also learned how to be a constructive editor and discussion leader.",
    "This course was super helpful! It exposed me to a lot of methods and disciplinary considerations within political science as a discipline, and provided me with a lot of helpful feedback on my preliminary thesis work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is strong because it sets hard deadlines for thesis materials. This helped me ensure that I did not fully fall behind on my thesis work. At the same time, however, this course moved very quickly. At times, it felt like I had to rush my research process to produce what was asked of me for proposal presentations. Here, I was unsure if I was behind or this seminar was pushing me to move at too quick of a pace. For me, this was particularly difficult because I needed to take my time, rather than be rushed, to make sure that I was doing what I needed with my project at the right times.",
    "It was helpful to meet weekly to develop a work schedule. There could be less summary submissions and more introduction and chapter development. An entire class on document formatting would be good, guest speakers discussing their thesis writing experiences would be helpful. More on-line peer editing would encourage deeper engagement by all students with each-others work and could help develop peer-editing skills",
    "Strengths: - Great to have my work looked at, critiqued - Valuable input from other students Weaknesses: - Could have been assigned more work that was specifically relevant to what I was doing",
    "More focus on our own projects and developing them - a lot of time is spent doing proposals, which are helpful, but not great for my advisor.",
    "Strengths: Professor Fangs research acumen and wisdom, hands down. He provided the guidance and structure to my semester that I desperately needed. The course is also valuable in that its set-aside time where were forced to begin writing, which is useful to work out kinks in your ideas before its too late. Weaknesses: I think its safe to say that every colloquium participant, myself included, didnt come to class prepared to offer feedback at least once or twice during the semester. This is understandable. At the same time, it doesn't feel equitable when some people give consistently good feedback to other people but receive half-baked comments on their own work. Im not sure how to build more accountability into the course other than a highly weighted participation grade, though. Even then, Im not sure how much of a difference it would make.",
    "The strengths of this course were that 1) it encouraged us to be more proactive in working on our projects 2) it gave me feedback that got me to revise my research questions and approach and 3) professor Fang did an excellent job at pointing us towards the right resources. The weaknesses were that people rarely submitted material on time so it was hard to offer them feedback, and there was generally a low level of preparation on the part of students."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! You need this class to do a year-long thesis in political science.",
    "I recommend writing a year-long thesis and classes such as this one encourage you to continuously work on your paper, which is essential.",
    "Yes! The personalized help is great, and this paper is a real challenge. Other people would do year-long theses if they realized that there would be this much guidance.",
    "I highly recommend doing the yearlong thesis because in reality it takes one semester to figure out what exactly you want to write about and one ore more semesters to actually carry out the project. Taking the fall senior colloquium will give you the time to narrow and refine your topic so that by the beginning of spring semester you have a clear, focused project idea a roadmap to execute it in a timely manner. Also, Professor Fang is an invaluable research mentor who invests so much time and thought into our projects. I hope future PLSC 490 students have the honor of taking this course with him.",
    "Yes. I think this is a valuable way of guiding students through the year-long thesis process that the department should continue to offer."
