    "Very interesting course. I was very happy to be able to take it before Professor Sattler goes on sabbatical. We were able to look at a lot of splendid old texts with a very specific goal, so I definitely got a lot out of the course.",
    "Ancient Notions of Time was only sort of a philosophy class. Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine offered arguments about time but many of the other texts required a historical or even literary approach. The class was structured with each student introducing one of the readings with a 30 minute presentation. I did not find this an especially productive or efficient way to approach the readings, but that may be a personal preference. Despite these structural weaknesses, the readings were all fascinating and Professor Sattler is truly an expert in the field."
