    "I recommend this class if you like learning languages with fun teachers.",
    "A natural continuation of L1\/L2. You can't not take this class - it would be a waste to stop at the L2 level. For people taking this as their first Yale Japanese class, be glad you get to have Seto Sensei, he's the man!",
    "This is a great class--the teachers are great! They're funny and helpful, and are truly interested in making sure that their students understand what they're teaching. Sure, Japanese is a difficult language, and you'll have to do a lot of homework and studying, but you'll never find that it's a waste of your time. Be warned though--if you're taking some pretty difficult and time consuming classes already, you may find adding Japanese to your course schedule a bit much. For me, it was an average of about 2 hours worth of homework per night, in addition to studying for tests and quizzes. If you stick it out though, believe me, it'll be worth it.",
    "The 10,30am section is a very lively class, and the students participate actively in the language drills and discussions. It was a great pleasure to work consistently with my fellow classmates on projects.I strongly recommend Japanese 130 02 to another student.",
    "Yes! Japanese 130 was my favorite class this semester, and even though there's homework every day, it felt like the least burdensome homework I had. Maruyama-sensei and Seto-sensei are both wonderful and engaging, and the small class size makes it easy to ask questions and get to know your classmates.",
    "Yes, if you wish to continue learning Japanese, there is no better way."
