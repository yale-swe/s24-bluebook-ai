    "Boot Camp Biology is a good class to take for students with a weak background in biology, if they are interested in developing a foundation. I would recommend the class, because I found it to be a clear and useful introduction to biology.",
    "A seminar-like course that attempts to allow students to have a basic grasp of biology. Covers many important topics, but its still not enough due to the vast amount of materials in biology. Yes. Good to at least build the basis (\/ have an intuition) for understanding biology .",
    "I would recommend to other students since it's really a good start to know more about biology."
