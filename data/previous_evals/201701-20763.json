    "This course opened my eyes to the fact that Rome, as a the city, a culture, and an idea, is present in everything around us. It taught me how to view the world from this humanities point of view. Furthermore, it also taught me how to conceptually analyze texts in tandem with other mediums such as architecture, film, paintings, art, etc.",
    "This class offered a chance to dissect the readings by delving into their content, context and significance, as well as to form our own history of Rome by threading together the multi-authored narrative. It was a great way to see how ideas change , or don't, over time."

    "There is so much material to cover in so little time. And sometimes, we ended up having to skip things in order to cover the most ground possible. But Professor Jewiss was extremely open to adjusting the syllabus when it was needed. Additionally, the material I learned from this course is applicable in a myriad of subjects and situations.",
    "Strengths--I imagine the summer component where students actually visit Rome is one of the best assets of this course, though the seminar stands alone too by leading a reading through many great and significant works of the western canon. The art history component was great and unexpected. Weaknesses--It would be great if there were more guided interactive components to the class during the school year to get students ready for the summer in Rome and to offer other students a taste of reading a place. There were assignments that encouraged us to do this, but it would have been nice to do this as a class, either taking a walking tour of campus or visit the art gallery or the Beinecke together during class time. Maybe students could have presented their findings from around campus and then heard feedback or other ideas from other students and the teacher to gain a fuller appreciation. Also, a visit to the Beinecke could have enhanced the medieval unit of the course, when we read The Divine Comedy. The teacher did say she would try to set up a visit to the print room at the YUAG, and maybe the scheduling just didn't work out this year, but I hope future classes are able to do \"field trips\" like this."

    "TAKE THIS COURSE IF IT IS THE ONLY THING YOU DO AS A YALE STUDENT. Let me just say that this course is fantastic. We go over 2,000 years of history of just one city. And even though it is only focused around this sole city, there is so much content to cover. Livy's The Rise of Rome, Virgil's The Aeneid, excerpts from Dante's Divine Comedy, are just some of the great work's that we read and analyzed. But we also supplemented this material in a multidisciplinary Humanities way through paintings, statues, films, etc. You leave this course seeing the world around you in a new way: Rome as a city, as a culture, and as an idea has especially influenced America among others. And the insight that Professor Jewiss brings to the course is absolutely invaluable, you cannot find a better expert in this field. You will not be the same person once having completed this course. I tell everyone I meet to take this course because not only was it the best course I have taken at Yale, but it is also completely life-changing. And even after the course is finished, you have the amazing opportunity to study abroad in Rome. Absolutely loved this course, cannot give it enough praise, and never regretted taking it. Even if you are a STEM major looking to dip your toes into the world of Humanities, take this course. If you are an experienced Humanities major who is just looking for another class, take this course. If you are a living and breath human being, TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "City of Rome is an absolutely incredible course - a true necessity for anyone interested in statecraft, government, culture, art, architecture or theology. Professor Jewiss is a brilliant scholar and a great lecturer, appealing to people of all academic backgrounds. The readings are all extremely interesting and VERY RELEVANT - learning about Rome has provided clarity and context in such a tumultuous period of American history. Would definitely recommend!!",
    "I would recommend this course to students who were unable to do the Directed Studies program, but have an interest in the coursework. I would also recommend this course to students who are able to do the summer in Rome program, because it seems like that is a great and unique bonus to this class. I would also recommend this course to students who are interested in history, but who would rather learn about history from a literary standpoint, not that all the readings were literature.",
    "I would recommend this course because Professor Jewiss is incredibly dynamic and energetic and knowledgeable. She will answer your questions in more than one way. The texts are fascinating. The accompanying PowerPoint provides a striking visual. Creative assignments that encouraged synthesis of ideas. Loved!"
