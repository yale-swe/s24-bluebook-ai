   "comments": [
    "The class is an introduction to studies of the peasantry. It's presented in a novel and interesting manner, and while some of the readings are dry, most are enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "If you have any interest in Agrarian societies or agricultural cultures, take this class. It is a lot of work, but well worth it. You will read a lot of great books on a variety of subjects and regions and get to discuss them with some of the most talented professors in academia.",
    "Great. Brilliant teachers, amazing subject matter, and compelling literature (sorry for the enthusiasm but I'm into the whole peasant thing after this). If one is interested an excellent cross-disciplinary course that will challenge your preconceptions on Development, Agrarian history, the makeup of peasant society, resistance, and the state, take this class.",
    "It's a great course for anyone interested in agrarian, social or political issues, contemporary or historical.I'll take a lot of ideas away from this course.",
    "As someone unfamiliar with agrarian issues, I liked the diverse reading, which introduced me to a whole slew of interesting broad topics within agriculture. The lectures were a bit longish, but interesting."

   "comments": [
    "As an undegraduate having done field research abroad, the class clarified my research and played a huge role in crafting my senior essay. It was invaluable to my overall academic experience.",
    "This class will help me a lot, especially with regards to thinking about the nature of states and the relationship between agriculture and the formation of human societies and relations.",
    "It introduced me to a lot of topics in agriculture, but we didn't spend much time talking about methodology, or academic\/policy debates."
