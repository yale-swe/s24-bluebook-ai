    "If you have any interest in urbanism take the class. There are only three assignments and other than the formulaic paper,the other two are pretty fun.",
    "It's a pain to say awake for so long so early in the morning, but if you're interested in getting a taste for urban design, this is a very interesting class. The readings are very intense but you get a whole week to do them, and I really enjoyed the three projects we were assigned. Mostly taken by grad students.",
    "Yes. The lectures are interesting, section is short and productive and all the assignments are very open so you can choose a topic you are excited about."
