    "I took BC my junior year in highschool and hadn't remembered much. I'm not very good at math, so I struggled a bit with this course. The tutors weren't great and the teaching was mediocre. Tests were hard.",
    "This is a very difficult course. Be prepared to work.",
    "This course is taken by many people since it is a pre req for lots of majors and premeds so it can be competitive. The curve is better than you expect so dont hesitate.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you need it to fulfill a major\/ requirement. It is not an enjoyable course.",
    "don't take this class unless you have to, but you probably have to",
    "Math 115 is a pretty difficult class. It covers a lot of material, most of which seem to have no relevance to one another. But once you are finished with the course, you sure will feel accomplished."
