   "comments": [
    "I recommend it to anyone wanting to take a basic biology class. It is interesting and not too hard. Make sure you choose a good paper topic because you will be spending a lot of time on it.",
    "No if the class is going to be structured this way again. The expectations of reading the textbook, attending class 3 times a week and then watching online lectures is too much. The first midterm was also a disaster, way too long. Half of the grade is your paper grade though so if you're amazing at writing, this might be the way to get an A.",
    "EEB 122 is an intro to environmental bio. It covers the big topics, and doesn't really go that in depth but gives you a great general idea. I think it is a great class, I think Stearns is an excellent professor, and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "It was an okay class. It wasn't stressful at all, and not a lot of work (as long as you don't do the reading, which you absolutely don't need to do). The lectures are online on open Yale courses, which is all you need to know for the two midterms. There is a 15-20 page paper at the end of the semester, which you develop as the semester progresses, so it's really not that bad.",
    "This course is a survey of basic evolutionary principles, ecology, and animal behavior. If you don't have to take it don't waste your time--just watch it over the summer on OYC without the stress of ridiculously hard midterms.",
    "If you're interested in evolution and ecology, this is a great class. Just know that there basically three grades - 2 midterms and a research paper, which is half of your grade. It's good practice for writing research papers, though, and there's a lot of freedom to pick a topic that interests you.",
    "Very interesting material, but the workload is pretty demanding. Lectures are not great, so most people do not go. There are 2 hard tests, which require a lot of cramming (and catching up if you haven't gone to lectures\/done reading), and a painful 15-20 page paper.",
    "Exams are difficult but will be heavily curved. It will be up to you to figure out the balance of attending class, watching the online lectures and doing all of the course reading as well because it will be difficult to do all three. A huge portion of the class comes down to the essay which depends on how difficult your TA grades.",
    "If you like biology, take the class. It is really interesting and it's a writing credit!",
    "This is an intro biology\/ ecology course. Most of its themes were interesting, and I was surprised by how applicable they were. The class was a lot of work- there were only two midterms so it wasn't that demanding in terms of cramming time, but watching the lectures before attending lecture as well as doing the reading was too much. The paper was a good deal of work but not as overwhelming as 15 pages sound. As long as you pick a topic that you are interested in and that is reasonably complicated, you will be fine.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in the subject, because it is fascinating and well taught. However, be aware that you will NEED to study hard for the exams and do A LOT of work for the paper. But, it is definitely doable.",
    "Yes. This was a wonderful course and if you take it seriously, you will learn an incredible amount about both the subject material and the field. Writing the scientific paper was much harder than I thought it would be and very time consuming, but extremely rewarding. I've written many papers in college but I have never had to put so much work into organizing my thoughts or condensing my language, and I think that I became a much better writer in the process. The subject materialis wonderful and Professor Stearns is great, although I don't think he'll be teaching next year. My only warning is to make sure you take the class seriously. because the concepts are all deceptively simple and some people are definitely tempted to slack off. You may understand each point when it's presented, but if you don't work to make sure you understand the material fully, its assumptions, how to test it, what it implies, etc., you won't do well on the tests or get very much out of the course. Additionally, the paper really is a big assignment, so this is not a light course.",
    "NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO TOO MUCH WORK TOO MUCH WORKTHE TEACHER DOESNT CARE AT ALLTHE CONCEPTS ARE COMPLEX ISH BUT ARENT EXPLAINED WELLTHE TESTS ARE A BIT HARDIF YOURE GOOD AT BS ING THEN THIS CLASS WILL CHALLENGE YOUR SKILLS",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, and if you do, you're in for a relatively miserable experience. Grading on the paper depends on who you have for section. The tests I personally found hard but not impossible. Maybe people with a better science background than me would find it easier. Most people I know in this course are frustrated. The lecturer repeats the same info that's in the online lectures and in the readings, making lecture not worth attending. Still, in the end, you do learn the material, it just won't be remotely enjoyable in any sense.I took this course as an elective for the hell of it, and that's frankly the worst decision you could ever make. Ever. EVER.",
    "EEB 122 is a solid intro bio class. Watching the lectures is pleasant, the tests reward comprehension not memorization, and the paper is manageable and well planned out by the course structure. Its not a must-take but you'll enjoy the material if you do, as a requirement to fulfill its enjoyable and painless. It's an average amount of work, easy on the weekly basis, but ramps up a couple times for the papers and two midterms.This year the online lectures matched up with the in-person ones, so I could skip lecture and watch it at home later, which I highly recommend, the online lectures are quite good.",
    "only take it if you have to",
    "Well-structured and interesting course. I stopped showing up when Stearns started cold-calling, as did most of the class, but things instantly got better when he stopped that and started lecturing again. Not too much work but the paper was irritating.",
    "This class is great for anyone who's interested in biology. The reading load is a bit heavy, but the only assignments are the two midterms and the big final paper (which you have more than enough time to write). It does get a bit repetitive, though, as Professor Stearns asks you to read the book and the online lecture before coming to class (where he covers the same information).",
    "This was a great course. I learned a lot, but it was a lot of work. Put in the time for the course and it'll pay off.",
    "Not really, it won't add much to your knowledge of biology unless you want to be an EEB major. I had to take it because Yale had it as a nonsensical requirement when I majored in MCDB.",
    "This course is basically only recommended to people who need it to meet a requirement. The structure, due to the Yale Open Courses, was really terrible. We had to watch the lectures online then come to class and hear a totally new lecture that was different. It made the class like taking two classes. That being said, the class at least covered interesting material.",
    "I liked the course, but it's not easy ..",
    "Yes, I'd recommend the course. Taught me a totally new way to think and wasn't too hard.",
    "It's a necessary evil that won't exist anymore.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "Lecture 3x a week, two midterms, and a 20 page paper. The paper is worth 50% of the grade, so definitely put a lot of work into it. They try to keep you on schedule with outline and draft deadlines, but definitely start working on it as soon as possible. In the beginning of the semester we were expected not only to keep up with the readings but also to watch the lectures online, which was very difficult, but afterwards the online lectures were no longer mandatory. The midterms are intense, very long and all problem-solving type questions where you have to apply what you've learned to get the answer. They're not strictly memorization.",
    "E&EB 122 was great, but it won't be offered again.",
    "Yeah, I think it's a good basic foundation",
    "This class had two distinct parts: the lecture, which was just like any other introductory lecture course, and the section, which was like a writing seminar. I really enjoyed writing the final paper for this class, and it seemed doable because the process was drawn out over the entire course. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in biology, or who like writing about interesting sciencey things.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but that seems unimportant, since it won't be offered again. I guess I'll just recommend open courseware then.",
    "Frustrating. Felt too liberal art-sy for a science course...too free form for us to fall into a comfortable work-doing routing. The topic covered was laughably huge, which made it weird when we went into high focus on specific topics. Professor Stearns fatherly demeanor made it better, though.",
    "i'm a science major and i took it for a writing credit, thinking i wasn't going to learn anything. i was surprised. a lot of the material seems useless and irrelevant when you cover them in class or learn them for exams, but it will come up in your conversations and personal musings later unexpectedly, be sure of that! don't expect to get an easy A out of this class though, because the exams, while they are easy, are hard to do well on, and the papers were graded quite steeply.",
    "A great class if you are seriously interested in the material. Probably not as a requirement.",
    "NOT AN EASY COURSE AT ALL. But you learn A LOT and it's FASCINATING and definitely a challenge, so if you're ready to commit a lot of effort and angst, you should take it! The grades are really scary until the end and the curve kicks in. The midterms are ridiculously long and difficult. The research paper is a REAL commitment for the WHOLE semester--you CANNOT think of it as a reading period project, it's something you work pretty steadily on throughout the semester. But in the end, it felt like a course that I really engaged with and came out having learned a lot.",
    "Yes, a basic understanding of evolution is important for science majors.",
    "I wouldn't take this course again. However, I am probably in the minority, as I neither need thiscourse for my major nor am I interested in the material. Make SURE you care about this course. It's easy to get slipped up in not attending class or watching the lectures online. I didn't put much into this course, so I got little from it, unfortunately. The paper was not a learning experience for me. Others would benefit from taking this course to learn the interesting material and to take advantage of the paper writing process. If you don't make this course a priority, it's not worth taking.",
    "Doesn't matter because this course won't be offered again. Paper was definitely doable if you started early. But it's a great intro to EEB and Stephen Stearns is amazing, mostly because of his accessibility outside of class and the fact that he truly CARES about student concerns and whether studnets are doing well in the course. He even hcanged the course halfway through the semester to accomodate student concerns about learning material. Just terrific lecturer, definitely take another class with him if possible",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in gaining a broad understanding of fundamental ideas behind evolutionary theory and, to a lesser extent, ecology. If you are a capable writer, this is a great course.",
    "This class goes through a lot of information very quickly. I advise you expect to devote a good amount of time to it, and make friends that you can discuss the material with more in depth. Study groups throughout the semester and more time management for the class probably would have helped me considerably. Also not skipping lecture as much, which was so tempting on Friday afternoons to start the weekend early. If you do plan on doing that, MAKE SURE to catch up with the online lectures, they are also very helpful because you can pause them and go back to things being said in each lecture.",
    "I would take it if you want to learn all the reading by heart, and view and review every lecture, and guess what questions will be on the test... if you want to devote yourself entirely to this class. otherwise, too much is expected from you, and you will be punished.",
    "The subject matter is fascinating and no matter howWell you do grade-wise, you will leave with a great foundation for understanding a lot of big scientific issues of our time. That said, I wouldNot recommend this course unless you are planning to be a biology major, and I certainly wouldn't take it if you have a substantial workload in humanities classes.",
    "Don't take it.",
    "It's so much work, don't take it if you don't have to because the paper is a nightmare!!",
    "Ton of reading, ton of writing. Prof Stearns drills students, so you have to be on top of the material BEFORE you step into the classroom. Interesting material, similar to Sexy Psych."
