    "Chinese 153 was a lot harder than first semester, but is structured the same way. You get to talk about a lot of cool social science topics like government corruption, economic reform, and the environmental movement. Be prepared for a lot of work though (seriously, it's even more work than first semester). If you put in the effort, you'll learn a lot.",
    "Compared to the fall semester, Chinese 153 is definitely a lot harder with more new vocabulary. However, there are less oral presentations and more discussion based presentations, which I liked. Overall, I feel like I did learn a lot more about Chinese society and the issues that they face today.",
    "A class well-worth it if you put in the time and the effort. Demanding at times but get's you to learn a lot.",
    "more practice on writing essays. overall a good course if you don't mind kang laoshi's teaching style, which is very textbook centered and not as responsive to creative suggestions",
    "Great course to take if you really want to improve Chinese language skills - the rigorousness of the course means you get lots of contact time, and learn lots of new vocabulary that is then applied to a broad range of exercises, presentations, dictations, essays etc.",
    "The class subject matter is far more interesting and thought-provoking than the first semester classes. The work material is not too hard or demanding (except perhaps writing the essays). As long as you keep up your work you'll be fine.",
    "You'll learn a lot. The work is very regular and well spaced out. Generally a solid course. Highly recommended.",
    "This is a hard class with a lot of work. My formal Chinese definitely improved, since a lot of the emphasis is on more formalized speech and writing. Kang Laoshi is also really interesting. But again, there's a lot of work. Three tests that are 2-3 hours long each basically equates to three finals spaced throughout the semester. And there's a lot of work during the week, as well.",
    "The difficulty increases a little bit this semester. If you did fine in the fall, you should be fine in this class. It's excellent if you wish to learn more chinese, and professor Kang is good. The structure of the course is the same as in the fall semester.",
    "Great class for advanced Chinese speakers."
