    "An excellent introduction and overview of photovoltaic energy technologies. After a brief few lectures about the spectrum and intensity of light incident on earth, the course dives right into semiconductor physics. In fact, it was a great refresher on semiconductors--will solidify concepts learned in EENG 320 very well.The problem sets were constructed in a very thoughtful way, starting with macro concepts and moving toward more accurate calculations as more physical concepts were introduced and assumptions were modified. Each problem set builds off the last in a way I hadn't encountered as much in other classes, but it worked well; the semester felt like it had a definite \"arc\" to it.The problem sets can sometimes take awhile and will definitely require you to dust off your skills with Excel \/ Matlab \/ your number-crunching program of choice. The final project departs from the feel of the problem sets and is instead more of a report on the current state of a type of PV technology.",
    "An interesting class. It'll have some pretty high level physics, although some of it is overlap from 320. In all it's a cool experience to dive into one technology, although we set up the framework of solar cells more than we look at current production. The final project gives you an opportunity to look at a current tech though and you can do a better job of it having learned the framework. Minjoo is a pretty good professor who cares about the subject and teaching you. At times he just dives into proofs but he is also very open to questions so as interested as you are, he will be there to answer.",
    "Great class, especially at the 400 level. Professor Lee knows how to deal with both undergrads and grad students at the same time. The work load is reasonable and does relate to the material presented in class. I wouldn't call this class easy, but it's refreshing to have a classthat you know if you pay attention and work through the concepts presented that you will be able to solve the problems on the homework with some thought and excel work. So in that way, it's much \"easier\" than other EE classes, in my opinion. Just don't expect not to work in it.",
    "Photovoltaic Devices was a great course. I enjoyed the material and was able to catch up quickly without having taken 320 before that.Prof. Lee does a good job teaching the material. I feel that I learned a lot.The grading of the course was fair and the assignments were quite challenging. Some of the assignments would take a long time to complete, but the fact that the midterm was take-home and there was no final reduced the stress from the complicated course material.The TA, Stephanie, is very helpful and would always answer our questions."
