   "comments": [
    "This is a great class if you like to read, since it is necessary to read the works in order to participate in class and write the papers. The books are really interesting, and the workload, as far as papers to write, is very manageable. The class isn't always full of lively discussion - the atmosphere is more quiet and laid-back.",
    "Yes, the literature is very interesting and your writing improves.",
    "I would recommend this course. It wasn't necessarily the most exciting or best class I've taken at Yale, but I did get the chance to read and examine great works of American literature that I likely would not have examined otherwise. The small size of my class (6) was excellent and made for free-flowing discussion without the desperate fight-for-your-participation-grade quality of larger seminars. The papers were not particularly difficult or very long. Readings took time, but they were mostly enjoyable. Feedback was fine and Professor Wiedenfeld is very casual and welcoming of questions. His emphasis on examining other art forms like film, painting, and photography provided a nice complement to reading the literature. His handling of conversation was not as stimulating as that of other professors, and I felt that discussion could have been structured in a more engaging manner (although I wouldn't be able to elaborate quite how). Overall it was enjoyable, and if you need a humanities credit, this would be a good one.",
    "English 127 is a great course if you want more literature in your life, which is hopefully you do, regardless of who you are. Even if you are a science major. This was my first English class at Yale, and you learn a bunch, but it is also totally doable, and the work is fair. If you take with Professor Wiedenfeld, he loves film, and you will get to talk about cool films alongside the literature, which is fun. Prof. Wiedenfeld is incredibly laid back, and class discussion runs very very very tranquilly, so if you would like that, take this class.",
    "Overall, I thought this class was a very good survey of a few big-name American pieces of literature. The reading list was great, and the writing wasn't too much. I liked Wiedenfeld as an instructor. He was laid back yet seemed to care a lot about the class. Class discussions were largely based on our reactions to the reading and were not exactly strictly formatted. I enjoyed his section, but I could see how someone looking for a more structured assessment of American Literature might not."
