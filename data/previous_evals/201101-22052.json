   "comments": [
    "It is a good survey class, although lots of memorization for the midterm and final.",
    "Yes. Because it is a great course.",
    "Interesting subject matter. boring lectures. extremely bitter yet knowledgeable professor.",
    "Take it. You will know how much you love it after the first midterm ;)",
    "It's a great course and I learned tons, in a fair amount of detail, a really interesting period of history in a really interesting corner of theworld. (Also \"corner of the world\" gives the wrong connotation - the course covered a huge period of time and amount of area.) The best part is the work is minimal! The readings are basically optional - they almost always cover the same information that is presented in lecture. I was in the writing section which is more work but not bad for a writing credit, I guess.",
    "The course description pretty much says it all. Prof. Foster is a good lecturer. However, waking up at 9AM is difficult, and for someone who cares so much about dates, he frequently gets his own dates wrong. Overall, you should take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "This course provides a good survey of the Near East. It's pretty early in the morning, so sometimes staying focused gets a little difficult. But overall, it's a good class. Not a gut though. You do have to memorize a lot of dates and facts for the exams. Bur Ben Foster is a great professor and really knows his stuff.",
    "TKAE TI TAKE IT!Reading's a lot, but no need to do all (although ideal). It's a pleasure just to go in and sit in during Foster's lectures, doens't matter if it's 9 am.Has some of the most interesting slide shows as well.",
    "This is a fairly relaxed class--if you attend the optional lectures, then all you have to do is take the midterm and the final. Prof. Foster is flexible with his grading policy if you don't do well on the midterm. There is a lot of reading assigned, though it really isn't necessary to do in order understand what is going on. Sometimes the lectures are presented in a dry way, but the topics are pretty interesting. Take it if you want to learn a lot about Persia, Rome, and the Byzantine Empire.",
    "This is a fascinating class, for someone who had no Classical knowledge coming in.",
    "Good class. Lots of interesting lectures -- Foster is a boss. Cool slideshow pictures, too. Don't take the writing section, though; it's a total gut otherwise. Go to the optional Friday classes so you don't have to write the final paper, and you end up only taking a midterm and final. Good Cr\/D fifth class, but the 9am part sucks.",
    "It's a good course if you're interested in the material. If you take the writing section then you will learn more. Only take it if you're interested.",
    "do not take this class unless you took ds or are a hipster",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to science students. Pretty much all of the information was new to me, so I can say this was one of the classes at Yale in which I learned the most. Do the course packet reading; you will learn so much and benefit so much.Be careful about signing up for the writing section unless you desperately need a writing credit, since it accounts for 1\/3 of your grade, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's a lot more work, but at the same time, it's very useful in learning how to think, read, and write about history.",
    "i would recommend it. it isn't much work at all but it is good to go to class and study well for the exams. dont need to do much outside of that though.",
    "Great fifth class. Interesting and not too intense; rare combo.",
    "I loved this class. Ben Foster is a very insightful and witty lecturer and the subject of late antiquity is one that is not generally studied in comparison to its importance. It was a great class that tied together the traditions of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity and showed the interaction between the East and the West, which is extremely relevant and applicable to even contemporary politics. Grading is generous, the reading is sometimes difficult but not always necessary.The only downside is that it meets at 9 AM in the morning."
