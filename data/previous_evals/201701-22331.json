   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this course thoroughly. Coming from a business background, and being a straight male, I learned so much about how other of different bents perceive the world. There were so many issues that women faced or thought of through the ages that I had never thought of before. It has really opened my mind and made me a stronger supporter for an egalitarian society.",
    "I really got a sense of the arc of western feminism. I learned a lot of critical theory as related to gender.",
    "This course is absolutely incredible and it taught me to read things for so much more than the arguments they make. The course's instructor and my peers were knowledgeable in areas that I have never delve into and I had a beautiful experience learning from them.",
    "This class was the feminist and queer theory class that I always wanted to have in my undergrad but didn't get the chance yo until senior year.",
    "This course is an incredibly important in-depth look into theories usually taught pretty passingly is general surveys. It goes into their philosophical and political roots, and gives the students an idea of how gender studies as a whole are connected to a wide variety of disciplines and modes of analysis. This is the next necessary step for those who have studied feminist theory and are willing to dive into the complexities of this often-misunderstood field.",
    "I learned a great deal from the readings in this course. Books, authors, theorists, and ideologist. These writers dedicated their lives to causes, I never even thought about. I learned how to read and write about gender issues, something I never knew I would be able to manage in one semester.",
    "I learned how to see past the layers of normality, acquiescence, privilege, and whatever else clouds the eyes--and to really expand the horizon of what I think is politically possible. This course teaches you to look beyond in such a deep way, I hate to call it just \"learning.\" I mean that you come to understand what solidarity truly means; what it means to have your fate tied to another person's; how to dissolve the subjectivity you think is a given--such as existence as an individual--and see what is possible, in order to imagine the better world that should exist."

   "comments": [
    "It was a seminar course with an intimate setting where everyone knew the other. This fostered good sharing and discussion about several sensitive topics in a safe environment. The readings chosen by our Prof were phenomenal and covered a large breadth of topics, even from different languages.",
    "Moira has put together an incredible syllabus truly one to frame and keep. We unfortunately did not have time to engage with everything. However, it was wonderful to know it was there, and Moira herself was an invaluable resource in discussions as she knows this (huge) body of work very well.",
    "This course can be improved only if other courses at Yale require their students to engage more critically with texts of many different things traditions. My other courses at Yale, with the exception of Intellectual Debates of Latin America, did not compete on the level and caliber of this course's intellectual rigor. However, Moira made all of these very difficult texts digestible and understandable in ways other professors could never imitate.",
    "This was a wonderful course, and much needed - even though I have studied gender theories extensively in the past, it has taught me so much and has corrected many wrong assumption I had about certain feminist and queer streams of thought. The course can be limited, in the future, to students who have background in the subject matter, however, it should be noted that Prof. Fradinger did a phenomenal job in getting students with no such background \"up to speed\" and integrating them in the discussion. By the end of the semester the gaps were hardly detectable!",
    "The class offers wide ranges of topics and time periods. These items make the class a bit longer than other seminars. But, it is much required.",
    "This was one of the strongest discussion courses I have ever taken in my life. Moira is the best discussion leader--she cares, cares, cares so deeply about each of us individually, but also about us as a collectivity, and it shows in how the conversation flows. Students really jump to become their best selves and bring in their entire lives into the discussion. \"Gender theory\" does not cover the extent of this course. Or rather, Moira shows how gender is a window into the workings of our world on so many levels. It is a great distribution of work: I loved the student-led discussions, as we had many experts in the room who brought their own research to bear on their presentation topic."

    "Yes! If you believe in equality and want to understand your fellow humans, then absolutely!!",
    "Yes. If you want to learn something at this university, then take this course.",
    "Definitely. Take classes with Moira!! She's amazing!!!",
    "Would recommend wholeheartedly!! Excellent course taught by an extraordinary scholar.",
    "I recommend this course to everyone. No matter where you are from, what you study at Yale. This class is a mind opener to issues that touch us all on a daily basis.",
    "Yes, take this course, and it will change your life. \"Gender Theory\" is one of the only classes I have taken at Yale that is politically committed, as well as intellectually, to creating the better world that we all deserve. You learn to see past constructions--like, of course, gender and sexuality, but deeper ones too: subjectivity, individuality, selfhood. This is a philosophy course, a history course, a literature course--all beautifully and clearly rolled into one. Students are committed to struggling through the questions posed, as they make up the content of our lives. You get a GREAT primer on gender theory, and an added abundance of joy--of learning how to find joy in the struggle of life."
