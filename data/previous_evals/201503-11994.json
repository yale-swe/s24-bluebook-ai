    "Unfortunately, this is the last time PLSC 202 will be taught (at least by Professor Dufresne), so this course evaluation probably won't provide that much guidance for future students. That said, if for some miraculous reason you have the opportunity to take this course, I cannot recommend it highly enough. You won't regret it for a moment.",
    "This is one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale. Unfortunately, Professor Dufresne is leaving after this semester, but she is an incredible teacher. For those students who love to read a lot, discuss, and debate, this is the class for you. Homework was time intensive, but assignment were incredibly interesting, and Professor Dufresne puts a lot of time into offering comments on your work. Great course!",
    "Best class at Yale. Hands down. If you're at all interested in children and\/or law, this is an incredible experience.",
    "I struggled with this class in a really productive way. I struggled, of course, to keep up with the heavy load of reading and writing that the course required. But more than that, I struggled with a lot of the very real and pressing questions pertaining to children and children's law that class discussions produced. I often found myself grappling with some really provocative questions that Professor Dufresne forced us to take a stance onboth through preparatory materials and through structured in-class debate. I never really had an intense interest in children's issues, per se, but I learned so, so much from the class regardless. This was by far one of the best classes I have taken during my time at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take it if you get in! but too bad Prof. Dufresne is leaving so it won't be the same.",
    "Professor Dufresne is the pride of Yale University. This course approaches perfection. I left with an extremely good understanding of the material, and a newfound love for the work of Children's Law. Since professor Dufresne is leaving, I don't feel too bad about not giving any constructive feedback. Switzerland is lucky to have her, and it is a shame that we're losing her. I hope she comes back someday.",
    "Children's Law and Policy is a truly incredible class, probably the best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Dufresne was an amazing professor -- in large part because she cared so deeply about the class, and was so smart and experienced and committed to the class, so students responded with equal commitment and hard work in the class. The students in the class worked incredibly hard because Professor Dufresne expected it of us, which made for really excellent classes. There is no busy work in this class; every assignment, from the weekly oral arguments, to the policy proposals, essays, and group discussions, were thoughtful assignments that actually helped us grow and learn. I feel so lucky to have gotten to take this class, and Professor Dufresne will be so missed -- if she ever comes back to Yale, and offers this class again, I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "This course was by far and away my favorite one at Yale. Even though there was a ton of work, it never felt like too much because it was so enjoyable and thought-provoking. Professor Dufresne is fantastic. She probably put more time and energy in the course each week than any one of us. She had something planned for every class oral debates, policy discussions, interesting questions. 100% take her class if she comes back to Yale to teach again."
