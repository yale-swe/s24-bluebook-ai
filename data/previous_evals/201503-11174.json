    "A great class if you're interested in getting your feet wet with Black history and analyzing and constructing narratives around these events in your writing. For those who have taken similar courses at Yale, this could potentially be a little repetitive, but you can benefit from differing perspectives.",
    "Take this course",
    "I was extremely disappointed by this course. The lectures, while informative, did not go into any real depth and were at times disorganized. Jonathan Holloway is a wonderful dean; however, it seemed as if he did not put a lot of effort into AfAm 162. Much of the lecture material was simply a summary of the course readings, and Professor Holloway often appeared rushed and frequently stumbled over his notes, which was distracting. Furthermore, a few important African American figures\/historical moments were largely ignored over the course of the semester, such as Thurgood Marshall and the Montgomery Bus Boycott. I am aware that one of the aims of the course was to \"complicate the traditional narrative;\" however, as a student with almost no prior knowledge of African American history, it would have been helpful to learn about some of the aforementioned topics, especially since AfAm 162 seems to be the only comprehensive African American history course offered at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested at all in understanding race relations in the country right now! Holloway is a great teacher and he does a great job with the material. The readings are also super interesting and definitely give you an interesting perspective on the history of these movements.",
    "If you feel any need or desire to better understand the black experience in America (which I hope you do), you should take this course. It is such an eye-opening experience to have stereotypical and\/or simplistic explanations of African American history dismantled twice a week for fifty minutes. However, it's not \"easy\". If you want an easy WR that you can do well in, this is not the course for you. I would recommend this course if you're willing to put in the work. Lecture is intense and fast-paced if you struggle paying attention, but take the best notes you can. You read a lot of books and anthology excerpts, so some weeks it feels like a lot. Thankfully, the more difficult ones seem to be universally so, and the easier ones are more engaging and \"easier\" reads. The first paper is longer than your typical first paper in a course (8 pages), but don't forget that this is a WR. Also don't forget that this is a WR when you realize that the second paper is 12 pages. Shockingly, I did better on the second paper, but I also tried to put in as much in the pre-writing stage as possible. It's not hard to have a good rapport with your TF. Having a final not too long after submitting the second paper is a bummer, but remember that there is no midterm, so I guess that's the trade off. AFAM 162 is not one of those classes that I would \"do again\", per se. The one time was enough, but it was by no means a mistake. Also, for anyone vaguely considering a Credit\/D for this, I don't see why, unless you are interested in the subject but fear that the course material would be alienating, hard to understand, or if your schedule is otherwise heavy. After all the work you do for this course (if you actually try), I wouldn't be happy to not see a letter grade attached.",
    "It's a good history lecture. You learn a lot about a side of American history that often gets overlooked. The experience though, as with any large history lecture, can totally depend on your TA. Mine did a good job of highlighting the important points, but could be much too harsh of a grader. Other TAs seemed to have cared less about their section, but were also more lenient when doling out grades.",
    "Yes I would recommend. As someone who doesn't plan on majoring in history or African American Studies, it was a great comprehensive introduction. Also, made more interesting by the way in which we engaged the readings beyond just historical content to structure and rhetorical structure. I also feel far more literate in the African American canon as they books we read were all exceptional.",
    "yes",
    "This is a very interesting class with a lot of reading and interesting lectures. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The knowledge is extremely important and relevant today and with a subject that there are so many common misconceptions, it's important to understand the history more fully.",
    "Definitely would recommend. Especially if taught by Holloway.",
    "You should definitely take the class!!!",
    "YES. TAKE IT.",
    "Definitely would recommend, even if you think you've got a solid background on the topics we study from regular history classes you've taken. Great lectures and interesting readings (if you decide to do them; you'll still learn plenty if you just skim them, though). The papers can be a bit tedious, but definitely not too much work overall. Took it Cr\/D but I think it's probably better to take for a grade, as long as you write some decent papers. Final was pretty straightforward.",
    "AMST 162 covers a lot of material very quickly, but is a good intro course. Holloway tries to complicate traditional narratives and make us view concepts from new ways. If you have a lot of background knowledge already, you may be happier in a different class, because Holloway has to teach to people with limited exposure to the subject matter. I will say that Holloway is very demanding - there are two papers (with graded drafts and outlines) and a fairly lengthy final (12 IDs and 2 essays) and reading of about a book per week - but he is in general an enjoyable lecturer. I think that getting a TF that you click with is essential, because in a writing heavy course with few grades it is crucial to find someone who you can work with.",
    "Yes, regardless of your background or understanding of the material. I am an international student, and took a lot from the class, but could still envision an American student, having studied AP history getting an equal amount from the class. Hollaway is a great lecturer, perfectly synthesizing fact, with analysis with anecdote. The readings are excellent, the knowledge is crucial. Take it.",
    "Take this class! Holloway is a fantastic lecturer, and the readings are fairly easy and very interesting. Even if you think you know a lot about this topic, you will get a much deeper understanding of African-American history and the history of race in this country. It's a really, really good history lecture.",
    "History of black people in America from emancipation to about 2008 - so from Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation to the beginnings of Obama's campaign for president. Since the course covers so much history, it's a mile long and an inch deep - a general overview that touches on everything important but doesn't have a chance to get too deep into any particular moment in history.",
    "I would recommend. It is very interesting, very prevalent and not very hard. There is a lot of reading though.",
    "Did not live up to expectations",
    "Afam 162 is an overview of African American history post emancipation. It is mostly the study of speeches and writings made by African Americans throughout US history with a special focus on the 1960s. It was definitely a worthwhile class that is accessible to non majors.",
    "This is an essential class. It should be required for all Yale students. If you don't take it, you probably don't understand enough of American history to be a well-informed citizen.",
    "I believe every Yale student should take this course! In high school history courses, we learn about a select few African-American historical figures. The Black History many of us learn is frozen in time, making it impossible for us to understand its many nuances and its interesting dynamics. This course completely challenged my previous views about my own African-American history. I learned new details, I learned about new people, I learned the reasons why my culture and people operate the way they do. I can't wait to take more Af-Am classes! Definitely take this course!",
    "An excellent overview of African American intellectual, political, cultural, social, and economic history. Holloway intersperses quotes and poems with his lectures, making them well worth attending. And the readings expose you to a distinct part of the American canon that is so rich.",
    "10\/10 would recommend. Great class to get an intro to AfAm history and not too demanding in terms of the workload.",
    "I mean, the title says it all: this is a course that covers the African American experience from emancipation to present day. I would recommend it, one hundred percent.",
    "Yes, very relevant and important",
    "Great course! A really great overview of African American History. Holloway is an excellent lecture, and the TAs are some of the best I've had at Yale. It's not a light lecture, though, you are often assigned a book a week, and there are two medium-length essays and an exam, which is more than most history lectures I've taken. But I would certainly recommend this course, definitely a must-take during your time at Yale!",
    "If you haven't really studied African-American History at the college level before, yes. If you have, this course will be too introductory.",
    "Take this class, it is so important. Especially if you're coming from a place of privilege and desperately need to get educated. Go to lecture. Do the reading. This class isn't about academics or a grade, it's about living in this America in this present. AfAm history is a history that too many ignore and too many devalue. Literally this class should be a graduation requirement.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students. While it definitely was a historically focused class, I think all students could gain a lot from the course, lectures, and readings. It offered students an oft overlooked part of our collective American history, and I found that extremely valuable.",
    "Absolutely recommend!",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to anyone else.",
    "Great course, a lot of reading, very good Credit D course! 100% recommend!",
    "It's a great introduction to African-American history with a very manageable workload.",
    "absolutely take this class. I grew so much -- definitely one of the most valuable academic experiences i've had at yale. a ton of writing..but it's worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend AFAM 162 to another student. Dean Holloway is great, your writing will improve, and everyone at Yale should have a good understanding of the history that is presented in this class.",
    "A great class that will give you a better perspective on the events that shaped our current situation.",
    "This material is so important to know and it is so often ignored by high school and other history classes. I found the reading especially so -- I hadn't read any of it before (besides MLK's speeches) and all of it was so eye-opening and interesting. All of the books are books you should read at some point. There was a lot of reading each week, and you had to submit discussion questions and terms a day beforehand. The papers (8 and 12 pages) had two pre-assignments each, but these were helpful because they made me start ahead of time and actually do outlines. Professor Holloway was a very engaging lecturer.",
    "It's a very reading and writing-intensive course. Definitely challenging, but worthwhile.",
    "This was a great overview of African American History post-Emancipation, and highlighted the major movements and charismatic leaders of each decade. It's hard to teach such a course in a semester, so a lot of the material was just broad overviews, but I would love to dig deeper into the content in another AFAM course. Great introduction, though!",
    "A broad survye of recent African American history. Defeinitely recommended, and very important to take! Everyone at Yale should take it to gain an understanding of recent African\/American history and its major themes and trends.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I think the material is interesting and lively, even if one doesn't have a passion for the subject. When considering modern day contexts, I think the material becomes even more important to consider. The course is generally well taught with Prof Holloway being very knowledgable about the subject and having really interesting takeaways and new perspectives on a subject that is not always given the complexity that it deserves. Even if one thinks Prof Holloway had the occasional not-totally-pulled-together lecture, he handled his job as professor very well considering all of the other hats that he wears.",
    "Definitely would recommend! I think AFAM 162 is a crucial class for understanding the ways legacies of racism continue to impact and shape our national institutions today. This is an essential class. Anyone who is remotely interested in politics, social justice, or just in understanding how our country works needs to take this class. I think this class is particularly essential for white students who don't have to confront racism on a daily basis. It's important to understand the nexus of privilege that we are a part of.",
    "If you do not have much knowledge of Black histories in the United States, and you wish to, take this class. If you already have some knowledge and experience, take one of the more exciting offerings in the AfAm Department.",
    "Yes, if only for the reading list. The reading list almost felt like it was supplemented by the course rather than the other way around, and was clearly really thought through.",
    "I took this class as a non-history major interested in the material, and I was not disappointed. The lectures were great, the readings were very interesting (the ones I got to--there's a huge amount of reading assigned), and the section was excellent (though of course that depends on who's in section with you). The workload was higher than expected, but doable: the first paper was 8 pages and the second one was 12. Take this class!",
    "I would 100% recommend this course! Learning about African History is crucial to understanding the history of this country and the racism people still experience today. This course has been eye-opening, thought-provoking and life-changing. It's definitely been one of my favorite courses throughout my four years at Yale and the one class I feel like I've grown the most from. Would 100% recommend.",
    "Everyone should take this course. I had only a surface understanding of African American history since slavery before taking this class, and this course, with Dean Holloway's insightful commentary, provided a crucial framework for me to dig deeper into all issues of race, class, power, and identity.",
    "I would rate the course highly, and I would definitely recommend the course to another student. As a new student to such an elite university, having the opportunity to learn from the Dean of my school was absolutely worthwhile. As for the content of the course, I found it very interesting. However, as a science major, students may find the content even more interesting if they are history or African American Studies majors.",
    "AFAM 162 is a comprehensive look at African American history from Emancipation to now (like the title says). You understandably spend a considerable chunk of time on the Civil Rights Movement, but you also explore more little-known figures and events. If you know nothing about African American history, you should take this class so you can get the basics. If you know a bit about African American history, you should still check it out because you might have gaps in your knowledge that this class can fill (this was my case).",
    "This class is the most enlightening class I have ever taken. Upends the narrative of a linear march of progress for African Americans in this country; proves that we still have far to go to achieve real freedom for all our citizens. We read about a book a week, 8 page essay, 12 page final paper, and a final exam (12 IDs and two essays). Professor is great, a little disorganized but knows so much.",
    "Could be a much better course. Holloway is engaging and funny, but he doesn't seem to offer anything new or interesting in the way of a thesis about the various things the class covers. If you take the course, be prepared for A LOT of reading for an introductory lecture course a book a week plus other articles or excerpts from an anthology. Interesting lectures, but the class fell below expectations.",
    "To summarize, AFAM 162 is a survey course in African-American history that encompasses the period in question. I would recommend this course.",
    "A survey course in African American history, and it really is a true survey -- you touch on most everything you might want to know about the subject, but Holloway leaves enough out to encourage you to take further classes in the subject. Workload is sometimes a bit much but certainly manageable. Highly recommended.",
    "Absolutely. Every. Student. Should. Take. This. Class. I can personally say that this was the most important class I have taken in my life. I was in love with every minute of it. Because of it, my understanding of American history has been expanded and much-improved. From W.E.B. Du Bois to Malcolm X to Obama and everything in between we learned sooo much. Professor Holloway was fantastic; he kept me constantly engaged and interested, and there were multiple times that lecture actually moved me to a deep emotional reaction. Despite being the dean of Yale (casual), Holloway was obviously very invested in the class, and he came across as an approachable and compassionate professor. The readings were a lot to get through, but were absolutely wonderful and worth the time commitment. I was particularly appreciative of the balance between academic historical works (which were sometimes dry but still important) and literature (which I loooved), which, I felt, gave students a surprisingly thorough and personal understanding of the realities of the African American experience during various historical eras. I have actually already been recommending some of the works that we read to friends and family members. Finally, my section was amazing, and I had some of the most unforgettable and paradigm-shifting conversations of my life there. I know this sounds overly dramatic, but I am being completely sincere!! I am a science major, but this class was so impactful for me that I am seriously considering a double major in African American Studies. Especially in the context of everything that happened this semester (ugh), I am immensely grateful for Professor Holloway, the dedicated TAs, and this course. Take this class, and make yourself a more aware and responsible American citizen ! ! !",
    "AFAM 162 is a class every Yale student should take. I am a STEM major and took it Credit\/D, and am very glad I did, because it clarified so many misconceptions and inaccurate assumptions regarding African-American history from the Emancipation... to the present day! It was eye-opening to see how many of the things taught to and assumed by the general public (including the majority of Yale students) are completely false. I learned so much and it was especially meaningful for me as a person of color during the events on campus, to be taking away the material I did on this course. There was a lot of material and a lot of reading, so be prepared to read, learn, and absorb your way through this class. A review session or having the key terms coming throughout the course would have been helpful for the final. I recommend making a study group to study for the final, as there are a lot of IDs to cover.",
    "Great intro class, must take (Should be required), you will def learn something new. Great reading list, through some sources can get repetitive (it just helps to show how extensive the history is and how some ideas have been around for soooo long). Holloway's an average lecturer (not difficult to stay awake, but not Salovey legendary) but he's quite lovable, approachable, and woke AF. My TF was sweet and great with paper feedback but section was an absolute waste of time. Last paper;s lack of prompt is daunting but start early and you'll eventually figure it out."
