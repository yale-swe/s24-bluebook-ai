    "Great HSHM seminar. Rogers is a good professor, knows her material and is relatively accessible. Covers topics of medicine and science from late 1930s to early 1960s, aka Cold War. The reading is interesting, and no more than any other history seminar. 3 papers--two shorter and one final paper. The two early ones give you a chance to get used to Rogers grading and comment style. Overall, I recommend it!",
    "Recommend.",
    "The material for this course was really quite interesting, but I didn't always feel like our discussions reached the same level. To truly appreciate the course, you need a solid background in American Cold War history, which few of us had. Rather than filling in the details, Professor Rogers would ask us. But as we simply didn't know, it often felt like there was dead time in discussion. It's certainly not the worst Junior seminar, but there are probably better ones too.",
    "Yes- this class was wonderful! Professor Rogers is the best and you will not regret taking this unbelievable course!",
    "Great for a seminar.",
    "Great class. Engaging readings. Not overbearing at all. Take it if you think this stuff will interest you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. It was very interesting to read about these topics, and classes were pretty interesting. Be prepared to talk though, otherwise class just won't be interesting.",
    "It didn't seem like we had a lot of readings at first, but you're not able to quickly read them the night before. In order to be able to participate in seminar, you need to get started on the readings earlier - especially when one week has an actual book to be read. Professor Rogers is really energetic and caring, she's a good moderator for seminar. We always talked about interesting topics, and discussed issues involving the atomic bomb, racism, and gender roles of the 1950s. The 2 semester essays were not that bad, and the research paper can be fun because you get to pick a topic that most interests you. I would recommend this seminar to another student, it wasn't too stressful, and only requried additional work for the 3 essays.",
    "If you love 1950s American culture and medicine- this is the perfect class. The readings are all mostly interesting and the class discussion is incredible. Professor Rogers actually knows everything. The in class discussion is like being a historical detective. She makes you think like you're part of the history and we're all solving the crimes of the past. It's a lot of fun and not too much work. You really learn to dig deep into historical documents.",
    "This was a good course. It was great to have the opportunity to do some research in the archives for my final project."
