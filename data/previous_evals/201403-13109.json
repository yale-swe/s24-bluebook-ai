    "This class is so enjoyable, with an ideal, funny English professor Neuman, and an amazing book list. You will re-evaluate what you envision to be a hero, and understand where some of your heroic values have come from. The literature on this syllabus was impeccable; I loved each book from the beginning, or at least grew to love each work Neuman chose. If you enjoy old literature new literature, or just reading some of the most transformative pieces from throughout the centuries to discuss, than this is the class for you. Also, Neuman will help you improve your writing with commentary, office hours, and rewrites. The workload is never too much, though from the books you will pick out and carry around, it will appear that you are in DS. This class is a great choice for anyone who enjoys reading old books, wants a writing credit\/writing help, and who wants to participate in meaningful discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 115 to another student. It is a very helpful writing course.",
    "A wonderful literary analysis course for casual literature explorers and more serious literary aficionados alike, bonded over the mutual desire to delve into the written world without reading as many pages per night as some more intense seminars. With four essays and a class participation grade, this class is a you-get-out-what-you-put-in propositionyou can read just what you need to pass the essays, or you can read everything and engage in class. Indeed, a few coast through silent in class, some dominate the discussion, and majority fit in between. By far the most important factor in choosing a seminar is the professor, followed by the books on the syllabus. I highly recommend Justin Neuman, who is a phenomenal teacher. He came to every class with such an enthusiasm for literature that it was hard to keep his passion from rubbing off on you. He was always more than adequately prepared to lead discussions, offering fascinating insight on the books we read. He has such an intimidatingly scholarly and articulate way of talking that I sometimes couldn't believe that he was sitting in the same room as me, and that I was expected to have an answer to the probing question he just asked! tl;dr: Take 115 from Justin Neuman, you'll enjoy it.",
    "Interesting course, but with A LOT of DS-esque reading (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). In-class discussion was always interesting and fun! Professor Neuman is a great professor with very interesting socks! I enjoyed the course and thought it was a good first-semester writing credit for someone who likes reading.",
    "English 115 was a perfect introduction into literary analysis. As someone who never had to write papers in high school, this course was very helpful.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "It was a very interesting way to look at heroism and how the idea of a hero changes through time. It's an intimate setting that is well guided by the teacher but also facilitates student discussion and allows you to express your opinions."
