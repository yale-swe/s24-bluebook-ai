    "I developed listening and reading comprehension skills as well as the ability to better understand what a natural francophone is saying I.e. idiomatic expressions and colloquial language.",
    "I improved my speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills in French. I also learned more about Francophone countries' cultures and histories.",
    "Advanced speaking skills",
    "Solidified my speaking skills and learned more vocab",
    "This class is an extension of L3, but a little less focused on grammar and more focused on literature. The things you read are also really interesting. I especially loved reading all the short stories from the French colonies. You probably won't actually learn that much in this class but your reading, writing, and speaking will improve a ton and you'll have fun if you like literature.",
    "I believe my ability to understand and speak French with more confidence has improved, as well as my understanding of grammar."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed that we watched quite a few movies as well as did a lot of reading. I think the course could benefit from some more in-class grammar practice.",
    "Some strengths include the small class size, support from the instructor, and purposeful workload. One weakness is the use of very old recorded tapes as part of homework because the tapes are often very long (20-30 minutes), and after about 15 minutes it's easy to become disengaged and not gain much from them.",
    "more engaging course material, some of it felt dated",
    "I really enjoyed most of the readings and films. Some audio programs are far too long, and some of the older ones are hard to hear.",
    "The literature was great! I've taken French at Yale since L1 and this was by far my favorite semester in terms of the material. I will say that I wish we got a little bit more speaking practice. I also think this course could be improved if we spent a little bit of time talking about current events and practicing more day-to-day French instead of only discussing literature. I think it might make the class a little bit more practical."

   "comments": [
    "I would. I found this course to be a lot more engaging than L3 and enjoyed it much more. It really felt like the students were becoming more familiar and confident with French rather than simply doing the work.",
    "Absolutely. I always looked forward to going to class and practicing the language. Not only was the work rewarding, but class was fun, and the instructor was a pleasure.",
    "Yes, very effective method of learning french",
    "Yes, if you want to strengthen your skills in reading, writing, and speaking, fren 140 prepares you well",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course because it's well-taught and the material is interesting. Especially if you like literature, definitely take it because most of what you do is read and discuss books.",
    "The French program at Yale is more intense than many other languages, but very rewarding and you walk away with an adequate level of knowledge and experience."
