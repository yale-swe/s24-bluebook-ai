    "I have had a very hard time understanding the pedagogical principles behind this class. The goal of the course is to cover the entire German grammar in a semester, so that we could \"read\" a German article of 500 hundreds words and translate it in two hours. I believe I haven't learned any German grammar if not to get through the test. I can barely pronounce any word, and if I skim through a German text I don't understand more than a word here and there.",

    "I believe that the instructor should really reflect on what this class aims to teach. I hardly see any strengths. This class requires an enormous quantity of homework, and the result is that I am barely able to understand a written sentence, let alone understand a simple paragraph.",
    "It is unfortunately just too much material to cover in one semester. Either it should be expanded to two semesters or the course material should be cut in half. While I gained a fairly proficient understanding of German translation, I continued to make the same repetitive errors because we simply did not have time to deeply engage with any one topic.",
    "I think this course is great. I really appreciate the group collaboration amongst students. I think it will be great if we collect questions from the students for the overall text."

    "I would not recommend this course to anyone. The workload is immense, the time in class absolutely useless (most of the time the instructor goes over topics you are supposed to study on your own for the same day) and one doesn't really learn anything about the language. The only reason why I took it is to satisfy a language requirement (the credit does not even count for my coursework)",
    "Yes, but with the understanding of its limitations and incredibly fast pace of learning.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who intends to acquire a condensed version of German reading training within one semester.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. I think this course is an excellent place for any students to start reading German"
