    "I would recommend the class if the student were willing to commit a significant amount of time to reading Latin that is both challenging and unusual to read.",
    "Petronius is run like your typical L5 Latin seminar. There's about 250-350 lines of reading per week, as well as some secondary reading during the first half the course (during the second, you do your own readings in prep for the term paper). Kirk is a great teacher, and basically stops whoever is reading as they go whenever something interesting or of cultural note comes up. He has a great personality and is really chill, and makes the number of lines a lot more manageable by giving periodic quizzes instead of a final for which you need to reread everything. Petronius himself is incredibly fun to read, especially if you've taken more traditional authors already and want a text that provides some contrast.",
    "Take it, but only if you are a major or very good at latin-- it is really a lot of work.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! One of the best I have taken so far. The content, professor, atmosphere in class and workload is great. You make the class for yourself. There are reading in the first half of the course, then it is down to you to read what is relevant to your paper. There is not so much a 'set' workload, but feel as you go sense to the class. If one section of text is particularly interesting we would spend time and on that, rather than trying to rush throughout what we had planned. Great class!!!",
    "A large workload but ultimately worthwhile",
    "I would recommend this to any student who is passionate about and is skilled at Latin. In summary, it's a fairly complete look at Petronius's Satyricon, with an emphasis on translation and cultural themes in the text.",
    "Only if the student was advanced in Latin, the preparation load for each class is heavy."
