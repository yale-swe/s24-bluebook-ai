   "comments": [
    "fine, i knew a lot of the information already though.",
    "Why make us sit through a painful seminar? Just require all students to do the online modules before starting Yale.",
    "This was a fine introduction to research ethics. I think many of our classes at YSPH cover ethics in some form or another so this was a fine supplement. I feel like I have a good basic understanding of research ethics.",
    "For students in the AP program, this seminar was a waste of time. We have all done research before or had medical ethics courses. There should be some sort of mechanism to test out of this seminar.",
    "It is ridiculous that such an important concept is consolidated into a two-hour lecture. I took an entire semester class on Public Health Ethics in undergrad, and that is how it should be taught here. The material was not helpful and it seemed as if they just wanted to 'check the box' that they had taught it. Really embarrassing that YSPH would conduct itself in this manner.",
    "More direct examples of when we might need IRB approval would have been helpful (i.e. if you are giving surveys, this is what you need to do, if you are working with patients, this is what you need to do).",
    "This was some course we had to take to be MPH students, it provided no value as it was redundant with a guest lecture we had in another course.",
    "I dont know what the point of the lecture was. Instead, we should be required to do all the online exams together. I understand the importance of knowing HIPAA information and everything else we tested for, but the lecture seemed to be an inconvenient waste of time. Khave did a really good job though, this is not a comment on him.",
    "I didnt go to the lecture. I wrote a paper. A lot of the websites we were meant to take the tests on weren't working properly.",
    "N\/A",
    "The course is mandatory so nothing can really be said of whether it was worthwhile or not. I thought that it should have been broken down into smaller groups, rather than the plenary session.",
    "2 hours was plenty of time for the seminar and the most important concepts were covered.",
    "Good, thorough, efficient vehicle for covering the required material. Stay the line!",
    "It's not really a class just one time seminar.",
    "Required 2 hr seminar on research ethics. Relatively painless. The IRB section is somewhat informative for people who will have to go through that process.",
    "The online certificates taught us all the information that the lecture presented, so the lecture was superfluous, but it was only taught once in the semester, so if there is a lecture, no big.",
    "Given that I had to complete most of this course's requirements for my volunteer work, this was not necessary for me.",
    "Does this class really apply to HPA and HMP students who aren't going to do summer research?",
    "Why isn't there a whole course on research ethics that is required? This is such an important topic and really integral part of research.",
    "This course didn't teach any new material---all material had been covered in other courses.",
    "This was a one-time class which was interesting, but not particularly useful for me because I don't plan on doing research. With that said, though, it's probably best that a graduating MPHer has these certificates.",
    "It was a waste of time.",
    "It was a very helpful course to better understand research ethics and how to properly coordinate research involving human subjects.",
    "Strengths- good overview of research ethics and expected ethical behaviour of individuals in Yale that are carrying out researchWeakness- The in class meeting could have been spread over two or three class meeting",
    "Epstein committed two classes and a guest lecturer to IRB\/Ethics therefore this was an unnecessary review that stressed and inconvenienced students rather than informed them.The powerpoint slides were disjointed and the instructors were not formally introduced. One slide, Belmont Report: beneficience, justice, respect could have sufficed.",
    "The ethics lecture was interesting as far as ethics lectures go.",
    "We only met once for this course, but I did feel it was useful.I have had little exposure to research using human subjects, so it was a good introduction to the ethical protocol for that.",
    "the course gave an important introduction to ethical issues and IRB procedures. however, perhaps the course could have been given as an online tutorial or shorter informational training.",
    "generally pointless, but at times had interesting discussion",
    "Decent",
    "I wasn't able to attend the lecture so had to make up the work.",
    "good",
    "it improves students' awareness of many ethical issues which is essential to public health researchers and managers.",
    "The course was helpful in opening the eye of everyone to the constant debates that occur in research ethics and the protocols and procedures that must be considered when doing research.",
    "This was only taken since it was a requirement. The majority of the material covered was not new to me, and I did not learn much from the session. Filling out the required online courses was a waste of time unless required to do my own research projects.",
    "Good. It may be better to have the course more than once though as i felt little was learnt during the class.",
    "I have a very strong background in research ethics so it's hard to say how beneficial this class is. I'm sure that for students with no background, this course provided a good foundation.",
    "Good introduction to IRB and related research issues",
    "I would prefer to just do the assignments and not have the lecture part of the course."

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0He presented the information in a concise and coherant manner, but he discussed topics that many of us already understood from either courses in undergrad or research conducted prior to graduate school."
