    "I recommend this class to anyone who appreciates type!",
    "Absolutely - I think that Type I is an incredible class that will get at many of the principles of graphic design through the lens of typography. By the end of term, you'll be able to identify typefaces easily, and you'll have an incredible respect for typography as it applied in the environment around you. Alice is an extremely dedicated instructor and the assignments she gives are both stimulating and fun.",
    "I loved this course! It had a good balance of projects and history. When the semester is over you won't be able to look at typography the same way again."
