    "EVST 120 studies the relationship between humans and nature, be it land, natural resources, or ideals, in the United States from the late 17th century to the present. I would recommend it; it was fast paced and interesting, and helped develop my intense interest in natural resources and energy.",
    "A wonderful class. This was my favorite class this semester, mostly because of Professor Sabin. He is THE BOMB. He is SO knowledgeable but also approachable and humble. He is extremely good at presenting concrete details, which is hard to do which such a broad topic, while wrapping them within complex historical narratives. He shows how deeply intertwined environmental issues are with political, social, cultural, and economic forces - but in SUCH a tangible way. I gained both perspectives and real knowledge in this class. We also had a fun field trip during October break, where we visited sites in New Haven and learned about their past. This is so important to do but so under-done. I also honestly enjoyed section for this class, which was maybe because I had such a wonderful TF. I've never looked forward to section, or gained so much from it, but my TF (Clara) facilitated such deep conversations. Important notes: this class is called Environmental History, but it really should be American Env Hist. We do talk about global issues, but only as they apply to American ones. There is also a TON of reading, but you'll be fine if you don't do it all. Also, the readings were interesting, enjoyable, and connected very well with each other and the lectures.",
    "I would only take this if you are very interested in Environmental Studies. I liked the class, but I know that people who took it just as another credit did not engage with the material as much as I did. Lot of reading assignments as well.",
    "Absolutely Recommended, especially for people interested in the environmental sciences. This course provides you with a good historical context of the environmental issues we face today. And the work is totally manageable.",
    "I loved this class - I would definitely recommend it. Knowing very little about environmental history, this course showed me an entirely new side of US history I never considered, and really brought up important themes of environmental issues throughout history and in the present\/future. Professor Sabin is a great lecturer, and section isn't bad either. The exams are fair - he provides a list of IDs that could be on the exam ahead of time, and gives you a choice of IDs on the exam. Other than a few tiny essays at the beginning of the semester, there is a final research paper, which I suggest starting early and actually can be kind of fun to write, if you choose a good topic that you care about. I also really enjoyed all the readings, so take some time to read (or skim) them. And make sure you go to lecture!",
    "Great overview of key themes in Environmental History.",
    "A great overview course. Prof. Sabin is a great lecturer and an overall nice guy. The readings were fantastic--possibly my favorite class this semester.",
    "Definitely a good class if you want a general summary of environmental history. Covers some interesting topics like Native Americans not often covered in history courses. Lectures can sometimes be a little dry, but general interesting material.",
    "An interesting take on history. It sometimes covered events that I was already familiar with, but in a new and interesting way. The reading can be a bit excessive but it's interesting material, and the essays are not that difficult. A really good way to get a WR in a fairly easy class.",
    "I didn't love this class and at times found it pretty boring. I realized over the course of the semester that I'm actually not that interested in preservation and environmental movements, which is the bulk of what we talked about. I did enjoy some of the material in the middle of the course, about topics like the dust bowl and city development projects. I also felt that the professor was trying to squeeze too much information into each lecture (talking really quickly and almost always going over time.) I definitely didn't hate the class, but it wasn't as good as I hoped. Also if you're thinking of taking it, keep in mind that it's strictly American environmental history.",
    "I would recommend this class but only to students who have an interest in the environment",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, even if you are not an environmental studies major. It covers issues that are very relevant to past, present, and future history.",
    "Initially HIST 120 seemed to be pretty boring for those of us who were not environmental studies majors but after a few lectures it became much more interesting as we shifted to looking more at American History through the lens of environmental changes.",
    "YES TAKE IT!!! If you have any interest in the environment or American history you will love this course!",
    "Definitely take this class if history interests you at all - you'll do some really cool readings!",
    "A fantastic course on American environmental history. Lecture was always interesting, sections were awesome, and Sabin often started lecture with folk music, which was great. Take it if you're at all interested in environmental studies or American history. Two thumbs up!",
    "All EVST majors should take this class. It's an excellent chronological survey of environmental history in America. It's also a pretty easy writing credit.",
    "One of the best course I've taken at Yale. This is, all in all, a fantastic course and exactly what I was looking for. The lectures are some of the best I've had at Yale. The sections are exactly what they need to be: discussion involving the readings and lectures. The assignments are helpful and really lead you into the writing the final paper. The readings are quite interesting, particularly Prof. Sabin's book \"The Bet\" which was fantastic, even riveting, and very clear. Definitely read this! This course does what no introductory course I've taken does: introduce a subject. And still it keeps environmental history always interesting. The only sucky part was that there was a 10 page final paper due six days before the final exam, which was a bit unnecessary. I'm hoping they change this for the next group of students who take this class because, otherwise, this is the perfect course.",
    "It's a great class. I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in the history of how humans have shaped the environment and how it has shaped us.",
    "For students interested in the environment and learning about the earth for the sake of learning this is the class to take.",
    "Solid class, I found the topic very interesting so I enjoyed the lectures and readings. Sections were required, but discussions were always engaging. If you have even the slightest interest in US environmental history, take this class! You won't regret it. This year and previous years it was also a WR credit, but there are only 2 short papers and one 8-10 page final paper, which isn't bad at all for a WR credit. Exam prep is nice because the possible IDs are all on from a list of possibilities that he provides, which was super helpful especially for the midterm which was 100% IDs. You will get a good grade if you put in effort. Readings and lectures were on the same topics, so if you did one or the other for a certain day, you won't be missing much! I did more than half of the readings which was plenty enough.",
    "Not my favorite, but not bad. A lot of assigned reading.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "Intro to Environmental History is what it promises to be- an introduction to the history of how Americans have related to their environment, before and after colonization. Often intriguing, Professor Sabin is a good lecturer and is accessible to students, even taking students on an environmental history tour of New Haven. Reading are generally pretty interesting. The introductory level, however, means that the course never goes in depth, covering a span from pre-Colombus to modern day, and section discussions can be painfully bad. Still, understanding the history is useful as an EVST major, so I would definitely recommend the course. The final research paper is specifically a great way of delving in depth to a subject you really care about.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for a student looking for an overview of environmental history. This class will help you shift your fundament understanding of American history. The class provides an excellent summary of historical themes and applies them to current environmental issues. Although the reading load is difficult, the papers and exams are quite manageable. This was one of my favorite classes.",
    "Awesome course for anyone who loves history. Not difficult at all and the coursework is not at all overwhelming. You have a totally new perspective and understanding of the environment in the end!",
    "Yes certainly",
    "Yes, a good writing credit and an interesting history class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. Professor Sabin is passionate and interesting and the material is important to know the kind of history you should've learned in grade school but was for some reason overlooked. It's important to go to lectures because Sabin gives out lecture notes only to those who show up, but if you show up to class the midterm and finals are a breeze (they're mostly IDs). There are a lot of readings, and while many of them are interesting the workload is borderline unmanageable. Still, you can get by skimming or reading selected chapters, whatever works for you, and you get most of the information verbally, through class and section. A warning: it should be called *American* Environmental History if you're looking at a more global look of the world maybe check out Harvey Weiss' Agricultural History instead."
