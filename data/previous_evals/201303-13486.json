    "English 120 is above all a creative writing class. The readings will pile up over time, but the real effort will always be about writing. There is more work than an average course, but there is also plenty of time in which to finish it. I recommend the course on the condition that the other students are engaged in the material as well. The students will make or break the class.",
    "\"Reading and writing the modern essay\" is very self descriptive. We read two to four essays for homework and then discussed them during class. The idea is to identify the strategies and techniques used by these writers, and to try to apply them in our own writing. This is a great class that everyone at yale should take, regardless of their major. It teaches you how to read critically and how to write and think clearly.",
    "English 120 is a class for English and non-English majors alike. It is a fun way to learn to write like a college student. The group discussions are thought provoking and each student grows tremendously over the course of the semester. Professor Sider is incredible.",
    "I will definitely recommend taking English 120! It is a great class and writing non-fiction is always passionate. It will probably be better if taken after ENGL 114 or 115 so that students are more familiar with writing at Yale. But definitely take it as one of your writing requirements!",
    "AMAZING. yes, absolute recommend. take it!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to everyone who wants to see their writing improve dramatically. This class is as much about reading as it is about writing, and the material is fascinating (as were our discussions about it). The process of workshopping essays was very beneficial as well. I feel much more confident about my reading and writing skills going forward- TAKE IT! You won't regret it!",
    "YESS! It's hard work, but you'll learn a lot.",
    "In English 120, you will learn how to strengthen your formal writing ability in ways you did not in high school. You will be writing and reading not literary or academic arguments, but rather creative essays. You will learn to spill your thoughts onto paper and the process of straightening them out afterward. I definitely recommend this course."
