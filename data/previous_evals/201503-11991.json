    "I cannot recommend enough taking a class with Shelly at some point in your Yale career. You will never have a professor who is more dedicated to helping you grow as a thinker than Shelly. Yes, his standards, both on papers and in class discussion, are astronomical, but he does so muchfrom writing essay-length paper comments to staying long after the end of class each week to continue discussionto help you meet those standards. As for the class, it is a very comprehensive overview of the major issues in normative ethics (which lies somewhere between practical ethics and meta-ethics). At times, discussion in class is not as deep as one might otherwise wish, but one always has the opportunity to explore particular issues in-depthand with much support from Shellyin one's papers.",
    "This is one of those courses that can really impact how you view things in the world. Just be prepared to take it credit\/d",
    "Take it. It might be one of the harder classes you'll take here and you'll actually have to think critically, but it is completely worth it.",
    "I highly recommend this class! It is fun, it makes you think, and it is a fairly comprehensive survey of normative ethics. Make sure you are ready to participate, but don't be too worried about the workload (it is fairly low because, besides three papers, the reading is not too difficult and only takes a few hours a week)."
