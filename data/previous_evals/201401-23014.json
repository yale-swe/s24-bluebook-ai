   "comments": [
    "A class without discussion, and as a result, quite boring. I would probably not recommend the class. A simple reading of the \"rules\" and guidelines would be equivalent to what was learned in the class.",
    "Because you have to take it if you want money.",
    "It's required",
    "We discussed various aspects of research ethics. Generally interesting and important things to think about",
    "As far as ethics training goes, I thought this course did a good job of presenting the issues and bringing different perspectives.",
    "It's required, so I would recommend that they take it. It's only an hour each week but it is at a pretty inconvenient time.",
    "It is a weekly lecture\/discussion on some practical ethical issues that can come up in the course of conducting research.",
    "A weekly lecture on various topics regarding responsible conduct of research. No homework, but missing a class requires a make-up exam and two absences are not tolerated. I would recommend it, even though the class is mandatory",
    "It's a useful course with light work load. I would recommend it because it makes you think.",
    "I would recommend it, but this is unnecessary because it is a required course. I would summarize it as an ethics course as it pertains to science, research, and conduct.",
    "The course was much better than any ethics class I've ever taken and aside from it being required, I would highly recommend it.",
    "Because you probably don't want to take it again...show up and take it.It's actually not a bad way to spend a Friday afternoon."

   "comments": [
    "It didn't. In fact, several times I tried to facilitate a discussion by noting a differing opinion. Each time I did, the instructor responded, \"yes, you are right\" and moved to a different topic. I gained a better understanding of responsible conduct from random discussions with peers.",
    "It contributed by completing the requirements set by the NIH to have money.",
    "Made me think about certain aspects of graduate school. was sort of helpful in choosing a lab to work in.",
    "It helped me to be think a lot about different important topics and concerns in scientific research.",
    "In order to be a good scientist, it is of utmost importance to have outstanding ethics. This course did a good job of highlighting gray areas in the field and challenging us to think through them critically.",
    "It taught me a lot of basic things that I should know about lab that you don't normally learn in the lab setting",
    "This course helped me understand what was expected of me in certain aspects of my work. It was quite informative for questions regarding papers and authorship.",
    "The mechanics of what should be cited and how was helpful.",
    "This course helped us understand the implications behind the decisions that we have to make on a daily basis. I especially appreciated the conversations about publications and deciding upon an adviser.",
    "Helped me think about what I would do in various situations",
    "It make me think about the things I should and should't do during my academic career thus it is really relevant.",
    "It didn't deepen my knowledge of my discipline or profession, but it provided a means for me to communicate or handle some ethical dilemmas if it ever becomes necessary.",
    "I now know more than I did when starting, especially about the patent and intellectual property rules of Yale University. This information is invaluable, and I'm very glad and fortunate for the opportunity to have learned it."
