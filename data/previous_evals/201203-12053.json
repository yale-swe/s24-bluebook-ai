    "The nature of this semester totally depends on how demanding and regimented your senior thesis advisor is.",
    "You have to take it if you are a senior history major. The history major is the best on at Yale I think so you definitely should take it!",
    "I am really enjoying the experience of the History senior essay thus far. If you pick a topic that you are really interested in and an advisor who you want to talk to on a regular basis, the essay can be fun and rewarding. If you are able to do so, performing some research over the summer can also make the fall semester much easier. Having done a one-semester senior project for a double major, I really prefer History's two-semester format. Two-semesters allows you to separate the researching and writing phases and allows you to delve far deeper into a topic.",
    "You have to do it to graduate!",
    "Well, you're required to take it ... so yes, I recommend you graduate. That being said, some pointers:1) Try your hardest to get your 10 pages written before Thanksgiving. And go for 10 pages of writing, not an outline. You'll thank yourself later.2) Find an adviser who you can work well with.3) Don't be afraid to ask professors other than your adviser for advice!4) If you're going to be working in a foreign language, make sure it's one you're very comfortable with.",
    "This is a requirement for the History Major, but within the context of Yale generally, I would recommend being a History major and writing a senior essay because it enables you to explore an area of interest in depth.",
    "You have to take it if you are history major.",
    "It's the senior essay.",
    "Great experience!",
    "Yes really rewarding experience."
