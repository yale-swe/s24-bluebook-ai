    "This class is quite useful for its specific purpose and intended audience! It was also intresteting and fun!",
    "Great in-depth introduction to social theory. I understand the decision to focus on 3 authors only was a new development and I think it works very well.",
    "This is an essential course for any anthropology graduate student, even if it were not already required. The material overlaps well with 500-01 and was an important introduction into social theory."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge a lot! It gave me a theoretical foundation for my discipline and my own research, and a foundation for broader conversations in my field.",
    "The course provided a comprehensive background of the most influential theorists in social theory which is already proving useful in other classes.",
    "I can't really answer this at this point having only finished one semester, but I have already come across Weber, Marx, and Durkheim in several other academic contexts and over the course of my nascent research so I feel confident that this course provided me with a needed foundation for my future studies.",
    "As mentioned above, I cannot imagine an anthropology graduate program without this course. It was an absolutely essential introduction to social theory."
