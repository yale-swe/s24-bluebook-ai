    "It's a good upper level bio seminar. Interesting, but the grant is a lot of work.",
    "Excellent class. Craig Crews is a brilliant scientist, so it was great to have him as a professor and hear about his ideas. The class format is great: each week we discuss a couple of papers about a signaling pathway and a student gives a background presentation on the pathway discussed the following week. We also did these things called \"action items,\" which were basically interesting medical and scientific concepts that came up during discussion that students volunteered to talk about the following week after doing some research. My only complaint about the course was that there were so many action items that we sometimes spent the entire class period talking about them instead of discussing the papers. The paper discussions were helpful, but also not incredibly interesting: we basically went through the figures, which most people seemed to understand already. I think our time might have been better served assuming that people had read the papers and discussing how we might improve the experimental design, etc. The workload is light until the final grant proposal, which took a decent amount of time to do but was a great educational experience. Overall, an excellent class.",
    "Readings and discussion of primary literature on cell signaling, upper level science class, challenging final grant writing assignment; take if you need it or want to learn more about cell signaling in specific.",
    "As an MBB major, I've been quite disappointed in the format and content of many classes in the MCDB department. This class is different! Absolutely take it! It's a great class to learn about molecular signaling and a lot of the current experimental techniques in the field. The grant proposal was long, but a very fun assignment in my opinion. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "MCDB 42 is the best way to learn signaling, and a great way to learn how biochemistry is used to analyze complex intracellular phenomena. You'll become a facile reader of the primary literature and familiar with all or most the major pathways involved in development and disease. I highly recommend it.",
    "Ah take this! I'm pretty sure it'll be capped next year, so if you get in take it. Best class I've taken at Yale. Validating\/challenging simultaneously. It makes your science education feel worth it because you are only able to understand the papers with some background knowledge but still difficult. You have to be on top of your stuff. The grant takes SO long, but also quite fulfilling.",
    "Very good course but you should have a strong background in molecular biology and brush up on some signaling pathways. Readings can take a while but they're interesting!",
    "Fantastic class. Must take. Great way to fulfill the upper level MCDB requirement. Papers don't take long to read, and you can do them the night before\/day of. One presentation, one grant proposal, and one grant. Grant takes time to write, but if you're truly interested in biology, it doesn't feel like a chore. Basically all the positives of being a PI without actually wondering if you're going to receive the grant or go through graduate school.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Crews is a very engaging professor. Not only do you get to discuss current papers, you also get to talk to him about his own research and cutting edge research being done in Cell Biology. Our discussions were also very medically relevant. Crews is very interested in how basic science research can lead to drug development. Workload wise we went over two papers and two reviews a week. Everyone gave one 20 minute presentation on the next week's topic and at the end of the semester we all wrote a 12 page (single spaced) grant proposal. Other than the grant proposal the work was very manageable. Just make sure you start the grant early.",
    "Absolutely excellent course. Everyone with any interest research should take this class.",
    "Definitely highly recommended. This is how biology should be learned.Be prepared for the grant.",
    "I would recommend the course. The seminar setting ensures you will come out with more biology knowledge. Also, Professor Crews is a great professor! Just start writing the grant proposal (your final project for the class) early!",
    "It's a good-discussion based upper level bio seminar. Some people in the class just want to hear their own voice but I guess this is unavoidable. Overall, a positive experience though.",
    "A great MCDB seminar that gives an idea of what real researchers need to know about. Each class reviews one signaling pathway and we discussed papers related to that particular pathway. I really liked this seminar and recommend this class to biology majors interested in becoming a researcher.",
    "In my top 3 most influential, most important classes I've taken at Yale. This is the kind of class that makes me proud to go to Yale -- a small class with other highly motivated students and a professor who really cares about his students and his field. A real strength of this class is that you discuss methods in great detail (the section I tend to skip when reading papers). You build a theoretical science toolkit so that when you write the grant proposal at the end, it's not too bad. It's pretty fun, actually, to see that you've really learned a lot in this class. Crews really trains you to think logically and creatively about science. Also, he's very interesting and incredibly boss.",
    "Definitely recommend. Provides really valuable insight into the real scientific research experience that one rarely finds with lecture courses. It will also give you invaluable experience in writing a research proposal, which is huge for anyone looking to enter any realm of research in the future."
