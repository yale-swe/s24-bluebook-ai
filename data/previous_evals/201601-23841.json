    "Recommend.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN GET IN. the class is a 2 hour seminar - you spend the first hour learning about a particular watercolorist and you spend the second hour painting on some part of campus. homework each week is to paint a piece. you also have to write a 10 page paper about an influential watercolorist. Prof van doren is the man - he's so funny and a great teacher. painting is an amazing form of expression - you won't regret taking this class!",
    "Without a doubt if you get into this course you must take it. Professor Van Doren is the kindest, funniest, most helpful professor, and even if you have no art background at all you will develop semi-impressive skills in watercolor painting. Absolutely yes.",
    "If you get into this class you MUST take it. Hands down the best course at Yale. You'll take so much away from this, beyond just learning how to be artistic and watercolor. 100% recommend, no hesitations",
    "If there is one thing you do at Yale, take this course, or another painting, drawing, or similar visual art course. My only regret is that I waited until my senior spring to start playing with color.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in! It taught me so much not only about the history of watercolor but about different techniques, using colors, and seeing in a different way. Professor Van Doren is also an amazing teacher!",
    "Take it if you get in. Be prepared to work though.",
    "Yes! Especially if you've never taken an art class before. I cannot draw for my life, but taking watercolor allowed me to work on my sketch and painting techniques in a very low-stress, supportive setting. I loved getting to work with Professor Van Doren and getting to see my classmates' work. It's a ton of fun, unlike any other class I've taken at Yale. 10\/10 would recommend!",
    "Not enough painting. But it is a dope free way to paint if you want to sit through the lecture.",
    "Take this class!! It's a great opportunity to learn a new skill and take a much needed break from the class norm. The art history is also interesting. Watercolor is something I'll definitely continue doing as a hobby the future."
