    "Looking at the African diaspora in different ways and across different times through a book a week. Each person presents one week on a theme (which kind of coincides with chronology of the diaspora) and brings in readings of multiple authors engaged in the topic. Very positive experience",
    "I would recommend it for someone with either an existing background in African History of African American History, as some of the reading topics could be a little challenging for people with an existing background on some of the topics. That being said, the professors do a good job of guiding the discussion to their most fruitful ends."

    "This class exposed me to a much wider historiography than I would have otherwise been exposed to. Additionally, the way the paper was structured, as a deep dive into a particular week's reading, allowed for more specialized consideration of a topic. The class definitely gave me a wider array of knowledge to build on for future scholarship."
