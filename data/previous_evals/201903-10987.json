    "Reading theory \/ scholarly work alongside novels",
    "I had been somewhat familiar with Foucault and queer theory prior to taking the course, but I feel that the readings that specifically engaged with race, colonialism, and sexuality (especially around the varied historical developments of theories\/categories of sexuality) were mostly new information and were helpful for me. I was also grateful for the opportunity to engage with influential works of literature, and to engage these texts alongside readings in theory.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings and the insightful presentations led by my peers. I hadnt read most of the novels on the syllabus, and I had never read C. Riley Snorton, of whom I am a big fan now."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: looking at literature alongside theory, variety of topics, assignments that were useful for practicing writing\/presenting in different professional genres (book review, class presentations\/discussion-starting, review of special issues, final paper intended to be read aloud), discussion-based with student presentations, helpful and detailed feedback from the professor throughout the semester, professor very helpful in office hours Weaknesses: I would have liked to have seen more class time spent on theory, or in more explicitly applying the theory readings to the literary works. Sometimes this happened organically, but other times, it felt as though the theory readings and works of literature were discussed separately from each other. Also, I feel like the syllabus did not always feel connected from one week to the next (with one week building on the weeks that came before it), though I did appreciate that we were able to cover a variety of topics throughout the semester",
    "The pacing of the work was sometimes hard for me to keep up with but the presentations really helped. Writing a book review and a conference paper was really helpful; I had never written a book review before."
