   "comments": [
    "More of a lecture than a section but Professor Hurtado is brilliant and very helpful during office hours.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have any interest in Human Rights, Latin America, law, and media studies. This class offers so much to students interested in these areas!",
    "Yes! One of the best courses I have taken.",
    "PLSC 365 was an absolutely fantastic course, and I would definitely recommend. Professor Hurtado is an extremely caring and dedicated teacher who is both deeply passionate about Latin American transitional justice and invested in his students' success. Great class and professor, especially if you're interested in the legal mechanisms of truth commissions and supranational courts, or in histories of state-sanctioned denial.",
    "Media in Human Rights in Latin America is a class for someone who cares passionately about the region, whether that means having a personal connection to it or not, and someone who is interested in human rights. The class covers a survey of different countries (including Argentina, Peru, Colombia, El Salvador, and Brazil). We learned about human rights in Latin American through an interdisciplinary lens, including journalism, law, documentary film-making etc.",
    "Looks into prominent human rights violations in Latin America through the legal framework set up by the Inter-American human rights regime. Mechanisms of state denial of atrocities are used to explore phenomena like perpetration and impunity. Professor Hurtado is very knowledgeable with plenty of legal and journalistic experience and is really helpful in the researching process. The one downside to the course was that it wasn't really structured for much participation in class.",
    "Great seminar on an intriguing subject with an amazing teacher!! He spends all semester working with you on the final paper, so don't be intimidated by that!",
    "Lots of demanding reading, but overall worth it. You'll learn a lot about Latin America and human rights in general. If you're interested in the content, take it, but be prepared to work.",
    "TAKE IT!!! You'll learn so much!!",
    "This class discusses state perpetrated atrocities in Latin America by looking at specific case studies and understanding the mechanisms of the IACtHR to address issues in the national arena. This is a small lecture course where students make weekly presentations about specific Inter American court of Human Rights cases.",
    "This is a valuable class to learn about the greatly ignored history of Latin American in the last century. It's vital to understand the world today and will give you a newfound perspective. I would highly recommend this course if only for the value of its content.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are very interested in human rights in Latin America and do not mind learning it in a lecture-style format. The professor and a student presentation deliver the material each class.",
    "Without a doubt would recommend this class. Completely changed my perspective on Latin America and made it clear just how ignorant of the region's history and current events I really was. Over all, this class was a stimulating and rewarding experience."
