   "comments": [
    "This class was not oriented towards skills so much as learning how to think. In this class, I was exposed to new pedagogical methods and fields that I had never given any thought before. I read texts that altered my view of the role of art and art theory. I gave a LOT of thought to questions like: what is art? Why do you bother asking that? How have people theorized artistic practice throughout history? How effective are organizations and institutions in their various pedagogical methods and why? In my opinion, these are questions all people should grapple with and dwell on, and this class provided an excellent, open-ended forum to do so.",
    "Even though this course was very interesting, I don't feel like I really gained much new information from it. The readings were interesting, but not groundbreaking, and I think the discussion at times was repetitive. I did enjoy the structure of having students present on the readings each week. It made the space more collaborative.",
    "This class was more of a space that challenged us to think about different topics and philosophies than one that asked us to develop a new skill."

   "comments": [
    "It's very heavy on student contributions, coming from both presentations on the reading and in-class discussions. Both work very well, but sometimes I felt there could be a little more intentional direction of the class.",
    "Strengths: -truly a flexible seminar and teacherProfessor Ruth gives students the authority to drive discussion (given that they take the opportunity to do so and use it to have depthful discussions) -a wonderful blend of theory and practice -creative freedom allowed for student projects and in student-driven discussions -explored many teaching approaches in the course of one semesterand students reaped the varied benefits!! Weaknesses: -not much feedback on writing provided (though sometimes this made sense given the nature of the assignments)I think the course should remain a writing credit. Its allows for a unique writing style that is important but not explored in many other classes Ive taken.",
    "I really liked the presentation set up. I also liked having the reading responses every week, but I think it might be more beneficial if people were encouraged to respond to each other in the responses if they want, it might lead to better in-class discussions. Also, even though I enjoyed the freedom of the paper topics, including the final, it felt a little too vague at times."

   "comments": [
    "It's very good for a practical look at art in the goal of service, and I learned a lot of philosophy on the subject. However, a lot of the reading can be very dry, so just be prepared for that.",
    "I came into the class quite skepticalfeeling like the professor wasnt taking control of the class and that the students didnt have much to offer to the seemingly wildly open-ended discussions. I now feel that the class was one of the most important Ive ever taken. This course requires a tremendous amount of patience for the average yale undergraduate, who may not be used to professor Ruths pedagogical methods. That said, if you do the readings (do them! There arent that many), watch the documentaries, and engage in class discussions actively, this will be an incredibly valuable course for you. You will discuss questions like: what is art? Why does it matter? What are some theories of art and why should we care? How to we apply theoretically conversations to organizations and institutions in the present? The course beautifully blends theory with practice, and allows for creative freedom among the students in both their projects and in their ability to shape class discussions. Professor Ruth is open-minded, generous, and quite reasonable in his expectations and demeanor. Take the class!",
    "Only if they were really interested in the subject. The course is about art more broadly, not just music. There was a very odd group of students in the class too. Sometimes this can lead to very diverse, rich discussions, but in this case it just made communicating difficult. I think this was just more of the individuals in the class, not the class overall.",
    "Yes, TAKE THIS COURSE. This course absolutely blew my mind. Originally taken to be an easy class with a writing credit, this class completely exceeded my expectations. Not only was the material deeply philosophical and engaging, but Prof. Ruth was also an amazing instructor that continuously encouraged important and challenging dialogue about art and social justice. Take this class if you truly want to know how important of a role art can have in our society, because you're in for a ride.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! The course material is very interesting and the workload is light. This class is also the most discussion oriented class I've ever taken and the students are really able to engage with the material in a way that comes from their own experiences."
