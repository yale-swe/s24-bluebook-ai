   "comments": [
    "Really interesting and fun! Ben is an awesome teacher. Besides learning how to make good pictures using a digital SLR camera on manual settings, you spend a lot of time learning about functions in photoshop and get exposure to some great photographers of the past and present. Not a light time commitment, but the work is usually enjoyable. It's a great art class for a non-art major who is interested in doing something creative.",
    "Donaldson is brilliant. The class reflects that.",
    "We spend a few days discussing camera techniques and Photoshop techniques, and the rest of the time is spent looking at pictures from famous old photographers. Also, he expects you to take 100 pictures a week, but he didn't really check that. But it's good to have lots of practice. Same thing with working on photos on Photoshop outside the classroom...",
    "Absolutely take it! It's very fun and the skills you acquire will last you a lifetime. I took the class credit\/D and didn't have to stress out much about grades, and how much time you spend shooting\/printing would definitely be obvious during critiques, so don't just expect an easy A if you can't devote time to it. I would also recommend taking it with Ben Donaldson, he was very encouraging and inspiring. Plus all of your friends will love you because everyone looks nicer with an SLR.",
    "I wouldn't hesitate a second to take this class if you are interested in learning about photography and are willing to take the time to make as many photos as possible. The class is amazing if you make sure to spend enough time with it.",
    "You will learn a lot about how to take and print good digital photos. You will be able to recognize qualities that make a photo good--both compositionally and in terms of print quality. You will also learn a lot about the work of certain famous photographers."
