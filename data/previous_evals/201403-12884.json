    "Italian is an absolutely beautiful language and not a very hard one to learn (as opposed to Chinese or something). But what really made this course so great is that ANNA MARRA IS BY FAR THE BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE HAD AT YALE SO FAR. She is a genuinely kind person who truly cares about her students, and you can tell. She brought her passion and excitement every day to class and she instilled it in her students. Everyone in my class loved her, and she made learning a language, a pretty hard task, fun. TAKE THE CLASS WITH HER",
    "Best class at Yale so far. Such a fun course. you learn a lot in a very short amount of time so expect a lot of work but if you work diligently, you see results immediately (there are no curveball questions on exams etc.). If you get a chance, take the course with Professor Marra because she's amazing, helpful, supportive and really fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although it meets every day and there is a good amount of work involved, it is well worth it and I am so happy I decided to explore my interest in Italian.",
    "Having picked it up for fun as a junior, I can say that it was a lot of fun to get this kind of an introduction to it. It's a typical language-learning course, where you get a bunch of exercises and you have a lot of tests but it's really not overwhelming, especially if you are good about staying on top of the workbook stuff (that makes the tests easier since you don't have to cram as much!).",
    "An amazing language, involving a lot of homework but not that difficult.",
    "I would say it is an introductory language class that is very fun. It is difficult but it is much worth it.",
    "The basics of Italian language including essential vocabulary and verb conjugations. I would recommend as a starting point for aspiring Italian speakers.",
    "Italian 110 is a good, solid language class. Languages are a little more difficult in college than in high school. You have to learn a lot of material, but you do learn the language fairly quickly. I would advise you to, in general, stick with a language that you learned in high school, but if you want to learn a new one, Italian is a good one to pick up. It's lovely, fairly similar to Spanish, and the work is pretty light. Good course!"
