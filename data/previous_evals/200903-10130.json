    "GREAT SEMINAR. I would recommend it to students with the right interests. The research-methodology focus would deter me from recommending this to all.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course! The material is fascinating, plus, they serve free pizza!",
    "Fantastic course that offered everything I could have wanted from a graduate course. Unfortunately, there are limited slots available, so it might be better to split the class in future years to give everybody a chance to take it.This course is a must for anyone interested in economics, psychology, or any \"alternatives to rational choice\" material. The syllabus is first rate, and the discussions are better.",
    "The course leads from the very first theoretical beginnings of decision making to applied research today. It also links psychology to marketing. The course on the one hand a good introductory to marketing on the other hand a guide to applied psychology.It is very recommandable not only for those interested in decision making and marketing, but also for all those who plan on becoming scientists. The discussion among the professors are very fruitful as well as all the background information about the professors own studies.",
    "This is a superb course, probably the best I've taken. Lively conversation, great dialog among the professors, have much improved my ability to analyze work in judgment and decision making. Highly recommended."

   "comments": [
    "Fantastic course that offered everything I could have wanted from a graduate course.I was able to fully design a thesis-like project in the course with almost no additional outside time spent on it. The course is chocked full of fertile research ideas, providing both a foundation for the discipline and posing the interesting questions that motivate award-winning research.This course is a must for anyone interested in economics, psychology, or any \"alternatives to rational choice\" material. The syllabus is first rate, and the discussions are better.",
    "The course contributed greatly to my interest in the field. As I only had little background, I profited a lot from the large scope of studies discussed. The area of marketing is very new for me and due to the course my interest in it is greater than ever before.As I am not writing my dissertation now I cannot incorporate the knowledge I acquired, but I will do so in one way or another later in the future."
