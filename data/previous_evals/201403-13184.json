    "Definitely!",
    "Provides good history of the blues, jazz, hip hop. Also a great look at african-american poetry.",
    "Extremely interesting exploration between musical and literary modes of expression. Although slightly unclear at the beginning, as the course progressed I definitely began to understand the connections between AfAm music and literature. Prof Reed offered a great balance of musicians, literature, and critics. The course is still very much focused on the literature. Overall, a great class if you want an interesting perspective on AfAm literature. Also, musical knowledge\/ability is useful, but not majorly important. As long as you have the ability to listen, you'll be fine."
