   "comments": [
    "I learned about contemporary political science literature on bureaucracy and the current topics in the study of bureaucracy (oversight, delegation, local embededdness).",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the relationship between democracy and bureaucracy. I read many in depth papers and re-framed how I thought about government through the lens of the authors.",
    "Good broad introduction into how bureaucratic agencies function in a democratic statemostly in the US but some readings from elsewhere. Goes into legislative delegation, rule making, bureaucratic motivation, agency structure, regulatory capture, etc. Good mix of empirical studies into weekly readings (some game theory or statistics background is useful for those).",
    "Very illuminating course on the mechanisms of democratic bureaucracy",
    "This was the first class I have taken at Yale that focuses on the how of political science as well as the what. You read mostly empirical papers which in and of itself develops new skills, and then Turner does a good job of explaining the tensions and contradictions between different ways of seeing the bureaucracy.",
    "I learned how to critically consider the structure of a bureaucracy and its consequences of existing within a democracy.",
    "The most valuable thing I learned from Democracy and Bureaucracy was how to engage with dense, theoretical political science texts. It has helped tremendously with my job as an RA and has enabled me to manage my time much more effectively.",
    "I learned about the structure of the bureaucracy. I also learned about the problems caused by bureaucratic organization. As someone who has taken many poli sci courses, this class offered a new and interesting perspective on American government.",
    "The ability to closely read and analyze the arguments of complex, academic papers. This will be an invaluable skill in the future. Also, the ability to formulate arguments in discussion with class members. The level of conversation in this class was incredibly high which was awesome.",
    "I learned to read academic political science papers, and the interaction of the U.S. bureaucracy with congress.",
    "I learned more about the structure and function of bureaucracy in the US government (particularly the federal government)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The goal was to have a different student lead class each week, but students were not prepared to guide interesting discussions for two hours and I thought the conversation stagnated often. I think the class could be improved a lot if there were guiding questions for each week that got discussed, or if students were forced to come to class with substantive questions. I also thought that the optional background readings on the syllabus should be required as they set up the tension between democracy and bureaucracy most clearly, which was a theme that sometimes got buried during the semester.",
    "Strengths: Good group discussion, I liked the soft deadlines for the reading responses. Weaknesses: Very many long readings (but you can generally get what you need from the intros and conclusions)",
    "Strengths. It's a good intro course on the bureaucracy, which isn't often covered in courses on political institutions. The week on rule making was particularly interesting given how many regulations and policies are enacted through that process and it does a decently good job covering the arguments for and against the benefits of decision making by unelected bureaucrats within a democratic state. The rule making exercise was a good place for people to focus on a specific agency of interest in what was otherwise pretty broad coverage of a lot of topics related to bureaucracies. Weaknesses: without any game theory or statistics (which are not required) we didn't really delve into the methodology of the empirical studies we were reading, so results\/conclusions were taken as given; also the week on delegation could have used some articles or case law on non-delegation doctrine given that it is a huge issue in the courts right now.",
    "Practical outlook combined with theoretical frameworks make the course feel both poignant and rooted in traditions of political science. The readings may be challenging to those less experienced in econometrics.",
    "Reading load is quite a lot, but Turner is funny, understanding, and helpful in office hours. Sometimes it felt like the conversations across classes were very similar though.",
    "Best seminar Ive ever been in. More feedback on writing assignments as they are graded would be helpful.",
    "I think the assignments of the course are very well organized and well spaced out. The reading responses were helpful in synthesizing the information and the rulemaking assignment was fun. However, the readings can get somewhat dry and at times there is too much reading to really cover in a single class.",
    "strengths: great professor, great readings, great assignments weaknesses: none",
    "There was a lot of very dense reading, the course could be improved by cutting the reading load a little so more time could be spent digesting each.",
    "The readings were really interesting that's what made the class had value. Classtime was ok Professor Turner is really excited about the topic, which is awesome, but sometimes I felt our class discussion was a bit aimless and wasn't necessarily grounded in the readings and the theory of the literature. I think what was missing is structurewe had a tradition of having two students lead the class discussion, but I think this sometimes meant that those two students had done the reading really thoroughly while everyone else skimmed\/didn't read all of it, which led to an unbalanced discussion. I think if Professor Turner lectured more to give us a concrete overview of the field, that would help. We had reading responses but never received any feedback on our writing that I could find, besides the number saying our grade. I also read that previous iterations of this course were twice a week, and I think that would be a much better option than having a seminar once a week."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the minutia of the government and are thinking of going into the bureaucracy or the legislature then I highly recommend it. At times, the class was pretty depressing the more in depth we got into the inner workings of the government.",
    "If you have interest in the bureaucracy, yes, it will give you some understanding of how bureaucratic agencies\/agents fit (or don't fit) into democratic ideals of governance.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to students interested in the organizational and strategic aspects of governance and democracy.",
    "Only if you are okay with reading empirical studies. I found it useful, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.",
    "I would highly recommend it. Professor Turner is a fantastic, enthusiastic teacher who made class something to look forward to. A niche subject made very engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course. It approaches American government from an angle that most other poli sci classes don't explore, and Professor Turner is a very engaging instructor. I read more actual political science research papers in this class than I have in any other class and learning about the bureaucracy is very important to understanding government.",
    "Yes - amazing class.",
    "I haven't taken many other political science seminars, so I don't have many similar courses to compare this too. I'd say it's a pretty chill class but you have to be self motivated to learn about and care about the material. You can get away with not really engaging too much with the readings (which I would not recommendin essence, this class requires self discipline). We also didn't do that much rigorous writing. However, if you are interested in working in the justice department, DOE, or any other federal agency, then do take this class! Because that's what the material is all about."
