   "comments": [
    "Yes, great course! Professor Carreras is fantastic. You will learn lots of functional spanish vocabulary and about many aspects of medicine in Spanish. I honestly learned things that I have not learned about in English yet. The workload is also very manageable.",
    "YES! Like physiology in spanish!",
    "Recommend. Its a chill class and you take out what you put in.",
    "I recommend it. It's a great way to get an L5 done and if you even have a minor interest in medicine it's actually pretty interesting.",
    "I would recommend it as a class to get basic medical vocab down and not for grammar improvement or even that much speaking practice really.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in the material or professor.",
    "A great introduction to the medical profession and current events within that field.",
    "Spanish 225 is a pretty relaxed class and the workload is very manageable. I didn't find it as interesting as some of my other classes, but if you are interested in medicine, you'll probably find this class helpful.",
    "It was a good class with few major assessments, except weekly homework, which are actually good ways to practice Spanish. Not a lot of work and the lectures are generally interesting.It's a good fifth class and for me, helped me decide I really want to be a doctor. The professor is very knowledgeable about medicine.",
    "The class is very chill and it helps maintain your Spanish somewhat. Other than that, it isn't particularly useful. It is a great class to pad your schedule with something. The whole 9:00am thing gets old...really old...really quickly.",
    "Absolutely! Especially if you are looking for a Spanish class that isn't too intense. However, if you are looking to work on grammar try another course, because she expects you to know the basics.",
    "Spanish for the Medical Professions is a great course for someone wanting to get some exposure to medical terminology in Spanish. The course probably takes on too much in trying to be a broad introduction to medicine, in Spanish. Most of the class instruction was pretty formulaic in going through the definition, symptoms, diagnosis and treatments of many diseases, organizing them roughly according to medical specialty. Due to time constraints, we didn't really learn any particular thing in great detail. This semester, the class was very low stress due to the absence of any formal assessments.Honestly, this class was exactly what I needed this semester in terms of a low workload course that allowed me to get constant exposure to Spanish in a topic of personal interest to me. The moment of greatest learning was the oral presentation that each student must prepare at one point in the semester. I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an easy L5 Spanish class, and especially anyone desiring to work with Hispanics in medicine in the future.",
    "Yes",
    "Exactly how it sounds--A survey of medical information and vocabulary in spanish",
    "Yes! Great Spanish course! Not too much work but you definitely get to practice your Spanish. No tests and the final is a take home paper.",
    "Medical Spanish is an awesome and pretty chill class. The workload is very manageable and Professor Carreras is wonderful. I would definitely recommend this as a relaxed fifth class. I found the class to be very interesting, but I would warn anyone who isn't premed or interested in medicine that we spend most of each class talking in great detail about various diseases.",
    "This class is a great class to take as a fifth class, especially if you're interested in pursuing medicine in the future."
