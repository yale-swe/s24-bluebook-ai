    "Orgo Pollutants is a course that studies the chemistry behind common pollutants in the world. We study the ways in which pollutants work, spread, and are remediated. I would recommend this course to another student, more to work with Shimi than because of the actual course material.",
    "Mediocre class. Don't come into this class expecting to be blown away. Way too much chemistry, which makes sense because Shimon is a chemist, but I was hoping to learn a lot more qualitative information. Not a bad class all-in-all, but I would search elsewhere."
