    "This course taught me a lot about band diagram and defects, which are quite helpful for me.",
    "It supplemented my knowledge in EE, because I seemed to lack certain useful knowledge in EE after I got my bachelor's degree in physics.",
    "This course gave me a good background on electronic materials (semiconductors in particular) which is particularly helpful for my research. Coming from a chemistry background, my foundation in semiconductors was fairly weak, so thiswas a very good overview course to get me acquainted with the field.",
    "Most of the information I learned in this course is not directly applicable to my environmental engineering research, but a working knowledge of semiconductors will certainly be useful."
