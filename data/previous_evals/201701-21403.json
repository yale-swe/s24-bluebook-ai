    "I learned how to research for and write a compelling review for a variety of performing arts.",
    "I learned a lot about writing reviews - how to be concise and exciting and informative at the same time.",
    "I really improved my critical writing and critical thinking skills in this class, especially as it pertains to the performing arts. Professor Spillane really pushed me to think more and write better.",
    "This class helped me to develop a critical eye and exposed me to many genres I wasn't familiar or comfortable with before. It also helped clean up my writing to make it as concise and clear as possible, which will be helpful for all genres.",
    "I really did learn a lot about the style of criticism and how to write it, which was something I hadn't experienced before.",
    "My writing really improved by taking this course! I've never taken a class that actually focused on technique and thinking about form alongside content, so that was really great. I also gained a lot of practice and insight into critical writing, which I'd never done in any formal way before and really enjoyed. I feel much more comfortable discussing and engaging with the performing arts and everything we read and watched was super interesting."

   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course is that it is niche enough so students who take it are self-selecting and are predisposed to be interested and engaged. There are also amazing readings and compelling guests. This is a great course.",
    "I think the assignment load is perfect - you really learn how to write and revise reviews. Prof. Spillane offers such detailed edits, which I really appreciated. The reading list is also amazing - super enjoyable. I think the one weakness is the journal writing at the beginning of class - I didn't get that much out of it, and I never really had time to write anything thoughtful.",
    "Professor Spillane is so engaged and passionate and really addresses the students like fellow writers. The only possible weakness is the Saturday at 3 deadline was sometimes difficult, and I almost would have preferred everything due on Friday. But the quick turnaround is good practice for the journalistic lifestyle!",
    "Sometimes the focus was less on writing itself or individual growth in terms of the way the class was structured, but overall it is a phenomenal course!"

    "If you want to learn how to write a performing arts review, you should definitely take this course. Prof. Spillane has reviewed countless performances and shows, and she really knows how to do it well. She cares a ton about everyone in the class and about this topic. But don't be fooled: this course is not easy. Prof. Spillane calls it boot camp, and that is an apt description. You read many reviews and essay for each class, and there is almost always a deadline on Saturday at 3 pm (to better simulate what writing real reviews is like). Still, if you are invested and have the time, this class is amazing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this. This was my first time doing creative nonfiction, and I loved it. The articles you read are so, so good, and you receive a ton of feedback from Prof. Spillane throughout the semester. Guest visits are really fun as well!",
    "Amazing class that anyone interested in writing and\/or the performing arts should definitely consider! Professor Spillane is amazing and will push you to write better all semester. The workload is manageable, and the reading is pretty light. I had a great time in this class and am a much better writer because of it!",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! SPILLANE IS AMAZING AND THE SYLLABUS IS SUPER INTERESTING!",
    "I loved this class! Professor Spillane is so fun and gives excellent and detailed feedback on all of your writing, which is so helpful! I really feel like my writing improved a lot after taking this class. Also, everything you read and watch in this class is super interesting. Pretty much all of the readings were things that I would have been happy and excited to read on my own time, so getting to do it for class was great. The mixture of general discussions, guest speakers, and workshopping worked really well to keep things interesting and to keep everyone engaged. If you care about the performing arts at all, this is a class worth taking."
