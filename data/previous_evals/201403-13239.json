   "comments": [
    "Less work than 110. Tests are more focused on character writing. If you're taking this to finish off the foreign language requirement once and for all I wish you the best of luck!",
    "I think it is important to understand that this class is a very significant workload, but I would recommend it to someone who feels up to the challenge.",
    "Standard l3 class. Weekly tutorials take up time but are good for improving speaking.",
    "A well-paced Chinese class with a good balance between reading, writing, listening and speaking. However, in the typical Chinese teaching style, there was an excessive amount of memorization. We would spend most class periods memorizing texts that we would immediately forget. I felt like this had almost no positive impact on my learning of the language. It would have been much better had we stopped more often to learn the grammar structures or practice vocabulary.",
    "Class is pretty predictable. Compared to L1\/L2, I'd say it's less assigned work that you have to do on a daily basis, but they definitely expect you to be more independent in your learning. There are some idiosyncrasies that were really annoying (long tests, dumb homework assignments, bad textbook, to name a few) but overall it's a solid course. It doesn't hold your hand and consequently it gives you the skills necessary for future study in Chinese, whether that's a higher level class or just learning on your own."
