   "question_text": "How would you summarize AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 for a fellow student? Would you recommend AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's helpful to get a good grip on some of these fundamental math concepts for engineering students.",
    "survey of the most important results (for engineers) from wide variety of math fields. likely to be a lot of overlap with undergrad math classes.",
    "I actually feel that all textbooks used should have student solutions manuals available. To see a full discussion of odd-numbered problems, for example, highlights the mathematical thinking necessary to solve certain difficult problems. Certain mathematical techniques are not intuitive and to see a step-by-step anaysis of a solution helps tremendously. The answers in the back of the book do not accomplish the same goal.While solutions were available, they tended to be available right before exam. I tend to study a little bit every week so a solutions manual would have helped me review earlier in the semester and not during crunch time when so many other courses were holding exams as well.",
    "no unless one needs training in basic graduate math",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. Unfortunately, it is a requirement.",
    "The course is basically a refresher of all the mathematics done during undergrad. For most of us, we have seen the material before but we are not confident in the course material enough to pass the place-out exam. I would recommend this course just because it is a requirement, not if it is not required.",
    "I would only recommend it if their work requires a ton of advanced math. I can see how a lot of this would be valuable to some engineers, but it is not very applicable to my work.",
    "recommend for those who have some math background (more than calculus 1ab)",
    "Good intensive graduate level math.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend ENAS 500 to another student. It is a decent review of material one would have learned in undergrad, and it's a nice outline of the math that is necessary in engineering. However, so little new material is covered that, if you're a student who has trouble staying interested in an 'easy' class, you should probably try to take the more difficult class taught in Physics, as it certainly will keep you occupied more than this class will.",
    "Good class to take for math overview. Good reviews of old material, and good way to learn new material.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class and professor Van Tassel; He was extremely helpful and he prepared every class very well; I did learn a lot in this class.",
    "If you're missing some important area of engineering math (see syllabus) then take it.",
    "Maths is the basis of all engineering so yes!!!",
    "I believe I learned as much from reading the book as I did from going to class.",
    "I would not recommend it just for the fact that I can't imagine it would be helpful to anyone unless they're mathematically adept and looking for a review course.",
    "Yes, definitely! It's useful in all the branches of engineering fields. By the way it makes me understand some other courses I took in the semester much more easily.",
    "This course is a quick overview of most of undergraduate math. If you have not taken one of the subjects covered, it will seem very fast (for me, PDEs and Complex Analysis really whizzed by and were more difficult). It was very straightforward for the most part though.",
    "This is a required class for most engineers, so there is not much to talk about it. However, since there is an option of placing out from the class, and I could have exercised that option, I chose not to because I wanted to get a review of my undergraduate math. In that aspect the course is very well designed.",
    "Do not take this class! Unless you are very familiar with the subject and only want to take it to get a good grade.",
    "Good course with lots of review of important math concepts. Some of the later stuff becomes somewhat irrelevant but worth learning. Requires a lot of outside work to understand because it is taught so quickly.",
    "It was a good class to get everyone on the same page in terms of mathematics.",
    "Good. Yes, it is benefit for future use"

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a requirement. Also helps in my research interests now.",
    "The math methods course is good in that it makes sure that all engineering students have a common mathematical framework from which they can analyze problems they will encounter during their time at Yale.Not having taken the required core courses yet, however, makes it difficult to assess its application to my research and\/or other core courses.",
    "requirement",
    "Course material did not contribute much to my research for I am primarily an experimentalist and the mathematics I deal with is relatively simpler than the course's. Since most of the course material, I have already dealt with (in a much deeper fashion over the span of 4 years) during my undergraduate study, it did not deepen my insight in the subject by much.",
    "It did not contribute much to my research. I guess I now understand more about some advanced math that other engineers use, but unfortunately I won't use it at all.",
    "This course didn't much deepen my knowledge of my discipline, but it did remind me what tools I have in my toolbox, if you will. It served as a useful reminder of the math methods I can use to solve problems, which means I can then teach myself later when I need to know more advanced math.",
    "Very much! I think it is very necessary to take a math course like this to prepare for my graduate work. I would highly recommend to take it.",
    "Since the course mostly focused on deriving mathematical tools and juggling complicated functions, I certainly did learn much about these things. However, in my professional life, I will not need to develop new mathematical tools (mathematicians can do that) or juggle complicated functions (computers can do that). I would have liked to learn more about what the mathematical tools can be used for. Had the course been taught differently it would very likely have made a big contribution to my research and professional development.",
    "I feel that I really did not gain what I had hoped to from this class.",
    "I thought it definitely strengthened my command of the topics I had already seen, and did a fair job of introducing material I hadn't already seen. I doubt it will contribute significantly to my research, but nevertheless I found it worthwhile.",
    "Prepares me for the basic mathematical analyses I will need in modeling.",
    "Mathematics is essential for engineering. Understanding these concepts provides a foundation for applied research.",
    "It is very helpful."
