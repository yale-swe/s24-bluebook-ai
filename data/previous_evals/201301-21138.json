    "Definitely, no questions asked.",
    "I would say that it is a very thought-provoking sampling of German intellectual history on the subject of the philosophy of history. I would probably only recommend it to students who have an intense interest in this particular subject and in highly intellectual conversations. Not a general intellectual history course.",
    "If you're willing to put in the work and are interested in German Theory, then absolutely. I could not recommend anything better. It's incredibly focused though, so expect detail over breadth. Would be good to have a strong background in the subject before you focus on a 40 year period."
