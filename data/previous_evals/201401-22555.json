    "Knowledge of Homer is fundamental to Classics and I'm glad I took this course. I liked the focus on Hector instead of the usual \"greatest hits\" approach of Homer courses. Also I was happy that most of the class assignments overlapped with what the philology PhD students have on the reading list. My work for this course will be useful once again when I'm preparing for the Greek graduate translation exam. Finally: I'm enjoying the commentary project very much. It's useful writing style to learn especially for PhD students who may one day be publishing real commentaries.",
    "It deepened and expanded my general knowledge of Homeric epic and Homeric language, which is invaluable for me, as a student of ancient Greek language."
