   "comments": [
    "This class has improved my singing and performance so much. I came into it with a lot of experience in choral singing, but a fear of solo singing, and I have gained so much confidence over the past few months. Professor Lalli is such a wonderful and encouraging teacher. He knows exactly what to say to each person to help them improve and class with him is always a joy. The only complaint I might have is that we didn't get as much class\/private time to work on the details of each song as I would have liked.",
    "Absolutely take this class! The class is great, Professor Lalli is fun, and you will learn a lot about the specific style of music that you're performing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with any interest in singing. Professor Lalli can make anyone fall in love with any style of song. My only criticism is that it is not always entirely clear what is expected of students for any given week",
    "This class is great because it's once a week and doesn't have a ton of written work. However, that does NOT mean that it's an easy class. Preparing for each class requires learning song, meeting with the pianist outside of class time, working for hours on pronunciation, etc etc. It's a pretty significant chunk of time, but it's so incredibly worth it! You learn so much about your voice, about classical music, and about the history of certain writers and composers.",
    "MUSI 222 is a unique opportunity at Yale. You get to learn amazing songs for voice, and you sing for two great musicians-- Lalli who does voice, and Sara who is the accompanist. Class time is spent learning diction, studying composers, listening to recordings, and performing the songs that you have learned. I would recommend MUSI 222 to a fellow student who is interested in learning the classical repertoire and how to sing with classical technique. It is somewhat arduous to learn to sing in French and German, but it is entirely worth it if you have any desire to sing seriously as an adult."
