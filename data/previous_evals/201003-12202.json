    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Learning a new language is exciting and a skill completely different from the other classes you will take; it is a wonderful way to round out a schedule. Italian is entirely manageable and so much fun; it is a beautiful language and a great culture.",
    "TAKE IT! Italian is such a beautiful language, and having this class every morning is a great way to start your day. It does have a lot of work, but it's relatively easy, particularly if you keep up with it every night.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The professor was awesome and the course was a lot of fun. Italian is such a beautiful language and the Italian department at Yale is superb. Students should take advantage of it!",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian to another student. It is a very fun and interesting language and the class is not too hard. It moves at a good pace for beginners and I never felt too intimidated to speak up in class.",
    "Italian is an intense intro language course that requires work every day. Sometimes that gets tedious, but the class is really fun.",
    "Good course, not too difficult, but requires a good bit of regular studying outside of assigned work to really do well.",
    "This class is a ton of work. It's a rewarding class, but the workload is nearly impossible if you play a sport. I would recommend the course if you have background in spanish, or french. Note that this class is very fast paced, and if you fall behind it is difficult to adequately catch back up."
