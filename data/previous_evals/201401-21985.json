   "comments": [
    "I would take this course if you need it for the major. It's not a terrible requirement, and you'll do well if you attend the lecture and take good notes. But the material and course requirements really pile up toward the end of the semester.",
    "Yes, learn a ton. Great way to fulfill research methods requirement.",
    "Even if you are BA for Psych\/Neuro still take it! Having taken the class, I know feel like a Neuroscience major as opposed to just a Psych student taking a bunch of survey courses",
    "I loved this course. The first few weeks focus on neuroanatomy - you dissect sheep brains in several different planes and try to develop an understanding of the layout of the brain in 3D. You also learn about some basic experimental methods in neuroscience research\/the history of those methods' development. Next, there are a few weeks on electrophysiology, where you and a partner complete computer-simulated \"labs\" exploring properties of the action potential. After that, there are a few labs that combine electrophysiology and behavior, which involve earthworms, crayfish, etc. At the end of the course, you choose one set of data that you collected (or go back and collect more data) and write a final research paper about your methods and results. The class meets for 3 hours each week, and it's usually a one-hour lecture and 2-hour lab, or some variation on that. This format can get a little tedious, and sometimes I felt like I didn't totally understand the finer details of what we were doing in lab, but overall, I learned a lot and found the class very effective. Professor Donegan is wonderful. He is truly committed to helping his students develop a nuanced understanding of course topics and of the research process in general, and he offers tons of office hours where you can go over tests and lab reports and talk about your final paper. He is one of the kindest and most dedicated professors I've ever had at Yale. The best part about this class is that Professor Donegan doesn't just teach about research methods - he employs research methods as the primary means of learning fundamental neuroscience concepts. As a result, instead of just learning about action potentials the way you probably have in other psych classes, you make hypotheses about their properties and then revise those hypotheses based on the results you get in lab, until you come to a clear understanding. This really makes the concepts stick in your brain and drives them home on a deeper level than you'd get from just learning from a textbook.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, because you learn a lot about brain anatomy and electrophysiology. The tests are not too hard, as long as you understand the discussions in class. The lab reports are also extremely fair.",
    "If you are on the neuro track, you probably have to take tho course, but the class is one of the more enjoyable requirements in my opinion. Donegan is great, and you learn a lot.",
    "This was a really fantastic course that gave me valuable hands-on experience. Great for any psych neuro students.",
    "Three hour, once a week sessions can be long to sit through, but once you get to the experimental stuff (recording action potentials from earthworms, cockroaches, and crayfish) in the 2nd half of the semester, the class gets more interesting! The class consisted mostly (if not all) of psyc neuro majors fulfilling the research methods requirement.",
    "If you need it to complete a neurosci requirement, or if you're interested in seeing how action potential works in different organisms, take this class. It's interesting when you're in the lab, though the lectures tend to be a bit dry. You definitely learn a lot, though."
