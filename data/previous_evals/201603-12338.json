    "I believe we gain valuable skills in terms of materials characterization and synthesis. Although the scope of the course is very vastly to really say we became \"experts\"or gain deep knowledge in any particular topic, I believe it does gave us the opportunity to have a general idea on all of them, and for the ones that will be relevant to our research, know where and what to look for.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the Range of Knowledge included; Weakness: If some parts of the course content could be introduced in more details, it will be better.",
    "This course covers a lot of topics, but does not do a very good job of connecting them. A more continuous curriculum would greatly improve this course. For instance I found fit very odd that we discussed crystal lattices at the beginning of the course but didn't talk about the radius ratio rules until half way through the year. In addition, with only one exam it was difficult to measure how well I had mastered the material. Finally some of the slides were difficult to follow, particularly the ones on MOSFET.",
    "I believe part of this answer is explained in the textbook above but if i had to change anything from the course it will be to reduce a little bit the amount of examples used (but not by much since they are very illustrative) and spend a couple of more class hours on get a better understanding of the phenomena behind them.",
    "great professor, interesting material, well-organized",
    "Weakness: sometimes the professor focus too much on the details without letting us understand the big picture. Strength: the professor talked a lot about cutting- edge research.",
    "Some examples are hard to follow. I feel like it would be better if we could be provided with more background knowledge",
    "It was a great survey course about advanced materials science, and integrated both fundamental theory and current research well. It did feel very plug-and-chuggy though, and I wished that we had discussed conceptual topics more. The equation-based nature of the psets combined with the open-book exam format made me feel like I could pretend that I knew what was going on without really understanding everything."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, pretty useful class",
    "I believe this course gives a good overview of a lot of topics which is useful. It is on the student, however, to dive deeper.",
    "Yes if he is doing research that involves materials characterization and synthesis.",
    "yes, I really enjoyed learning about materials chemistry. I had no background in this field and I feel that I learned a lot from this course",
    "yes interesting material engaging",
    "It would be a great introduction course.",
    "If you're specifically interested in materials science, definitely take it. If you're just looking for an elective though and you don't like physics, you'll probably be bored and confused. It's heavily geared towards research applications (specifically materials structure, synthesis, characterization, and behavior), so if you're looking for a concept-based theoretical solid-state class this isn't it, but it's very useful. The grading is super lenient if you show up, complete the psets, and put in an existing amount of effort on the paper\/final, you'll definitely get a good grade.",
    "Decent course. It's a lot more focused on current research and advancements in materials chemistry, with a little bit of conceptual background. However, it still gives a pretty solid survey of general solid-state chemistry principles, and is probably a good course to have under your belt if you're at all interested in the field. Though it wasn't the broad overview of solid-state chemistry that I was hoping for, I now feel that I can go fill any gaps in my knowledge without a problem, and I have a general idea of where materials chemistry as a field is, which would have been a lot harder to figure out by myself. 8\/10 would take again."
