    "I work for the U.S. State Department, yet prior to this course I had little to know knowledge of the goings on in the Western Hemisphere in general and Latin America in particular. Now I feel as though I have a much better context in terms of not only the history of that region, but also my areas of expertise- the Middle East and East Asia.",
    "As noted above: broader exposure to and frank assessment of recent trends in Latin American historiography - specifically culturalist approaches to the history of power, politics, and imperialism."
