    "This class was a thrilling discussion of the most pressing foreign policy problems our country--and the world really--are facing today, with some of the people who have worked on them recently, including Secretary Kerry, and other wonderful Yale students. The class challenged some of the assumptions I had about what is important and how we should prioritize our many problems, and it helped me think about frameworks for developing policy. The latter is quite rare in a class!",
    "I developed a better understanding of what drove many of the key policy decisions of the last decade. I also now better grasp the nuance of negotiation and the myriad side issues which factor in.",
    "Practical understanding of how diplomacy and foreign policy operate on the ground. Broad introduction to a wide range of critical foreign policy issues and how one might approach handling them if in a leadership position for the government.",
    "It helped me to develop a holistic and creative view to understand global diplomacy.",
    "This class was extraordinary. There is no better opportunity to learn about the toolkit available to American diplomats.",
    "Understanding of history, foreign policy, the art of diplomacy and how international relations work in practice."

    "The set of the readings, the guests, Secretary Kerry, Frank, and Sona all made this class a wonderful experience. It was especially great to attend Secretary Kerry's conference on democracy at home and abroad. I loved the social gathering we had the final week; it would be great to have more of those!",
    "Secretary Kerry is incredibly personable. He was engaged in every class, despite his rigorous schedule, drove the discussion, and readily listened to and responded to each student's responses. The guests were well chosen and provided great insight.",
    "Although it would have been nice to devote slightly more time per class to open discussion, I learned so much from Secretary Kerry that I felt comfortable with the format. One suggestion is to ensure the guest speakers have adequate time to present and share their stories.",
    "This is the best course Ive taken at Yale - the level of exposure is absolutely amazing!",
    "It was the best class I have ever taken. If you get in, you must take it",
    "The small number of students made the class more engaging. The visiting lecturers added a lot of important information."

   "comments": [
    "Of course! This class is so unlike any other that Yale offers. It really is a privilege.",
    "Absolutely, Secretary Kerry is open and frank in his remarks but doesn't dominate the discussion. He is genuinely interested in what the class has to say and accepts constructive criticism.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who do not have a preference for structured learning.",
    "Strong yes. Invaluable learning experience to interact with a practitioner at the highest level. Extremely interdisciplinary course.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The class was a unique opportunity to learn from one of the most knowledgeable foreign policy experts in the country and it was a hugely eye-opening experience.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you get in, you must take it. Once in a lifetime opportunity.",
    "Yes",
    "Must-take course. Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn from a brilliant and dedicated statesman.",
    "Yes, the opportunity to learn from Secretary Kerry's experiences is a great one."
