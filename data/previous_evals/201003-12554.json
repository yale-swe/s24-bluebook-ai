   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would gladly recommend this class to anyone interested in improving his or her writing. Having come to the course from a reporting background, I found it very helpful to be able to take a step back and carefully craft my ideas and language in order to make my writing more confident and, in general, stronger.",
    "A great class that will have you reading narrative non-fiction in a different and more nuanced way and will help you produce three really strong pieces for your own portfolio, student publication, or professional publication. Going to class with Prof. Strebeigh every week is just a total blast, and you'll hopefully get to know your classmates better as well. If you can get accepted, take it.",
    "TAKE IT. And take it EARLY -- I was a sophomore in the class and I think I got so much out of it because I was really just starting with this kind of writing. You feel a little over your head at first but before you know it you're right there with Professor Strebeigh. We built up to these little epiphanies every day in class and the course itself built us up to our own epiphanies about the craft of reporting and writing. I felt like I've probably learned morefrom this semester than I did with a whole year of student journalism under my belt. The only weakness I think is that there are sometimes long gaps where it's easy to fall behind and not do a lot of reporting. Professor Strebeigh is also a genuinely kind and supportive professor.",
    "Strebeigh is the architect of Yale's fantastic nonfiction writing sub-curriculum, and this course is the cornerstone. A must for anyone interested in journalism or writing. It will make you a better writer, a better reporter, and probably a better person, with a lot of fun along the way. The seminar, and all the work I did to prepare for it, was always the highlight of my week.",
    "This course is about how to write in a fundamental sense. The three assignments all require reporting, but I feel that the course's basic concepts (how to create voice, structure, and author) will help me write fiction or personal essays as well. The course is highly recommended. The reading list on its own is enough reason to take the course. Prof. Strebeigh is devoted to his students and teaches with energy, and I felt every class taught me something more about writing. I also found that thinking hard about how to turn facts in the world into a nonfictional story forced me to think hard in a way in which I would not think in any other course, and I am happy to have taken the class for that reason as well.",
    "English 454 is an intensive course in narrative nonfiction. Over the course of the term, you'll produce three pieces, two of them feature-length articles, and extensively revise all three with the help of your workshop and Strebeigh, who's incredibly brilliant and helpful. As with many writing workshops, you'll get out what you put in--and you'll probably put in a lot, because having Strebeigh take you as seriously as he does his students is extremely empowering. More structured, and more useful and teaching, than other writing workshops I've taken at Yale -- with Strebeigh, you'll closely analyze successful texts to extract tools to apply to your own writing.",
    "Absolutely take it if you get it. If you don't get it, keep applying. It's just a lot of fun---like an amazing high school English class. Strebeigh is not only a great teacher but also one of the few writing teachers at Yale who is encouraging rather than discouraging. The class atmosphere is relaxed and enthusiastic, but focused. The reading is a pleasure, but not required if it overwhelms. I took the class for credit, which I recommend if you have a heavy schedule, just because it takes some of the pressure off the deadlines (which Strebeigh is flexible about anyway). You'll want your work to be of good quality, but it's hard to write three great articles in one semester, so that's why taking it for credit can just make the class as fun as it really is. (And the work is fun to do!! You'll just want to be doing a lot of reporting.) Other kids in the class were also great; it becomes a bit of a community. It's just so worth it--if you are a journalist or enjoy writing, then your writing will grow in this class, and you will have fun.",
