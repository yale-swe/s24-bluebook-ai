   "comments": [
    "English 114 09 was very interesting but if you really want to improve your writing it will not be very useful",
    "Take it if you're interested in thinking about why monsters exist - this is not a place where you'll be talking about monsters in movies. Very philosophical.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking. You will have great discussions in class, and Professor Hurley will also help improve your writing.",
    "This class was one of the easier 114s. We only wrote three papers because Professor Hurley was so behind schedule. The readings would take an hour to do, but they weren't necessary to participate in the class discussions. I took this class because I wanted to feel comfortable writing papers in college. Unfortunately, my writing didn't improve. The only thing Ilearned was to support the quotes I put in my essays. I liked the class; I just wish I had learned something. The material was fun though, especially when we got to technological monsters.",
    "I would recommend this section if you are interested in the topic. The readings are very interesting and the discussions in the seminar are great and occasionally mind-blowing. However, the professor is very slow at grading and (partly due to the hurricane) falls behind on the syllabus too much and sort of crammed a lot of things into the last few weeks. The drawback is that we did not have enough time to do the final research paper step-by-step (like in other sections).",
    "Monsters is a great class where you learn to analyze different monsters from different perspectives. I really enjoyed the class and would definitely recommend it.",
    "English 114 09 is a very interesting course, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it is for everyone. The subject area is very specific, which I guess is how most 114 courses work. I realized that medieval literature is not necessarily appealing to me. I am more into renaissance and romantic lit, so it's more of a personal preference thing. This particular course, however, was extremely interesting and the general themes apply to everyone. If I could go back in time I would probably choose to take this course again.",
    "English 114 is a challenging class; you have to prepare for every meeting. It is a great class because you learn how to write a research paper about a subject that you choose (and are most likely interested in). Because of this, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because the material was extremely interesting and the course itself was very enjoyable.",
    "The course was an interesting take on monsters and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to take a writing seminar to improve their research paper writing."
