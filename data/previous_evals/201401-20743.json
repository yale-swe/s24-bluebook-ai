   "comments": [
    "Overall interesting material if only it were presented in a coherent\/competent way. Paulo spent every class going on incoherent rants about all the class material, never pausing for feedback or questions. They seemed to be extemporized rants about whatever he wanted to talk about, which included a lot of useless although sort of amusing anecdotes that revealed his quirks. He was genial, just a little bumbling. Other than that, the work was easy. Section was the most helpful thing. Go for it if you don't actually want to learn Spanish.",
    "Decent class, not well organized, not too much work. I would recommend it if you like lectures.",
    "Fun class, interesting class. Definitely worth taking.",
    "This class provides a very interesting introduction to different aspect of cultures of Latin America. A wide range of topics such as race, violence, and history are covered in a way that provides insights into a wide range of Latin American countries, including Brazil. The class also covers a variety of important Latin American authors and thinkers such as Cortazar, Rulfo and Bol\u00edvar. Although it is a very cursory view of culture in Latin America since the topic itself is very broad, it provides solid grounding with which to start gaining a greater understanding of Latin America. The readings can be a lot at times, but overall the workload is very manageable.",
    "SPAN 247 is an interesting L5 course, and probably one of the easier ones. It covers a lot of different areas of Latin American culture, which can be interesting, but also a little disjointed. There is a lot of reading, but they are not really assessed, aside from a few take-home assignments during the year. I would recommend this class to another student since it is probably less work than other L5 classes and the professor is great (really friendly, funny and engaging).",
    "It was a relatively chill class, however, I found it disorganized at times and that sort of made it boring for me. There isn't any detailed information about any particular culture, but Professor Moreira tries to encompass a range of topics that are common across Latin America.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class 100%. It will really make you reflect on past and contemporary Latin America and their current influence on society.",
    "Good class! Professor Moreira is fantastic, and super engaging. The readings for this class are tough, but if you focus and get 'em done, shouldn't take too much time. And trust me, doing the readings and paying attention in lecture is worth it - it will enhance your experience quite a bit. Assignments and deadlines were always a bit hazy (the class had to be restructured to fit a bigger-than-expected class size) but Moreira is responsive over email, so asking him for clarification is your best bet. The 3 take-home exams that comprise 65% of your final grade have a fair spread of questions, so if you've been doing the reading and paying attention in class, they'll be totally fine. A great class especially considering the other L5 Spanish options - recommend!",
    "Maybe, since the course was easy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish in a way that focuses on improvement through conversation and literature. It does not focus on technicalities, but rather a broader ability to use the language to communicate ideas and in-depth reflections. This is a great L5 course for those who have a true interest in Spanish or are less interested but need to get a credit - either way, Paulo is a great professor and the class is very enjoyable.",
    "This course is not a good introduction to Latin American cultures. It's poorly run and disorganized, assignments changed, and the way our grades were calculated kept changing. I did not feel in control of my grade at all. The TA was pretty harsh in grading, although she was very helpful in reviewing assignments for grammar before we handed it in. The readings were largely unnecessary, and though the professor was engaging, no one seemed engaged. I learned more about the cultures of Latin American by watching one of the movies he assigned than I did by attending the actual lecture. You're better off taking another L5 Spanish course that might have harder\/drier subject material, but that is more organized. I was really excited for this class but now I'm really disappointed.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It was a GREAT class to fulfill your L5 requirement. Although there was almost no oral component to the class, I felt as if my spanish skills were really being honed.",
    "The name of the course may be confusing, depending on one's understanding of the term \"culture\". This course is more so a general survey of Latin America in general, from an anthropological perspective that includes cultural history but also politics and sociology. This is one of those courses for which you get out of it what you put into it rather than what your grade indicates you got out of it. That is to say, one can easily get an A in this course without really engaging with the readings and actually experiencing the full breadth of the topics covered in the course."
