    "Playing and identifying major and minor scales, playing and identifying chords, text setting, interval identification and writing, and Roman numeral analysis.",
    "I took away an incredibly clear, although maybe basic, knowledge of music theory. As a vocalist with no formal music theory training, this class was exceptionally helpful and well-run."

    "My biggest critique is that the course description does not really fit the course. It says it is designed for anyone beginning music theory, but all of the students in my class had already a background in music. I think if there was someone who did not have experience they would have felt lost and like the course was moving too quickly.",
    "The small class size was a definite strength. I loved getting to know my classmates and the professor. I wish there were more regular assignments and graded practice assignments.",
    "I really like how small the classes are and how we can tailor the time spent on each section to the needs of the students. I think the textbook is not the best, it was barely used, and it cost $100."

    "This is a great course if you want to have some practical skills in music theory and composition. As a musician it helped my practice and I really enjoyed learning the thinking behind my intuition. However, if you don't have much experience in playing music, this class might seem like it moves too quickly and isn't super applicable to understanding how music works generally. good for me, might not be good for you.",
    "Yes, I would for it builds a great foundation on music and allows a new insight into an integral part of life.",
    "Yes! A great course to familiarize yourself with the most basic elements of music. Very helpful.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, whether they are a musician or not. I think being musically literate is very important, and this class is totally ideal for that.",
    "Yes!! You learn so much."
