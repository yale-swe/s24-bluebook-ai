   "comments": [
    "A history of the American West, focusing on the untold stories of women, immigrants and Native Americans and using a variety of primary sources.",
    "Great class that covers the history of the american frontier from the Columbian encounter through to the present day, with a focus on art and cultural interaction. I highly recomend it.",
    "Yes, but it ends up being a lot of work. The readings are average for history courses--it's the ID's that will sink you. Especially for the second half of the course, they're pretty off-beat.",
    "Professor Faragher is an amazing lecturer, and the textbook he's written for the course is outstanding. It will burst every myth of the American West, so get ready to leave your preconceptions at the door.",
    "It's a lot of work (term paper, midterm and final, and lots of reading), so it wasn't the funnest class to take Credit\/D\/Fail. But the material is really interesting, engaging, and enjoyable if you've got the time. And the opportunity to research at the Beinecke is a unique and fun experience. Professor Faragher is an engaging and well-versed lecturer (when he can get his slides to work!), and working from images is an interesting and different way to approach history. I'd recommend this class.",
    "A deceptively tough class. Not much assigned work but to succeed on the tests a lot of studying is necessary.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's a great history of cowboys, the Dust Bowl, \"western\" culture, and all that cool stuff, but Professor Faragher also incorporates a lot of art and film and literature into the course. The class is a lot of fun, really interesting, and you really learn a lot, even if you think you already know a lot about the American West.",
    "This class was excellent! I would highly recommend it. There's weekly reading, and while a few of the books are large, most weeks have very manageable textbook readings. The textbook itself is lively and a great read. Some of the books you read are classics (such as The Grapes of Wrath), while others are somewhat less knownbut EXTREMELY enjoyable. Professor Faragher's lectures were wonderful. The course focuses a lot on images. Overall, it's a very fair course: a lot of work, but you get out what you put in. The exams require a lot of memorization of names, dates, etc, but you get a study sheet in advance so that there are no surprises. Be prepared to work hard, but be prepared to get a lot out of it. The essay assignment is really broad, and lets you do anything you want with primary source material. At times, some of the themes of the course can get a little repetitive, but not enough to detract from the overall value of the course. Shop it to see if you enjoy Faragher's lecture style, and if you do, take it! Catherine McNeur was a simply lovely TA.",
    "I loved this class. It was really interesting and completely broadens your perspective about the West and about American history at large. Professor Faragher combines art and history in a really great way that provides a context for the mythical representations of the west in cultural imagination. There's a lot of reading some weeks, but when there is, it's usually novels or stuff you (maybe just me) want to read. He includes a lot of groups that are traditionally left out of our heroic cultural narrative about the West and its destiny. Great class!",
    "The American West is a course that covers the history of the American West, from first contact all the way to almost-present-day. It follows the changing frontier across the continent. The course reading load isn't light, but it's not too heavy either. The exams can be difficult, especially as you need to memorize the dates and artists for a lot of images, as well as a lot of other IDs, so it can be cumbersome. But the lectures are good and the reading is good and so I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about the *real* history of the American West.",
    "History 141 explores the role of exploration and the concept of the West in American history. I would absolutely recommend it to any student, as it was one of the best humanities lecture courses I have taken at Yale--if I had taken this class as a freshman, I'd probably be a history major.",
    "Good course. Be prepared to memorize a lot of art and ID's. Also, the paper is primary source research, which is fun but more difficult than standard lecture papers.",
    "This is a great course for those interested in the West, which included all of America at one time or other. Professor Faragher is wonderful. He pays a lot of attention to the ironies and nuances that make history interesting. The course focuses a lot on visual history and artwork, so be prepared for that.",
    "Overview of the idea of the \"west\" in American history as it expanded, with an eye towards minority and gender history. The emphasis on images and the vast number of id's you'll need to know makes for two very challenging exams, but the class is fantastic, as is the textbook and other readings. Faragher is incredible. Take it!",
    "Definitely take the course. Taught me to study history in a different way. Very reasonable course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Not only will it change the way you think about the American West, but it will change the way you think about visual sources in history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It tells an important story that is often overlooked in the history of our country.",
    "Fairly engaging lecture, really interesting material, primary source readings are mediocre but on the whole you can get away with not really reading. Professor Faragher is really cool. Exams are kind of rough, but Faragher gives you a review sheet so you can just memorize the material (there's a lot of it though).",
    "A great way to get introduced to the American West. The class will teach you new things, and correct some ideas you had long held as wrong. The work is there but not overwhelming. Tests can be difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It gives another view of the American West that I had never considered before and opened my eyes to new ways of evaluating primary evidence. Professor Faragher was wonderful, and his lectures were always captivating and insightful. This course also encouraged me to use the Beinecke Rare Books Library, which I had never used before. The only minor drawback to this course is that it takes a lot of time and a lot of work to memorize images and dates for the two tests. The reading is great, though, and well worth your time!",
    "I would recommend it. It's an image based history course that will allow you to understand the West in a way you couldn't get from any other class. Excellent.",
    "It's a class that looks at the history of the American West, from the time of the Spanish conquistadors to the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in the 1980s, looking at cultural, social, and political factors. The lectures are focused primarily around images, most of which come straight from the collection at Beinecke. I would recommend the class to someone who is interested in these subjects, because the stuff can really be a lot of fun.",
    "good class. hard. lots of details to memorize, dates etc. too progressive and negative on the whole. not sure if i would recommend it.",
    "I loved this class. Probably my favorite history class. Faragher gives great, atmospheric lectures. He addresses fascinating issues like our ideas about the west, cowboys, outlaws, etc. The paper is a lot of fun; you work with primary sources at the Beinecke. Reading is light and is often primary sources that are interesting. Tests require a ton of memorization, including images, like the history of art people are used to. But totally worth it, you learn so much.",
    "Great overview of American history from a new perspective. Would recommend it. Tests are a bit much to study for though.",
    "Really good and interesting course - a fun and somewhat unusual perspective on American history. Good readings, good lecture, and not too much work, but be aware that the course has a heavy emphasis on visual sources and so lectures can get a bit hung up on artists at the expense of larger issues. Even if that's not your thing, though, I still definitely recommend the course as one of the better history lectures I've taken.",
    "This is a course that details the history of the American West. It focuses on using images as primary sources to tell the history of the West, both objective facts and also to illustrate how events were perceived at the time.I really enjoyed this class, TAKE IT! I was never someone who really enjoyed American history but this course is fascinating. You will learn a lot, but also enjoy the lectures and the textbook.The reading assignments are generally very manageable, and you have plenty of time to work on the final paper. I found the midterm very difficult, but it is possible to do well on both the final and midterm if you spend enough time studying. Do not leave studying for this exam until the last minute! I took this class Cr\/D\/F and it was much less stressful because of that."
