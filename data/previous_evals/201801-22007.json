   "comments": [
    "I learned all about spanish literature",
    "I left the class with a new definition of culture and a deeper understanding about my own culture. I loved learning about Latin American culture through works produced by Latin American authors.",
    "Throughout the course of this class, in addition to learning about different cultures in Latin America, I also learnt about the many meanings of the word \"culture.\" I was also exposed to a lot of new, exciting literature that I would not have read if not in this class.",
    "I was able to practice my Spanish and learn more about the different culturally significant elements of multiple Latin American countries.",
    "I have greatly improved my Spanish writing and gained an even greater appreciation for the cultures of Latin America and the authors who write about it.",
    "did it for the culture",
    "I improved my understanding of the Spanish language and its various cultures by reading and writing in Spanish.",
    "Concept of transculturation, short stories and poems by Latin American authors, various conceptions of culture.",
    "I really improved my comfortability with Spanish.",
    "I developed a better sense of the changes in Latin American literature over time and became familiar with the major works",
    "I learned how to appreciate Spanish Literature.",
    "I learned how to close read Spanish texts and paraphrase them to fully understand the ideas discussed. Also, how to look cultures from different perspectives and the many components that make up a culture",
    "I learned about cultures through reading essays, poems, short stories, and myths pertaining to the topics discussed.",
    "Since this is essentially a lit class, I learned a lot about very specific topics from different cultures--whatever the reading was about it what I learned.",
    "Insight on cultures from various parts of Latin America which challenged my previous perspectives.",
    "In this class I learned how to read and write on complex topics in latinamerican culture.",
    "I learned so much about Latin American in this course. From cultures from Cuba, Peru, Mxico and the words associated with them I learned how to truly appreciate the diversity in Latin America.",
    "I learned a lot about the cultures of Latin America. Largely overlooked by popular study of humanities, this region of the world has a rich culture that provides an interesting model from which to base a broader study of cultural patterns. More than just learning about the specific cultures (which we did to a great extent), we learned how cultures transition, evolve, and combine. We learned how to look at culture in an inclusive and understanding way and what important features of culture to notice.",
    "First of all, I certainly increased my fluency in Spanish and my understanding of complex written Spanish through the experience of reading the selected texts. I gained an appreciation for this literary canon that I had never seen before in my prior studies, and I was opened up to Latin American culture in a way that I never had in my history or Spanish classes in high school.",
    "You read a lot of spanish lit. You have to actually do the reading and pay attention in class to get anything out of it. Not a super hard course, but it is what you make of it. The prof is really kind though and definitely cares a lot about her subject.",
    "Learned about anthropology and connecting various kinds of primary sources. Also improved my Spanish reading and writing skills.",
    "A broad and fascinating introduction to Latin American cultures, which expanded my thoughts on culture itself",
    "I learned a great deal about Latin American literature and got a nice in-depth view of some of the most important cultural practices of the region. Additionally, I improved both my written and spoken Spanish.",
    "My knowledge of the Spanish language was expanded greatly while I learned about relevant and interesting aspects of Latin American cultures.",
    "the best part of this course was the chance to read so many different texts that dealt with different ideas about culture in different contexts. In that regard, I think my reading skills improved substantially.",
    "I developed a vast amount of knowledge through this course, including cultural histories from diverse regions of Latin America. The course is based in different kinds of literature, including essays, short stories, myths, and poems, which is helpful in improving language abilities. My complex reading abilities improved not only from these readings themselves, but also from the close readings we conducted in class.",
    "Through learning about the history and culture of selected Latin American countries, I practiced my Spanish communication skills and learned to better understand complicated writing in Spanish. This course emphasizes practical communication, comprehension, and the clear expression of ideas over perfect grammar.",
    "How to analyze texts word by word, not just in general as a whole, and to find the true meaning based on every single word that was included with a purpose."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe throw in some movies or something fun to take a break from the traditional powerpoint",
    "The strength of the class is that it is taught in Spanish. Usually when we think about Spanish class we think about learning the language itself, but this class was unique because it was learning and thinking in the language of Spanish. It is not a good class for improving Spanish.",
    "I don't think that the course had any weaknesses. The class was well-taught and the content was well-explained. Students received a lot of support in and outside of the classroom.",
    "I think the range of materials is good. I really enjoyed the days the Jose Ramon taught the class because he did a good job of adding context to the reading of the materials. Sometimes I did think we read a little too much in class and could have talked more about the meaning of the text. But that's more textual analysis and the class was more about the cultural context of the readings.",
    "The course is fantastic: the teacher is so kind and thoughtful, the material is easily understandable yet challenging and thought provoking, and the assignments are very manageable.",
    "This is really a great course. Maybe a microphone for Profesora Adorno would help, because sometimes her voice is so quiet it is hard to hear in a lecture hall.",
    "I really enjoyed learning from Professor Adorno and Jose Ramon, who are experts in this area of study.",
    "Readings are really fun; lectures consist mostly of students reading passages out loud from the course packet, which doesn't feel very useful",
    "Well organized, fun, reasonable workload. The class was too big for the voice projection of the professor.",
    "amazing professor",
    "The readings at the beginning of the course are not very interesting and are very dense, but the lectures are engaging. As long as people go to lecture they should be okay.",
    "This course is very interesting, and lectures are fun and seem reasonably laidback. The reading material is always reasonable lengths, and is usually pretty interesting. The study packets for the tests made the exams very fair. This course could be improved by perhaps giving examples of the essays or more guidance as to what the professor and TF is looking for.",
    "Solid class. Each reading was covered vey well in class",
    "N\/A",
    "This course is wonderfully constructed. The professor places great emphasis on student engagement and communicates the main idea of each lecture in a way that makes us understand.",
    "This course is incredibly well-taught due to the way that Profa Adorno always makes sure to explain all the readings in detail during class and opens office hours frequently to ensure student comprehension and to prevent any confusion that may arise.",
    "The readings and material of this course were great, however it was presented often in a bit of a dry fashion. I would have liked to see something other than just reading the text and then going over it in class, but given the size of the class I see why that might not work.",
    "The strengths of this class were in its reading content and in its professor\/teaching. Profesora Adorno and Jose Ramon both were extremely knowledgeable and always understood the topics they were discussing. They showed a passion for the subject that they transferred to us. I really appreciated the complexity of the texts we were reading, especially as they got more and more nuanced in their themes as the semester progressed. I think the only real slight weakness of the course was that, with the large size of the class, it was sometimes difficult to participate orally, but this did not really hinder learning.",
    "very relaxed course. I don't like the lecture style discussion because it is so easy to just not pay attention. The class could be improved by not being a huge lecture.",
    "Strengths were that it provided a way of practicing language in an applied setting, which made it more engaging. No real weakness.",
    "Strengths - lectures are interesting, readings are a good length and interesting Weaknesses - the tests could be more interpretive and less focused on wrote memorization",
    "The strength of this course is Prof. Adorno. She's very lovely, and cares a lot about getting to know everyone in the class despite its large size. A weakness is the lack of speaking in the class, which I suppose is a given because the class is a lecture.",
    "The strength of this course is its professor. Professor Adorno does an incredible job bringing the literature we read to life and connecting it to broader cultural trends. She looks out for her students and roots for each of them. The only weakness of this course was that, at times, we got stuck in the readings; that is, we focused so much on individual pieces of literature that we became alienated from broader cultural ideas.",
    "I wish that there were sections for this course because I felt that there weren't enough opportunities to practice Spanish speaking skills. Texts that we were read we interesting.",
    "I like the practical approach that this course takes to language learning, emphasizing comprehension and clear communication over perfect grammar. The readings are well selected to expose the major issues and themes in the region without trying to cover too much. Participation in the lectures is important, and Prof. Adorno facilitates it impressively well given the large class size. At times, the readings felt unnecessarily long for their key message. The shift from exams to writing assignments halfway through the semester felt somewhat abrupt, though Prof. Adorno's helpfulness during office hours made the process easier.",
    "Although it was a big lecture course, Adorno still made it feel like a seminar, knowing everyone's name and calling on students during class to read the text, answer questions, or give their own insight."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Rolena is one of the best professors I have ever had.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to get an easy L5, but it is not a rewarding experience.",
    "This is a very good course. You're already supposed to have a high level of Spanish when entering this class. This means that what you take away from this class is more content and understanding of cultures of Latin America through a Latin American perspective (since all of the readings are in Spanish). It lets you view culture from different perspectives.",
    "Good Spanish class if you need your language credit. Does a good job of surveying many parts of Latin America. The tests and papers are fair and we went over the readings in class.",
    "I would very much recommend this course to the student who wants to continue to his or her Spanish but is nervous about making mistakes. Professor Adorno's class does a great job of letting you make those mistakes in a constructive and learning environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in getting survey exposure to Latin American culture and a preview of some of the great works of Latin America.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a great broad view of a range of cultures. Profesora Adorno works hard to make the class interactive.",
    "Definitely. This was a great class!",
    "I can't imagine that there is a better L5 course here at Yale. Prof. Adorno is amazingly sweet, selects great readings out of the Latin American canon, and cares much more about whether students understand ideas than whether they can spout of Spanish vocabulary. I learned a ton this semester without having to break my back over the Spanish readings and would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an L5 credit.",
    "I love this course. Prof. Rolena Adorno is very understanding and an amazing professor.",
    "Yes I think Prof Adorno is a great instructor and very patient and nice",
    "Yes, professor Adorno is passionate, loving, and funny.",
    "Yes, the course was interesting and I was able to read about other cultures in LatinAmerica.",
    "Yes, it is a L5 course which is interesting and reasonable. I came out of it knowing a lot about the cultures of Latin America. The tests were fair.",
    "Yeah! It's a little dull if you think about the repetitiveness of the class, but overall its not a bad class!",
    "Great opportunity to work on your Spanish while getting more cultured",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone, it is well-taught, interesting, and very rewarding.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Of course, this course satisfies the language requirements, but far more importantly, it was extremely interesting and intellectually stimulating. It is taught with care and passion and will definitely widen a student's cultural horizons.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in keeping up your spanish in a relaxed way this is a good course.",
    "Yes. It is a genuinely interesting course that would appeal to most Spanish-speakers.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Class was engaging and interesting.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone interested in improving their written and spoken dpanish and who has an interest in Latin American literature. Professor Adorno is kind and very knowledgeable and classes are enjoyable. It is interesting while not being too difficult.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. It's a good way to start L5 Spanish at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The course is rigorous, but not overwhelming, and Professor Adorno does so much to connect with her students. 10\/10.",
    "Yes, I think the content is really interesting and the professors were very strong.",
    "Yes! It's a great L5 course for anyone more interested in learning about history and culture in Spanish than practicing the particulars of the language. Prof. Adorno is engaging and extremely friendly, and she puts together a great syllabus. She has some specific expectations for assignments, but as long as you understand those, the assignments are manageable and very interesting.",
    "Yes take this class, it's a great L5 course to take and Adorno is a wonderful teacher."
