   "comments": [
    "Reaction mechanisms, stereochemistry, how chemistry can explain biology, a developing chemical intuition!",
    "I developed the skill to predict the outcomes of reaction schemes and understand the mechanisms behind these processes. I developed insights into the basis of the organic chemistry behind many useful medicines.",
    "I learned about electron movement and how it leads to resonance, acidity, polarity, stereochemistry, and various reactions in organic chemistry.",
    "how to think about organic synthesis reactions, determine various properties of a compound by looking at its structure, predicting major products, and a general intuition about reactions using electron pushing",
    "I learned a lot about stereochemistry, alkane\/alkene\/alcohol reactions, and other topics in organic chemistry.",
    "I learned a LOT about organic chemistry and different reactions.",
    "I learned the basics of Organic Chemistry and the beginnings of chemical synthesis.",
    "I learned the basic classes of organic reactions, how to represent and think about molecules, and how to gauge how electronic and steric effects will impact the physical and chemical properties of molecules.",
    "How to predict products and draw mechanisms for reactions.",
    "I learned about the organic synthesis of chemicals, the physical properties of chemicals, and some molecular orbital theory.",
    "The thinking and constant analysis that pervades organic chemistry... it blows my mind! There's so much foundation and conceptual framework that goes into a whole array of reactions and it's a ton of exciting stuff.",
    "A fundamental understanding of organic chemistry, including the importance of stereochemistry, alcohol, epoxide and ether reactions\/mechanism, and conformations.",
    "I learned a lot more about the concepts pertaining to Organic Chemistry and more about the field in general. I expanded my critical thinking and problem solving skills, and I learned to go past rote memorization.",
    "Through taking this course, I developed my understanding of why reactions occur, as well as how compounds will react. This class developed my problem solving skills and tested my intuition in a new way. This course opened my eyes to the vast number of reactions that organic chemists must know how to perform, and showed me how important some of these reactions can be in the field of health and medicine.",
    "This class introduces first-years to organic chemistry. The pace of the class starts off relatively slow, then picks up towards the end of the semester. This class gave the students insight into not just the textbook concepts but also industry applications as well as biological relevance.",
    "I gained an understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern the interactions between atoms and compounds used to form organic products.",
    "This course gave me a lot of insight into how my college courses are going to be like, and has thus prepared me accordingly.",
    "Literally organic chemistry. I knew very little orgo prior.",
    "Organic chemistry has opened my eyes to the incredibly complicated yet simplex world of science. I am inspired by how immensely simple molecules can be used as building blocks to build much larger macromolecules. I learned to better study efficiently by looking over notes carefully rather than re-reading the course textbook. Most importantly, I learned to never give up and of the value of remaining persistent.",
    "I gained a good step-by-step introduction to the basics of organic chemistry, as well as a general introduction to what taking very challenging courses at Yale is like.",
    "How to think about organic chemistry in a broader context",
    "I felt organic chemistry included a lot of problem solving and pattern recognition, especially with resonance, reaction mechanisms, and synthesis questions. We only covered a little bit of synthesis, but I think first semester prepared me with the mindset required for the copious amounts of synthesis that will be included in next semester. I did not expect organic chemistry to include so much analytical thinking. Initially, I thought it would be a lot of memorization and quantitative thinking, but we hardly dealt with numbers. Instead, there was a lot of memorization, but memorization of concepts and patterns that you had to apply and defend the application of. By this, I was pleasantly surprised.",
    "Organic chemistry intuition",
    "I learned many of the tools I require for second semester orgo but not only that, Professor Scott Miller taught the course in a manner to have us develop problem solving skills.",
    "By the end, I was able to apply my knowledge to understand current research papers.",
    "This class was my first exposure to organic chemistry. I believe that this class gave me a strong and thorough foundation for organic chemistry concepts including acidity and basicity, reaction mechanisms, stereochemistry, and the beginnings of synthesis.",
    "This course challenged me to develop problem solving skills in the context of organic chemistry. Not only did I learn the basic concepts and reactions that form the basis of organic chemistry but I also was able to find effective ways to study and prepare for new types of questions.",
    "Chemistry",
    "I learned how to predict the products of a reaction, and how different reactants could interact with each other. Arrow pushing was a very useful technique I learned.",
    "I feel that I gained valuable intuition on how organic chemistry reactions work.",
    "Apart from great knowledge in Chemistry, this course helped me to manage my time effectively and to answer questions in detail.",
    "Learned about a multitude of organic chemistry reactions and syntheses, as well as how to think in an organic chemistry mindset",
    "Critical thinking and problem solving from synthesis questions along with a comfortable base in the subject of organic chemistry.",
    "This course changed the way I think about chemistry. I learned how to be a problem-solver, look at things in a different way, and understand the physical world.",
    "Problem-solving and extrapolating information even if it wasnt directly taught. Learning to apply skills to understand different concepts. Basic organic chemistry- including acidity, chirality, stereochemistry, mechanisms etc.",
    "I developed knowledge about the fundamentals of organic chemistry and learned about various reactions that are used in synthetic organic chemistry. I also learned connections between concepts I had learned about in general chemistry and topics in organic chemistry.",
    "It was one of my most enjoyable classes learned to find information on my own to a certain extent and think critically about problems",
    "I feel that after the course, I have a really thorough introductory understanding of organic chemistry -- not just on a basic level, but on a deeper level of the actual reasons behind the phenomenon we observe.",
    "This course has taught me the fundamentals of organic chemistry and also how to become a better critical thinker.",
    "I learned a lot about organic chemistry itself, as well as many problem solving skills (etc. working backwards). I also developed some insights into effectively preparing for exams by learning to make use of all the extra-help sessions, such as peer tutoring and office hours.",
    "I developed a comprehensive ability to solve basic organic chemistry problems through 11 chapters of a 28 or so chapter textbook. This includes molecular orbital theory, alkene addition reactions, oxidation-reduction problems, and the beginning of synthesis of molecules. This information relates heavily to the corresponding CHEM222L course, and the lecture and lab built off each other. I also learned that organic chemistry is quite hard, and certainly requires both memorization of circumstances and an innate understanding of your situation, including rules and visualizing molecules in your head. A model kit is essential, will help your grade by the time you hit discussions on chirality and molecular rings. Finally, I understand electron-pushing formalism and mechanisms. I also believe I learned this information better than I would have in the sophomore level course-- the topic is covered with greater depth and exams are generally more difficult. However, this gets made up for by skipping general chemistry lab and a year of general chemistry.",
    "This course taught me so much! By the end of first semester you will learn the tools necessary to understand the basics of how synthesis reactions work in organic chemistry, including how to combine knowledge of reactants, solvents, and mechanisms to come up with efficient ways to create specific products. Miller was an excellent professor and taught us everything from resonance to acidity to SN\/E reaction mechanisms to molecular orbital theory at an advanced level in one short semester.",
    "I learned the basics of Organic Chemistry, how the electron pushing formalism works and the mechanisms of many simple chemical reactions.",
    "An understanding of a lot of organic chemistry reactions. The course was different from a lot of Stem courses in that it was very conceptual and based on intuition.",
    "Developed an intuition for predicting the outcome of some specified types of organic reactions, along with an understanding of the underlying fundamentals governing classes of molecules\/compounds, their respective reactions, and their chemical\/biological implications.",
    "I learned about chemical reactions, how organic chemicals interact; I learned more analytical skills and how learn and retain great amounts of information",
    "I feel more prepared for other science lecture courses at Yale, and the class has helped me decide I want to major in chemistry.",
    "I definitely developed a lot of skills in terms of organic chemistry. I feel like I have a better grasp of the concepts in terms of reactions, conformational analysis, etc. I also learned about study skills and just in general what it takes to be in a college class here.",
    "Through this course I have begun to build the intuition for the process of synthesizing compound from other compounds using various chemical processes.",
    "Many reactions about organic molecules and how to create molecules from starting materials. We built on basic concepts such as resonance in order to apply them to reactions and ultimately uses those singular reactions to synthesize chains of reactions to get end goals products.",
    "I learned a lot about specific reaction mechanisms and how they occur.",
    "I learned a basic introduction to organic chemistry, like properties of different groups as well as some mechanisms for reactions with alkanes & alkenes (halogen reactions, hydration reactions, hydrogenation reactions, radical reactions).",
    "Foundation of organic chemistry and reaction mechanisms",
    "I definitely got better at organic chemistry. I feel that a lot of the understanding I did come to gain though, was on my own or not in class and not in office hours."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength is how passionate the professor is. Unlike other orgo classes, this one focuses on understanding of reactions, instead of routine concepts like nomenclature (though it became a bit rushed with more memorization towards the end). While this admittedly makes the exams harder, it also makes them a lot more interesting. I wish we had been given more time on tests, though. Sometimes lecture felt a bit disorganized as well with notes scattered everywhere, though it definitely helps if you read the textbook beforehand.",
    "We cover all of the material very quickly, so it is an advanced version of an already difficult subject. Exams are designed to be difficult, but the weekly psets are relatively easy. So, students generally have a good understanding of the material, but only after going above and beyond assigned work (re-copying notes, going to office hours, doing many practice questions, etc). I think that it would be beneficial to have problem sets that are more similar to exams in difficulty, or to lower the difficulty of assessments.",
    "One strength is that it only met for 50 minutes three times a week and not any longer, as this is close to the maximum time one can pay attention to this material. I also liked how the lecture material correlated very nicely with the information in the textbook. The TAs, peer tutors, and Professor Miller were always available for help, which was very nice. The tests were challenging which made them somewhat hard to study for, but also very rewarding in the end.",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures, challenging yet intriguing content Weaknesses: I wish we had more opportunities for individual help",
    "Strength of the class is how much we learn. One weakness of the course is that it goes a bit fast to try to cover several topics.",
    "This course is very interesting to learn and keeps me engaged. This course can improve by taking more time going over the topics that are more challenging.",
    "The course should have provided more practice problems for the three tests. Three practice tests per in class test would have been helpful.",
    "There were many avenues available to get help on the course material. TA led sections, TF led office hours, and professor lead office hours were always helpful and abundant. Weaknesses of the course include poor communication of the grading curve and no feedback on problem sets.",
    "Scott Miller is very engaging in lecture and the material is interesting but the course moves along at a very fast pace and is definitely challenging.",
    "The curriculum of this course was not very organized. We would jump into a random topic, then come back and learn the foundations of that topic. That made learning all the material very confusing. (This problem was partially the textbook's fault, but also partially the professor's fault.)",
    "It's a little bit fast paced but it's also super engaging and interesting. There's a bit of a gap with the lectures and problem sets and readings, but strategically, the readings can be made as a primer for lecture material if you have the time. At that stage, I think that's the optimum way to take this class.",
    "Strength: professor was very knowledgable in the area and the class was very interesting. Tests were relatively challenging but grading was (for the most part) reasonable. Weakness: the professor would sometimes go on tangents, and while they were interesting, it was difficult to differentiate what to study for on the exams.",
    "Strengths: Professor Miller does a great job at posting and addressing really interesting journal articles about the relationship between class material and current research. This class is definitely difficult, but it is well-rewarding. Weaknesses: Discussion section wasn't always the most helpful and was very TA dependent.",
    "I think a major strength of the course is that many of the students are very passionate about the subject, and thus I was able to connect with many of the students who took the course. Another strength is that there is a clear correlation between lectures and the textbook, and thus there is plenty of supplemental material to assist learning. However, a weakness of this course is that students are not expected to have read the chapter covering the lecture BEFORE the lecture. I think this class would be improved if homework for the chapter was due right before the professor began lecturing on the subject.",
    "The strengths of this course were the textbook, the TAs, and the Professor. The weaknesses of this course is that sometimes you are tested on material that was not mentioned in lecture.",
    "The depth of the tests far exceeded the textbook. I would suggest changing to a more comprehensive text.",
    "It oftentimes felt as if Prof. Miller expected us to know a lot more than I did, and his class moved extremely quickly. He'd often just name-drop terms and expect us to know them, and I felt lost for a lot of the class.",
    "Weakness is that frequently the tests ask about material not directly covered in lecture and that frequently material only made available during office hours is present on tests.",
    "Prof. Miller was an incredible instructor. He was a mentor to all of us, and encouraged questions and group collaboration. His knowledge of organic chemistry is immensely vast, and it was simply inspiring to be able to see how Prof. Miller thinks when given a problem. I did not see any weaknesses in the course.",
    "it's super hard and requires a LOT of time, but it's well taught and interesting.",
    "The biggest weakness is that the problem sets mostly consisted of problems not directly related to the material covered in class and many of the problems were on topics we did not cover. The strength is the amount of resources available to students, the many opportunities to get your grade up, and the number of resources available to students.",
    "Do more examples of things in addition to teaching theory",
    "The most helpful aspects of this course were the TAs and peer tutors. They definitely affected my engagement with the course, and they were the most helpful resources for learning the material. The lectures were a little all over the place, but they more or less followed the textbook which was very helpful. In the future, I would suggest maybe forming a more structured syllabus. At the beginning of the year, I felt there was a lot of uncertainty about the class, and I think a structured syllabus would help those hesitant about taking the class in the first place. I would also maybe suggest revising the problem sets. The problem sets, to me, felt like busy work that didn't test\/challenge my understanding of the course material. Problem sets that prepared me for the exams would be much more helpful.",
    "Manageable workload Content of tests not specifically stated before",
    "The specific questions on the exams are incredibly difficult but the problem sets dont reflect this difficulty. Maybe an adjustment to the type of homework assigned?",
    "There were many different resources if you needed help with the material.",
    "I think this course was very well taught. The beginning of the course seemed very fast-paced but I was able to adjust over time. It may be helpful to gradually ease in to the course but I was very thankful for the many resources we had throughout.",
    "The exams given in this course were not always representative of the material taught. For example, the final exam included a question that was not addressed in class (and even contained a disclaimer saying that we would learn about this topic in the following semester). The midterms each contained at least one question that addressed topics not taught in class. I felt that it would be more fair if the tests given for a subject as challenging as organic chemistry allowed us to perform as best as we could given the material we had learned\/had access to.",
    "The course provided a strong guidance into a notoriously difficult subject. Professor Miller made the material interesting and gave real world examples about how the material is applicable. People say that he has too many anecdotes but I think theyre interesting.",
    "The strength was definitely the discussion section. Having TF's to break down concepts from class saved me multiple times. I do feel like the course was harder than it's sophomore counterpart, but I suppose that's to be expected if you voluntarily choose to take orgo as a freshman.",
    "The course has a very manageable and the tests are (usually) fair, but the homework problem sets sometimes don't feel relevant to the material. Often, the questions asked in the psets are not reflective of what will be asked on the exams.",
    "Strengths: does a good job of teaching why something occurs rather than just memorization Weaknesses: moves very quickly, as all teaching is done on the blackboard, it is difficult to go back and review material you didnt understand (more online teaching material would be awesome)",
    "The course was very interesting and the professor taught with genuine passion. Everything was communicated very effectively.",
    "The main strength of the course is the structure of the course itself (starting with review of general chemistry topics and using those to understand organic chemistry reactions and mechanisms).",
    "It was good a little more structure would be nice",
    "The class is really well organized and really well taught, and because it's first-years only, there's a sense of community even though it's a big lecture class. Be warned that orgo is really really difficult. I would say the biggest weakness of the course is that there's a sense sometimes that no matter how hard you study, you just won't be able to get the material that you'll be tested on. That being said, you'll be in the same boat as a lot of your peers, so it's all okay in the end.",
    "The review sections were very helpful as topics are sometimes skimmed by the lecture, or many mechanisms are presented that you may not actually need to know.",
    "The strengths of this course were the informative lectures, the TA's, and the lab course. The main weakness of this course was the ability to seek out extra help because all of the tutoring sessions were usually pretty busy.",
    "Some strengths of the courses involved the clear way in which lectures matched the textbook almost exactly in sequence and the mechanistic explanations offered by the textbook and the instructor. A weakness may be how fast we moved through material and how the material taught in lecture was sometimes a chapter ahead of the problem set we were assigned that week. Maybe this course could be improved by shifting the problem sets so that we would be required to do a chapter's problem set before rather than after the material was taught. Additionally, maybe extending class time by an additional 10-15min would make the class a little easier to follow as well as allow more time for questions at the end of a lecture.",
    "This course causes a lot of stress as about 500\/600 of its points come from 3 midterms and a final. The midterms are situated directly after break. While this may help some students (as Professor Miller thinks we will study during break), in reality it seriously damages procrastinators and leads to a hectic week back. I believe averages would be higher if exams were directly before break, as the material would be more fresh in our heads. I also think that testing students based on lectures close to exams is unwise-- while exam content generally sticks to 3 chapters and the lecture prior to the exam is not tested, Professor Miller did test us on relatively easy problems from a chapter he gave one lecture on prior to the exam. As we spent most of our time studying the other 3 chapters, the majority of the class missed those points and he had to give a make-up quiz to normalize the curve. Finally, the problem sets have a few long and difficult problems, but collaboration is allowed and they are not graded on correctness so this isn't the biggest deal. Thus, the weaknesses are mostly about test timing. In terms of strength, the course is set up to minimize weekly stress (at the expense of exam stress). Problem sets are graded on completion, not accuracy, and students can read answer keys to understand their mistakes. We also got extended HW weeks on test weeks-- we never had both due on the same day, even when other classes would have done so. We got extra days whether the chapter was long (in one case) or if we needed to study. Professor Miller also makes sections relatively open-ended, and TFs are left up to their own devices (and generally help students where they need it, not follow a curriculum). If you miss a section or two, you are not penalized, and you can sit in on others. Finally, tests are graded within two days, and while grades are not posted online, the turnaround time is RIDICULOUSLY fast. Finally, there are plenty of review sessions, barring the Monday and Tuesday after break (another disadvantage of the test after break model). Tutors, TFs, and Professor Miller hold frequent sessions and office hours. Professor Miller is kind and funny, and truly believes everyone can succeed in his class-- he gives help until they do. Thus, the strengths are about keeping students relaxed.",
    "Strengths: challenging and intellectually stimulating course, pushed my understanding of chemistry to a new level, urged me to truly comprehend and apply topics rather than simply memorize, super helpful TAs (thank you Jon you were amazing!!), plenty of review sessions\/resources Weaknesses: My understanding of all the individual topics we learned only came together by the end of the semester with synthesis reactions, where I had a sort of \"aha moment\" that never came to me previously. I wish we had understood the greater relevance of concepts like acidity or resonance in the moment, and had done more practice problems in class rather than just on psets, so that I could have better applied concepts while learning them rather than while studying them.",
    "Strengths: Very engaging subject matter, well organized, the 3 midterms give you a feel for your progress in the class. Weaknesses: The adjustment to the class from high school can be a little much at first",
    "This course was a challenge, even for someone as interested in chemistry as myself. However, it was enjoyable and engaging, and the resources available with regard to extra help and information were essential. The assigned material in the Loudon textbook and the material covered in class ran more or less parallel for the semester; however, there was some occasional ambiguity where the textbook covered material not discussed in class and vice versa.",
    "On exams not to have so many weird exceptions or to go over them in class so that when we see them on the exam we are not at a loss",
    "I dont think turning in the problem sets accomplished anything as they were only graded for completion; Id rather the practice problems be suggested practice, since that would help us develop more independence (which I think is part of why theres a class just for first years anyways?). The lectures were excellent; definitely a strength.",
    "Strengths: The material. I really did feel like what we did was very interesting. Professor Miller made sure to incorporate journal articles and tell us about how concepts were discovered. Those were some of my favorite class moments! I very much enjoyed learning about the process of how the field has advanced -- it really made me feel that we were learning relatively new concepts! Additionally, I liked the discussions we had regarding medication and other applications of organic molecules. Weaknesses: I feel like my test scores did not demonstrate my knowledge. I know I was not the only one who felt this. The average on our third test was 64%, which is pretty much failing. If that was the average, for me, that indicates something about the test\/teaching not lining up (as I know that many students worked and studied VERY hard to prepare).",
    "I felt this course was very rigorous and forced me to learn a lot in a short span of time, which I enjoyed, and I especially appreciated the help of the TAs throughout the semester. I also enjoyed how Professor Miller connected concepts we've learned in class to real life scenarios. I feel that the organization of the material could be improved as sometimes we would be tested on concepts we would not learn until much later.",
    "The TF\/TAs for the course were great, especially Jon. In section, you synthesize and apply the information you learned about in lecture and the textbook--you learn a lot from section. They really are there to help you succeed. Professor Miller was a great Chemistry professor in terms of knowledge but had troubling explaining concepts to undergraduates who were exposed to organic chemistry for the first time in their lives. Lectures facilitated learning, but they were very disorganized and I felt that many topics were just thrown at us in lecture. We were expected to understand the concepts perfectly after that. Because this course builds on itself, a lapse in knowledge from the lecture was almost detrimental and led a spiraling of mistakes later on. Professor Miller was a great resource and could have been even better with greater organization in lectures as well as the ability to \"dumb it down\" every once in a while. He also goes on tangents a lot. In terms of course workload, the problem sets are fair but it is more to get students to read the textbook than anything. If you're a student that does not learn through the textbook, this course may be very challenging.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course is the lecture format. Professor Miller essentially just repeats the textbook (almost word-for-word sometimes), and I would rather have a lecture that is fresh where the textbook supports the material in lecture (and not be the same).",
    "*Strengths:* Clearly a very knowledgeable, entertaining, and passionate professor; thoughtful exam questions that really made you think; grading of the tests was extremely fast, very impressive; section was helpful with TAs who actually did practice problems on the board that helped you learn the material. *Weaknesses:* The class was basically teach yourself the textbook, guess what might be on the exam, study that, then hope you can figure out what actually appears on the test. Little partial credit is given if you get a step wrong. Psets were assigned from the textbook (graded for completion and you get to drop onedefinitely positives), but on material that wasnt yet covered in class. Several problems on each pset appeared only on the pset (absent from class and on tests). It was totally on you to learn all the material from reading the textbook (dense and pretty good), do the problem set, and then *the next week* Professor Miller would *start* talking about the material on Monday for the pset you turned in the previous Friday. Not that it really mattered, since Millers lectures didnt foster understanding or ones ability to apply the material. There seemed to be no lesson plan. Professor Miller would sketch a few things covered in the previous weeks textbook chapter (read by us then, so we could do the homework), but really only present a few very specific reactions without explaining them in a way that would allow you to apply the principles more broadly (textbook did a good job of this). Often, half the class was spent on some byzantine reaction using some out-there reagents with a long, multistep mechanism that was technically an example of whatever the previous weeks textbook chapter title was, while the other half focused on a research publication only tangentially related. Sort of interesting but appropriate during class time only if (1) we actually did instructive problems during class, and had time left for this, or (2) on tests we didnt get random stuff never seen before, that could have been covered in class if we used the time effectively instead of reviewing publications. Every test included material we had totally never seen before, which was subsequently explained in class the following month, since it was actually three chapters ahead in the reading. I didnt understand the timing for those test questions (you want us to think 180 pages ahead??), when clearly Miller thought they were distinctive enough to give them explicit treatment during lectureweeks laterand the textbook thought to separate them by over a hundred pages of background. Very disappointing, as Professor Miller clearly is knowledgeable, so its a shame the lectures werent beneficial for understanding. Much of organic chemistry relies on pattern matching, so without doing problems to build intuition, youre SOL. Miller wrote all of the exams, but none of the homeworks (really boring, typical, lengthy textbook word problems with parts A through H), so we didnt practice on problems similar to those that would determine our grade. Exams had simple but interesting questions that challenged your knowledge, but without having prior practice in the methodology, you often got questions wrong, since many were exceptions to standard practice, and againnot much partial credit (class average was 64 on one test). Grades are entered as raw scores into canvas so Im hoping for some sympathy on the curve after I turn in this course review. On many of the practice exam problems, youd have little idea what was going on, go to a ton of review sessions, study the hell out of them, and then the actual exam was usually very different. When asked for additional practice problems in the style of the tests, Professor Millers suggested we Google practice problems, but you end up practicing random stuff, with no direction as to the exams coverage.",
    "Strength: rigor, helpfulness by TAs, certain grading policies Weaknesses: lectures were sometimes unhelpful; the disparity between exams and covered material is very large",
    "Personally, I thought the course went quite well, I just wish that the lectures and the content of the textbook lined up a bit more closely, as often, problem sets were covering content that had not been covered by the lectures. Additionally, it was sometimes unclear as to what parts of the textbook were relevant to the course, as there were times when content was covered in problem sets, but not in lectures or section, which left us a bit confused as to whether that knowledge was necessary. Additionally, there were times when the midterms included content that had not yet been covered by the course at the time, which was a bit frustrating.",
    "The professor goes on tangents and tells students irrelevant information HE finds interesting. More time spent on actually learning the mechanisms would have been time better spent as the time to cover such vast quantities of materials was already so limited."

    "This class is interesting and you will develop a \"chemical intuition\" by the end, but you will have to put in a lot of work to do so. It takes time to fully understand the lectures and textbook, especially if you had no previous exposure to organic chemistry. It really is like learning a foreign language. However, the professor is wonderful and so passionate about the field, which is inspiring. He cares a lot and does a great job of showing why what we learn is important.",
    "Yes; Professor Miller's enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. The lectures were engaging and explored the topics with great depth and clarity. Professor Miller always found ways to tie the material back to it's real-world applications and often included humorous anecdotes in his lectures. The tests were challenging extensions of the course material. The class as a whole was an engaging and enjoyable challenge",
    "If a student is very interested in the subject (particularly medicinal organic chemistry, since that is what many examples centered around), they should take this class. It is too much of a commitment to take \"just because\".",
    "Yes. If you are planning on taking organic chemistry, it's probably better to try tp skip gen chem and go right to orgo, so you can get ahead. This class was nice in that it allowed you to meet first years who are interested in the same things as you.",
    "Yes! Although it is a very challenging course, the content was extremely interesting and the professor is extremely knowledgable on the topic.",
    "Only take this class if you need to for a prereq or if you know you are REALLY, REALLY, REALLY interested in chemistry\/organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are thinking of pursuing the pre-med track because it's required. I also have a very good instructor and TA.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it was required. While I enjoy organic chemistry, the workload and time spent studying is not worth your time unless you need this class for your major.",
    "Nope, don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "If this student is interested in learning about organic chemistry, I would recommend this course. If the student is not interested in organic chemistry, I would discourage them from taking this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who interested in organic chemistry or has to take it to meet requirements. However, it is definitely challenging and requires a lot of time and effort.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it's a requirement. Or, I would recommend trying to get into the regular organic chemistry class, as those students tend to learn more and do better. For me, the course was just very confusing and I couldn't understand what I was doing wrong. I broke down into tears many times because of this class.",
    "Absolutely! If you're up for an intellectually stimulating course and you won't die with the initial struggle with understanding the workings, it's an absolutely fascinating subject area and it's taught quite well.",
    "Yes, I recommend to First-Years looking to accelerate into higher-level science courses.",
    "Yes. If you're at all interested in Organic Chemistry, take this class. It is great to have a class of just first-years, and I found it to be very collaborative.",
    "I would honestly recommend this course. Although there were times when the work felt tedious, by the end of the course I came to really enjoy the class. I really enjoy puzzles and problem solving, and came to discover that this class involves much more problem solving than I thought. For example, in one of the problems on our final, we were given a starting material A and a final B and had to write a multi-step synthesis reaction to get from A to B. Personally, I really enjoyed solving those types of problems and enjoyed the types of questions on tests (even if I wouldn't do as well as I hoped).",
    "Yes. Take this class. If you are pre-med, you need to take organic chemistry at some point...so take advantage of the opportunity to take it early with other first-years.",
    "Yes, this course is necessary for anyone considering studying in the life sciences or chemistry.",
    "Its necessary for many majors. If you like o chem, take it. Otherwise, probably not a great intro.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to an aspiring student in STEM. It is an eye-opener not only for those wishing to pursue organic chemistry as a career, but for any young scientist.",
    "I took it for pre-med, but honestly I learned a ton and everyone really struggled together. I wouldn't take it for fun, but it's interesting and a challenge for sure.",
    "Take this if you have to take it at some point and are a freshman. If you test into first-year orgo, do not take gen chem. The lab is horrible, whereas orgo lab is much more relaxed. CHEM 174 is hard, but not impossible.",
    "I would probably say take this class sophomore year instead",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to first-years who did well in advanced chemistry in high school. It might be a little intimidating and difficult at first, but the course was definitely worth it and manageable. For me, I felt a learned a lot through this course. I struggled at the start, but once I got into stride, I felt I was engaging much better with the material. I don't know what the other Chem alternatives are like, but I would say my experience in First-Year Orgo was overall positive.",
    "Yes. It is a challenging but rewarding course",
    "Sure I would, you have to be willing to put the work in but it's worth taking",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in chemistry. It was a very inspiring course.",
    "I would recommend most students to take the general organic chemistry course (CHEM 220) as opposed to taking CHEM 174 in their freshman year. This is because many students who take CHEM 174 have already been exposed to organic chemistry in high school, and have a leg up. In addition, I learned that CHEM 220 students are allowed to drop a midterm score, whereas CHEM 174 students are not. Thus, it became known that it is relatively easier to achieve a higher grade in CHEM 220 as opposed to CHEM 174.",
    "Yes. Its tough. Its catered too much to premeds. But its a good course",
    "Yes. Though the course was incredibly difficult, it'll be nice having it out of the way early. Also it's nice having the class be all freshman.",
    "Yes, I think that this class was an effective introduction into organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course if the other student in question is comfortable with constantly challenging themselves. This course is worthwhile and rewarding, but it isn't easy!",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone absolutely sure they wanted to pursue either chemistry or a related field as a major, does not suit someone well who only wants to explore chemistry",
    "I would recommend it, even though it was difficult. I think by the end of the term I had been able to look back at topics we studied and had a clear understanding of them, to the point where I could teach it to someone else. I would say if a student has the opportunity to test into this class, they should do it.",
    "Yes; Professor Miller completely changed how I engage with and think about chemistry. If you are at all interested in understanding chemistry or how the physical world works, you should absolutely take CHEM174.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It is a great alternative to the classic huge organic chemistry class that allows for more interactions with the professor.",
    "Yes, I think that there is a lot to be gained from taking this course. For many students that are considering pre-med, this course can help students decided whether they want to continue that track. Furthermore, I think that there was a strong community of students that was formed from this course.",
    "Yes definitely would recommend",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who's willing to take on a challenge -- it's difficult, but it'll be worth it in the end.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is genuinely interested in Organic Chemistry. The course is taught well; however, if you want to be able to succeed in this course you need to really enjoy what you're learning and practice it.",
    "Yes, although this course was incredibly difficult, it was rewarding to see the work pay off as I developed a greater understanding of organic chemistry. The plethora of extra-help sessions were paramount to understanding the material and making it less daunting.",
    "I would, but keep in mind this class is HARD. It is harder than sophomore organic chemistry, but it is good to bite the bullet in a few scenarios. If you have a major in which you can get acceleration credit out of organic chemistry and escape a year of general chemistry, TAKE THIS COURSE. I am an EEB major who needs chemistry through 1st semester orgo, and I have much more flexibility (3 semesters vs 1 semester, which is better?). Other examples include a friend in chemical engineering, who I believe needed 2 semesters of orgo and 1 of p-chem, and will be done with her requirements a year earlier than most of her peers. IMPORTANT: If you are placed into CHEM 163 or 167, I would cram for the placement test into 1st year orgo, as you are ineligible for the easier general chemistry track unless specifically noted. I didn't do chemistry in about a year but passed with about 8 hours of last-minute studying, and most everybody I have talked to has said that the material of those classes, while interesting, is difficult and doesn't really apply to the lab. If you are only taking orgo for a requirement and can do so to get out of general chemistry, do it. It will be hard but then you will be done. HOWEVER, if you are premed, I would advise talking to a DUS. Most med schools require a year of non-orgo, and if you take this class, that means doing p-chem. You don't want to do p-chem. It may be worth skipping this class in that scenario. If you can handle a particularly tough first semester and do not want to seriously consider chemistry, I would take orgo provided you have a strong chem background (a 5 on the AP or 2 years in HS). It is worth it. The only issue is that some students have already taken organic chemistry, so you may be going in at the lower end of the curve. Regardless, it is still possible to succeed on exams with just a bit more effort. Professor Miller is a joy. While you will often find yourself getting lost in his lectures, and his tangents sometimes do not really apply to his class (and are much harder than your textbook), he has lived an incredibly interesting life, and he is quick to relate questions in class to interesting anecdotes, jokes, and stories. He is truly a wonderful teacher, despite some confusing moments.",
    "YES - I know this course may seem daunting but it was so worth it! Though it may not be easy to get the best grade in this class, you learn so much as a freshman that it more than makes up for it. As a prospective bio major I did not think I would be able to have as great of a handle on chemistry as some of the other students in this course who were prospective chem majors or who had taken organic chem in high school already, but by the end of the semester, I felt confident in my understanding of the material and feel capable of pursuing higher level chemistry courses in the future. Content is actually very interesting if you choose to invest in it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was very very interesting and managed to have all the conceptual problems of general chemistry without any quantitative reasoning.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are passionate about chemistry, give 'er. If not, then you're in for some pain.",
    "Unless you are pre-med or really enjoy chemistry or looking for a tough challenging course do not take this class",
    "Yes, because its an interesting subject matter presented in a very clear format. I think all students in this class were set up for success.",
    "Yes, I would. I think you just need to be prepared to work very hard and understand that even when you pour hours and hours into the class, sometimes you won't do perfect on the exam. Focus on your learning and understanding and make an effort to ask questions right away when you don't understand something. This class was very stressful, but very interesting.",
    "Yes if they are very interested in the subject as this course requires a lot of focus and dedication to perform well.",
    "For some background, I took CHEM 174 because I wanted to explore Chemistry coming into Yale--it was an interest of mine from high school. After passing the placement exam, it also fit with my potential to be pre-med. If you know for sure or am leaning toward becoming a pre-med student, I think CHEM 174 is the right choice because support for a first year in orgo is known to be much better than support later on. However, if you were like me and wanted to explore Chemistry, the answer is it depends. You will never know if you'll enjoy Chemistry unless you try it and if it was that much of an interest, CHEM 174 is a great place to start. However, if you're going to take organic chemistry just for the sake of pride, I would not recommend this course because it is quite a challenge. Also, just because you passed the placement test does not mean you have to take organic chemistry.",
    "The most interesting part of this course is solving the problems that Prof. Miller gives on the exams. The lectures and problem sets tend to be the more tedious task. Being able to solve the complex problems that he gives you at the end of year (like retro-synthetic analysis) is the most rewarding part of the class.",
    "Yes",
    "No, I absolutely would not recommend this course. Its not that Miller is inherently a bad professor; hes just not good for this course. At least until he has more experience teaching it (this was his second timefirst was in 2015) and develops a course structure with lectures that actually help you learn and communicates what he wants you to know. The review sessions before exams were jam-packed with like 70\/85 of the students in the class as everyone was struggling to get some semblance of preparation. Id strongly recommend taking Organic 1 in the CHEM220 section with Ellman as he has been teaching this course for 10+ years, Ive heard great things about his lectures, and he gives you practice exams that are consistent and prepare you for the tests: 3 midterms mostly multiple choice so the answers are explicit and clear (unlike this course where when you make one small mistake on one mechanistic step write-in and end up getting like 8\/20 points on a question on a midterm worth 100 points) and you get to drop your lowest midterm (not the case with CHEM174). I feel like Miller would be a good professor for a higher-level synthetic chemistry course where you already have a good intuition for the material and its not 100% on him to teach you everything you need to know. Had this course been the CHEM418 Advanced Organic Chemistry course I believe it would have been a much better experience, since although the lecture order seemed to follow the Loudon textbook chapter titles (the textbook listed for this course), the content the course covered seemed like a much better fit for the Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part A textbook by Carey and Sundberg.",
    "Yes, but be careful of what other classes you are taking and how comfortable you are with chemistry in general.",
    "If you are STEM major and need to take it, then yes take it. Otherwise, don't."
