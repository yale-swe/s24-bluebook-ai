   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Professor Robinson! He is very knowledgeable about censorship, and is a genuinely nice, helpful person. There are only four short (~1500 words) papers, and the topics become increasingly broad, allowing you to focus on your own interests. The only downside is that the discussions can get repetitive after awhile, since there is only so much that can be said about censorship before you start rehashing the same arguments. However, I did not see this as a major downside. Professor Robinson always keeps the class humorous and enjoyable. Grading did not seem too harsh either. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I thought that this was a fairly good writing course. The professor definitely helps you strengthen your writing, especially by helping you focus on backing up your arguments with evidence. Having gone to a high school which didn't train me almost at all on how to write a college paper, this class was very helpful. The essays are engaging, as is the topic. The class waned a bit toward the middle, and I thought that the readings became less interesting and on topic. The readings are important to do during first quarter, but after that, they do not usually directly apply to the essays. Since there was little discussion of them in class, the readings don't necessarily always need to be done. All in all, I thought that it was a useful, not too stressful course. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants to improve their writing or needs a not too difficult writing credit.",
    "Definitely take this class. English 114 is an excellent class to prepare you for the kind of writing Yale classes expect. Censorship and the Arts in particular is an absolute delight \u00e2\u0080\u0093 opt for this section if you can! I found the topic to be relevant and stimulating. The readings are never too heavy (although they can get a bit long), and are always engaging. The class atmosphere is friendly and warm, mainly because Professor Timothy Robinson is one of the warmest and least pretentious people ever. He is extremely accommodating and approachable, and intensely witty! As for the papers - the four papers have equal weightage for the grade (as does class participation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is easy if you do the readings). Each paper is five pages long. The first paper is perhaps the most difficult and restrictive, but the remaining three allow you to be flexible. I was able to explore areas I was genuinely passionate about in all three papers. So, to sum up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this class teaches you to be a good writer, a fast and critical reader, and an efficient researcher. You will have to work hard in this class, but you will enjoy whatever you do immensely, and will definitely learn something at every step.",
    "Boring. Not helpful.",
    "English 114 with Professor Robinson is amazing. If you're going to take 114, definitely shop this class. Professor Robinson is seriously enlightening.",
    "Very good class! Take it! You won't regret it.",
    "My writing has improved a lot after taking this class. I would recommend it to anyone regardless of their major.",
    "A great class for writers of all abilities - I would recommend this class to everyone. As a science major, I wanted to take a writing class that would provide a solid foundation for the rest of my college writing, and this class definitely did that.",
    "English 114 18 is a freshman writing seminar that refines students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 critical thinking skills and writing through an examination of issues of censorship in both historical and contemporary contexts.I strongly recommend that all freshmen in Yale College take English 114 because this class exposes students to different styles of argumentative writing and sets the standard for the type of analytical writing expected by college professors. Furthermore, this course eases students into the process of writing college-level essays by having students write a rough draft for three of the four essays, and its workload is manageable. If you are considering taking this class with Prof. Robinson, make sure that the topic of censorship interests you and that you feel comfortable writing about it.",
    "This course was a great way to improve writing skills and learn to write persuasive and argumentative research papers. This is definitely an important skill and this class really worked solely on developing and honing that skill. I would recommend this course to another student because the information gained from the class is necessary and very interesting and Professor Robinson was a great professor who really cared about his students."
