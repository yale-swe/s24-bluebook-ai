   "comments": [
    "We do not spend time in class going over the homework so it is difficult to retain knowledge on what we learn.",
    "The course is great overall. I would perhaps incorporate speaking the language more in class.",
    "The major strength and weakness of this course are its lack of rigidity. On the one hand, this gives a lot of flexibility that lets us take fun and educational diversions from the prepared lesson plans. But, on the other hand, it sometimes causes us to waste time and learn less than we could. In general, I'm a bit disappointed that I learned much fewer new concepts this semester than I did last semester. Other strengths were the journal (it was good to practice, though \"daily\" might have been too much; maybe do it weekly?); the weekend homeworks (they were long, but they were actually pretty good reviews of content); and the increased amount of dictation. Other weaknesses are that we stopped having weekly quizzes near the end of the semester (they're great motivators to study) and that language table didn't feel very useful, in large part because we still don't know how to say much. Having activities like role play, Quizlet, or Kahoot! might add some fun and edification to the language tables. I'd also love it if the class was only conducted in Yoruba (like other language classes), though I know that that's unrealistic. Finally, I'd love to learn more linguistics; learning about morphology last semester was really eye-opening, and I was hoping we would learn more things like that this semester.",
    "Excessive homework that doesnt improve learning",
    "The course is very engaging and finds innovative ways to teach the material. The course does have a lot of busy work however.",
    "Strengths: teacher is charismatic and helps you when you need it. Also structures the class for the most part to the students needs."
