   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student as a \"greatest hits\" of medieval social history.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for any graduate student. This course offers an excellent opportunity to wrestle with some of the most difficult historiographical issues in medieval history while simultaneously offering exposure to the writings and ideas of many important historians of the Middle Ages.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student only if he or she had already taken a course or two in medieval history. This being my first medieval history course, I often felt behind, though I had done all the assigned reading, because my background knowledge was much more limited than that of my classmates.",
    "This course is a survey of medieval social history in which every major issue in the field is discussed for a week. Themes include social issues and social groups (peasants, jews, gender, kinsmen networks) and time periods (crisis of the 11th, 12th, and 14th centuries). I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in medieval society."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "As I focus on medieval social history, this course was extremely helpful in giving a broader overview of this topic and how scholars have approached it; this historiographical depth will add a great deal to my own dissertation research.",
    "My previous knowledge of medieval Europe has been largely through the lens of a specific perspective. This course offered me a far deeper engagement with the broader context of medieval society than I had ever previously had. As such, it served a crucial function in my development as a scholar. This course offered me the opportunity to explore topics that are of direct relevance to my research interests.",
    "Understanding of the historiography of social history is crucial to being a professor of medieval history.",
    "I feel much more familiar with terminology and basic historiography, and more comfortable in the research materials of the period.",
    "Not only was this course a survey of medieval history but it was also a survey of medieval historiography. I not only know more about the different periods of the era, but also about the questions traditionally asked about them. This is invaluable."
