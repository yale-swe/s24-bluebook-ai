    "I would recommend with caution. Only if you're very interested in the topic should you take it because it will cause you a few headaches for sure.",
    "Difficult, but interesting and valuable.",
    "It is a great course to get well acquainted with different fields of structural biology but is somewhat disorganized. The TFs make up for it though and help strengthen the course (Yagmur in particular).",
    "Structural pharmacology is a great course for a student interested in structural biology or pharmacology. The first third of the course provides an introduction to structural biology techniques, and then for the remainder of the course you are taught by a variety of PIs that use structural biology in their own research. I highly recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "It definitely opened my mind more to the possibilities of developing drugs using more basic research type questions and I will be more aware when going into my own research, but it was not directly related. It was also nice to get a more in depth review of lots of different proteins and systems, so I feel like it broadened my base knowledge which is useful for reading literature.",
    "It guided my decison process of what I want to focus my graduate studies on. On the long run, I was able to get well-rounded with the research of other professors.",
    "Because the course comprised of lectures from a variety of PIs that use structural biology in their research, this course greatly deepened by knowledge of the discipline. I am not yet sure the extent to which this course will contribute to my dissertation research directly; however, indirectly this course was extremely beneficial."
