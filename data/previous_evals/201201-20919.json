   "comments": [
    "No, I would not recommend this class unless you are not taking any other courses at the same time. It is too time consuming and not beneficial, especially if you have any tissue engineering knowledge at all.",
    "I would not recommend the course. It required a LOT of work but I did not learn anything new. I came out of the class with similar knowledge to what I went in with, except I had to endure months of work in between. The exams did not cover the concepts we were learning, instead they chose minute facts from middle-of-the-pack papers.",
    "The concept of the class is excellent, however, it is extremely poorly organized. This disorganization urgently needs to be changed.",
    "I would highly recommend it but explain it is an abstract course that hops around between the disciplines that compose it. I would caution them depending on the lecturer.",
    "Overview of tissue engineering. Good material present, but poor overall organization and lab component was very difficult. Could do without lab component for more in depth lectures, or more hands on lab to learn techniques. Advising and deadlines would help. Supplies were limited and needs to be more clear what could be used. Mike was an excellent TA who put in a lot of effort and was available to help. I would recommend the course if organization improves, lab is more structured and lectures updated to current state of knowledge. Important to make sure lectures are spread evenly, so final exam does not cover only 2 lectures as it did, so more focus on project could be done."

    "The course had some useful information, but I already knew much of it.",
    "Helpful in gaining knowledge of tissue engineering.",
    "Deepened knowledge significantly. Overall, excellent powerpoints and lectures\/papers. Will utilize knowledge in future. More of self-study. Presentations\/lab could use improvement"
