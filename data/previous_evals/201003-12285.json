    "Take this class. Anyone who wants to have any sort of handle on the Greek language needs this class. If you think you can really understand it without a basic knowledge of the phonetic concepts in this course, you're kidding yourself. Also, you get to read great poetry, and learn an entirely new way to look at literature, This class probably isn't like anything you've done before, so taking it, or Jay's Comparative Latin course could be a good breath of fresh air. Just be ready to put the work into the course and the benefits will become manifest almost immediately. Also, Jay is so awesome.",
    "I would summarize Ancient Greek 403 as a truly unique course. The primary and secondary readings are excellent, the lectures less so. Although Jay is extremely knowledgeable, he occasionally fails to convey his knowledge clearly.",
    "I would recommend this class or the corresponding Latin class to anyone who has a strong background in classics and is interested (or thinks they might be interested) in linguistics. I felt that it improved my understanding of Greek, VASTLY increased my knowledge and interest in historical linguistics, and made me a better and faster reader of both Greek and Latin.Strengths of this class included a good textbook, a clear structure for class sessions, and an interesting and varied reading list (90% Homer, Hesiod and lyric poetry). In our year the class was assigned problem sets, translation assignments and a monster final in place of a paper, which was a relief at the end of term. The main problem area was that Jay's lectures were sometimes difficult to understand because of the large amount of linguistic data he presented in every class session. The first two to three weeks were especially intense, but you shouldn't let an intimidating first class or two scare you away from the course.In summary:Classics majors: take this class, ideally after or at the same time as Greek 390, to improve your Greek.Non-classics majors: be aware that this class probably requires more than an L4 command of Greek going in (i.e. if you haven't read Homer or Hesiod before, the reading will be fairly hard).Linguistics majors: if you've already taken LING 112 or a similar class, you could probably take this class with less than an L4 background in Greek if you were prepared to spend a lot of time looking up words in the reading.",
    "Take the course if proto indo European and comparative grammar interest you - gives a valuable new perspective on Greek - but it's not particularly easy."
