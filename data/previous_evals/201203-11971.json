   "comments": [
    "I found this course less challenging and more fun that F130, but this may be simply because the format was the same and I had had time to get used to it. You really end up feeling more confident with French prose by the end of F140. Since this class meets everyday, you probably don't have that much flexibility in choosing a section, but since it meets everyday, it is very important both to like your professor and to enjoy the other students in your class.",
    "Take it if you need to complete the language requirement. Pretty easy to get an A-, somewhat challenging to get an A. Mme. Koundi is fantastic, both as a teacher and a person. She's very approachable and understanding, so class isn't at all a stressful experience.",
    "My answer is similar to that of the 1st question. I find level four to be an awkward bridge between memorizing grammar and actually being able to read interesting books. I would suggest spending time in France over taking this class because at this point speaking and listening skills simply need to be developed and this is best done speaking the language all the time.",
    "It's a pretty standard L4 course. There is a lot of work and time involved.",
    "I would summarize this course as a class that helps students with some background in French come to a firmer understanding of the language. I would definitely recommend this class to a friend. The grammar is helpful, and the topics we cover are extremely interesting.",
    "French L4 is not very different than L3 in terms of grammar and workload. Actually, one of the reasons why I found it far more interesting than L3 is the fact that we didn't drown in a ton of grammar. And I think it's fair to say that you are more encouraged to speak and participate in French which was the most helpful part of the class for me. At the end of the semester, I did an oral presentation and in contrast to my expectations, I didn't choke trying to form sentences! All thanks to so much practice.",
    "French 140 is a very comprehensive French class that ensures that students learn about grammar and have the opportunity to read a full length French book as well as watch a variety of films in French. I would recommend it to another student because I think that it really allows people to greatly improve their French in a way that is not solely focused on grammar. Rather, students have the opportunity to learn about French culture and politics discussed in the readings; this allows students to improve French discussion skills.",
    "This is a great, solid course. I enjoyed it, especially with Mme. Koundi. Make sure that you can tell when she is joking, though- I had a few friends who misunderstood her and spent the whole semester unhappy from a misunderstood wrong start. She is a strong teacher, and though I did this solely for the language requirement I really enjoyed French 3 and 4 with Mme. Koundi.",
    "Koundi is very good. You can't go wrong with her. The texts and movies are interesting but all revolve around depressing subject matter."
