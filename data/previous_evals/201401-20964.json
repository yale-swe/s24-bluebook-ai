    "I really enjoyed this course and felt like I have come out of it having learned a ton. Two days a week of lab can be a lot, but you get used to it. As someone who had no previous experience working in a lab at Yale, this was a great way to try out a wide variety of techniques and become more comfortable in a lab environment. There are quizzes each day in lab, but they are good because they make you read up a bit on the lab before you get there. The two big lab reports are long (do not wait till the night before to start) but really help you gain a deeper understanding of what you did in lab. Our TFs were awesome and this made a huge difference, as they were always willing to help us out\/answer and questions. Aruna was also helpful. Overall, I would recommend this course.",
    "MBB 360L was a great lab course. It can be a bit difficult to schedule other courses with the 2x a week meeting, but you really do learn quite a bit from the course, especially if you haven't had too much experience with wet lab techniques yet in your research. Work isn't too bad, mainly 2 large reports and 2 smaller ones with quizzes every lab session whose difficulty varies based on the TA writing them.",
