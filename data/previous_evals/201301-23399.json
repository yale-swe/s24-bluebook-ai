   "comments": [
    "A good introductory American literature course. I probably would not recommend it, as we came away with little more than the substance of a few good discussions, not a body of knowledge.",
    "ENG 846 offers you the opportunity to read a wide-ranging set of American Literature under loose regional, national, and global categories. Authors may include Bradstreet, Hawthorne, James, Jewett, Pound, Lowell, Faulkner, Stein, Toklas, Erdrich, Hughes, and Truong. The secondary readings tend not to enter into discussion as much as the primary text. If you read the text carefully, you will gain a lot more out of the class, because you sometimes cannot rely on classmates to keep discussions active and engaging. It's the type of class that can enter into really interesting discussions based around close reading of particular passages but also one that can veer in many tangents (this seems to happen when students in the class have not read the material very carefully--it can be quite obvious).",
    "I would recommend it but I would explain the issues listed above."
