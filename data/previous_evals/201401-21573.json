    "It's more work than you think it's going to be, but it's information every geology major should know. I actually really enjoyed the material, there is just a ton of it coming at you very fast, because the department refuses to split the course into two separate classes.",
    "It's hard, and there's a lot of material to be learned. You'll feel like you got better at mineralogy after it though, and understand how it affects basically everything in geo. Danny is nice. He expects you to learn, so be ready to work. But it's not that bad in the grand scheme of things. I liked the class\/lab.",
    "A lot of work, extra lab, should be 1.5 credits. However if you want to do geology definitely take it - you will learn A LOT!",
    "G&G 220 is a class with a very broad material base and a relatively shallow depth of study. A lot of the class revolves around chemistry, although it's not too intimidating and pretty easy to pick up if you've taken high school chemistry. As a geology major, I thought this class was a must-take and I still stand by that opinion. However, I am unsure of how non-geology majors would perceive the class; I think you should make sure you can deal with a semester of rocks and minerals before you sign up. There are a lot of really pretty samples in the lab, though! Maybe that makes it worth it?",
    "I'll start by saying that some of the material is necessarily dry. Learning how to read the dozens of graphs used by minerologists\/petrologists, about symmetry and about the chemistry of different silica structures can be tedious. It is, however, incredibly rewarding when everything comes together. By the end of the course, you can look at a rock formation and not just describe the composition but make an educated guess at the way that rock formed. The major downside of this course is the no-credit lab component, which really makes this two courses rolled into one. It's quite enjoyable at times though and, if you're taking this course, isn't identifying rocks what you're trying to learn anyway? By the end of the course, I felt far more proficient in the identification of thin section and hand section."
