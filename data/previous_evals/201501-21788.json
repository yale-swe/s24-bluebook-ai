   "comments": [
    "A lot of my problems with this class stems from my problems with DS, so all I feel like I should say is, don't let philosophy be the reason you drop DS!",
    "Take it. If you are wondering whether to stick it out for the second semester, do so. The second semester works are probable more compelling than the first, and you will learn many things in this course.",
    "A good survey of philosophers from Descartes to Wittgenstein, not as colorful as first semester but essential to understanding the field. Prepare to deal with a lot of sceptics.",
    "Second semester DS philosophy is, in my opinion, way harder than first semester in terms of both readability and understanding content. The material covered is interesting but it's rather easy to get lost and confused. If you take this class, definitely take advantage of any supplementary materials (i.e. online outlines, Stanford Encyclopedia, etc.) you can find - a lot of times, you're going to need it to actually understand the text. Professor Greco is pretty good, although he tends to let the discussion go where it will and so it can sometimes veer off track (though that depends too on who you have in your section).",
    "Very analytical style, very little ethics, incredibly perplexing works done at absurd speeds. Don't do it if you know what you care about, don't do it if you're comfortable with being told a chair is a chair and that's that.",
    "This class was a wonderful introduction to the philosophy of the western canon. The works were well chosen to ensure a feeling of continuity and flow throughout the course. The true core of the course were the seminars, and the course material was extremely conducive to this type of learning. I would definitely recommend taking this class if you want to experience a survey course with a surprising amount of depth.",
    "I would; however, I would warn them that this is first and foremost a survey course and the depth that is offered in such a restricted amount of time cannot possibly do justice to these texts. One must take this course as a survey and pick several texts to focus on in later years. This is also very advantageous for a non-philosophy major."
