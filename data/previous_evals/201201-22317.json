    "Solid history class - interesting time period. A lot of reading but its all pretty interesting",
    "Recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend this course. I think it was an extremely interesting topic taught be a fantastic professor. There is a lot of reading to do, so be prepared for that, but much of the historical background has already been covered in other history courses, so, if pressed for time, focusing on the primary sources will suffice.",
    "Overall this course is a very interesting overview of American development in the context of world affairs (with a focus on the European Congress). While you'll be able to understand the material well enough with a AP US level background, a large part of the class is evaluating competing interpretations of the era so having a strong grounding in the facts of developments in Europe (from the Congress of Vienna to WWI)would make the course substantially more interesting."
