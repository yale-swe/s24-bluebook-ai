    "The reading assignments were all informative. They gave insight into the history of the 20th century and the mindsets of historians.",
    "Better knowledge of 20th century history",
    "The insights from the readings were great. Listening to Tim was also insightful, so to speak.",
    "This is really a course about decision-making, and then I learned in more depth about Arendt, the Balkan Wars, historical processes, etc.",
    "This course taught me to approach history differently than I had previously. It stressed the importance of inspecting sources in order to better understand an author's claims.",
    "How to use primary and secondary sources",
    "A strong appreciation for the use of primary sources as well as critically assessing the biases of authors\/historians.",
    "I do not think this course had a significant impact on my academic career. It involved a lot of reading but not a lot of discussion on the material that we had read, which left me with a feeling of inadequate absorption of the material. The simulations did help me gain some negotiation skills, but on the whole, I don't think the lessons were very relevant to my career."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness: 1.not focusing on the world history 2. Not giving us clear instructions about the assignments. Strength: simulations",
    "Please spend more time lecturing instead of letting students who didn't read the material share their opinions or ask questions meant to derail the conversation. We want to learn from you!",
    "The readings for the course were superb. Unfortunately, we barely discussed them in class. Such a shame and missed opportunity. The simulations were good for class bonding, and I really did get into the characters I portrayed. Virtually no directions or feedback.",
    "Strengths are that the topics are interesting, and the WWI and WWII simulations were fun. The course could have been more organized in terms of expectations for papers and simulation guests\/final simulation assignment expectations.",
    "I think the course demanded way too much work then what we got out of it. Having simulations and papers due on the same day made it difficult to engage with the reading and the material. While I know graduate courses are supposed to have heavy workloads, I think it detracted from the course because many of us would have liked to really read and digest the readings. The readings were incredibly interesting so having more time to digest and discuss them would have been so much better.",
    "The materials covered in the course were excellent. I really appreciated the focus on a much neglected chapter in European history (the lead-up to World War I). The simulations provided a unique opportunity to channel the personalities and thought processes of the day in order to gain a deeper understanding of each nation's priorities at the time. One criticism of the course is the length of each seminar. Given the fact that we were only in class for an hour at a time, there was not sufficient time to really unpack and discuss the required readings. If the course could somehow be extended by half an hour, I believe the students would gain a lot.",
    "The work for this course takes a disproportionate amount of time for the amount of learning that is actually done in class. This is a huge weakness, because it made me unmotivated. I think the amount of time invested by the instructors is much too low for the amount of time that we are required to invest in return. In the end, the course ended up feeling self taught. I think the course is also extremely euro-centric and as a requirement for global affairs majors, this needs to change. The feedback and guidance we received in our work was seriously lacking. Furthermore, neither instructor was very available or responsive.",
    "Strengths: The various simulations were a very useful tool to engaging with different historical time periods and provided the students with a great opportunity to explore lots of primary sources. Weaknesses: There was often confusion on what the instructions for an assignment were. More time would have been spent by the students actually trying to produce the best work they could if the instructions were clearer. The instructor and course assistant did not adequately make themselves available to answer questions when they arose."

   "comments": [
    "We do not have an option. I would suggest this course be drastically altered. No point in having a course be mandatory if the administration knows it is overburdened. I think Tim and Sara did well for what they had to work with.",
    "I would recommend this course for the exposure to well-written and researched historical works as well as a unique approach to studying history.",
    "No, I would not recommend it unless the student is okay with having very little engagement from the instructors and not a lot of feedback on work produced, while handling a huge workload.",
    "No, I would definitely not recommend this course to another student. The course felt very unfocused and assignments were often unclear. The course attempted to cover way too much material without an adequate amount of time to digest and discuss it."
