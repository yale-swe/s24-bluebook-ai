    "Insights into Voltaire on his thoughts on tolerance and religious freedom",
    "I really enjoyed the class, the professor is engaging and the material is overall very interesting. I learned a lot about religion, tolerance as concepts developed by Voltaire.",
    "I had never read Voltaire before taking this class, so I liked that it gave me a fairly comprehensive view of three primary genres of his writing: novels, tragedies, and pamphlets. This is not fully a philosophy class or a literature class, but more of a general culture class; more than a philosopher or a novelist\/playwright, Voltaire was a political commentator, so his writings give you a good indication of his political views and (often satirical) commentary on the state of contemporary politics and society."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness: the pace of the discussion was very slow sometimes, and there were times when the discussion seemed very tedious and unproductive, mostly due to lack of high participation in the students. Also, near the end of the semester the ideas and themes we would bring up in class became very repetitive and uninteresting because Voltaire's writings dealt with the same arguments over and over again, and we were reading the same arguments but just in different forms (tragedies, pamphlets, letters, etc)",
    "After reading some of the great tragedians, like Sophocles and Racine, in other classes, it is clear that Voltaire is not among them. Really, his tragedies are just a veil for more political commentary. I felt the works I liked best were the more direct, yet eloquent, essays and pamphlets, because these felt like they communicated Voltaire's true identity. We could have read more of these, I think. I would have also liked to know more about Voltaire as a person and his socio-political context. I would have enjoyed reading works by others about Voltaire. For example, he had a bitter rivalry with Rousseau, so it would have been interesting to compare works by them or read Rousseau's opinion of Voltaire."

    "The readings are not too difficult if your French reading and speaking abilities are advanced. Interesting class and not too much work if you just keep up with the readings. Discussions will often become very slow, and the quality of discussions really depends on the engagement of the students. Discussion can get very repetitive near the end of the semester because you'll be reading the same argument from Voltaire against religious fanaticism and for religious tolerance presented in different forms of text (pamphlet, letters, tragedies, etc.). Definitely take this class if it is offered and if you are interested in Voltaire's writings, because this class has not been offered at Yale in years and probably would not be offered if Professor PSA weren't here!",
    "Definetely!",
    "Yes. Voltaire is an important Enlightenment figure and significant to one's knowledge of the body of thought from that time. Reading him in comparison to the other thinkers is also enriching. Being an L5 discussion-based class, it gave me a chance to improve my spoken French, and the three 5-6 page papers were manageable and helped me improve as a writer presenting an argument. The readings are manageable (on average about 2 hours per class period) and there is no final."
