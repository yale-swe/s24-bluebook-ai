    "This wasn't my favorite class (lot of work), but Ian was really great.",
    "A decent amount of work but worth it in the end.",
    "I would recommend this course. I think that I improved my spanish skills and I honestly looked forward to class every day. You will get out what you put in. It is a heavy course load but manageable.",
    "Spanish 140 fills in all the gaps in your speaking and overall knowledge of the language. It also helps your conversation skills immensely.",
    "This class is very speaking heavy. It helped me fulfill my language requirement. Definitely take this class with Ian Althouse if you can. He is absolutely amazing and made the class so much better. At this point the grammar is pretty advanced and can get a little tricky at times. My soonish improved this semseter.",
    "Very rigorous class, but you will learn a lot. Be prepared to work hard.",
    "A lot of people at this level of Spanish are just taking it to fulfill a requirement, and since it meets every day its imperative to find a professor and group of classmates to whom you enjoy speaking. Overall this class helps students improve speaking skills and knowledge of culture in various Spanish-speaking countries."
