    "99% of the course contents were new or at least semi-unfamiliar to me, so I learned a LOT. Most importantly, I became much more comfortable with quantum mechanics because, finally, it was presented as _mechanics_, with time-dependent motion! David Tannor was completely right in the intro to his book -- introducing time-dependence makes QM so much less weird, although the weirdness never goes away completely. I liked the mixture of methods presented in the class, especially those that present QM as a correction to classical mechanics. Again, this reduces the weirdness. I also now know that whatever life sends my way, the best way to tackle any life problem is to insert closure (|j>",
    "Where to start? this class was a lot of effort, but very rewarding in that it left me with a vast understanding of the field of quantum dynamics. In general, we covered many topics, such that mastery of them was infrequent. However, I now have an excellent reference to several different methods of dynamics, and -- perhaps even more valuable -- I have a grasp of what the mentality behind developing quantum dynamics theories looks and feels like."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: see above Weaknesses: 1) could have spent less time on Wigner transform. I liked learned about it, and it's clearly extremely important, but maybe we could have covered something else too. 2) could have spent more time on path integral methods and approximations like RPMD for time-dependent dynamics. Also could have learned more about how path integral methods can be incorporated into classical MD as a correction for small particles. 3) could have had more paper-and-pencil problems to reinforce material",
    "The lecture notes are, overall, exceptional, and their ever-continuing growth reflect Victor's passion for the subject (not to mention they make for excellent reference). However, there were some topics that could have been clarified\/introduced better with a more conceptual introduction. I'm not sure whether this aspect of the course was a strength or a weakness, but there were many lengthy derivations on the board, which may have been left to lecture notes to leave time in class for more conceptual\/ intuitive approach to the topics. At least, that was my opinion at the start of the class, when an occasional error in a 20 minute derivation left us scratching our heads. However, the benefit of such a teaching style is that you really see how the concepts were formed in the minds of their creators."

    "I would recommend this course to any theory\/computational student, even if they don't plan on doing any quantum dynamics. Once you learn things from TDSE perspective, QM is not the same again.",
    "I would recommend this course only to someone who was already very familiar with quantum mechanics (hence \"advanced quantum mechanics\"), who has the time to put in a lot of effort for the class, and who has a passion for the field. That said, I would strongly recommend this course to such a student."
