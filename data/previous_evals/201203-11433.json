    "A reading of a cross section of Renaissance Spanish novels from several genres. Useful for students studying or interested in Renaissance Spanish literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to any fellow student without reservation, provided that they have any previous interest in the subject of Renaissance literature. Such an interest could then be fulfilled in many different ways, since the class discussion is indeed open to incorporate philosophy, art and othe disciplines into this field of knowledge.",

    "The course requires reading a number of texts not on the reading lists which is good for general knowledge of Spanish literature. It would have been useful, however, to read a few more texts from the reading lists.",
    "It added so much background that I lacked. Helped me understand influences an roots of ancient literature to more recent works."
