   "comments": [
    "Chem 554, for an inorganic student, is really simple at the beginning, with plenty of review from coordination chemistry. The physical methods are useful, and as such I would highly recommend the course. The final project is of questionable value to the student.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Inorganic chemist, for two reasons: 1) This is essentially a spectroscopy course. You will learn a lot about useful spectroscopic techniques that will enable you to read the literature at a higher level and perhaps use these techniques in your own research. 2) There is a tradition in inorganic chemistry to allow nature to inspire a lot of synthetic chemistry-- this course will make you a more literate chemist in this regard as well as you will learn about a lot of important natural systems and how they utilize specific chemical principles to carry out useful transformations. However, I would not recommend this course to a Chemical Biology student, largely because I think the course draws heavily on Inorganic Chemistry intuition and prerequisite knowledge. I believe if I did not have this intuition\/previous knowledge, I would have gotten significantly less out of this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a good blend of inorganic chemistry and more biological and biochemical topics, which I enjoyed. I thought the workload and exams were reasonable for the expectations of the class.",
    "I would recommend this course as a relatively easy survey course. I didn't have much, if any, background in bioinorganic chemistry, so most of the material was novel for me. The detailed analysis of case studies was a bit overemphasized, but the diversified set of tools\/techniques discussed made up shallow footed lessons.",
    "Nice survey of important bioinorganic topics. Strongly recommend.",
    "Unless the student is in inorganic track, I wouldn't recommend it to other students with limited coordination chemistry background."

   "comments": [
    "The physical methods overview, especially on magnetism, is something we haven't really gotten anywhere else and may be invaluable in the future.",
    "As stated above, this course helped me understand useful spectroscopic techniques at a higher level. It also improved my background knowledge about important natural examples of important chemical reactions synthetic inorganic chemists like me attempt to mimic.",
    "Overall, this course contributed to my understanding and general knowledge of inorganic chemistry. While it did not directly relate to my research, I still think it is a valuable class for all inorganic students to take.",
    "Learned about helpful physical methods."
