    "Really helpful, and you get breakfast goodies every morning!",
    "I strongly believe that the year-long sociology thesis is the better option, and here's a whole slew of reasons why... 1) You get far more time to craft a better finished product. 2) The seminar only meets every other week--and Professor Smith will make sureto feed you! 3) You have the opportunity to watch your classmates' projects unfold over the entire year--which has so far been really cool. 4) You can't graduate with honors in the Sociology major unless you write a year-long thesis. 5) You get to take a seminar with Professor Smith, who is delightful. AND, 6) last but certainly not least, you get the added bonus of actually getting to know about a dozen people in your major. So long as you have an inkling as to what you might write about, the year-long option seems to be the way to go. Enjoyable class, steady but reasonable pace, and keeps you on target to finish your thesis well ahead of the deadline.",
    "Year-long senior thesis - it's a lot of fun to go through the process with your fellow majors, highly recommended, don't be daunted - most of us don't seem to get our act together until mid-way through the semester.",
    "The sociology department has by far the best method of getting seniors through their senior essay. With an advisor, a teaching fellow AND the DUS of your department leading your senior essay colloquium, it's very difficult to go wrong here! I highly recommend pursuing the year-long route as it's much more rewarding and less stressful than the semester-long thesis, but that's just me. Good luck!"
