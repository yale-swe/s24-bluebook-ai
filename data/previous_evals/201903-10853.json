    "Strengths: Heavy emphasis on group casework & lecturer was excellent, very highly engaging Weaknesses: Quizzes are quite difficult because they're timed (like 5-10min), having written-out longer quizzes would ensure we truly understand the material",
    "This class is extremely thorough in content, collaborative in nature, and organized by topic. I have no suggestions on how it could be improved."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in seeing how corporate finance topics apply to the real world.",
    "Yes! Especially as an undergraduate, it was really nice to take a course at the SOM with non-Yale College students. I learned a lot about Finance over the course of the semester as the professor is excellent and every lecture has been highly engaging.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students. The content in the class, as well as how you learn it through case-based projects, is extremely interesting and engaging. I learned so much practical knowledge about corporate finance, which I don't think I would have gotten otherwise.",
    "Absolutely. Case studies as a style of learning are much more realistic and practical; as a consequence, they are much more complicated. Thus, I believe, they compliment the learning styles of other classes at Yale College. Highly recommend!"
