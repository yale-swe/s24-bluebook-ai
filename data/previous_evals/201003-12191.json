   "comments": [
    "One paper, two midterms and a final. A straight forward science class that is usually REALLY fun considering it's a science. Enjoyable for humanities and science kids alike. I'm also no longer afraid of bugs.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. I took it for my science credit, but I was actually interested the whole time. It's not a gut (there's a research paper) but it's so fun to project bug behavior onto human interactions.",
    "Dude.... you would have to be a FOOL to chose any other course if you're trying to meet your science requirement. Astro? Please... Tech World? I see where you're going with that... but... please... take a class thats taught 50% by the best bio professor at Yale and 50% by David Attenborough\/Planet Earth.All of my friends that chose otherwise were jealous. Exams are not bad at all, just review powerpoints. NO HW!",
    "Amazing class! Consider taking it Credit\/D if your science background isn't great, as the material may sometimes seem a bit above your level, and the exams cover quite a lot of it. That said, Marta is an awesome professor, and the lectures are entertaining and broken up by tons of helpful video clips (Attenborough fans, rejoice!)",
    "This course is good for both bio and non science majors. It's an interesting perspective and is accessible to anyone. Marta is always excited about the topic and keeps you interested at every lecture.",
    "It was a very good, interesting course about material not many people think or know about. The professor is engaging, the reading and material interesting. The material may be a little difficult if a student is not terribly well acquainted with biological topics.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Take it Credit\/D\/Fail if you don't want to work that hard.",
    "If you are a non-science student looking for a science, and retain a childhood fascination with bugs and creepy crawlies, this may be the class for you!",
    "A class all about bugs. Recommend-but you should actually be interested because it does cover a lot of material.",
    "This course will teach you A LOT about arthropods, and it is all very interesting. I am an Econ major; I only took this course for fun and ended up greatly enjoying it. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Bugs is a really excellent science option. It's slightly harder than a more traditional gut, but it really is fun and you learn a lot about the \"cool\" aspects of bugs. It was probably my favorite class this term and I am a humanities\/social science person.",
    "It is a lecture course co-taught by Marta (one of the best people at Yale) and David Attenborough (who, little known fact, booked Monty Python for BBC). It is a fantastic class and you should definitely take it if you have any interest in insects, spider or other terrestrial arthropods.",
    "E&EB 250 is a great introduction to the evolution, anatomy, behavior and ecology of arthropods. Professor Wells is a really engaging lecturer and makes the material fascinating. As a humanities student, I did find the work a little difficult to keep up with, but this class is miles more fun and interesting than any gut science.",
    "A great science credit for the non-major, but certainly not for the slacker. Whoever you are though, there's something to be enjoyed. Take it, absolutely.",
    "If you need a science credit, take this class. It's pretty tough in terms of the work load, but the material is FASCINATING AND FUN! You will be a bugs-buff by the end of the semester, and you will begin to annoy your friends with weird facts about the respiratory systems of bees and the mating habits of the red-backed spider! BUGS ARE SO COOL! TAKE THIS CLASS! I used to hate spiders, but this class made me appreciate them.",
    "Great class. The professor is really enthusiastic and you walk away with a great knowledge of bug case studies. She show lots of great videos in class. three midterms a final a final paper are a lot, but the paper is cool because you get to explore the bugs you're really interested. marta is great to talk to after class. I took the class as an engineer interested in biomimicry and it was really cool. its really similar to the ornithology class too, same level of awesomness.",
    "I really liked this class. Both Marta and the TA were caring and helpful, and the subject is endlessly interesting. It's a bit of a tough science credit but its worth it.",
    "Biology of Terrestrial Arthropods is an extremely fun and interesting class for both biology students and for anyone at all interested in the natural world. Every single lecture will blow your mind as you discover new amazing things that bugs are capable of, and in the process you will actually learn a lot about evolutionary theory, ecology, and biodiversity. Humanities students beware, though: this is not a gut class, as the amount of material to learn is significant, and the workload is pretty intense (three tests, a final, and a 12-page paper!). That said, if you aren't afraid to take a real science class, you will be heartily rewarded."
