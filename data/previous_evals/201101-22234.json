   "comments": [
    "Excellent. Professor Greenberg is incredible and you learn a lot about a topic that is not very often explored in other classes. Take this. Not much work.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a fun and interesting topic. Be warned though that if you want to learn something from the class you have to commit to the reading. Otherwise it isn't too hard to skim and then only shallowly participate in class discussion.",
    "I would. It's not a very difficult course, and the subject matter is relatively interesting. I enjoyed the flexibility to pursue topics that I was most interested in. I also found Professor Greenberg to be fantastic and memorable.",
    "YES. A tour of interesting and relevant language-meets-politics case studies: Quebec, U.S., Belgium, Balkans. I learned a lot and I had a great time. What more could you want?!",
    "I expected to get more intellectually out of the course-I mostly picked up interesting 'cocktail party' facts. However you don't have to do that much of the reading if you get the basic concepts. The syllabus graded requirements also.aren't difficult at all.",
    "This is a rather lite seminar on the ways governments deal with issues of language planning and minority languages. We look at many countries, mostly in Europe and North America, usually reading an article or two before discussing them in class. The workload is not heavy at all; there is a group project on a country of the groups' choosing, a short midterm, and a final paper. I would recommend this class to someone looking for an interesting fifth credit; if you already know a lot about minority languages in Europe, I'd skip it.",
    "If you love languages and are interested in politics then this class is for you. It's excellent! Even if you are not too interested in political science, still try to take this class. Discussions are always enjoyable and you feel like you learn a lot after every class. Definitely one of the best that Yale has to offer.",
    "This class was an exploration of the relationship between language and the politics of various countries throughout the world. I would recommend this class to another student because i felt the topics and issues discussed were very interesting and helped to increase my awareness of the roles and importance of language in the world.",
    "Definitely take if you can get in. Very interesting class, engaging material and great discussions, the work is not too intense but you learn a lot. Professor Greenberg is wonderful; he is brilliant and passionate about the subject, which makes the class so amazing. It's also once a week in the evenings, which gives it a relaxed atmosphere.",
    "Fun and manageable course-load. Take it."
