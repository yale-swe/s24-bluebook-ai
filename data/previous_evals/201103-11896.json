    "During class you go through allthe theory and then in the problems sets you are asked to implement algorithms you learned about in C or Fortran. If you like these languages and are comfortable in them then this class is for you. You also need a solid linear algebra background in order to keep up in class. Professor Rokhlin is a little weird, be warned. Manageable load and fun psets -- take it!",
    "Rokhlin has really good advice if you want to program well, especially doing anything numerical or data-related. Light workload that develops basic tools and programming practice - so you won't be doing actual data mining, but lower level stuff. The TAs are helpful, understanding, flexible. Note that Rokhlin is INSANE and terrible at explaining anything. It's an adventure.",
    "This is a class on numerical computation. There's no discussion of \"data mining\", but you do generate random data to apply algorithms like SVD or nearest neighbor to. It's a decent class for programming practice though. There isn't much structure or incentive to learn (three programming projects, no exams) and some lectures can be harder to follow. Professor Rokhlin has a unique teaching style, so definitely shop this class. He's hilarious and has some useful thoughts on programming, but he doesn't require attendance and it shows in the content of his lectures."
