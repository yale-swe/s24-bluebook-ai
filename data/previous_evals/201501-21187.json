   "comments": [
    "I will recommend this course to another student because it is really helpful.",
    "This course introduces a number of biochemical and biophysical analysis techniques and demonstrates their utility to cell or molecular biologists. Most units include both lectures on principles in the classroom and hands on demonstrations in labs or core facilities. I would highly recommend this course to any biologist without a strong background in biophysical analysis.",
    "Good course. Not easy but helpful.",
    "I would summarize it as a graduate level course on biochemical and biophysical assays, with the assumption that students are vaguely familiar with each technique but may not be familiar with the theoretical details or how to execute them in a lab setting. I would recommend this course to a fellow student if they would benefit from learning about techniques and tools for biochemical assays for their research and had not had much lab experience with them.",
    "It was a course that required a lot of time spent visiting various laboratories, but not much time spent on work outside of class.",
    "It is an into into many different methods. I would probably not recommend it because I don't see myself using many of the techniques and if I did need to use one of them a few days of talking to an expert and researching would suffice.",
    "MCDB 630 gives you a familiarity with different biochemical methods. I would recommend this to another student if they were working in an area that will require biochemical techniques.",
    "This course is important for people with limited biochemical background, but the relevant and interesting information is unfortunately buried between many lectures and topics that are, at best, tangentially relevant to the majority of MCGD students.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you come from a much less quantitative background like myself.",
    "Would not recommend. Do not learn anything new, waste of time learning about techniques you would not use but would instead send to the core. The worst part of this class is that overall molecular biology is a really interesting subject and this class completely failed to demonstrate that. To fulfill the MCDB course requirement students should instead be allowed to pick an MCDB course in a subject interesting to them, instead of being forced to be in a class that is taught in too great of depth non-relevant to our research. Please do not force the next year to take this class.",
    "The class was a survey of techniques with some hands on explanations. This course is required, but it was also helpful.",
    "This was a course to learn about biochemical and biophysical methods that could be useful in research. I think this class was less useful for students going into genetics and would therefore not recommend this class to them. For students going into cell biology or MCDB, I would recommend this course if they were interested in biophysics.",
    "I would if he or she wants a general idea of different techniques",
    "If the student anticipates encountering any biochemistry during their PhD, then the course is recommended; however, many students may find that the information presented in this course (although useful) will not be utilized."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me a much better understanding of several techniques at both the conceptual and practical level. The most useful modules for my dissertation research will most likely be the microscopy and mathematical modeling modules.",
    "Everyone need biochem for research...right?",
    "This course gave a good theoretical overview of several biochemical and biophysical research techniques, and provided some practical advice on how to execute each of these were I to perform them in my own research. Other than the lectures on protein purification and microscopy, I am unsure as to how directly this material will apply during my dissertation research in a cell biology lab, but it may prove useful at other stages of my scientific career.",
    "I've already covered most of what I want to say to answer this question, but I want to specially mention that David Baddeley gave a fantastic demo of the PALM facility. He was really thorough and I'm grateful that he was willing to answer my ten thousand questions :) I will probably use super-resolution light microscopy at some point for my research.",
    "It helped me learn new experimental techniques.",
    "I will use a few of the techniques or ideas throughout the course of my dissertation, but not much.",
    "I now know a bit more about some of the biochemical techniques that I am likely to use during the course of my Ph.D., and a lot about the biophysical basis of techniques that I will certainly not be using (NMR, X-ray crystallography, etc).",
    "It helped me think about biological problems from a new angle. It may not contribute directly to my thesis work, but I may decide to apply the tools discussed more directly later in my career.",
    "Did not. If techniques will be used in research, will not be doing them by self but send to core. Writing the proposal at the end was helpful though, as you had to propose and justify a series of experiments to answer a biological question of choice. Not a great class for students in genetics, may be helpful for biochem or mol bio students.",
    "The most useful part of the course was probably the microscopy section which I could potentially use in my research. This class taught me more about the options available at Yale.",
    "to some extent",
    "Although it did certainly expand my knowledge of biochemical techniques, I feel my time could have been more appropriately spent on more relevant courses."
