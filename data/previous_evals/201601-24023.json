   "comments": [
    "This is a class on Holocaust testimony, Holocaust history, and Holocaust memory. We discuss why the Holocaust is remembered in different ways in different places, its impact on American culture, and how the Holocaust is historicized.",
    "This is a great course that deals as much (if not more) with the intellectual history of the Holocaust and with theories of how history is formed, than with the history of the Holocaust itself. Professor Dean does a great job leading the course and the workload is manageable. Cannot recommend this course enough.",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes! Yale has very few courses that cover the Holocaust. This is not a course where you'll just learn endless facts of that is what you are looking for. This course discussed the history and the benefits and drawbacks of the testimony of the Holocaust and is a very intriguing discussion.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in Holocaust TESTIMONY. This is not a class about the Holocaust but rather about how it is remembered and discussed. The class was very open-ended and felt more like a weekly book club meeting. Professor Dean is great though. She was very chill and was always happy to help with our papers. She had us peer-edit each other's paper ideas during the last week, which I found very helpful. Anyway, take this class if you can! But don't worry so much if you don't.",
    "HIST 269J is a great history seminar that provides an interesting perspective on the study of the Holocaust. It is great as a junior seminar but could be difficult for a non-history major as it requires a basic understanding of how academic historical analyses work. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the Holocaust as a historical and human phenomenon, especially someone who has learned about the Holocaust from a narrow religious or personal point of view."
