   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Try not to be intimidated by the reading list or the 9:00 am time slot--both are worth it. I feel like it was especially helpful to take this my freshman year, as it gave me a broad introduction to the literary canon without the restrictive schedule of the Directed Studies program. If you are an upperclassman, never fear! This class is one of the ones to take before you graduate, as you truly read \"the best of the best,\" the works everyone should explore at some point in their life. Professor Neuman made a well crafted (though, admittedly, much used) syllabus accessible and helped our class through plays tragic, comic, and frustratingly ambiguous.",
    "A great introduction to some of the major works in the canon. The class keeps a fast pace, but I was impressed by our seminar's ability to dig deep into the major issues of each work.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student who wants to read great literature and discuss works in a small class setting. There is a lot of writing, but freedom to write about something you find interesting. The reading load is pretty heavy, so be prepared to dedicate time to the readings.",
    "If you are interested in literature and drama, and are wanting to develop a more educated view of tragedy, then this is a good class to take. If you don't like reading, discussion and writing, there are probably better options.",
    "This is a very demanding, very difficult class for a freshman, but it will push you to the next level in terms of literary analysis. I am a different writer and a different thinker because of this class. Take it! Every second is worth it."
