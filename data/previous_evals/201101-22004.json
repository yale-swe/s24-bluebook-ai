    "Intensive theory class but very manageable",
    "I highly recommend it. Its fun, and interesting, not too hard, and not too much work. You basically spend class doing exercises, its very interactive, and you don't feel like you have to scramble to study for the exams.",
    "This is a great class. If you just took Music 110, know that this class is not as easy. However, it's really satisfying to build on all the information you learned in 110. A lot of this class is about the daily work (60% of your grade), so if you keep up you will automatically prepare for the tests. This was one of my favorite classes this semester and I would recommend it to any of my friends.",
    "I would definitely recommend 205. I came from a singing background but with absolutely no theory, so it took a little while for me to catch up with everyone else, but I feel like I learned a lot. It was a nice break intellectually from other classes because it is so different than many of the classes that are offered at Yale."
