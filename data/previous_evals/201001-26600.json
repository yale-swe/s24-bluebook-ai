    "The course discussion was vigorous and intelligent. To spend the semester studying through drawing a figure as important and with such resounding implications on today\u0092s practice as Mies was an intense and invaluable experience. The course was successful in bringing to light Mies\u0092s complexity of approach and the conflicts between his written aspirations and realized work. The readings and mid-week discussions were also a big help.",
    "The organization worked very well.",
    "We did have a syllabus, although it was not strictly followed in the least. I found the course highly disorganized and there was often a great amount of missed communication between the students and the professor as he was often unavailable and difficult to get a hold of. We were supposed to have readings every week and informal discussion sections, although this only happened twice and it seemed like it was entirely up to the TA to pick out the readings, rather than the professor, which I find problematic. Since Eisenman has never taught this subject matter, it seemed as if he knew as little about it as we did. I am encouraged by the idea that it was as much of an experiment on his behalf as it was on ours, but since there was hardly any open communication between us, we students were often left in the dark as to what was expected of us, and even what we were really striving for in the course.",
    "THis course might be better with two drawings every other week with a discussion of the readings and buildings in between. There was not the supporting readings that i would have expected after the first year course which overall was much better organized."

    "(see above)",
    "My expectations for the course were high and they were very well met. The only expectation that was not met was that I thought Peter would give more lectures, instead of looking at drawings all the time. While I appreciated looking at and discussing drawings, I often would have appreciated hearing Peter's point of view without only having recourse to drawings as points of reference.",
    "I came into the course with the expectation of learning a lot, and I definitely did, although none of it was from the in class discussions. I found the format to be rather trite - all of us sitting in chairs facing the drawings, while Peter was up front, stealing the show. The drawings, which were usually very delicate and beautifully drawn required a close analysis, which does not work when we are sitting so far away (and Peter refuses to get up out of his chair for anything). I was expecting more of an equal-opportunity round table setting where we could look at drawings and also face each other as we discussed them. I must admit that peter's comments on the drawings were often less than brilliant. Most of what is to be gained from the class comes from personal motivation in doing extra readings and in the making of the drawings themselves.",
    "I expected more from this course, the work load was extreme and I didn't feel the same level of commitment on the other end. The weekly discussion were largely of the drawing and very often didn't engage the big picture questions that the class's premise promised. Also the lectures by outside critics were great but the weekly classes would be better served by a lecture by Prof. Eisenman,"

   "comments": [
    "The course was very helpful and germane to my own interests. It sets the stage for me to continue a line of work through reading and drawing.",
    "I thought the course was extremely valuable.",
    "As mentioned above, what I value the most from the course is the fact that we learn through the act of drawing. What is to be gained from the class really comes from doing extra readings that we find ourselves, and from the amount of time we choose to devote to the drawings. I am still unsure about the title of the course, Mies' relationship to genius loci and the zeitgeist, as we somehow dropped those terms at some point in the semester... Although I think we were latching onto them too much at the beginning, and I think it was even hindering the drawing, we later seemed to forget about them all together, which makes me think, what was the point?",
    "This class's value lies in its ability to excavate architecture's idea base from a close analysis of great works of architecture. It's limitation is in the way brackets out Architecture from society and culture, it would be better to study these works along side there context- both physical and historical. I think this would decouple the dialectic, because the way it was approached Genus Loci was always seen through the valence of Zeitgeist and never understood in terms of its broader implications."

   "comments": [
    "Teaching prompted energetic discussion and generally stayed on track. The TA was extremely organized, responsible, and clear in criticism and broaching of major themes.",
    "I thought the instruction was great, however I felt the TA did not offer the kind of resistance, or even a different point of view, which I felt he could have.",
    "Peter is not really encouraging as a professor and I think is losing his sharpness as he sometimes takes a while to understand drawings and we often seem to waste time trying to get him to understand things that the rest of us understood a long time ago. What I do appreciate is the rigor he brings to the course, and the fact that this really pushes us to do our best. I often felt more satisfied with the drawings I was producing for his class than for studio. However, this is coupled with the equally frustrating feeling that the drawings were not given due credit, and leads the students to lose their motivation.",
    "I think this class could have been better organized. I don't know who to pin this on but there seemed to be a lack of effort in terms of organizing readings and class materials to support the weekly drawings and discussion. This is particularly disturbing because of the amount of work that was put into the drawings week after week."

    "Much discussion was devoted to geometric and proportional analyses: 9-squares, meter of punched openings, eroded squares and extensible grids. Also relevant to discourse today, more so as Mies\u0092s career unfolds, is the development, lateral exploration, and distillation of frame as a reaction to and interpretation of technology contemporary to Mies. It is important to discuss construction (sorting of bricks in the Wolf House, plug welds at Farnsworth, varied steel grades at the Nationalgalerie) to gain insight into and the tools to evaluate emerging trends of facadismand fabrication in an increasingly digital-dependent environment. This is also an opportunity to rethink and update technique, because axonometrics and orthographics lend themselves so readily, even insidiously, to a proportional, geometric analysis. With regard to Mies, whose buildings resemble increasingly a built axonometric, the similarity between mode of representation and object represented may not force enough distance from the work to be able to gain the highest level of clarity.On the subject of axonmetrics, the 11x17 format was great for streamlining discussion and getting quickly to big ideas. It may also help to intersperse a couple weeks within the semester to look not at two drawings of the same building side-by-side, but drawings of different buildings, to scale. Seeing Farnsworth next to Barcelona or 50x50 next to the Nationalgalerie could help elucidate how Mies\u0092s ideas grapple with scale and site changes throughout his career. Also, it could have been good to devote or or two two-week streches within the semester to develop and research a particular building of the student's selection in greater detail.",
    "I have very few suggestions, except that I wish that there had been more lectures.",
    "I propose more of a round-table setting for the discussions. I also despise the drawing studio as I find it highly unsuitable to the format of the seminar and only increases the hierarchical, formal aspect of the way class is set up.",
    "Alternating a lecture\/discussion classes with a drawing classes would be a better pattern and in the end would both the discussions and the drawings would improve. Overall this was a great class and am proud to have been part of it. The school would benefit from having more classes like it that have their own ongoing projects."
