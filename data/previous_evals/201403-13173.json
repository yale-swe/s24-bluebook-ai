    "This class was great! As with all creative writing seminars, the professor is arguably the most important determiner of the overall quality of the course and Leslie made this a class worth being a part of. Her selection of readings was great and her feedback was specific and reasonable. I don't think she'll be teaching this class again but if she does and you have the fortune of taking it, do it!",
    "TAKE IT",
    "This class gives exactly what it advertises. Wonderful workshop class with a manageable amount of work. Great professor.",
    "Definitely. Whether you are an English major or not, this course is invaluable for expanding your fiction reading and writing experience, as well as for being a more empathetic person. All readings are interesting, the assignments well thought out and the small class size enables thoughtful, often humorous discussions.",
    "English 245 with Leslie Jamison was a wonderful course. Leslie is an incredibly warm and welcoming presence, and provides at the same time absolutely essential insight into our stories or the short stories we read for the class. I learned a lot from the class, and am so glad to have had the chance to be in a workshop with her. Her syllabus was also great--she dedicated each class to a certain element of fiction, which I found really helpfully for crystallizing ways of thinking about each one.",
    "THIS CLASS ROCKS. Take it. You'll be a better writer, even if fiction isn't your thing.",
    "An overview of different topics of craft (voice, dialogue, structure, etc.) through reading stories. Towards the second half of the class we workshopped our own work.",
    "A standard creative writing workshop course, with great short story reading assignments and an attentive, engaged, and enthusiastic professor who runs an effective discussion. Recommended!"
