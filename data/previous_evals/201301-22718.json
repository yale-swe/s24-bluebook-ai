   "comments": [
    "It's interesting, but I probably wouldn't take it if I didn't have to.",
    "Don't take it unless you are a Chem major. Don't be fooled: some topics are a review from gen chem, but you will go way more in depth with the material. It isn't that well taught, and you need to rely heavily on TAs and classmates to finish the problem sets.",
    "A very standard chemistry course that I would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "In Nilay's defense, this is his first year teaching the course. He's a wonderful person who cares about the class and his students. However, he's the first instructor I've had that's managed to make me hate a chemistry course. Many, many times I walked out of lecture confused because he wouldn't explain any of the examples; he just read the information off the slide and I suppose expected us to figure it out on our own. My impression is that he assumes we have a lot of prior knowledge and\/or that we are geniuses and able to absorb his lectures at an incredible pace. Asking questions was intimidating because I felt belittled every time I did so. The problem sets were also unreasonably confusing; I distinctly remember a question involving a ligand bound eta-5 before eta was ever explained in class. Overall, I'd say the course material would've been interesting, but my experience with the class was negative.",
    "Great class to take. You learn a ton, and the resources are there to help you succeed.",
    "I'm not sure I've learned as much in any introductory class as I did in this class. I am not a Chemistry major (Bio major using the class for a gen-chem requirement) and didn't have any real background in Chemistry. But the class is incredible in that it can take a person with limited chemistry exposure and give them a base level of fluency to which they can apply to several other fields.Nilay and the TA's are a real treasure. Although the lectures weren't always terribly informative, the problem sets did a good job of reinforcing some of the more niche topics without giving anything away. Nilay and Liz (my TA) were always quick to respond to emails and gave plenty of pertinent help for whatever questions I had. Two midterms, a final, and weekly problem sets are pretty standard for a science class, so don't expect any mulligans there. But if you're looking for a decent Chemistry class with a good professor (who gives a lot of chocolate), this is the class for you.Also, Nilay won't be teaching this class next year...so, good luck.",
    "If you need a chemistry grade, take this class. Otherwise, no need for this class.",
    "It was good. Nilay needs to make it a little more accessible for people who haven't had pchem or organic as technically they're not prerequisite. I think it's unfair that the girl that had taken p Chem was the only one (including the TAs) who didn't think the MO diagram questions were unfair. Nilay is a genius. He is an excellent lecturer. The things he does tell us are very clear and easy to understand. He's also much more entertaining than Crabtree. That said there were big problems with him saying he'd post answer keys and never posting them for any of the assignments.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "Nilay was an extremely engaging and knowledgeable lecturer. He made what could have been some very boring or complicated topics interesting and understandable. He invested a lot of time in the class and was always open to questions. This was a very well-taught, comprehensive intro inorganic chem course. The 1 problem set a week was very manageable, and the 2 midterms and final were also not too bad.",
    "A good class! The first third or so is review, and then it gets into newer and harder material (although it never really gets that hard). You learn interesting chemistry, and it really doesn't require that much work, so take it if it sounds interesting to you!",
    "A great class! The small size definitely helps and it was the first class I took with primarily chemistry majors, so everyone had at least a somewhat genuine interest in taking the class and being in lecture. The TF's were both some of the best TF's I've ever had for a class. Liz won't be coming back next year unfortunately but Sahr might! Ultimately, a good class for chemistry or non-chemistry majors. A (easier) way for chem majors to begin fulfilling their major requirements.",
    "Only take this course if you are a chemistry major. It covers a lot of ground very quickly and not in much detail, and on the whole I would say a lot of the material will not be particularly useful down the road.",
    "Absolutely! If you're interested in inorganic chemistry or want a great Australian professor, it's a great class to take!\\\\\\",
    "Don't take it unless you have to because you're a chemistry major. This class was not good at all.",
    "The course overall is not too bad, but Nilay only uses powerpoint to conduct the lectures. Even though his lectures are fairly clear, it might be hard for students who are used to having professors who write out all the mechanisms on the board.",
    "Great class. Honestly, it's a not a class to stress about if you give it a good effort. Nilay's very kind and transition metal chemistry is a very important intro topic.",
    "You learn a lot of essential items in inorganic chemistry, although know that you will need to learn all of the material well on your own. Psets are not too bad although the material gets much harder towards the end of the course."
