    "This course is a wonderful one, but you have to WANT to do it - as in, you would do it if no such course existed. Your professor also has to genuinely care about working with you, which was not the case for some of my fellow concentrators. That being said, when the mentorship is heartfelt and genuine, it really helps you to be a far stronger writer than you would be on your own. Set up your meetings so that you can interact as much as possible with your advisor. The less you meet, the less you will (be forced to) write. The deadlines and potential for shame both help. Still: this is A LOT of work and does not easily permit the integration of previous work. Expect pretty much the entirety of your manuscript to be new material. You can do it, and your friends will support you, but, really, you have to WANT it. If you do it: good luck, and stay sane.",
    "Don't undertake this project if you need it as an incentive to write. Take it if you are already making time to write. Taking this project should be a relief from an academic credit, not an additional burden.",
    "I would absolutely reccomend it--the chance to work one on one with a professor is a transformative and wonderful experience.",
    "I would definitely do the writing concentration project. It's a great opportunity to work one on one with a professor on a longer writing project."
