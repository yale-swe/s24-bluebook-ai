    "This is a great science class. I wouldn't call it a gut by any means. You definitely need to study for exams and put time into the homeworks (they usually took 4ish hours per week). But other than that is a really fun class and a great way to get a science credit.",
    "-only for someone really interested in the topic",
    "NO!!!!!!!! Do not waste your time, not a gut or worthwhile class in any perspective, just a terrible experience on what should be interesting topics.",
    "Recommended for humanities majors looking for an informative science credit that's also highly relevant to humanities disciplines.",
    "Definitely take this course! You need the Science and it's really fun!",
    "As far as science credits go, this is a pretty good one. Still, there is a very important distinction to be made here: this course requires a fair bit of work, it just isn't all that scientific. Weekly readings and \"problem sets\" (more like regular homework assignments in any humanities class) were very tedious and boring and could take several hours. If you're willing to work in a science credit but just can't handle actual science, this is probably the course for you (there's a final paper, which is probably very rare for science credits). But if you don't want to do any work, look elsewhere. As far as the material goes, how interesting it was could be pretty hit or miss. There were some lectures that I was riveted by. There were others that I spent the entirety of on my phone. Other random thoughts: Professor Faison never responds to his emails, and the TAs were unbearably (unacceptably, really) slow in returning homework assignments, and were not always helpful when they did. They were extremely harsh graders and would also refuse to answer questions about problem sets that they didn't grade, even if the question wasn't about grading but just \"what would the correct answer have been here?\" If you're an astronomy grad student, you should be able to do better than \"I didn't grade that question.\"",
    "Archeoastronomy is fine -- not too hard, not too vague. Really just an anthropology class with some basic astronomy at the beginning of the semester. Psets take a couple hours each. Midterms are easy if you've half a brain. The reading's required in theory, optional in practice. You don't really need to attend lecture, though it helps.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for any non-STEM people who need a science credit. The course load is manageable and the professor and TFs will help you with whatever you need.",
    "Archaeoastronomy is a pretty solid non-science major science credit. You write a final paper rather than taking a final exam and have a great deal of flexibility about topic, so that was a nice feature. The math can get a bit tedious, and at times it was a bit more work than I wanted to put into \"just a science credit,\" but I learned a good bit about ancient cultures and their astronomical systems and generally enjoyed the class.",
    "Interesting material; not necessarily a super gutty gut, but still easy. You have to understand the material but if you put a little effort into it you'll be fine. The stuff that you'll be learning is relevant to everyone's general education.",
    "So you have to take two science credits. This one isn't great, but it isn't absolutely terrible either.",
    "I really, really enjoyed this class. The lectures were sometimes a little long, but overall this class is everything you ever wanted to know about the stars (if you're interested in constellations and planets and things like that). Absolutely 100% recommend, but it is NOT a gut by any means.",
    "For the first half of the course, we learned the basics of naked eye astronomy. This involved some math and memorization. During the second half of the course, we learned about the cosmologies of ancient cultures, which involved a lot of reading and writing. The second half was definitely more interesting, although it helped having the astronomy background of the first half. The lectures for this course were interesting. We looked at the sky in Stellarium on the big screen, which was really cool. Professor Faison is a great lecturer, he's so enthusiastic and he knows so much about this field. In terms of work for this course, you have to do a problem set every week and write a final paper at the end. There are also two exams. Sections were somewhat helpful, but honestly it was hard to get good help. Plus, the grading was quite harsh.",
    "The first half of the course on how the earth, moon, and sun actually interact is really interesting, but don't take the course if you are not interested in the history of astronomy and calendar systems, because that is the entire second part of the course. It is not too much work, but some of the readings are unnecessarily long with regard to the amount of information in them that is relevant to the p-sets.",
    "Take this class if you need a science credit but don't think it's a walk in the park! You've got to do some definite work, but it's probably the most interesting science work you could do and Professor Faison is great !",
    "The technicals of naked eye astronomy with some reading about ancient civs thrown in",
    "ASTR 135 is an OK, but by no means amazing, option for a non-science humanities major looking to fulfill the Sc requirement. Overall, the lecture was engaging, and the problem sets certainly fair, but the lecture and the problem sets (not to mention the tests) were never very directly related to each other, which was unfortunately a disincentive to attend. The lectures were filled with interesting anecdotes from the professor, but I would walk out of there after 75 minutes really unsure if I had learned anything. Additionally, I found the system of electronically submitted and electronically graded problem sets to be infuriating at times. By the final day of the term, there were still several problem sets that had not been returned to us despite the supposed convenience of this system, and the TAs demonstrated no desire to amend this fact even though it meant there was a good deal of uncertainty surrounding our grades even at the end of the semester. Emails to the professor proved fruitless as well, since he seemed to consider this problem to be the domain of the TAs. At times, it seemed the TAs were even less engaged than the students, and this was quite annoying.",
    "Highly recommend it if you're interested in the material. I found the first half more interesting--we learned how the cycles work, how stars and planets move around in the sky, how to predict eclipses, how calendars work, etc. in the second half, you apply this knowledge.",
    "This class is more difficult than it seems, especially if you are an innocent humanities major looking for a good science credit, like I was. In that case, I would not recommend it to you, unless you are interested enough in the material that you don't mind the extra work that's going to come with it.",
    "As an introduction to naked-eye astronomy and the cultures that used it, this class is interesting and exciting. There are weekly problems sets that must be submitted online, as well as a final research paper, two midterms, and an observing exercise. The problem sets were sometimes confusing, asking for information that was not given in lecture or method that was not previously explained. Dr. Faison, however, is an engaging lecturer. The course starts out more math-based, as you learn the different ways to chart the motion of stars and planets in the night sky. It then moves on to a more social sciences take, doing a case study of ancient cultures from Britain to Greece to China to Central America and their use of naked eye astronomy and the structures that remain of this aspect of their culture. I would tentatively recommend the course, as the material itself is interesting, but the actual structure of the class could use some improvement.",
    "Yes take it it was awesome, stimulating, important, fun, fantastic for anthropology majors! Facts you should know for life, plus really important lessons about how to look at the world!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in astronomy or anthropology. It's also an easy science credit, although I took it because it was interesting and not just for the credit. There are weekly homeworks based on the assigned reading and lectures, which involve a mix of astronomical calculations and cultural analysis.",
    "Okay, here is the thing: The class teaches you cool stuff. However, it is HARD. If you are a second semester senior who doesn't want to spend the semester terrified you ar going to get a D, RUN FOR THE FRIKKIN HILL I AM NOT JOKING DO NOT TAKE. Don't be fooled by the syllabus. I was. I was like, oh but it look so interesting. Don't be fooled by the professor. he seems nice and goofy and compassionate and kind. He wants you to fail unless you're a science whiz. Basically, unless you are confident you can do the work or don;t need the science cred and take it Credit\/D, it is going to be tough going.",
    "I don't know how to describe this course. Kind of cool because you do learn about the movement of celestial bodies and can better understand the phases of the moon and whatnot, but the course was really poorly executed. Lectures often had little to do with problem sets, and many TAs seemed oblivious. I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "You need a SC credit? Sort of interested in the stars? Take this. Be warned: this isn't a gut.",
    "I would not recommend archeoastronomy to a fellow student. While it may seem like an interesting science credit, it is incredibly frustrating and hard to learn anything worthwhile.",
    "I took this class for the science credit, as I am most definitely not a science person. It was good; I learned basics about astronomy and it wasn't too hard. However, this is NOT a gut class. The psets could be tricky and the TA's weren't very nice about grading. The tests were ok as long as you prepare for them, and there was a short final paper that was pretty easy.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone. The professor is awesome and class is really interesting. I guess if you hate looking at stars or planets and never have a desire to learn anything about them, then don't take it. Otherwise take it because you will learn a lot.",
    "Yes",
    "This is not a gut course. Do not take it if you aren't willing to really do the work.",
    "This class was an interesting experience. You'll do weekly psets, take two exams, and write a term paper, but there is no final. It's a struggle, and I think you'll take something out of it, I'm just not sure what.",
    "Not a total gut, the p-sets will take some time. Faison is wonderful and super helpful.",
    "A fairly interesting class. Take it if you think that the subject might even remotely interest you.",
    "This class was not as advertised. Though interesting, it was disjointed and difficult to gage what all was on the tests and how we were doing on homework. It was far too stressful and vague for what it's worth.",
    "I personally would not recommend this class. I found the problem set gardening inconsistent and the readings not the lectures as my main source of learning.",
    "You should take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Interesting subject matter to help inform a new perspective as I move forward.",
    "This is an interesting course, and I did take something out of it, but do not joke around or think it is a simple, easy gut. Make sure to study and read, and it can be worth while. Also, reach out to Professor Faison and TAs for help if there are any difficult topics. Overall, it is a good science course for those not interested in the hard sciences.",
    "Do not take this class. It might sound fun and cool (which the material really is) but it is an organizational nightmare. Please don't take this class. You only have one day to do the problem sets because the material isn't taught before then. PSETS are terrible - the questions are incredibly vague and there aren't any example problems. The TFs take months to grade the problem sets. There are better science credits out there, I promise. Though it's pretty easy, this class is the biggest pain.",
    "It's a good science credit without much science, in case you're looking for one. The hardest part is conceptualizing some of the topics.",
    "ASTR135 is an overview of astronomy as practiced\/understood in different historical cultures. The first part of the semester focuses on topics of naked-eye astronomy (to get an understanding of the basic principles), and the second half focuses on exploring different historical\/cultural cosmologies. I had never taken an astronomy class before and really enjoyed this class, and learned a lot about astronomy that I found quite fascinating. Dr. Faison is really great, very enthusiastic and excited about teaching, which makes lectures fun to listen to. There were optional sections several times a week, for help with course material and with the weekly problem sets. There were 2 non-cumulative midterms and a final 6-8pg research paper. Overall I would recommend this class to anyone interested in a survey of archeoastronomy--you'll learn a lot of really cool things that you might not otherwise come across.",
    "If you are interested in sociology, anthropology or ancient cultures, this class is rewarding. However there is a large section of the class focused on basic astronomy covered in Astronomy 110. I would have preferred to spend more time on the ancient cultures, and study their astronomical beliefs in greater detail. I think the professor intends to limit the number of people in the class, which is essential! There were too many people in the class this time, and we did not receive our problem sets back for a very long time. The exams were based on the problem sets, and we did receive our problem sets for the second exam back until 48hours before the exam. The professor is approachable if you have any questions, and he organises reviews before each exam. Sometimes the class content does not cover the questions in the problem set, but the problem sets are not difficult. The exams are fair, if you have studied the material, and you can choice whatever topic you wish for the final paper.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting science class that includes ancient history and culture, and are not too keen on the natural sciences, then I would recommend this class. However, you do have to dedicate a good amount of time to it if you want to do well. There are psets and readings every week, a few observing exercises, and two midterms which are not too difficult if you study the material well. There is a final paper in lieu of a final exam, which can be fun since you get to pick your topic.",
    "This class is perfect for a relatively easy but interesting Science credit. It will also change and enhance the way you look at the sky.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course to another student. I did not feel very invested in or challenged by it. The problem sets were terrible and boring. If you want an easy background in astronomy with a cool twist towards cultural studies and are willing to put up with the grading being late and boring problem sets then take it.",
    "This class is not a gut science....don't be fooled like I was. However I still thought it was really interesting and what I learned is definitely applicable moving forward. That said the readings were tedious and the problem sets difficult due to length of time needed to complete them.",
    "It is difficult",
    "I would not recommend Archaeoastronomy to another student. As interesting as the material can be, the lack of structure in the course and the lectures eclipses the potential joy you may experience after learning the difference between a synodic and sideral month. Professor Faison is knowledgable but unhelpful, and the PSETs are endlessly frustrating, as grading seems to adhere to nothing other than the hourly whims of the TFs. If you want to learn about ancient astronomy read the wikipedia page. It is not a fun class and it is not an easy science credit."
