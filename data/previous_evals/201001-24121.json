   "comments": [
    "It's a class that starts off sort of slow and dry in regards to the material, but picks up during the second half. It's for someone who has a real interest in Vietnam, not just looking for a filler class. He's very enthusiastic about Vietnam and his studies. A lot of the reading is pretty dry, but class discussions make them more interesting.",
    "This class is amazing. While the readings can be a bit dense and require a lot of time to think about, I think their arguments and associated insights are well worth the time spent. Professor Harms is an outstanding instructor and I think every Yale student should take a class with him before he\/she graduates. He cares so much about the material and his enthusiasm spreads to his students. This class functions as a seminar, so be prepared to do a lot of work. While it is possible to get by without doing the reading, you will get nothing out of the class. Midterm and final paper are the only two graded assignments. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Vietnam or viewing the world in a different lens.",
    "Class about PostWar Vietnam and many different broad topics. Great starter to anthropology with very interesting ideas and readings.",
    "I really enjoyed this class-- there are 2 papers: one mid-term, one final. There were also some smaller written assignments, like the class wiki but, for the most part, very manageable. Some of the readings were dry, but overall, this class does a good job of offering a different, more \"insider's perspective\" of Vietnam.",
    "The class is about Vietnamese culture. straightforward.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in anthropology, Vietnam, or who just wants to take a small class and have an opportunity for some meaningful intellectual discussion.",
    "A great class to make you more globally aware, I would highly recommend it.",
    "It was a good course in terms of informing about contemporary Vietnam, and it was also very good in terms of raising various anthropological questions and themes. Professor Harms is the guy you want explaining difficult anthropological concepts to you, and he has a really fun, easygoing personality. His grading is still very fair, if you slack off on a paper he will still read it well and won't just let it go, which I respect very much. Overall a pretty good course, recommend for those interested at all in Vietnam, SE Asia, or who wish to have an understanding of an Anthropological approach to studying a region.",
    "Take it if you are truly interested in learning about Vietnam. It isa shame if you take such an in-depth course without respecting the culture. There is a pile of reading every week, which can be difficult to balance on top of other classes. Each reading assignment must be summarized by 1-3 students, so it can get pretty hectic when it's your turn to summarize.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student. The syllabus was well thought-out and the readings and topics we discussed were really interesting. Most important, Professor Harms was an incredible professor. He encouraged everyone to question their assumptions about the world and to think on a more critical level. His comments for improving my writing were also really helpful."
