    "It's a travesty that environmental engineering majors have to take this class. The first half is a bunch of useless lectures about chemical engineering plant design, economics, and general chemical engineering principles. Not useful to environmental engineers at all. The second half is a design project, which was more relevant, but still not great. We only had 1 month to come up our entire project. The whole thing felt rushed and I don't think the work produced was very high quality as a result. Also the project was very rigid - we didn't have any freedom at all. Creativity should always be a major component of a design project, and it didn't really come into play here. At least the class isn't that much work or too difficult.",
    "You probably have to take this, but don't be too worried. The first half of this class is a normal engineering lecture (although it can feel a bit disjointed). The psets aren't any more or less challenging than any other class you've heard. The group project was a bit frustrating because it's hard to coordinate a group of 6 second-semester seniors. Good luck - pick people you know are hard workers, or be willing to put in a lot of work yourself at the very end of the semester.",
    "ENVE MAJORS BE WARNED. Before you have to take this class GO TALK TO THE PROFESSORS. This is a terrible capstone experience, so I seriously encourage you to talk to the professors, previous ENVE graduates, and the DUS about making changes. It has potential, but the way it is run right now is very impractical.",
    "Chemical Engineering Process Design is an excellent course that ties in together all of the core principles of the chemical engineering discipline through the four years at Yale. The course benefits from real-world examples like the production of Ethyl Acetate or the economics behind mass producing materials by utilizing discounted cash flows (DCF's). The course culminates a wonderful group project at the end of the semester that tackles topics that are both relevant and are chosen by students : energy, economics, water, sustainability, etc. Professor Plata and Professor Van Tassel are really open to collaborating with students on the group topic for the semester and have helped give us the freedom to take charge of our own task. It is a wonderful way to tackle a real-world problem (which in our case was the reuse of fracking fluid from hydraulic fracking wells through an energy neutral water treatment train).",
    "It is a great class that you have to take. a fun capstone",
    "I would say it is a pretty inaccurate culmination to the environmental engineering major. I think the problem solving aspect of the project was pretty cool, and overall I guess I learned a decent amount, but overall it was kinda weird.",
    "Take it if you have to, but be warned that it is rough. You will get slammed at the end, and your presentations will get demolished by the faculty who attend your project presentations.",
    "I hope your senior project is less aggravating than ours was. We were forced to modify fracking procedures but weren't allowed to advocate for the ending of fracking.",
    "Ask early if you want to have a say in the topic! In past years, they assign your topic for you, and its often related to biology (which we learn nothing about in our required courses). We met with PVT during junior year and talked about how we wanted to do something related to water and membranes (which we did learn about a lot and in which our department specializes). Make a senior design group that will work well together, and really work together on it make sure everyone pulls their own weight and spend a lot of time talking over your ideas together as a group. The first half of the course is sort of a chore, unless youre really into accounting."
