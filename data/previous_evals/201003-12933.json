    "Harvey (he requires us to call him by his first name) is an amazing man. Although class is pretty unstructured, he manages to teach us so much. He encourages participation and active learning, so don't bother taking this class if you are hesitant about talking about sex or demand that every fact be laid out to you. You have to be able to think outside the box and break these down.There is practically zero homework. Only one project and paper first semester (which is a bit daunting about how we will get a grade, but definitely nice).You really don't learn too much about the details or science of the reproductive system. Instead there are open discussions about sex and society etc.I love this class and definitely recommend trying to get into it.",
    "Not an incredibly bio-intensive course, but AP-level bio knowledge is definitely a must. You should be comfortable talking about sex and be able to think of sex in a broader context than just humans and procreation. This is an absolutely great course. Harvey is awesome, really friendly and loves to foster whole class discussion. Hardly any work outside class, maybe like two short essays and a powerpoint the whole semester. Definitely check this class out.",
    "A macro overview of everything reproductive you could care about",
    "Absolutely. Take this class! Not only was it low-stress, but it was one of the more thought-provoking and stimulating classes I have taken. Basically, the class is structured so that every week the students sit around a table and discuss the assigned reading (which is never too long and is always interesting) or a student gives a presentation on a chosen topic (this can range from spermatogenesis to orgasm). No matter what is being discussed or presented, questions are asked in a socratic seminar style, by both Harvey and the other students, which can sometimes lead to debate (fun!). This class is absolutely amazing if you're the type of student that thrives in a truly seminar environment.",
    "Yes definitely reccomend. However do no take if you are squeamish about looking or talking about genitalia, sex, etc.",
    "Take this class. Talking about typically taboo topics in a friendly, discussion-based setting is a pretty unforgettable experience. Harvey's amazing, and the workload is limited to projects that really have a purpose--no busy work or rote memorization here. You'll really start taking away the themes underlying reproductive biology, and applying them to life outside the class."
