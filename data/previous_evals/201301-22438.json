   "comments": [
    "Yess!If you are debating between Math 118 and 120. Then take Math 120 with Miki otherwise take 118",
    "Not an easy course but a good course for multivariable calculus. Keep in mind that everyone in the class is a high performer and many students have already taken multivariable in their respective high schools. Miki is a great teacher, she can sometimes go fast but usually explain really well and answers questions\/supports her students amazingly. I would recommend this class. the timing is a consideration though, 9am can be really early in the morning for learning math, and the class is 75 minutes long which can be a little long sometimes.",
    "I didn't have to take Math 120, decided to take it, and ended up really enjoying it. It's a not too difficult class that still feels rewarding, and it's possible to do well as a non-science\/math major. If you don't have to take it, though, there's no point doing it unless you are willing to put in the work!",
    "It is a fairly standard but great course. Take it with Miki!",
    "Difficult class need to prepare a lot for",
    "Take it if you need it for something. The end of it gets a little confusing and you go at a pretty quick pace, so be prepared.",
    "If you are going to take Math 120, take it with Miki. She is an amazing instructor.",
    "Standard math class. Pretty easy; generous curve. Just go to class and take good notes.",
    "The material is difficult but with Miki Havlickova the course is worth it. Definitely go to office hours and tutoring.",
    "Multivariable with Miki in the mornings is about as great as a 9am mathematics course can get! Even if you have not had any exposure to multivariable calc before (I definitely had not!), please don't be afraid to shop this class rather than underplacing yourself in 115. I found the material to be well-taught and clear, albeit at a fast, clipping pace. I had to scramble to scribble down all the notes, and then spend at least half an hour trying to make sense of them afterwards. That said, the notes are great - filled with examples and organized in a logical, memorable manner. And the exams were extremely manageable. The best resource of this class, outside of notes and the textbook, is of course Miki herself. She makes time to hold office hours four times a week - and she's always there with a smile and a joke, willing to help you on any problem or concept. Multivariable can be hard to grasp at times, but Miki went out of her way to craft little review sheets, in-class games, and resources for all of us. I'm quite humanities bent and would never count myself as a math person, but I have to say that I enjoyed this class and all the knowledge I have gained from it.",
    "It is very fast paced, but very well taught (if you have Miki). Very fair.",
    "Yes, if you have to. Challenging, but also pretty rewarding.",
    "I would recommend Math 120, although that may just be if you like math and aren't afraid of the course. The averages on the exams are usually pretty high, especially first semester, so it can be kind of competitive and nerve-wracking. But overall it's an effective course for learning Calc III, and I think students should consider taking it if they have a reason to. Make sure you know the difference between Math 120 and the corresponding ENAS course that also covers multivariable concepts; they each satisfy slightly different requirements, and that could be important.",
    "If you are going to take MATH 120, take it with Miki. To be honest, I wasn't looking forward to taking this course (I had to take it as a major requirement, but the reviews for this course weren't that good...) However, Miki changed everything! She is a wonderful lecturer who is very good at explaining difficult concepts in an understandable way. She had office hours four times a week, so it was easy to find help when I needed it. I cannot stress enough how important it is to learn calculus from a lecturer who can actually teach. The textbook is not that helpful, so it is difficult to self-study the material by yourself. Miki is very popular and it may be difficult to get into her section, but you should really try to have her as your prof.",
    "Pretty decent class, Miki's section is very good. I originally thought about taking ENAS since I'd heard better things about it, but this worked better for my schedule, and I think the class was fine. If you need to learn multi take the class.",
    "I liked MATH120-intersting material that got more challenging as the course went on but never got too overwhelming. Also, try to get Miki as your professor if you can-she is fantastic!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class, especially if you like calculus. It was very interesting, and the class itself is organized and manageable to keep up with. As long as you keep up with problem sets and go to lecture, it's really not too difficult or stressful.",
    "A lot of people have trouble with this class because math isn't their thing but their major requires it. Essentially, people take this class if they have to; I took it out of curiosity, although I'll probably need it for my major. Yes, you should take this class if you're curious, although you should also be comfortable with your math ability. (If you're simply \"curious,\" you'll be competing against a lot of people who are taking 120 grudgingly, so hopefully you'll have the advantage of being interested in the subject.)",
    "If you have to take Math 120, definitely take it with Miki. She's as great as everyone says she is. Definitely go in for office hours if you have questions and go to her review sessions. Psets could sometimes be long and tedious, but they're great practice for the exam. Also, do the practice test they provide online; they are excellent ways to prepare you for the exams.",
    "If you have to take math 120, obviously, try to take it with Miki. If not, why take it?",
    "Multi",
    "Math 120 is a typical multi-variable calculus class. The material is covered at a quick but manageable pace. The homework is good at covering the math necessary for the exams, but I would highly recommend doing the practice exams before the actual exams. Plenty of review sessions are available before tests, so students should definitely make use of them. I would only recommend the course to a student who either needs the math class or really loves math."
