   "comments": [
    "This course offered an inside peek into how IPCC chapter 12 is developed, and a survey of current literature on climate change mitigation for urban areas. Due to the compressed timeline, there wasn't really opportunity to skill-build, as it was only in the final few classes that it became clearer what we were being asked to develop. There is so much potential for a great course here - I just wish I'd taken the full-semester option, as the intensive does a disservice to the learning opportunity.",
    "Good overview of various concepts around urban mitigation, and good exposure to the related academic literature. I sort of learned how to write a synthesis.",
    "I learned the valuable skill of synthesis writing and filtering through dense research papers to get to the gist of the matter. The course was highly engaging and informative on matters of climate change mitigation through urban re-design.",
    "I learned a great deal about climate change mitigation in urban areas and especially the issues and needs for this area of climate action\/engagement. I also learned how to read journal articles more efficiently to pull out key information for the purposes of a synthesis and assessment.",
    "Climate change science and mitigation in urban areas",
    "Really developed a good base of knowledge on urbanization research to do with climate change.",
    "The course readings and classes taught the drivers and sources of urban carbon emissions, provided an overview of the different carbon accounting methods, and presented strategies for mitigation. Through homework, I developed the skill set of writing synthesis (not a summary!). The class also provided insight into how the IPCC works and how climate change knowledge is made."

   "comments": [
    "In content and instruction, exceeded expectations. Karen is hands-down the most brilliant and compelling professor I've taken a course with at F&ES. The individual sessions were engaging, and the material very relevant. Time flew by. That said, it felt like this course was an afterthought. The structure was really poor for facilitating learning, given that the volume of content would have been overwhelming on a weekly basis. As it was, there was too much to thoughtfully process or develop.",
    "Somewhat. There was so much focus on the syntheses which caused a lot of stress. However, the material I learned and the class discussions\/activities were very useful.",
    "Very well!",
    "The course aligned with my expectations, although I found the structure could have been better planned. I understand the reasoning for condensing the course, but given the level of engagement required and the workload, I really feel the course should be at least 2.0 credits so that students can meet the professor's expectations.",
    "Very well",
    "It aligned very well, but it could have been helpful to do a little less. The amount of work was so high and the work couldn't be returned in time for us to adjust our S&A's for the next round.",
    "Even though this is a 1 credit mini-course, I learned more from it than any of my other classes this semester. This class met and exceeded my expectations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: highest-caliber instructor, great content in a highly desired subject area. Areas for improvement: - Structure: at a fundamental level, this would have been much more successful as a full course. In addition to the learning benefits, the workload was also not appropriate to a 1-credit designation. - Feedback: tied in with the above, but given the quick turnarounds between assignments, there was no time to get usable feedback. If you're going to ask for a very specific style of writing in the S&As, there should either be much clearer instruction or examples provided at the onset, or more responsive instructor feedback between assignments. The student feedback was minimally helpful, as peers lacked the knowledge to provide actionable suggestions. Nobody knew quite how to write an S&A, we only knew that everyone else was doing it poorly too. - Takeaways: it would be helpful to set aside time each session to discuss key takeaways. After wrestling with these topics for several hours, it wasn't always clear what we could bring forward into our professional lives.",
    "Strengths: good overview of topics, good readings, good class discussion Weaknesses: the expectations for the syntheses were very hard to grasp even after multiple discussions about it. These assignments caused an unnecessary amount of stress. The class would also be better meeting 1x per week for six weeks rather than 3 times a week for two.",
    "The course was structured for two weeks of classes spread out over the semester, and during each week 3 assignments had to be turned in. A week wasn't enough time to give the attention that each assignment required and as a result my grades suffered. There was a lot of reading material to be covered for each assignment and 2-3 days per assignment is just not enough. Some of the skills we were learning had been introduced for the first time, so it took us a while to fully grasp the scope of what was required. For a one credit course, the work load was too high.",
    "The professor is an expert in this field and thus relays great intel. However, a big weakness is the level or work over a very condensed period. I do not think this is an effective way for students to engage in the material to the extent expected for the course or to really process the material. To write an effective synthesis and assessment, students need to be able to reflect on the readings. I am not sure the best way to resolve this issue, but perhaps allocating additional credit hours and better spacing out course periods could allow students to allocate more intentional time to the material and assignments.",
    "Excellent course for learning the science of climate change in urban areas. Workload was too high for a 1 credit course. Should be at least 2 or 3 credits. The intensive 2-week structure was not structured to create classroom cohesion; class protocols and discussion suffered as a result.",
    "Strengths -- Karen is truly an expert. We looked into super relevant research. Weaknesses -- far too much work for a 1 credit class. Structure was such that we couldn't understand S&A's before we had done too many of them. Also the speaking at the end added a bit too much.",
    "Strengths -- Learn a lot from the reading and homework, class discussions\/protocols are great. Improvement -- While the class only met for two weeks, taking into account the homework assignment due dates the class was closer to 6 weeks \/ half a semester. I think the class should be worth more than 1 credit. The course could be improved by giving more time to do the readings and write each S&A."

   "comments": [
    "It's all-consuming, and as an intensive is a bit of a mess. But if the option is to take it or never experience a class with Karen, would still take it.",
    "It is a very heavy workload for a short period of time. Be prepared to prioritize the course.",
    "I would advise a student interested in the class to really think about the time commitment it requires. As a 1.0 credit course, students are forced to juggle an impossible amount of work depending on what is required by the other 11.0 credits that semester. Thus, in order to really get what one wants out of the course, students should reflect on this reality.",
    "This is a very intense class that covers a broad range of material. Very good content but be prepared for a steep learning curve and not a lot of classroom support due to the 2 week structure.",
    "Only take this class if you can give it as much time as a 3-credit class. It will take over your week in the weeks that it meets. That said, there's a lot of expertise to tap here.",
    "This class is a lot of work. If you want to learn about urban climate change mitigation, I highly recomend taking it, but plan to spend a lot of time on it."
