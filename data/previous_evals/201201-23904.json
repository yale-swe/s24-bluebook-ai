   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "My expectations were to be pushed to become a better designer. These expectations were met and I'm leaving this studio feeling very optimistic. I could not recommend this studio any more highly.",
    "I expected the project 'style' to be more proscriptive. Often times, just by looking at a student project, you can pretty accurately guess who the critic is. Our studio, on the other hand, had a broad range of approaches, styles, aesthetics, focuses -- I really got to pursue what I wanted to pursue.I didn't expect the short one week assignments (factory design, branding design), and wasn't sure I'd refer back to them once we had finished them. In the end, each mini-project we did somehow factored into my final project. These were helpful, especially as breaks after midterm to take a step back from my main project.",
    "This studio far exceeded my expectations. The lessons I learned during this semester are the kind that I will carry with me throughout my career and will shape who I am as a practitioner, for that I am deeply gratified. My one and only complaint for this studio would have to be the way the instructors handled the Feldman nomination. Instead of deciding who the recipient should be themselves that left it up to the students to vote for a nominee. In my opinion this turns a very academic process into a popularity contest. I do not think it was appropriate or fair. The Feldman nomination is strong motivation for everyone to work hard, I think had I and the rest of the studio known that the nomination was going to be decided in this way it would have unmotivated everyone a little. I think in the future it would be better if they made the decision themselves.",
    "One of the reasons I took this studio was because I was pretty sure that Deborah and Noah would be available more often than studio professors who are coming from further away. I feel like I still need a bit of guidance so I preferred a studio where I would get that and this expectation was met.",
    "I came into the studio because I wanted to work at the building scale. I wanted to take a proposal through a large scale concept and develop architectural and tectonic resolutions that support and reinforced that initial idea. however, I was more or less indifferent to the program, bourbon sounded exciting but also not totally relevant.Looking back now, the urban manufacturing aspect of the studiowas one of the most complex and rewarding parts of the studio. We were forced to deal with the social and economic implications of a real-life issue. We had to design not only for the users, the visitors, and the greater public, but we had to develop and understanding of the bourbon making process and design around its constraints. Having to deal with a complicated and highly specific program forced the studio to consider all parts of the project with as much specificity and rigor.Deborah and Noah should be applauded for proposing such a complex and multi-dimensional program and for carrying through with such helpful and insightful guidance.",
    "I had no preconceived notions prior to entering the studio, I had goals and expressed these goals in the beginning to both critics. What I enjoyed most was how easy they made it to accomplish my goals while maintaing their own goals of exploring a new urban industrial typology. My goals were to work in a formal language using new software and to represent the project through animation.",
    "I expected an interesting project with a good critic this semester, but what I received went so far above and beyond this simple hope. From the very first mini-project to the final distillery, Deborah and Noah were so enthusiastic, helpful and receptive to my ideas and goals. They made five days in Louisville into an experience that I will never forget. While I arguably worked harder this semester than in semesters past, it often didn't feel like work. The project, the program, the critics, the organization of the studio all came together into a semester that was educational and enjoyable.",
    "I had always expected advanced studios to be a more in-depth study of a subject, and this was not met last semester. This semester, I felt like there was a more comprehensive approach to design and we were able to engage in everything from the urban scale to the product scale. This exceeded my expectations, and I am happy with the outcome."

    "Yes they were adequate.",
    "No special equipment required - software\/computers were fine.",
    "Our studio space was freezing cold the entire semester. We repeatedly complained and the maintenance crew came several times to try to fix the problem with no success. The fact that we pay so much money and spend so much time in studio and it is not at a reasonable temperature is unacceptable.",

    "yes.",
    "yes",
    "Resources, as always, were adequate.",
    "Yes. In addition to the production resources, Deborah set up a number of talks and tours (and bar sessions) in Louisville and New Haven that were very helpful in our Bourbon research."
