    "Among the fundamental challenges of countering violentextremism in West Africa is understanding the message Boko Haram (BH) and its offshoot ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA) deploy to build and sustain their operations. State governments are often challenged to compete with the BH and ISIS-WAmessage-one that promises power, economic prosperity, spiritual fulfillment, in an environment often marked by considerable disparity, local insecurity and poor governance. The United Stated Department of State asked for Yale Graduate students assistance to more thoroughly study and understand the BH and ISIS-WA message. Rather than traditional papers and examinations, the goal and intention of this course is to simulate a consulting engagement. Working for a client, (the United States Department of State). One will be asked to learn a tremendous amount about past and present violent extremist movements and counter messaging theory.",
    "I gained a comprehensive knowledge base concerning CVE, Nigeria, and Boko Haram. I also learned a great deal about managing and organizing consulting engagements, particularly with government clients."

   "comments": [
    "Since this is a consulting class, the client's request and the team's (students') ability to successfully deliver on said request are the major determining factors in how the semester will unfold. While an abundance of resources is provided, it is up to students to determine what they need in a timely manner. Still, the underlying structure of the class, such as assigned readings and guest speakers, provided an important foundation for better understanding the issues at play.",
    "The first few weeks of the course were just a bit unorganized, as students were unsure of how to best execute tasks and be prepared for class. However, before long, we quickly adapted to Professor King's unorthodox but incredibly effective teaching style.",
    "Course provided incredible opportunity to work on current, pressing issue, with high-level government client. Good background to CVE work; excellent opportunity for self-organizing practice."
