    "Yes, a good solid bio class that is actually interesting, without too much extra homework.",
    "Biotech is one of my favorite classes of this semester. It gives a very comprehensive review of current biotechnologies as well as practical applications and experiences given by guest lecturers. Definitely take if you are interested in research or going into biotech in the future.",
    "It's a great class taught by some really good lecturers.It covers all the interesting\/cutting-edge technology in the biotech field.",
    "pretty good upper level bio. not too difficult. prepare a lot for wolenski's exams.",
    "A good overview of biotechnology. Doesn't go into huge detail on the hard science behind the technology. I'd recommend this course to people going into research or biotech industry.",
    "Great course. The best part is that you get to listen to several different professors talk about their areas of interest which is a refreshing change of pace. The exams are hard to study for, as the material is so scattered and there's really no way to know what to expect.",
    "A class for seniors. Gives an overview of biotechnology and approaches to pursuing a career in the field, though also a very interesting course for those not looking at a future in the field. Lectures weere interesting and guest speakers added a nice element. Tests could be a little tricky.",
    "Yes, I would since it is probably the only biology class that synthesizes what you have learned in the biology major and applies it to concepts relevant to what is occurring in the real world."
