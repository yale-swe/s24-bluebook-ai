   "comments": [
    "Class became a lecture (about 35 people). Good introduction, but certain class members will dominate the discussion (i.e. people who have studied Islamic or other religious law and those who follow it).",
    "I would say this class has advanced material, a lot of reading, but if you're interested even tangentially in the material take it. It's an awesome course, you are in class with law\/graduate\/undergraduate students, so you get a diversity of opinions and thoughts. Definitely highly recommend, very much my favorite class of the year.",
    "An intense and very informative experience for all levels.",
    "Take this class if you have a strong background in Islam and legal systems.",
    "This year the seminar was more focused on the application of shari'a in the are of public law (in the past it was more focused on legal methods and other foundational questions). Professor Marchis obviously brilliant and leads a class very well. Not too work intensive, basically just a bunch of reading with a term paper at the end. I would definitely recommend it, though I would warn that it's not the most interactive seminar if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone who is able to motivate THEMSELVES to do the reading (which is very interesting and worthwhile). It's easy to \"get away with\" not having done the reading, but that means you won't get much out of the class, which is primarily readings-based.",
    "I think the class will definitely appeal to people who are interested in law, or Islamic religion, or inter-cultural issues.",
    "This course was a seminar in name only. Prof. March didn't really cap the class, so we ended up having about 30, maybe 35 people in a seminar room with some sitting on the floor. As such, the environment wasn't necessarily what I was looking for. Add to that Prof. March's seemingly encyclopedic knowledge and tendency toward verbal diarrhea, and the product is a \"seminar\" course in which I got talked at an awful lot.The material itself was pretty engaging, though I wish I had read more. The contemporary country studies were helpful, though a little bit more systematic study of the foundations of Islamic jurisprudence would have been helpful. I really liked the flexibility in the readings - Prof. March didn't expect us to read everything, and was OK with that.Overall, I was a little disappointed.",
    "This course is kind of like a survey course but much more advanced. If you don't have that much background knowledge when it comes to this topic, I'd say take an introductory course in Islamic law beforehand because the class will move quickly.",
    "Take it if you want a feel of Islamic law and its issues..",
    "yeah, if you're interested in the subject its a great class."
