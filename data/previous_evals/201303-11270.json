    "This class is a fantastic introduction to semiconductor devices. All the topics covered are extremely interesting and detailed (assuming you find solid state devices interesting) and Prof Reed does a very good job presenting the material. He relies heavily on powerpoint, which is less than ideal, but other than that the class is amazing. The exams are super easy and straightforward. The labs are easy, but the writeups are extremely time consuming (10-15 pages each for 8 labs). You will learn a lot in this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The professor is great and has a way of translating complex ideas into things anyone can understand while still keeping enough technical information to keep everyone interested. Fair warning though, the lab reports are long and arduous but do reward you with a deeper understanding of the material than you could have otherwise.",
    "I felt like I learned a lot about the material in the course of the semester and the subject matter is pretty essential if you're interested in technology at all. The class is heavy on the physics side. There's a ton of work (8 labs that come out to around 15 pages on average and a problem set every week) but this is offset by a midterm and final pulled straight from the homeworks (for the most part).",
    "You learn so muchneat stuff in this class! It's a ton of work, but if Mary is still TA, she grades lab reports very leniently, taking the edge off the stress of the class.The class is psets + midterm + final + 8 labs\/lab reports, which are probably going to take you at least 10 hours apiece. So maybe don't take it as a fifth class, if avoidable.But you'll come out of here able to talk about band diagrams! And... okay, mostly band diagrams! You learn how MOSFETs and BJTs and diodes work and you feel AWESOME. And your lab report writing abilities and your confidence in them will go way way up (unless you're already good at writing lab reports, which is fine too, I'm sure).Mark Reed is a fantastic person, but lectures were a little boring. I got most of my knowledge from reading the textbook and googling information for the lab reports.Highly recommended even if it's not a requirement for you!",
    "This was an interesting class, especially if you are interested in learning about how transistors work."
