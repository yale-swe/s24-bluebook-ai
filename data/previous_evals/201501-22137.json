    "Great class, expanding the knowledge of french culture, history as well.",
    "Overall, I got a lot out of French 140. However, it's a huge time commitment, a lot of work and the homework is not always helpful for improving your French; it's often just busy work.",
    "This class is a lot of work. Be prepared for that, stay on top of assignments. It isn't an easy language. You will improve though. You will be corrected if you do something wrong. You will build a tough skin, and just keep trying. Even if it feels like you aren't getting better.",
    "If they can take it with Koizim, yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone trying to improve their French, both grammatically and speaking\/reading\/listening-wise.",
    "Great class! Take it with Mme. Koizim if you can!",
    "As this is my second French class at Yale, I've found that the French department is structured very well. A lot of the grammar I learned was new to me, but not exceedingly difficult to pick up. I would definitely recommend this course and I can tell a lot of work went into getting it into the polished state it is in now.",
    "it's a great opportunity to increase your French language abilities. koizim is fantastic, challenging and fun. class never gets boring and she'll push you to do your best work. I feel more fluent in French and also very excited to learn more!"
