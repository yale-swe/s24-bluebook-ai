    "Interesting class on isotopes. Not ridiculously difficult, but Saunders has some old school methods.",
    "Saunders is really helpful if you need help. His Powerpoints really explain the majority of the class.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 437 to upperclassmen in the major who are looking for an interesting advanced lecture that has little work outside of class. There were supposed to be problem sets during the course of the semester (not for a grade), but they were never given. Saunders only tests on material from the class so make sure you do go to lecture. If you do miss, Saunders will give you the powerpoint slides eventually, even though it might be one or two lectures before the exam. Lecture can be pretty dry, but Saunders has some great stories from his long tenure at Yale."
