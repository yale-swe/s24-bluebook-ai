    "I learned that daily practice and dedication in addition to working regularly with my peers in class-conversations are extremely useful and acquiring a true understanding of a language.",
    "I feel this course provided me with a good overview of conversational italian.",
    "Solidified my grammar understanding and engaged more extensively with Italian culture through more film screenings.",
    "I learned how to be more comfortable speaking another language.",
    "I learned about the Italian language and its grammar and Italian culture.",
    "I wouldn't say I \"learned\" too much new grammar, but this class definitely helped me perfect the grammar I already knew and also helped me learn new vocab.",
    "Improvement of mastery of the Italian language, including speaking and reading\/comprehension",
    "Conversation, theme-specific vocabulary, cultural literacy (texts, films, talks, art history)."

   "comments": [
    "Strength - I liked the interactive aspects of the course - everyday included much in class-conversation. Weakness - the course included a lot of extra, not especially meaningful, work. The workbook exercises were helpful to an extent, but after a certain point, and a lot of time, it becomes busy work.",
    "A definite strength of the course was the everyday conversational element. I feel as though much of the italian that I learned came through conversational application, as opposed to writing or exercise based learning. In particular, conversations that forced me to use new grammatical concepts were very helpful. A weakness of the class was the italian tables. Although they represent an extra form of conversational practice, they were redundant when compared to the level of conversation practiced in the everyday classroom. Likewise, the fact that tables were open to all levels allowed for a wide variety of interaction, but also hampered conversation.",
    "The strength of the course is that it makes you more confident in your grammar skills. At the same time, I believe its weakness is that it doesn't do much more than go over grammar (which we already mostly learned in L2). I also do not think Italian tables are necessary because we already have class everyday. I do however think that Italian events and talks should be encouraged even more.",
    "The textbook was not great and a bit hard to follow. I also don't feel like I made much progress from the first two semesters.",
    "I enjoyed learning about Italian culture through the films we watched in class. I also enjoyed the discussion based class time as it allowed to me to practice spoken Italian. I thought the class moved at a fair pace; however, I thought that more advanced grammar could have been taught. It seemed to repeat all of the grammar taught in L1 and L2. Also, a new textbook should replace the one currently assigned for the course.",
    "Pretty good all around. Nothing major to change other than potentially eliminating the need for Italian tables.",
    "Could be improved by doing less busywork and less handouts, and more interactive sessions\/practice speaking.",
    "The daily practice of Italian conversation, learning vocab and grammar day by day, etc.",
    "Professor Quinlan was great, but the textbook was not. The old \"Parliamo Italiano\" book is better organized and is more user friendly."

   "comments": [
    "For a language requirement, Italian was a good choice, but I probably would not take it as an extra class.",
    "This class was a good way to cap off, for those students ending at Level 3, conversational italian in a way where it becomes functionally useful.",
    "I would recommend only if it is necessary or if you are looking for a stronger base for Italian grammar. The teachers are great and the atmosphere of class is active, but the material is not all too engaging.",
    "It is a perfectly fine class. Not a terrible way to do the language requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is at a comfortable level with Italian and wishes to improve their vocabulary and speaking skills.",
    "Great class, as is standard in the Italian department.",
    "Yes, I would recommend ITAL 130 to other students.",
    "Well, you've made it this far in Italian. L3 is mostly a review of L1 and L2 with some extra vocab and grammatical rules. Overall, if you have a good teacher, not a bad course. And I had fun learning from Professor Quinlan."
