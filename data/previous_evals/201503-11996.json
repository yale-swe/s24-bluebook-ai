   "comments": [
    "Yes, great class. Work is manageable and interesting. Highly recommend!",
    "Introduction into how health, inequality, and economic development are related.",
    "Definitely a worthwhile class for students interested in global health, development, and equality in health access. There is discussion on some basic development theories, and then how they apply to health access. The final paper is also an awesome opportunity to play with data and find patters in health access in the real world. I would recommend this class.",
    "Take it! A good econ seminar, not too too much work (3 critques and a final paper), the reading is interesting, and you'll come out the other side more knowledgable.",
    "If it's being offered, definitely take HI&D. Nicoli is super legit, brilliant, and nice. As someone who isn't as vocal in discussions, it was nice that class participation was not factored into the final grade. While the readings were quite heavy some weeks, they were all very interesting and the assignments were pretty straightforward. Nicoli grades fairly and is willing to read over rough drafts\/help you however possible. Definitely seek her out if you are struggling! She basically just wants to confirm, through the assignments, that you are keeping up with the material and thinking critically about the topics. She also values good writing, so make sure that your essays and final project are well-written.",
    "This is a solid seminar for anyone interested in global health, development economics, national and global policies for health and poverty, and\/or inequalities in developing countries. For econ majors, this is probably one of the most meaningful and interesting ways to fulfill the senior requirement. One plus: this is one of the few econ seminars where you won't be surrounded by banking\/finance-types, and I thought the mix of econ, EP&E, global affairs, bio, and global health students gave class discussions a great dynamic. The reading load was heavier than expected, but your 3 shorter papers will draw primarily from the readings and are fairly interesting to write. Professor Nattrass gives great comments on your papers, and is open to discussing a wide range of perspectives inside and outside of class. There is one longer final research paper at the end where you will use STATA, but Professor Nattrass takes the class to the Statlab to walk through the STATA commands together, so the analysis part of the project is not too difficult at all. All in all a very enjoyable and manageable seminar applicable across many majors!",
    "Yes. Take it!!",
    "I would recommend it. No participation is required so you can just listen to her expertise."
