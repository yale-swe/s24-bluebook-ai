   "comments": [
    "Great for students who want to brush up on their calculus and learn the basics of stata programming. I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone as long as Professor Lloyd Greiger is teaching it.",
    "I would recommend the course for mathphobes and math nerds alike. As someone who belongs to the former category, I was surprised that I actually started enjoying the calculus. I also enjoyed the STATA portion of the course and applying the ideas we learned to research.",
    "I would recommend this course to most, if not all, first year IR students. I think that it is accessible and applicable to students of diverse backgrounds and concentrations. It is also a good jumping-off point for future quantitative courses.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in Stata programming, especially to those who intend to take quantitative classes in the following semesters.",
    "It is a good course and Professor Grieger is an exceptional professor. However, you might get bogged down in the STATA in the second half of the course and I am not confident that you will actually leave the course \"with an applied understanding of how quantitative methods are used as tools for analysis in public\/international affairs,\" as the syllabus states.",
    "This course is perfect for understanding all of the calculus and mathematics that is often seen in reach papers within the field of social sciences. The course starts with pure calculus but the professor has then customized it especially for students of social science who then learn to use these tools to interpret data - which is especially important if you intend to do some sort of statistical research. Although the course does not fulfill any core requirements (which I think it should be considered for), I highly recommend this course to other students. A lot of the articles and research papers that we were reading in other classes like Economic Analysis were easier to analyze due to what I learned in this class.",
    "This should be a required class. I'm grateful that, not only am I no longer intimidated by regression analysis, I can actually speak the language and run the program myself. It blows my mind that I'm actually recommending statistical analysis as a \"fun\" class, but so be it. Lloyd is that good."

   "comments": [
    "Learning STATA will be avaluable asset, and understanding the different regressions will help in evaluating research and articles in the future.",
    "This course helped me better understand (and question) some of the important quantitative analyses made by World Bank, on Russia's integration to the World Trade Organization.",
    "I have more knowledge in statistics, STATA and quantitative methods that can be used to analyze public\/international affairs."
