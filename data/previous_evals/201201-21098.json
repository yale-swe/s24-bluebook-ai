   "comments": [
    "This is a great class not only for economic historians but also for anyone wants to learn how to do historical research. I would recommend it.",
    "I found HIST 798 very helpful for me as a survey of the main questions of economic history, as well as an elucidation of methodologies in economic history. I would recommend the course to any student interested in working on economic history, regardless of their particular topic.",
    "Overall, the course was excellent. It started with the methodological tensions between economics and history as disciplines, and through the lens of credit, it then examined a wide variety of scenarios where similar problems existed historically. Importantly, both Professors Lamoreaux and Trivellato tag-teamed well."

   "comments": [
    "I have learned how to critically read academic papers and how to write academic review essays from this class. It is very helpful for my future study.",
    "I am interested in working on economic history, but prior to this had not formally looked at it as a sub-discipline. The course increased my comfort level with economic topics as well as theoretical economics readings; I will ultimately incorporate both of these into my research.",
    "In probing the methodological tensions of economic history, this course offered me a much better lens through which to reconcile the ahistorical tendencies of economics with the inherent contingency of history. This conceptualization will definitely contribute to my further writing in economic history."
