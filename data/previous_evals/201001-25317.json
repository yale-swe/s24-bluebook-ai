    "Although I wasn't thrilled with the books we read, the class was a lot of fun - a very relaxed six-person seminar led mostly by Prof. Byrne. She's the main reason to take this class: she's knowledgeable and tries to make even dry literature a lot of fun (although there is a 15 page paper at the end of the class instead of a final). If you're not into the time period, skip it and try to take another with her instead.",
    "Profesora Byrne is fantastic! Very smart and very encouraging to her students.",
    "This was a good class, not too much reading and basically no work other than reading (just an open book midterm and a final paper). Professor Byrne is also great.",
    "I would recommend the class. While the subject itself isn't that interesting, Dr. Byrne leads a really interesting class and is always interested in what her students have to say."
