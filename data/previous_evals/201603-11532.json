    "I liked how the course hit such a wide variety of topics. While some of the guest lecturers were good, I actually would have rather had Shapiro teach all the classes because he's a great lecturer.",
    "Really enjoyed writing my responses for the take-home midterm and final - felt I learnt a lot through this process and it is generally a far better way to test than setting in class exams that are often rushed and don't allow for thorough exploration of the material.",
    "The guest lectures were really good and Professor Shapiro placed a lot of emphasis on bringing outside experts which was great. I think a smaller class size would be able to better stimulate discussion"

    "Good class, a little dry at times, but the material is worthwhile. Shapiro is a great lecturer.",
    "Yes, very interesting course and you will gain a lot of knowledge. Shapiro is an excellent Professor and he brings in great guest speakers from all across a range of disciplines.",
    "Yes for the interesting course material and if youre looking for a small and laid back lecture class. Definitely not like a seminar in its format."
