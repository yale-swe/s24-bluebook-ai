   "comments": [
    "Take it. The work-load isn't heavy (though the assigned reading is - learn what to skim) and the short papers are fun to write. Interesting and diverse range of topics and readings.",
    "Starting from property rights and the rise of the modern corporation, it then covered a variety of regulations in different areas of the economy before ending with a discussion on the complex relationship between capitalism and democracy.I would recommend it if you are interested in the material, otherwise, it could be boring.",
    "Not disinteresting, but nothing blew my mind. The class topics felt fragmented and didn't come to much as a whole.",
    "Good class that fills EPE requirements but might be relevant for non-majors too, particularly poli sci majors. It is a solid classroom experience and worthwhile class. The readings are moderate-to-heavy but the writing is light (only a half dozen 2-3 page papers and revisions of those papers, no midterm or final). The class is mostly about interest group politics and that theme may get a bid old after a while, so if you don't want to study that in-depth probably look elsewhere. While definitely not necessary since there are no difficult calculations, economics terms are thrown around a lot so a background in basic macroeconomics will help out.",
    "I would recommend this class to students in the EPE major who like debating and who want to learn more about the history of political influence in different markets. Warning: The class isn't particularly amenable to students of a more conservative persuasion.",
    "Politics and Markets was a really great seminar. I now feel I have a good understanding of basic questions and dilemmas in political economy. Strengths of the course include the selection of readings, which were invariably really interesting and intellectually stimulating, and Professor Swenson's presentations of the topics.",
    "Absolutely not."
