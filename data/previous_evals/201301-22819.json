    "This class was among THE BEST I have taken at Yale (probably the BEST actually); I do not say this lightly. The instructors are incredibly knowledgeable and approachable--they make the material digestible and even humorous at times. The content, while specific to Russia, engages with the traditional European canon as well. Having never before taken an art history class, Russian and Soviet Art was the perfect foray into art history: I developed skills of formal analysis, and knowledge about general movements in art, as well as movements specific to Russian art in particular. We learned an incredible amount: fromdynamics in the art marketplace, to photography, post-modernism, performance art, and icons--and it was all incredibly interesting, well-taught, and meaningful. This class made me better able to appreciate art and specifically, allowed me to understand abstract art, which I had previously (wrongly) dismissed; I feel like I've become a MUCH more cultured person through the class, no joke. I cannot sing the praises of this class enough. Seriously.",
    "It is very interesting, but a little bit hard to follow at times. Also, the underlying themes are not emphasized enough",
    "The Russian Art class was by far the best class I took this semester. The entire course is built around inteoducing art that we are not normally exposed for since Art History is very much Western Based. Because of that the class is taught in a way that straddles the world between a specialized and introductory class. That being said it is that dual nature of the class that makes it so great and really the perfect art history class to take. The professors are absolutely amazing and their lectures are the best and will likely be among the best I will ever have at Yale. In general the readings are dense but very interesting, correlating extremely well with the class.in general you will come to class sit down and for the next 50 minutes take notes almost nonstop as you get led through an amazing and rarely seen art history universe. This class is great for anyone and you will without a doubt learn so much.",
    "Take this class! It's a great introduction to not just Russian art but the study of art history in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, just because it was so fascinating.",
    "If you have any interest in art and\/or Russia, I'd definitely take this! It's very well-taught, and the professors know their stuff. It's a great look into Russia's history and culture.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, but especially to art history majors. This is a good introductory level art history class because it traces the history of art in Russia and links it to all the major European movements of the time, so it provides a good foundation of major movements, while specifying the angle to Russia, which is a unique angle. Professor Brunson and Professor Taroutina are really great at teaching formal analysis as well. Their eloquent lectures were very interesting and never dry, and I found myself writing down a lot of what they said because they had a lot of quotable moments. Overall an amazing class!",
    "YES! Take this class. It might be my favorite lecture thus far at Yale; all three teachers are knowledgeable and enthusiastic lecturers and the material covered is incredibly varied and interesting. I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "TAKE IT. It is a great course.",
    "Even if you have no idea what \"Russian art\" is, or don't know anything about Russian culture, this is a great art history class to take. I had never taken an art history class before, and this was a really different and fun experience. We spent a lot of the weekly sections in the YUAG, interacting with art and analyzing works we were studying.This class not only allows you to learn history through art, but also to understand art and some of the theory behind it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. Really great work and essential knowledge and understandings of USSSR",
    "This course is a survey of Russian art, which is underknown but amazing! The lectures are almost all totally fascinating, the art is beautiful, fun to write about, and the assignments are more fun than they are difficult. I totally recommend it to anyone."
