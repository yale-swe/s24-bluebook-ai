    "Take it.",
    "I don't think this course is being offered again. However if it is, I would recommend that you shop it the first 2 weeks (you'll get the main ideas, which will only get repeated over and over and over) and get a copy of the syllabus, and then read all of the papers on it that relate to the topics you're interested in. Everything worthwhile can be learned by reading the papers. It's a great class to audit. But I wish I'd taken a different class for credit. And if you do take this, don't Cr\/d, you can get a decent grade with marginally more effort.",
    "If you like Macroeconomics and\/or Econometrics, take this course. If not, then don't. You get what you expect and I loved how the course was presented. Most Macro topics were touched upon, though not much about finance or credit intermediation or trade. A very nice lecture on China, as you can expect from Roach. Nic Werquin was a bright and helpful TA, one of the best you can ask for.",
    "Take it. I'm a senior, and this is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. I almost didn't take it, and I'm so glad I did. Highly recommended.",
    "This course summarizes the opposing viewpoints on several contentious topics in economics using the most up to date literature available. It's a fabulous course for anyone interested in economics or really the way the world works.",
    "This has been my favorite class at Yale so far. After taking this class, I feel like I can actually speak intelligibly about various topics in economics. It takes the foundations that you learn in the core econ. classes and applies them to real life issues and debates. At first, the class was somewhat intimidating, and the homeworks can be hard, but do not let that deter you from takings this class. I strongly recommend it.",
    "If you're interested in current economic issues and want to find out what's going on with things like the debate over the fiscal cliff, trade issues with China, the European debt crisis and the underlying problems with European economies, the effects of the recent recession, the rise of emerging markets, and other such important issues, then you should definitely take this class. The workload is pretty light and the readings are short but very relevant to current economic debates. The professors are pretty good, although I feel like they agree on too many issues (although the class is called \"Debates in Macro\"). They also involve students in class discussions even though it's a lecture, which I think really adds to the learning experience. Overall a good, solid class.",
    "Not a \"debates in macro\" course so much as a \"the current state of macro\" course. The difference is subtle but important. I expected each subject to have clearly presented opposing opinions, but you have to do a lot of this synthesis on your own in the problem sets, which always ask you to take a side on an issue. Often this became more of an exercise in twisting words to fit the assignment than in actually learning what the papers were about, but overall I'd still recommend it. DO THE READINGS -- especially the Roach ones. Following the Roach readings throughout the course is a good reference point for everything else you learn and he writes in a laid-back and easy to read style.",
    "Awesome course, definitely recommend it. Learn things that you wouldn't learn in the rest of the econ department. There's a lot of reading but you don't really have to do it. The professors are both great and have a good dynamic.",
    "You talk about a lot of things relatively superficially and almost everyone gets A's. Tick and tick.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is stuff that everyone should know about. Lectures are interesting and funny. Both professors are great.",
    "Yes. Take this course if you are interested in finance-related industries. The terminologies and methodologies discussed in this class are super useful for your future interviews. It is also the economic class that does not focus on mathematics and theories, but more on the researches of current issues. It is also a good course to take if you are interested in global economics.",
    "It is a class that teaches general important economic issues in the current context. You would come away better informed and well-equipped to understand what is going on in the current world. It is a must-take, whether you are an economics major or not.",
    "Best class I've taken yet at Yale. Professors Roach and Tsyvinski are focused most on making students think critically about macroeconomic policy, and care very little about difficult testing and grading. The class has no memorizing models and learning theorems, instead it is entirely focused on how macroeconomics actually fit into the real world. Definitely definitely take this course! (Workload is a midterm and final, both very straightforward, and five fairly time-intensive homework assignments.)",
    "I strongly recommend ECON 185! The first lecture will seem dull and boring, don't let it fool you! I think all serious econ majors should take this course. It introduces you to the major economic debates of today. You will become well-versed in modern economic research. This course finally gave me a chance to apply my economics education to real-world questions. We discussed everything in this class, giving a broad introduction to various topics. ECON 185 is a great place to start your Junior\/Senior years in the Economics major.Note: The professors will cold call students to give their opinions. Don't be afraid! They're aren't checking to see if you did the reading. They just want to hear your opinion on a topic. Be smart and be quick.",
    "Highly recommend this class",
    "A must take for any student interested in studying economics or simply understanding how the global economy operates.",
    "The course is great, absolutely take it. Lectures are fascinating, the readings are not that long and most of the topcis covered are ones that all economics students should know about.",
    "Professors are humorous and great but beware that the class is generally focused around maybe 5 \/ 6 main ideas that just get regurgitated over and over again.",
    "Definitely recommended. You learn so much, even if you aren't themost well-versed in Econ. The professors are a great combination. Classes tend to be very enjoyable, the type you look forward to showing up to. The professors try and learn everyone's names eventually, which was nice. Class was often filled with laughs, as the professors tend to like cracking jokes. They also tend to have viewpoints that differ from the standard Yale stuff, which was refreshing. That being said, don't let the title confuse you. This class is about the currently debated topics in Macroeconomic theory and policy, but don't expect the professors to disagree on much, as they mostly agree on everything. They usually present some evidence from both sides but definitely tend to lean towards what they agree with to some extent. Not the hardest course to do well in. The homework is due about every other week, and can tend to take a while but they aren't terribly difficult and are at least somewhat open ended. The exams are pretty straight forward if you have done the readings and have been showing up to lecture. Otherwise I don't see how one could complete them very well.",
    "Probably the best economics class I've every taken. Everything I know about today's economy, I owe it to this class. I can talk about the fiscal cliff, QE3, Europe's sovereign debt crisis, the causes of the 2008 crisis etc comfortably all because of this class. Super practical, and covers a wide range of macro topics. Very high level and recent research papers were used but the profs managed to summarize the key concepts during class. TAKE IT."
