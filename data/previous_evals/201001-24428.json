   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in a survey of wind energy. Don't expect much depth, or very intense work. It is best if you are interested in a career in alternative energy since it explains many concepts that would remain mysterious without a survey.",
    "If you're interested in alternative energy or just wind power, it's worth taking this class. The field is much more complex and interesting than many give it credit for, and this class serves as a good introduction. Plus, the guest lectures from industry insiders give you perspectives you wouldn't find elsewhere.",
    "The class has only been taught for a couple of years, so the format hasn't really stabilized yet and might be changed. But we learned a lot of useful material on both the scientific and engineering aspects of wind energy, and the economics of the industry. I especially liked seeing guest lecturers from Vestas and GE (turbine manufacturers) and Noble (a wind energy developer), which convinced me that there are good jobs in atmospheric science outside of academia, and we also got to take a field trip to the new 100 kW turbine on the New Haven Harbor and even got to look up inside the tower. I would recommend having taken intro micro, because Idon't know how I would've understood the economics portion of the course without it.",
    "Good if you're looking for an interdisciplinary overview of the subject, but does not provide a high level of detail.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in going into the renewable energy industry, but you can find better classes if you just want an elective. If the class is still half a credit, though, it's a great way to round out your total Yale credits.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students interested in a career in wind energy. It does not teach you everything you need to know, or even come close to that, but it is helpful in filling you in on parts of the business you might have missed. Student presentations are a good learning experience and give good presentation practice, and the guest lectures are excellent.",
    "I think it is a useful class for people who do not have a much previous exposure to the specifics of the topic. participation of graduate school students makes the course quite interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend to another student. It's a great class, and provides valuable information for people interested in the wind industry.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone focused on energy - but would caution them about entering it with great expectations. You'll learn a fair amount about wind energy but you won't get as much or go as deep as you might want to. Again, in fairness, it's a seminar, not a traditional class. The course leaders are very open to improving the course, though, so suggestions for projects, field trips, guest speakers etc, would probably be met favorably.",
    "Great class. Student presentations cover most geographies and relevant subjects and were as useful as the lectures. The class is definitely recommended to anyone who plans career in renewable energy, utilities, international development."
