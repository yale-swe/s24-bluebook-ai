   "comments": [
    "A very valuable class for theorists, musicologists and other musicians or those with an interest in the history of musical thought. Some background knowledge of Kant and German idealist philosophy may be useful, and (although it is not an absolute requirement) some German (and to a lesser extent French) reading knowledge can really enrich the experience of the course. A useful foundation for understanding the 20th century both in terms of music and philosophy\/ culture and politics.",
    "Very good general introduction.",
    "The course covers the most important primary sources in the history of music theory and aesthetics of the nineteenth century. It involves some study of original documents, but much of the information about the sources is provided through secondary readings such as articles in the Cambridge History of Western Music Theory. I would strongly recommend this course to any student in the theory program, because the content is essential for the portion of the comprehensive exam on history of theory, and because an awareness of this background can enrich research and teaching.",
    "I would say that this seminar was more lecture-based than other graduate seminars in the Music Department, but that's just the way I like it. The reading load is definitely manageable. It's a great foundational class for any musicologist or music theorist to have under their belt.",
    "Definitely take it. It is an invaluable course for gaining a breadth of knowledge about music in the nineteenth-century and aesthetic and theoretical ideas about it.",
    "Yes, because the material is essential.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student, regardless of their specialty in either history of theory. It provided an excellent survey of theoretical and aesthetic issues of the period in question and I fully anticipate taking what I learned in this course and referencing it in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Not necessarily directly relevant to my own research, but an invaluable preparation for better understanding the late 19th and early 20th centuries - particularly with regards to the way in which German idealist and romantic philosophy shaped German culture and in turn concert and musical culture. And indubitably a valuable foundation for teaching later on.",
    "I have a better overview of the 19th century now.",
    "This course could be understood as offering some of the most crucial background necessary for historical awareness of the development of many fundamental assumptions in music theory scholarship. Even if my research does not deal directly with the history of theory, this course will undoubtedly improve my ability to situate ideas in relation to nineteenth-century developments in theory and explicit or implicit aesthetic values.",
    "McCreless is great with providing context. He was always tying developments in the nineteenth century to contemporary strains in our discipline and things that current scholars are doing (or have been doing). Yes, McCreless is a master of context. He was always tying it all together in ways that were very relevant and very useful no matter what area of music history or theory a student plans to enter.",
    "Very much."
