    "I loved my instructors for Chinese. Since we didn't have any one instructor, but they rotated among themselves, we got to see many different personalities and accents, which helped with our learning and kept the class fun. I would recommend",
    "Chinese is the best class I have taken at Yale (and the most work!) Every moment of class time is spent well, and the teachers are brilliant and lovely.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. Learning a non Indo-European language has always been one of my desires, and the Chinese department was one of the best. It is a commitment that you have to be willing to spend time on. If you are not willing to learn the characters every night, it will catch up on you. If you do, the amount that you will take in is incredible."
