   "comments": [
    "This class allows for an extremely interesting and provocative dive into some of the major issues surrounding consent, coercion, and the line between good\/bad sex. I also enjoyed the interdisciplinary approach of the class (mixing classical feminist and queer theory with legal cases and theory, political science, and literature), though the fact that students came in with such a wide range of knowledge-bases in the area of consent theory was sometimes difficult.I would recommend this class especially to students with a background and\/or interest in reading and analyzing social\/political theory, since it greatly helps when grappling with the more difficult material.",
    "Raises the discussion of sexual consent through different lenses - class, race, age difference, and \"alternative sexualities\" and illegal practices such as necrophilia, consensual HIV transfer, etc. Interesting but not sure what my takeaway is...Difficult if you are not a WGSS major, not because of the material, but because of classmates.",
    "Look at the reading list. You're going to 'map out' the components of the media (readings, films, etc.) and then discuss the 'tough questions'. It's a pretty straight-forward seminar, except that you occasionally do little break out group talks which can be awkward.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject. Prof. Fischel is great and extremely engaging! There isn't too much reading and the workload is manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course. I found it incredibly useful to try to think logically about questions of consent while simultaneously examining how many of my views on consent are socially and culturally shaped."
