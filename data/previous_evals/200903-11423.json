   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in graphic design, take the course. You'll figure out if you have a talent for it as well as whether or not it's something you want to pursue.",
    "Intro Graphic Design is a great class. If you're at all interested in graphic design, whether or not you think you're good at art, you should take it.",
    "You won't learn that much about graphic design, formally speaking, but assignments, practice and feedback make up the majority of the course. Sometimes you feel like you have no idea what to do, but that's part of the fun--nobody is sure exactly what the framework is. You will feel much more comfortable discussing and executing design concepts.",
    "YES, DEFINITELY TAKE IT!!!",
    "This is a terrific introduction to graphic design. If you have a fairly extensive background in the topic, the projects can seem a bit basic and you may find yourself struggling to achieve the level of critique on your work that you may be looking for. That said, the projects are interesting and require you to think in different ways and consider the different tools in the graphic designer's toolkit. There are weekly projects, with time commitments ranging from 3 hours to 15 hours to complete. The first half of the course is entirely manual with the second half focusing on digital composition. Ultimately, like any art class, you'll get out of it what you put into it. And take the course with Julian if you can. He's so nice and let's you work digitally towards the end, which you don't get in the other section.",
    "Yes! Makes you see the whole world with a designer's eye.",
    "I strongly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in a more structured course with pointed, useful critiques. Be prepared to spend a lot of time at the Digital Media Center for the Arts (DMCA). Additionally, prepare to spend three times as long as you think you will there; the printers are constantly broken, the technical support is awful and the software on their computers is not tailored for design work, but rather, photography. Just a heads up.",
    "Intro to Graphic Design is a wonderful starter art class. If you are looking for a class that might offer some variety in homework, or are decidedly interested in art, the class has something to offer everyone.",
    "Do not take this class if you expect to learn a great deal about graphic design on computers. It is a theory-based design course and there is very little emphasis on technique. Good introduction to the field, but you won't become a wiz on Photoshop.",
    "Art 132 is an introduction to the theories and basics of graphic design. The course leads the students through a series of assignments of increasing complexity, from collecting themed images to a final branding assignment involving a logotype, poster, catalog cover, and personal collection. The course examines the multiple uses of graphic design and offers the students a chance to work with several different aspects of it. I would totally recommend the course to other students, both inside and outside the Art major.",
    "Be prepared to spend tons of time on your assignment each week and receive little-to-no gratification for your efforts. Sometimes really fun, sometimes not.",
    "take it if you're good at art and\/or prepared to teach yourself a lot",
    "Definitely recommend. It's a nice change from other classes with written work, gives you a new way of thinking."
