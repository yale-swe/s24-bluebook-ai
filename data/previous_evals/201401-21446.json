    "Take it for a decent CS elective, or if you want to do a final project.",
    "This class is not an easy A. It's still much easier than classes like 421 or 422. Honestly this class is pretty boring. The material in the first half of the term is kind of boring and simple but you will learn how to use SQL. In the second half you learn details about database implementation and I think that was fun to learn, but Avi's lectures made it seem dry and there was just one short homework assignment on it which is ridiculously little. Too much of the grade depends on the exams, and the exams test too many basic definitions and too little advanced concepts. The final project seems like a cool part of the class but it's only 20% of the grade and the guidelines are not very concise and I have no idea what it will be graded on. I wish this class had more assignments and that the lectures were more interactive instead of based on slides.",
    "Ehh. 2 tests (not trivial, despite what you may have heard), 3 psets and a project. Psets are easy. Project needs more definition and is a huge pain unless you are used to coding up your own stuff (i.e. you are essentially given no guidance to do your project whatsoever). Project also has little to nothing with material learned in course. Basically, this is an ok course, but the project addition this term vaults it into not so good course territory. However, without the project the workload would be trivial...so some more work must be done. Adding an ill-defined project was not the correct way to do this.",
    "Course consisted of 3 homeworks, a midterm, a final, and a project. The project comes at the end of the semester and is supposed to be a substantial effort, and use databases to do something interesting. The final was difficult, as the TA said it would be. The class is accessible for non-CS majors, like me, as long as you have some previous experience in programming and CS.",
    "A good simple course to databases. Not too much work, but more in past years with the addition of a final project.",
    "This is one of the few easy courses in the CS department and it teaches you some very useful skills to boot. Silberschatz is a good professor whose lectures are actually worth going to. Even though the second midterm was much harder than the first and even though the final project turned out to be much more work than I anticipated, the workload in this class never felt unmanageable.",
    "Intro to Databases has become a pretty rigorous course thanks to Debayan.",
    "More work this year than you might expect because there was a project this year in addition to all of the other stuff, but the project turned out to be really fun",
    "Former gut. Still just as bad, but no longer easy. They added a big optionally-group project due after the end of finals. The lectures are terrible and nobody comes, but the exams expect understanding you would never get from the lectures or homework. Probably everyone got an A (I have literally no idea what my grade is) but it wasn't worth wondering. There were three assignments but they were never graded.",
    "If you want one foot in the door to databases, yes. If you want a relative easy CS elective where you don't really need to go to class for, yes. If you have an idea of a project involving databases which you really want to work on, yes. Otherwise, wait for Abadi's Database Systems.",
    "Do not take this class. I had so many options for 'worst class I've ever taken in Yale' this year but after much consideration I think this one wins.",
    "Don't take it if you don't need to or you're only interested in the practical side of databases. The class was too disorganized to really learn a lot",
    "This class teaches SQL and some theory about the underlying framework (hardware & software) to support a database. I would recommend it as an interesting class that teaches a useful skill (SQL). The homework and exams are straightforward. If you go to the classes and study the slides afterward, you'll do fine, but if you go into the exam without a full understanding of the material, you will not be able to figure it out at the last minute. At the end of the class, we worked in pairs to create small applications that used databases in some way, which required a fair bit of work. Lectures were quite fun.",
    "Memorization intensive course, in terms of the midterm and final. Not a lot of programming, but make sure you do the final project early. Problem sets were easy and sparse."
