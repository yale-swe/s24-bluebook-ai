   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in the English major (because it is a requirement) and\/or someone interested in English poetry. It was comprehensive and relevant. I would recommend it specifically with Professor Minnis since he was very willing to speak with students about papers and about understanding the text on a critical level.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking 125 with Professor Minnis especially if you're going to be an English major. He knows everything there is to know about Chaucer (and all the texts from the course). People hate 125, but I really enjoyed the readings--they're usually short to make up for the difficult material and the material becomes much easier as the semester goes on and you get used to the styles of the poets. Definitely learned a lot and the work wasn't so bad.",
    "A prerequisite for the English major, but not at all mundane. Professor Minnis is downright enlightening--the man is truly the foremost authority on all Middle English poetry, especially Chaucer. When you take 125, take it with Prof. Minnis! A great class.",
    "If you do not have to take this course for the English major, DO NOT take this course, unless you are truly interested in the authors and texts. It is NOT an easy writing credit - not the hardest you could take, but certainly not the least painful, either. It is incredibly boring, no matter who is teaching it. That being said, I would especially recommend not taking it with Professor Minnis. I would summarize this course as a introduction to some of the first texts of middle to modern English literature.",
    "Probably would not have taken this course if I weren't an English major; that said, I did enjoy parts of it. Some texts (Shakespeare!!!) are definitely better than others (had a lot of trouble getting through Spenser) but it's good to have an overview of these important texts. Professor Minnis is okay, really knows his stuff and happy to meet in office hours but guides discussion a little too heavy-handedly.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. Obviously, it must be taken if you wish to be an English major. But also, it is a good course to take if you want to learn about the most important early poets of our language.",
    "If you like 14th - 17th century English, including reading middle English, then this class is probably great. If you don't though, then it will not be a very enjoyable time. Minnis grades more strictly than other professors I've had (however, I didn't go to office hours, which probably would have helped). If you aren't an English major, and thus required to take this course (unless you do the four course substitution), there are other English classes you'll likely enjoy more. It's definitely not an easy writing credit to earn. Donne is fantastic though!",
    "ENGL 125 was a lot of work. The reading require close analysis and a high level of thinking, but overall it is a class that will teach you about the roots of the english language and how it can be used in a beautiful way."
