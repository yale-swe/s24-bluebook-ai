    "You will find that this section has considerably more busy work than 110. You will have many opportunities to speak French, which is helpful, but often times you spend more time FILLING time than spending it actively learning. A pleasant, but certainly not at all easy course, I enjoyed it despite how difficult it consistently was for me.",
    "Outstanding opportunity to continue study of French.",
    "You probably have to take this class because you took L1. It's the same format as L1, just that the grammar and vocab gets harder. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on French every week!",
    "French 120 is a continuation of French 110; nothing changes significantly. It gets harder but not significantly. French in Action stays the same as always. A very satisfying course to complete."
