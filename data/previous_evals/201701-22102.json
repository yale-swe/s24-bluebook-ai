   "comments": [
    "Strengths: A lot of personal attention to students because the class is small and there is a min of a professor and a TA who are native speakers. The professor also holds 2 Kiswahili tables(lunches with him and a TA, where one tries to speak only in Kiswahili and the teachers help them--a great way to let yourself speak and advance immensely into the language). Weaknesses: No use of videos or video materials. No use of listening materials. This cause you to get behind on getting used to speech of native speakers of the language. Sometimes the class also uses a lot of English instead of Kiswahili. Improvements: Use video and listening materials. Try to reinforce using Kiswahili as much as possible. Increase the level of difficulty in homework",
    "The class is very logically structured. It teaches useful Swahili vocab and grammar.",
    "Wonderfully taught and very fair workload. Kiarie does a great job meeting students where they are.",
    "This course was great. It was very engaging and I feel that I gained a lot from the course, beyond just basic ability to speak a language.",
    "This course is really accessible and the class becomes a community very quickly. There is a lot of content covered in a short period of time but regular assessments ensure that we stay on top of this."

   "comments": [
    "Great class to advance in Kiswahili grammar. Kiswahili grammar is pretty complex but very logical. TRY TO SPEAK ONLY IN KISWAHILI and try to make others do it too. That's the best way you can put the grammar into use. And if you don't the class can easily become people speaking in English about Kiswahili.",
    "I would definitely recommend Swahili L2. Mwalimu is wonderful, and the class is really useful. It is slightly more challenging that L1, but it is definitely okay.",
    "Yes! It's so much more personal than any other language department, and kiarie is literally one of the best teachers I've ever had.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you want to learn Kiswahili, this is a great class through which to build your foundation!"
