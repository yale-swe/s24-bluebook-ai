   "comments": [
    "This course was most useful in connecting many elements that I have studied at Yale, from development and security to human rights and diplomacy. It was a valuable addition to the degree.",
    "Absolutely! The class brings a great shift in rethinking governance and leadership in countries still struggling to establish functions of state. It is a class for everyone!",
    "Absolutely",
    "This is a class on development without an economics focus. It was very much focused on policy solutions to weak states. It was a macro level class that considered strategy and policy approaches, as opposed to microeconomics.",
    "GLBL771 is a rare opportunity to take a holistic, thematic approach to an issue that's usually obscured in the daily news cycle. I would recommend this class to any student interested in the threats and opportunities found in fragile states.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. If the course becomes a bit more structured, it will be even better. Perhaps the students could work on projects Clare has at her institute.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course for someone who is not interested in the academic discussion and more interested in the practical side of policy making.",
    "If you are interested in conflict or post-conflict societies, state building or development in general, this course is a great fit. Even if your academic\/professional focus is elsewhere, I would recommend it because it touches on issues and areas that are nowadays important for global affairs.",
    "I would describe the class as an examination of the international aid system, and the systemic failures that contribute to state weakness. I would most certainly recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in international development efforts because it demonstrates the various functions of a state and how external actors can best work to make these functions work more effectively."

    "It made me interested in more study of governance.",

    "This course taught me how to think outside the box regarding development issues.",
    "It improved my ability to write policy papers.",
