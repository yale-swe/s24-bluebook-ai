   "comments": [
    "A knowledge of the historical significance in a global context of Japan during the 16th to 19th century. You learn to think critically of primary sources and question western-centric sources.",
    "Fascinating information about the history of Japan. Became better at structured historical analysis through assigned writing projects and section debates.",
    "I have gained a deep knowledge on the complexities and grander themes of unity, sustainability, demographics, standard of living, and foreign policy of the Tokugawa era. I have been able to critically analyze the standard of livings and policies of Edo period Japan, how Japan led up to Tokugawa rule, and how this all affected the world in a greater scale.",
    "Great background of premodern Japanese history.",
    "Knowledge: Different aspects of Japan from 1550-1850 Skills: Several that relate academic historical analysis\/study, such as evaluation of sources, constructing historical arguments, analyzing primary texts and sources Insights: Japan has a fascinating history",
    "I learned the historical foundations of pre-modern Japan and challenged prevalent notions of Japan before Meiji Restoration.",
    "By taking this course, I developed a specific knowledge of Tokugawa Japan and how its demographics, social structures, and other characteristics add nuance to our perspectives on policy and history.",
    "This course enabled me to learn about a region I had little prior exposure to, even as a history major. It allowed me to reconsider previously held notions about Japan, sino-japanese relations, and the role of ecology in world history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: excellent lectures, understanding professor and TF's. Weakness: I think it would add to the structure of the course if students are required to pay greater attention to historical dates. Maybe, in addition to the map quiz, there should be a quiz on dates and periods in Japanese history.",
    "You must take this course. The readings can be a little dry at times (the final reading is terrible). You'll read about a little less than a hundred pages a week and go over it during section. Note that there is a huge disconnect between lectures and section (readings) so studying for exams can be tough. The essay prompts are engaging and the marking is fair (errs on the easy side).",
    "Strengths were Professor Drixler's lecture style and the incredibly interesting course material was enhanced by his curation. Weaknesses were the amount of reading required, which in some cases seemed unnecessary and excessive.",
    "Strengths: Well-designed and organized lectures Well-balanced readings. They're a little dry in the beginning but most are quite interesting and don't feel like busywork. TAs my year were fantastic Weaknesses: Sections of course always depend on the engagement of the people in them and how much reading they've done, which isn't the course's fault but is somewhat inevitable The first midterm is brutal in terms of time (50 min for a lot of writing)",
    "Dr. Drixler's thematic painting of a picture of Tokugawa Japan and the in-depth themes of the era were particularly helpful in learning about the era.",
    "The primary strength of this course is that it is so well organized for the interests of any Yale student; whatever major you might be, this is a course that will not be overly challenging and will probably still be quite intellectually fulfilling in some capacity. In addition, the prof and teaching assistants do care quite a lot about your learning, and will work with you to improve your writing\/historical analysis\/discussion skills throughout the course.",
    "The course was mostly flawless. Every lecture was highly engaging and entertaining. The assignments reflected our learning very well. The only thing that I would ask for is for there to be more instruction on how to write history papers. I think that in general, there was insufficient time spent teaching one how to write (I know that this isn't a writing credit but maybe a writing credit section would be useful as well).",
    "Strengths: a fantastic professor who has an EXCELLENT relationship with his TAs and with the students. The prof and TAs really wanted us to succeed and learn a lot! Exams were fair and encouraged you to show off what you had learned."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would. The course is an excellent introduction to Japanese History and culture. It is also a powerful instrument of looking at modern times and Western history.",
    "You must take this course before you graduate. Take it credit D first, and switch if the humanities are not your cup of tea. You must take this course.",
    "Definitely!",
    "This is a great history course. Well-designed and engaging. Professor Drixler is a fantastic lecturer with a knack for presenting material in an interesting way. History comes alive with people, rather than a mere parade of dates. He's also always willing to talk about Tokugawa Japan outside of the course--email exchanges about minutia are priceless. Great 5th class. Highly recommended.",
    "Definitely a course worth taking! As a first-year I am now considering a history major and am very excited to learn about more on East Asian history.",
    "Super interesting. Two papers that were mostly painless to write. Midterm and final that were easy if you were paying attention to the stories told in class and thought about the implications a little on your own time.",
    "This course is designed such that you will get as much out of it as you put in, both knowledge-wise and grade wise. It is very clear how you can get a good grade (and many students do) and you do not have to be a history-nut or a genius to do this. Furthermore, this course is equally well designed for students who are very interested in history or East Asian studies, as it is for those who might not be as interested in either of those subjects. Furthermore, Professor Drixler is an amazing human being. He will send you the notes from the review sessions before the exams and does take great care to make sure that you are enjoying the course and getting something out of it, as he designed the course such that anyone can take it and enjoy it. For those who do not like HU credits, this is probably the best course to fulfill the requirement. The downsides of this course is that there is a lot of reading, and you will probably have to do it to do well in section and on the papers\/tests. However, if you do put in the effort to just complete them, you will find success in the course. I would particularly recommend the course to students who have no exposure to East Asian history but have some interest; I came from a background without any East Asian history, and I gained some remarkable insights through the course materials. Having taken this course as a freshman, I would equally recommend it to first years who want to experience a \"Yale History course\" that is not overly challenging but will give them a taste of what history courses are like here. During your final exam, you might get a lucky treat if you stay...",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, absolutely take this course.",
    "Yes, this course was one of the most engaging, informative, and satisfying lecture classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes especially if that student is interested in Japanese history.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you have any interest at all in Japan or Japanese history, take this course. If you're interested in any sort of East Asian studies, take this course. Overall, this is just a really thought-provoking, interesting course that any Yalie will enjoy.",
    "This course was a great course - Professor Drixler's lectures were interesting and engaging, and the course itself was not too much work.",
    "Definitely! A must take even if you already have your pre-industrial credits or your Asia requirements.",
    "Great course",
    "Absolutely. I highly recommend this course, especially if you would like to learn more about Japan and Western relations with Asia during this time period."
