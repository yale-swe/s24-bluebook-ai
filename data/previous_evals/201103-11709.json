   "comments": [
    "I would not take this class unless you are incredibly interested in the material.",
    "Its a great course and I highly recommend it. It is also cross listed with a lot of majors.",
    "Take it! This course was very interesting and I felt like it opened my mind to what happens in the rest of the world.",
    "This class is very informative, very useful, and may open you up to new ways of thinking about welfare and development. That said, many of the other students I spoke with seemed to agree that there was something boring, tedious, and hopeless about the environment in the classroom. It's hard to explain since all of the ingredients of the course seem to add up to success, and you do walk away knowing the material, but the amount of time spent on typologies makes the course less than engaging for the first half and a bit too accelerated for the second half as case studies are covered.",
    "Yes, take it. A very manageable senior seminar and you will not regret taking a class with prof seekings, he is great!",
    "Excellent for those interested in public policy.",
    "I would not really suggest others take this class. In the end, I felt like I really didn't come away with a much better understanding of welfare systems, there was a lot of dull reading, a lot of writing (35-40 pages over the course of the semester), and although Professor Seekings clearly knows a lot about the material, he did not always lead the most lively discussions and some of the seminars turned into lectures."
