    "It's a graphic design class. Does that need a summary?",
    "If you love good-looking things but aren't quite cut out for the avant-garde, or if you want to flex your aesthetic muscles a bit but don't want to strain anything, this is the art class for you. Kind of like adult arts and crafts with a side of light judgment. Julian is hilarious and considerate, and his criticisms are usually frank and insightful. The class will also give you some good perspective on the evolution of Western design principles, especially those springing from the Bauhaus tradition. The morning time slot and proximity to two fantastic lunch buffets (Tandoor and Thai Pan-Asian) make this an especially great class for those who like to ease into their days.",
    "This is not an easy 5th class, so don't take it if that is what you're looking for. Also, don't take this class if you just want to make pretty things in an intro art class to show off to your friends. This class is really about abstract visual thinking and understanding the fundamental principles of visual design, so take it if that is what you're really looking for in a class. The more you put in the more you get out of it!",
    "If you want some experience in graphic design, pretty useful. You do need to be motivated to put work in on the assignments or else you will feel silly at critiques.",
    "Yes, anyone and everyone should take this class. It really opens your eyes up to detail and increases visual thinking. Its a lot of work, the first two thirds of the semester will be cutting out paper and glueing them on to paper but it really allows you to work with your hands a lot. Towards the end of the semester you get to learn some photoshop and indesign which is really useful for life in general. But you should take this class if you have the time to devote to it. Working in class is rare and usually all the class time is spent critiquing everyones work, so if you haven't put in the time for your project it shows and can be pretty embarrassing.",
    "This is a really good class for learning the basics of graphics design, and Professor Bittiner is really nice, helpful and knowledgeable. Be sure you are willing to put in the time and really participate in the crits, though, because they take up the majority of class time.",
    "Class twice a week, essentially these are critiques, and then a project of some sort due most class periods, at least every week. It's a good build-up, slower at first, then it gets more elaborate. I highly recommend this class-- good mix of practical and creative, unlike any other class at Yale. I loved Bittiner, thought he was an excellent professor.",
    "TAKE IT. It really makes you appreciate design and typography in a new light."
