    "It's a good class to improve your writing overall, think about some interesting topics, and develop a relationship with a professor. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "English 120 is a very rigorous course, but it is well worth it. You write an essay a week really, since although only every other week must you hand in the final draft, you must have a draft each week for peer editing. Deming organizes his course differently than other professors, so you want to shop around to find the teaching and organization style that works best for you (look at the syllabi.) I really loved Deming. He gets into the nitty gritty aspects of writing and during discussions he challenges us on our comments to delve deeper into the writing. He gives great comments on papers and is very helpful if you go meet with him (highly recommended.) He's just a great teacher and fun to have in class, so I would definitely take him if you can. The class is really great because you get to read so manydifferent styles of writing and then work on your own writing and improve greatly throughout the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend 120. Your writing will improve immensely.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. It was hard, and there were a lot of essays and small readings and other assignments, but it was definitely worth it. Prof. Deming is the best. He gives concrete advice about your writing, and helps you find your flaws. The discussions in class are really good too, as long as you've read the essays beforehand.",
    "You write an essay five or six times, then there's a workshop or peer-editing period that results in your final draft. Not too bad as far as course load goes. Sometimes it's hard to write about a topic you fumbled to land on for five pages but you do it anyways. Deming is great, but he only sees your final draft (in his class, there's an extended peer critique you have two days to write instead of workshopping). I would recommend the course but look at the prompts from the very beginning and come up with some ideas as to what you want to write about so you aren't stuck panicking at the last minute.",
    "Amazing!! Wonderful, fantastic course. Take it even if you're not an English major, or even that fond of writing. Dr. Deming will change your mind- he is phenomenal. Discussions are lively and intellectuallly stimulating, far from a bore. We wrote five essays, each complete with a rough draft, peer critique, and a one (often two) page letter to the professor with each final draft. Graded critiques, as well, are usually two pages and extremely thorough. I would definitely recommend this class to any student; the only shame is that Dr. Deming is not teaching next semester.",
    "Too good all the time. Go to office hours.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic course. Any student would benefit from taking it.",
    "Everyone says that you should take English 120 to revolutionize your writing. I don't know if that's really what happened to me; it felt more like a kind of awakening. I write more creatively and more easily than I did before. Deming is an absolute joy to witness teaching and being in class with him is really a rare privilege. He's an extremely mindful professor, who gives great comments that are helpful, constructive, and in no way lenient. His teaching style also progresses with the class -- his comments grow in their depth as the depth of your experience in the class grows as well. There's really no reason I can think of for anyone to not take English 120, and if you take it, try your best to take it with Deming. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes, but there are risks.",
    "Take 120 if you would like a writing class that doesn't require a ton of research to be done in the library but a lot of reflection on one's own experiences. 120 is a challenging writing course and forces students to really work on the art of writing. The readings for the class were amazing, EVERY SINGLE ONE. There were never a bore to read and it was a lot of fun to discuss in class!",
    "A good way to learn about writing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to those looking to improve their nonfiction writing. The reading selections are great--never felt like \"required\" reading, and many of the prompts are fun to write. It is time consuming and stressful at times, however."
