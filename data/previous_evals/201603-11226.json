    "I learned a whole light from this course, it was definitely my hardest class and for good reason calculus is hard. I learned to think differently about a whole array of topics that I feel have made me a better overall student.",
    "The Main themes of calculus and integrals. Will definitely keep taking math in the future.",
    "I love math now, basically! I was able to create a foundation that will be important as I further my studies through other math and STEM classes.",
    "My quantitative reasoning skills got better as did my work with word problems",
    "I learned how to look at problems multiple ways to solve them. I also learned the various skills needed to solve calculus problems.",
    "I polished what I learned in high school taking AP Calculus AB and learned some new skills like linearization and Euler's method.",
    "applications of calc",
    "Basic differentiation skills",
    "Basics of calculus.",
    "Great class, great instructor. Good opening course for someone who has little experience in calculus",
    "I mastered knowledge of precalculus, principles and applications of derivatives, and beginning integrals. I gained a lot from the problem-solving aspect of this course, particularly relating to optimization and differential equations.",
    "I reestablished my knowledge of calculus and learned some new topics and lots of different approaches to solving calculus problems. The class really helped re-familiarize early calculus topics to create a foundation for further math.",
    "I developed calculus skills for the first time. The class was very insightful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that a section once a week for students would be very helpful.",
    "Could be improved because we go over very simple example, but on the exams the example are much more complex and harder to respond.",
    "It was quite repetitive and often the in class material was far easier than the problem sets or the exams.",
    "Strengths: lecturing and clearing up complicated, confusing concepts. Weaknesses: could be more student engagement.",
    "The strength was that my professor talked us through examples in class that made it easier for me to understand how to do homework problems. She also had a lot of office hours that were always very helpful to go to. The weakness was that had I not had experience with calculus before (which the course description said was not expected), I would have been very lost in this class. It was easy to get behind in this class, and sometimes I wished that we would go more in depth in the classes. It moved by very quickly.",
    "material presented in class much easier than problem sets\/exams",
    "strength: consistant hw etc weakness: review sessions should be more organized with topics like the last one",
    "The course did a great job at teaching introductory Calculus concepts. But, the class could use more in-class practice problems that resemble those on the exams.",
    "The inconsistency of people who grade the problem sets",
    "The \"reverse classroom\" is essentially self-taught and ineffective for individuals who have no taken calculus before.",
    "Extensions, please.",
    "Strong at teaching but poor at class involvement",
    "The lectures were much easier than the exams so I suggest that the professor do more challenges practice problems in class.",
    "It was kinda frustrating that all the problems we did in class\/on the homework were not of the same magnitude of those on the exams\/finals. Even though the concepts were the same, when we were actually being tested on the material, the difficulty of the problems was hard to compare. It would have been nice to be exposed to more problems of that difficulty throughout the course rather than just when the sample midterms\/finals were posted.",
    "Strengths : Good intro course Weaknesses : Sometimes a little too much work",
    "My teacher was really good in that she gave lectures about the topics each class and handed us relevant worksheets for each lecture. I understand not every section for this class did that. They really should. Every time I told someone that's how my section operated they were jealous.",
    "The math 112 material is somewhat dry, and there isn't much interactivity. I understand this is the nature of introductory math classes, but I never found the class particularly thrilling. However, I thought the teaching was effective, and I always understood the concepts after lecture. The homework was appropriate for reinforcing class concepts. The tests were fair and well-written.",
    "The course gives you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with earlier calculus topics you may have forgotten or never knew how to do, so a strength is the depth the curriculum can go into because it only has to cover limits, derivatives, and the beginning of integrals in a semester, as opposed to trying to cram everything into one year and then review it all too. Although it's understandable that first-semester calculus would be taught by grad students, I've heard that being taught by a student who isn't versed in teaching and has to teach seemingly easy math has been problematic.",
    "The notes were very helpful but I feel classes went too fast"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, made me think in complex ways, which I think is helpful.",
    "Yes, a basic understanding of Math that everyone should have",
    "Yes, I would! It's important to know basic calculus.",
    "It set a strong foundation for me, I would tell other students to take it",
    "Yes, it provided a clear foundation for calculus.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need it to fulfill a requirement.",
    "yes - but a lot of the kids in the class have taken calculus. if you have never had prior experience with calculus before it might be pretty difficult.",
    "yes learned a lot",
    "Yeah, if you are not confident about calculus this is a very good intro course.",
    "Yes, Only ones who have little experience in\/with calculus",
    "Math 112 is a good review of differential calculus for students who have not been exposed to the material previously or for students who feel rusty in their calculus skills. The course is entirely lecture-based, but the concepts are taught well, and the exams and homework are useful and fair. Take for an excellent introduction to calculus and for use in future courses.",
    "If they are confident in their calculus abilities, no, I'd recommend them to take Math 115, as some of my friends did. If they would like to brush up on their calculus or have to take it to fulfill a math credit, yes because having a foundation of calculus can never hurt.",
    "Yes it is a very helpful course",
    "I would only recommend the course if it is part of their prerequisites."
