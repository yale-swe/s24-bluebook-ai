   "comments": [
    "Large load of material to go through, but an absolute must if you intend on doing immunological work in the future. I would recommend it to any student.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend especially if the person is interested in any research related to human immunology.",
    "It was, overall, a mess. I would not recommend it to a fellow student, nor would I take it again knowing what I know now. The book was excellent, though, and I feel it honestly would have been a better use of my time to read the book on my own and teach myself the material. Unlike the class, the book was well organized and always clear.",
    "I would recommend it but it is also very difficult.",
    "Extremely informative class. Yes, I would recommend it to anyone looking to jumpstart their knowledge in immune biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because they could broaden their perspective of immunology by listening to a broad range of immunological topics in one class."

   "comments": [
    "I do immunological engineering, and it's important to have a sense of the depth of material, the current issues in the biological side of immune system research and work, and to get a deeper understanding of the system as a whole. This is the most important class I will take in my graduate work.",
    "Because my current research involves a lot of immunobiology and I have not had any immunology class before, this class definitely helped me in my research endeavor as well. So the class really deepened my understanding of human immune system.",
    "Not related to my research, but did help satisfy my own interest in better understanding immunobiology.",
    "It deepened my knowledge.",
    "I broadened my perspective as in understanding immunological topics, which will definitely help my research career in the future."
