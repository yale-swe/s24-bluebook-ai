   "comments": [
    "The class gives a solid background and has some interesting facts. Great for non-science majors.",
    "Good broad intro course and great Sc credit - not a gut but an average yale workload. Problem sets are a pain and required reading should is irritating.. Exams have nothing to do with psets - so be aware that they are much more conceptual - a checkin of if you've been following along with the lectures. Otherwise, a decent course. Poster presentation was foolish - basically 4 different pieces of research combined into one poster - barely a group effort. 9am start time is also annoying. Otherwise, i definitely learned something - a good discussion of different natural resources and their complications.",
    "This is a good survey science class, a solid way to get an SC credit, definitely not a gut.",
    "The material is fascinating, but you have to be willing to put in the work for it.",
    "G&G 205 is a good class if you're interested in natural resources, but it shouldn't be forgotten that at heart it is more of a geology class than an EVST one. It also seems to have somehow developed the reputation of a science class for non-science people, but you should not take it under this impression because although the lectures don't incorporate much science, a significant amount of scientific knowledge is assumed in the problem sets\/exams.",
    "Interesting! Good for non-sciences majors: not a gut, but the pests are reasonably easy. And the information is pretty interesting!",
    "A fun class and useful science credit. Can be a little dry and psets can be tough but overall pretty good.",
    "Great class for non-majors who want to get something out of their science credit. A little dry and moderate workload, but good info to have.",
    "Absolutely! Before this class, I knew little about energy, natural resources, or environmental impact. Now, I feel like a much more informed global citizen.",
    "Fantastic background in fossil fuels, where they come from, and where they are going. Also on our natural resources and which seem to offer the most potential.",
    "I took this class because I needed a science credit. It was more work than I had anticipated, and psets took quite a lot of time to do, but the content of the class was very interesting. You learn about the different types of energy, fossil fuels, nuclear, renewable etc - take it if you are willing to put in a bit of effort and want to actually learn something meaningful.",
    "Not actually that gutty. Kind of interesting material. Take it if you're pretty interested in the subject matter, but if not, there are probably better science credits out there.",
    "If you want a qualitative look at alternative energy then this is a great class. The psets are math based, but the tests are purely qualitative.",
    "Would recommend for non-geology majors, but geology majors will find the content very simplistic. Tests are really just general knowledge geology exams.",
    "Doable science for non STEM people. Early morning meeting time was pretty rough though. Overall could've been worse, but I didn't come out feeling like I'd learned very much.",
    "Natural Resources is a really solid science class, especially for non-science majors. If you're looking for a science credit, I'd really recommend it - it doesn't assume pretty much any background knowledge, and you learn a lot. It's a not insignificant amount of work, definitely not a gut- the psets are really straightforward but get rather long towards the end. The psets did feel pretty pointless, they are mostly about doing unit conversions and practical calculations, but we were never tested on the material the psets covered. The tests are surprisingly hard, and the psets don't help, and there was a final poster project as well as a final - but Jay is really solid and seems like a nice and funny guy, and it was definitely a non-painful way to get a science credit.",
    "Absolutely recommend this! A great science credit if you need one, but also a really fun and interesting course for a STEM major like me! Though the course isn't highly technical (which some, more STEM-y people might not like), it does a great job of talking about the relevant technologies and issues surrounding natural resources, particularly those pertaining to energy. Workload is very reasonable, so no fear there. There are readings, but they're very helpful and a lot of them are articles that put issues surrounding resources into context. Psets about every week; they do have a fair bit of math, but it's quite straightforward and based on very concrete concepts. Prof. Ague is also the absolute bomb! He's so subtly funny, and very engaging, clear, and helpful. His sweater game is also on point, since all his sweaters look vaguely like rock formations. Basically, take this course, because this is stuff everyone should know, and you'll have a good time learning it.",
    "I'm an English major and I took this class because I needed a science credit. I also liked that the topics and issues covered are ones that are actually relevant to our lives\/ being an informed world citizen. I would caution that this is definitely not a gut course the p-sets can be challenging. However, I found the lectures engaging and the TFs for the most part very helpful. I would recommend this class for anyone interested in the material especially if you're looking for a science class that doesn't require prerecs but does require your engagement.",
    "In general, G&G 205 is a pretty chill course. It's definitely accessible to non-science majors, but this may make it a little boring\/repetitive for those who have taken other EVST or G&G courses. Professor Ague is great, and in general the psets are very doable. The final poster project is a bit frustrating in that it requires coordination with a group, but definitely a manageable amount of work.",
    "G&G 205 looks at earth's resources through the lens of geology. What that means is, instead of just analyzing how many fossil fuels remain or how viable solar energy is for large-scale use, you also look into how those resources came into being and, if applicable, why they are or are not viable for large-scale use. The class culminates in a group project in which you focus on a single natural resource (or the application of a resource), which really gives students a chance to delve much farther into their interests. In addition, several topic sin geology are introduced, especially interactions between tectonic plates. I would definitely recommend this to any student that is interested in energy, environmentalism, or really anything regarding earth's resources. Former knowledge of geology is certainly not required."
