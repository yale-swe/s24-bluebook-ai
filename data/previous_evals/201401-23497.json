   "comments": [
    "If you are looked for a specific writing-based course I would look elsewhere, but for anything else come here! Great class, learned a lot and I am a considerably better reader now than I was before even if my writing hasn't improved considerably.",
    "Yes, I would! I think it makes for a good freshman seminar choice. The workload is very manageable, aside from the novel-reading, which requires a bit of planning in advance.",
    "Before taking this class, I read in some reviews that it was a great class, but not to take it as your one extra easy class because it's a lot of work. This opinion was half right. This is a really great class and I recommend taking it, but if you are also a STEM major, don't worry about taking this as your extra fun class. This was considerably less work than my other classes, and the work was fun. Aside from three papers and a presentation, all of which are nicely spread out through the semester, you only have reading to do, and the reading is fun. I am a very slow reader, because I like to take everything in, so I probably took more time to do them than most people, but I still found the reading for this class to feel more like relaxation than homework. Last semester, I didn't read anything but textbooks after the first month, but now I HAD to read and couldn't feel guilty about not doing other work while doing so. Balzac, Zola, and the others are really fun to read, and the class discussions really help to get more out of them than you would yourself.",
    "8 novels, 2 short papers, and 1 final paper. Each class will have dynamic discussions (if everyone else in your class is engaged and excited about the readings, which thankfully my class was) and expect to learn a lot about 19th century French literature, capitalism, feminism, psychology, and French history. Probably my favorite class this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to interested students, given that it uses an interesting, effective, and timely lens--money and capitalism--to read the literature. Prof. Samuels is a very strong teacher, which is a further benefit to the course. It's one of the classes I really looked forward to.",
    "great class, a lot of reading but interesting reading so it doesn't feel like homework at all. paper is hard but there are only three of them so if you put work into itit will pay off"
