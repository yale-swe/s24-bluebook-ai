    "SPAN 130 is a very good and involved language course. You have to complete a significant amount of work every day, with larger assignments interspersed between the small ones. Nothing the course is too difficult, but the aggregate of the work can sometimes be a lot to handle on top of the other classes. I took 5.5 credits with this class, so I often felt like I put spanish on the back-burner and got hurt because of it. Still, I noticeably improved both my spoken and written spanish and am much more confident than I was coming into the class.",
    "A class with a lot of work, but i made a large improvement with my writing skills.",
    "If a student needed to fulfill the requirement or if they were interested in studying abroad, I would recommend this course as a way of improving Spanish skills. But if someone did not have a genuine interest in the language, it may not be for them.",
    "Great class if you're looking to improve your technical Spanish skills.",
    "Take it because you probably have to. Not too much work. If you have professor Vazquez, she's great. Super friendly and willing to help.",
    "Not too bad but pretty big time commitment-- homework every night."
