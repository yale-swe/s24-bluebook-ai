    "This course was very well taught and organized. You will learn how to converse casually with friends in Korean, which was more of a contrast to the formal cheongdaemal you learn in Korean 110 and 120.",
    "I feel my conversational Korean skills developed this semester. I now feel more comfortable speaking and listening, much more so than from L2.",
    "My speaking and listening abilities improved substantially.",
    "I learned how to study in Korean effectively, which means learning to memorize vocabulary and grammar concepts. I also learned a lot about Korean culture and tourism in Seoul.",
    "I learned many useful grammar structures, in addition to writing and speaking skills.",
    "Sadly, I don't think that I learned that much or gained that much by taking this class. A lot of the time, I felt like I was wasting my time sitting there every morning. I would not recommend this course to another student, and I regret taking Korean versus another language.",
    "130 doesn't really have a textbook and is more structured on building familiarity with casual Korean conversations on different topics through these dialogue packets. It's more about exposure to the Korean language then the more organized grammar instruction of before, so it's quite a different Korean learning experience."

   "comments": [
    "So many problems with the course that it should be restructured.",
    "While I did learn a lot, I'm not sure I enjoyed the format of watching videos and then being tested on those videos.I did learn quite a bit, but I wish the grammar lessons were a little more streamlined.",
    "It has a very loose structure that allows for wiggle room for the professor and students alike, but it is hard to reconcile this year's grading system with the seemingly arbitrary decisions made by the professor.",
    "A strength of this course was that it covered a large amount of material, I learned a lot and became a much stronger speaker through this course.",
    "The weaknesses: disorganized, clear favoritism, confusing homework assignments, low level of engagement, unfair tests, biased and unclear grading The strengths: was able to practice speaking Korean, and learned a few more grammar structures. The professor also tried\/made an attempt to help students This class could be improved by creating a more engaging set-up, clearer homework instructions, and better preparation for the tests. There was no structure to class -- for the most part, we just sat around and practiced memorizing scripts or reading them out loud. These are all things that the students can do at home, in their free time. In addition, the scripts incorporated confusing grammar structures many students have not learned yet.",
    "You gain exposure to dialogue and conversation, but you learn less grammar."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very well taught and organized. You will learn how to converse casually with friends in Korean, which was more of a contrast to the formal cheongdaemal you learn in Korean 110 and 120.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I really improved my language skills. Furthermore, Professor Choi is the kind of teacher that if you put in the effort, she will meet you half way and try to make you as successful as possible. She really just wants kids to learn the language.",
    "Ordinarily, yes. Our year was different, as our professor decided to grade 2 sets of students very differently.",
    "Yes, it is a very good course to learn and you learn at a challenging, but not excruciating hard pace. It is just right for foreigners to learn.",
    "This course is unconventional in that you don't learn from a textbook. Instead, you study scripts to short video clips that feature two people talking in Korean. We typically spent two days reviewing grammar structures and vocabulary used in the dialogue. Professor Choi stresses improvement more than anything, so it's important that you really put the effort into this class. She's really approachable and wants to help you, so don't be afraid to ask her questions!",
    "No, I wouldn't. I initially took this class because I wanted to be able to continue improving my Korean, but I can honestly say that I did not learn much or improve at all by taking this course. This class was very frustrating to be in because the homework assignments were often mixed up, and sitting in class reading scripts often felt like a waste of time. When these problems were brought up to the professor, she refused to listen and simply blamed the problems on the students. In addition, in lieu of a final, assigning an individual project and presentation, a final cumulative \"test\", and a group video project was extremely time-consuming and stressful in the midst of the many other finals and final exams."
