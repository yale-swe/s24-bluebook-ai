   "comments": [
    "I would in fact recommend Phys 608 to another student because it is organized as a course, and contains interesting material. Even if one does not end up doing research in something that directly uses quantum mechanics, many of the techniques are applicable to other fields. Something that I would recommend to another student is to try to use other resources for examples because Messiah is a bit lacking in that.",
    "Quantum Mechanics II is a required class for grad students in the physics department, but I would not recommend taking the class if a student is not required to. If it were taught by a different professor using a different textbook, then it would probably be a good class.",
    "You end up having to learn the material on your own, though the workload is very fair. Homework assignments did not consume our lives, unlike some of the other core courses.",
    "Its one of the first courses in grad school, where one is exposed to new material that one had not seen in undergrad. For this reason I would recommend this class.",
    "You'd better find a modern book on the subject and read for yourself, to really understand things clearly.",
    "You gotta take it, go for it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student- in the amount of time this class took, one can learn a lot more, maybe even by just reading a good quantum book and working through problems",
    "I do not feel that I would recommend Physics 608 to a serious Physics student.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's useful to understand quantum mechanics.",
    "It gives an overview of quantum beyond the basics. It is not particularly in depth, but it at least addresses important topics.",
    "Scattering, perturbative methods, dirac equation.",
    "I will recommend this course to other students because it's not complete to only take quantum mechanics I. A lot of non-trivial topics are covered in 608 01 which I think are both theoretically and practically crucial.",
    "Yes, I would. It was a good class, well-taught, and I think it will be useful later on.",
    "I would recommend that a fellow student try to take physics 608 with another professor. The concepts included in the course are extremely important to most branches of physics, but they weren't well taught.",
    "If the course was taught in the same way, I would recommend getting the syllabus, skipping lecture, and using an undergraduate text along with Messiah(sparingly) to prepare for the exams and homework."

   "comments": [
    "I am thinking of doing computational astrophysics, but as I said before, I think that many of the techniques from the course are applicable to other fields. For instance, I recently found a paper on Wigner matrices for use in the convolution in beam and sky algorithms. I wish that I had more time to soak the material from this course (three courses were difficult to juggle for me, and made it hard to catch up when I fell behind in homework), but quantum mechanics is a valuable course for all physics disciplines.",
    "This course is relevant because it is the basis of modern physics, but it is not immediately applicable to the research that I do.",
    "This class is obviously necessary for physics grad students. I did feel like I learned something.",
    "I learned completely new material, however I don't believe I have learned it to a sufficient depth.",
    "I'm not sure I learned much in this course at all. I suppose using the partial wave expansion in scattering problems was new to me.",
    "Yes it helped, but primarily by reading rather than listening.",
    "this course essentially did not contribute anything to my researchit helped me with some methods like perturbation theory and variational methods that may be used in other fieldsit was good for developin \"physics culture\" maybe",
    "The subject of the course was new to me, in that sense I learned a lot. Not because the class was \"good\", but because the material was new.",
    "It doesn't directly help my research but does help the general understanding.",
    "It was important to learn cross sections and relativistic theory",
    "Have to know quantum mechanics to do most research.",
    "It gives me the ability of learning more deeply about the quantum mechanics in my future study and research. I don't think an introduction course should cover everything and every detail. But it's crucial if an intro course could give you a little confidence in the future study and show you some basic methods of self-study. I think professor Iachello's course has this kind of effect.",
    "I believe that many of the methods that were taught (perturbation theory, etc) are applicable in many areas and though I haven't run into anything yet I think it may very well be helpful later on in my research."
