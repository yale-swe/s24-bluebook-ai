    "I would say to do a one semester thesis in the fall.",
    "If you want to graduate and you're a Humanities major, I suggest you either take this course or stage some sort of revolution so that you can change the institution's requisites for graduation.",
    "It's required and it is worth doing. Find a good supportive advisor to push you and you will be rewarded.",
    "You have to take the course since you can't graduate without completing your humanities senior essay. For all future humanities majors, I would really try to keep to a tight work schedule to make sure you evenly space out your work. It's difficult to stick to a self-made schedule, I know, but it'll save you a lot of stress in the end, and your senior essay will come out much better I promise. Try to stay really on top of the deadlines! Set mini-deadlines for yourself and meet them. And use your breaks, especially spring break and winter break, to get a lot of work done ahead of time if you can."
