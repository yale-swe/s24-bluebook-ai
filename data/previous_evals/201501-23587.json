    "The course is the most organized and logical course I have ever taken in Yale. The information is very useful, which is just awesome.",

   "comments": [
    "Some more help with the term project would have been nice. Also a lecture or two on google earth engine seems essential considering its capabilities and the cost of ENVI.",
    "I understand spending a few week on the physics aspect of remote sensing but I think those can be summarized in a week and we could spend more time familiarizing ourselves with Envi.",
    "As much as I liked learning my way around ENVI, the point and click nature of the lab exercises became a little stale.",
    "Many of the lectures are poorly organized, particularly the slides. A good set of lecture slides is independently understandable and loglical. Many of the slides are difficult to comprehend. It would be very useful to update the slides, provide more organization and flow, and define all terms used to make them better study tools and reference materials. The background information doesn't seem particularly useful as presented. I think there's too much discussion of principles without relating them to the use of the tool. The labs are too structured and don't allow room for independent thought. I learn best from labs that challenge me to think critically and solve a problem. The labs in the course are more like recipies, with some repetitive work that felt like unnecessary busywork. The labs could be improved by offering less in the way of following steps and more in the way of solving a geospatial problem using remote sensing techniques. The field trip was fun!"

    "They fit together very well.",
    "Spend time during lecture to go over issues during the lab. I understand that the TA is available during lab time but sometimes he was busy with other students and\/or was not able to answer my questions.",
    "I think that the final project should begin much earlier in the semester. Even if it is only a couple steps at the outset. For example, in lab 1 or 2, having a section that coerces students to retrieve an image would be helpful. This would better allow students to examine their project as they move through the lab exercises.",

Definitely take it if you have any interest in developing fluency with or an understanding of Remote Sensing - just make sure you have the time in your schedule to do so.",
