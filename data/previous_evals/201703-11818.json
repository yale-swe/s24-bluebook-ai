    "My Arabic improved, if only incrementally. I felt as though the class improved my writing skills the most. I also memorized two poems, a process that I enjoyed and felt taught me a valued part of Arab culture.",
    "I gained grammar, comprehension, and conversation skills in Arabic",
    "I continued to learn skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking in MSA. I practiced Levantine dialect. I gained comfort in reading and writing longer passages.",

   "comments": [
    "Memorizing the poems was a process that I really enjoyed, and spreading out the presentations to have one per day was a good idea. The presentations are great because they make us learn useful vocabulary in the process of making them. In addition, making us write the essays at the end of each chapter helped improve our writing. However, the vocabulary in Al-Kitaab seems to random at times, with no clear order or theme to organize it. In addition, the integration of shaami in class and in the textbook was awkward and did not really help us learn shaami.",
    "I enjoyed the oral presentations, as the ability to converse is my primary goal for taking this course",
    "I think that this course could be accelerated. I would prefer that we learn much more material in a shorter amount of time. I would also enjoy more opportunities to converse with native speakers, including our professor, in Arabic--the course was often conducted in English, and when we worked in pairs, it was hard to receive feedback, since my fellow students weren't able to correct my mistakes. I liked that we integrated more grammar into the course this semester and that we began writing longer pieces. I did not enjoy the listening assignments very much--I found them to be far too difficult for students of our level. I didn't learn very much in the Shaami section--I learned much more by speaking individually with our TA in Arabic outside of class. I would enjoy learning more everyday vocabulary and incorporating more culture into our lessons.",
    "While my reading, writing, and grammar skills improved throughout this course, the fact that we spoke mostly English in class, while comfortable, meant that I learned little in terms of speaking and comprehension."

    "I would absolutely recommend Arabic 130 to another student. I came into Yale, admittedly, with some background in Arabic but have learned a tremendous amount from the course - it is an excellent and thorough instruction of grammar and fusha with plenty of casual speaking integrated. Great class! Take it for more than the requirement - take it if you want to be conversant in Arabic by the series' end.",
    "Take this class if you love Arabic and are interested in the Middle East. Professor Aziz is a caring man that wants everyone to learn, but you sometimes have to supplement the class with extra work to really learn. In particular, the class is deficient in helping you improve your spoken Arabic and your listening comprehension, so you might have to especially supplement that part of the course.",
    "L3 Arabic is no joke, so make sure you commit if you take it",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The course is not too difficult but still teaches essential concepts for continuing in Arabic study.",
    "I recommend this course. Aziz is a cool teacher, and he's got a lot of expertise in MSA. If you do the work, come to class, and stay engaged, you'll learn. If you don't, your grade doesn't suffer, but you won't learn."
