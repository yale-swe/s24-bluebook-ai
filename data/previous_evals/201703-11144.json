   "comments": [
    "I can't believe how much French I learned this semester. After studying the language for four years, it's incredible to me the leaps and bounds I've made in reading and listening in the past three-and-a-half months.",
    "I learned to write and speak French in a grammatically correct way. Though some of the constructions and vocabulary can seem very specific and occasionally pedantic, everything we learned was useful and helped us feel confident in what we said.",
    "I learned a great deal about the different topics we covered in the texts studied, as well as how to approach lengthy French readings and difficult grammar concepts. I found the work we did on French colonies and on the Second World War in France to be especially interesting. It was also a great opportunity to improve my speaking skills through in-depth class discussions, where we were encouraged to communicate our thoughts and responses to the given texts we studied. The oral linguistics component of the course (with audio programs) was great, as I had never done anything similar before. I also really enjoyed the readings.",
    "Reading, writing, listening and speaking -- such a well rounded thorough course",
    "French 140 did a good job refining my French skills. Over the course of the semester, I became more comfortable in reading the languages after going through several short stories and a couple books. Our small class size made class discussions a very involved activity that improved my speaking skills.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of French grammar, as well as improved writing and speaking skills. This was aided by the wide range of literary texts and written assignments. I also learned how to better balance my workload given that this class is every day and almost always has homework assignments.",
    "I developed stronger French speaking skills, particularly presenting and discussing in class. I also developed better reading comprehension."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths of this course include the course content, the course packet, and most of all how the material was presented in this class. The only thing I can think of that may improve the course is to have a bit more graded speaking or structured speaking to help better prepare for the oral productions on the exams.",
    "The amount of speaking and dictation that we did as a class definitely helped increase my listening comprehension and speaking abilities. Professor Burton was superbly kind and understanding, and took a true interest in her students, making learning and asking questions easy. The only weakness would be the lack of use of conversational or informal French, which can be overlooked if students get a French tutor on the side (very easy, would recommend doing so).",
    "I believe that the course is overall very strong. It is engaging, challenging, and very rewarding. It would be good if more time could be spent on Un Sac de Billes, as the reading requirements for this texts were very challenging (simply because of the time required to complete them), however it is understandable that so little time may be spent on the text given the breadth of subject matter covered throughout the course.",
    "The small class size really made sure that everyone was coming prepared to class and ready to talk about the material. I enjoyed the range of books that we read. I especially like Sac de Billes and the unit on World War 2. It would be nice if the answers to the course packet were posted a day before the test to help for review (and to make sure your answers are all right).",
    "This class was very successful in the way that it allowed students to develop a greater understanding of the French language by intensely learning it every day. It was very helpful to have the entire course conducted in French. One improvement might be to allow the students to have more time to speak freely in French to improve conversational skills and add a greater ease to improve fluency.",
    "Strengths: interesting and challenging readings, opportunities to present in front of the class, grammar skills; weaknesses: the oral exercises in the course packet are not helpful, more opportunities for discussion in class would be more helpful for improving oral skills"

    "Absolutely. I always had a great time when I was in class. Although there was a fairly large workload, it wasn't the kind that makes you want to wring your hands and bang your head against the wall. All it took was a little bit of time and effort, which was much needed compared to some of the other courses I was taking this semester. The reading was all very interesting, though difficult, and the audio lessons were actually fun. The subject matter of the class was fascinating, and it was always presented as such. I sincerely enjoyed this class, and I feel like I can now listen to and understand French, which was the goal all along, right?",
    "This course is amazing for students who are not completely confident in their listening and speaking abilities, but are genuinely interested in the French language. It is fantastically taught. All of the professors are fantastic, and I am so pleased with my experience in the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I improved a great deal in my capacity to communicate in French, while also learning a lot about relevant global matters. This was my favorite course this semester.",
    "Yes I would",
    "140 will improve your French skills and is similar in structure to the earlier classes in the French program. I would recommend fully immersing yourself in the language by taking a study abroad program, though. It feels like you can only do so much by just having an hour class a day. To become fluent, you have to live in the language.",
    "Yes- any one that is strongly inclined to learn French would greatly benefit from taking this class. The course requires a lot of work, but it is worth it when you can see improved results at the end of the semester.",
    "Yes, especially if they want to become proficient in French"
