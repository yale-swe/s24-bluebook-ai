   "comments": [
    "Don't take it unless you have to. The professor goes on tangents 90% of class, which makes the lectures very confusing and often incomprehensible. The material you learn in class is irrelevant. All homework can be done by reading the book. The best way to study for the exam is to go to every review session and memorize the way to solve all the problems on previous exams because every exam is almost identical to each other. Class has mostly 230-231 kids who are competitive so the curve may be difficult.",
    "Math 301 was a good course, but it could be painful at times. I thought I was pretty comfortable with limits and series... but some of these series are the most ridiculous crap I've ever seen in my life. What the heck. Seriously, if you don't believe me ask someone who was in this class to look at some of the series Professor Jones gives on exams. However, this class did greatly improve my abilities to estimate, which is pretty important for analysis, so I do feel well prepared for the rest of the analysis sequence.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you are a math major, want to take 305 (Real Analysis) in the spring and have a credit to spare in the fall. The class served me very well. Lectures by Prof. Jones consist of amusing anecdotes\/histories of Yale\/non-Yale math\/non-math professors and even a little bit of real analysis on the side, the former being an essential part of a libral arts education in math, and the latter a good refresher of some of the material of MATH 230\/231 that I took in freshman year (I'm a junior). Workload is quite light and exams quite fair, if you learn the techniques he shows you during review sessions in which he cut the story portion of the lecture from some 80% down to 40% to actually do some good proofs.",
    "You must understand the Jones scale of rigor before taking this class. The Jones scale of rigor is a base-10 logarithmic scale from one to ten that Professor Jones unofficially uses to evaluate the rigor of your proofs. A six is ten times more rigorous than a five. If you're coming in hot from 230\/231, you're going to get owned on your first exam. If you're not careful, you'll only give proofs worth fours and fives on the first exam. On the exams, try to give at least sevens or eights to get most of the points. Good luck. It's a great class, and it evaluates your ability as a mathematician. Learn to appreciate how helpful Jones is because he can teach you a lot if you listen with the right ears.",
    "Yes take this class over 300, as it's more fun, rigorous and lets me have a great understanding of fundamental concepts of real analysis. Read the textbook in advance as the lectures run a bit all over the place.",
    "I would advise anyone shopping this class to reconsider and look at other options for an analysis course. Professor Jones has many funny and interesting stories to tell, but beyond that there's not much enjoyable about this course. Lectures are disjointed and filled with random asides; proofs are hard to follow and often left unfinished, yet you will be required to reproduce them on exams. Problem sets are generally straightforward but will take ~6 hours\/week and only count for 10% of the grade. The remainder of the grade is determined by 3 exams which will really test your ability to memorize tricks and solutions presented during review sessions. If you do take this class, don't make the mistake of missing any review sessions and don't waste time studying any material not on previous exams. Professor Jones recycles questions and they all rely on obscure algebra\/calculus tricks, much more so then on your knowledge of material from lecture.",
    "If you've taken 230\/231 and got it well then you really don't need to take this course. I definitely see taking 301 as a mistake after taking 230\/231. Even if you feel a little shaky, you'd be better off just self studying the main ideas in intro analysis if you're planning on going on to take 305. If you have no prior experience with analysis, then best of luck. Jones is a very disorganized lecturer. Very enthusiastic and tells some funny stories, but if you're trying to learn in lecture it can be really tough. Also, for the tests just go to the review sessions. Even if you actually know all of real analysis, since Jones wants you to answer the questions in the way he likes. He does think about things in a unique way and the problems can be kind of cool, but overall it's ridiculous."
