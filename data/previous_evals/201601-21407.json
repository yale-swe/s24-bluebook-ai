    "Unfortunately few actual applications. The midterms were quite difficult, as they were mostly just true false, and it was just conceptual questions.",
    "Taking this class was a BIG, FAT mistake. The topics themselves are not even that hard, but Professor Asaf Ferber somehow managed to make them hard as hell. This class has no structure, lectures are long, boring and all over the place. To put this into perspective: there were several people during lecture who literally watched MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on their laptops, which were the only reason I understood something at all about linear algebra. Exams consisted in 1 sheet with some true or false and a couple of multiple choice questions where making 3 or 4 mistakes out of 15 questions meant getting a C. Problem sets were super hard too, much more than the actual exams. I know of people who studied the night before the exam and got As in the class, but I also know of people who dropped the class because they could not keep up because of the professor. Personally, I would not recommend taking this class with Asaf Ferber to my biggest enemy. I really wish the peer tutor taught this class, it would be much much better.",
    "This course is not something one takes for the fun of it, but if you're wanting to get a background in LinAlg, or if you need it for your major, it's definitely a solid choice. It wasn't ever stressful in terms of the amount of work, so if you don't feel a need for a deep understanding of the topic, I'd recommend this over Math 225.",
    "This class is not that hard, but with Asaf it was slightly more theoretical than other classes. It's definitely helpful to know the theory behind lin alg, but if you don't know it going into his exams, you won't do well. By the end of the year, we could explain our mistakes on the first 2 exams. So, we definitely had all the pieces and the knowledge just didn't quite understand it all when we needed to. I'd recommend this class, and I know other sections are more math based, but as long as you understand reasoning, you'll do well.",
    "This class was NOT good. Terribly run. The syllabus was basically a letter with no outline of what we were covering when, the psets didn't align with the lectures and had typos and mistakes, the midterms were TRUE OR FALSE. THE FIRST MIDTERM WAS 10 TRUE OR FALSE QUESTIONS. PUTTING TRUE INSTEAD OF FALSE COULD LITERALLY DROP YOU HALF A LETTER GRADE. The kicker was that out of the two practice final exam solutions released, 2\/6 answers on one were incorrect. When I went to Professor Ferber the day of the exam to ask about them, he was clearly aware that the solutions were incorrect, but hadn't sent out an announcement or anything to let the students know, so people were studying incorrect material. Terribly frustrating as a student. In terms of content, I didn't really discover any applications of linear algebra. Professor Ferber didn't seem to pace out the lectures very well (we spent a whole class covering adding two vectors together), and students quickly stopped showing up\/paying attention in lecture. I admit that as I took a rather heavy courseload this semester, this class fell a bit by the wayside, and I didn't go to office hours as perhaps I should have. Of the \"problem sessions\" by Andrei that I did go to, I found them supremely unhelpful (Andrei is vague and dismissive). Overall, really frustrating. I'm leaving this class with a good grade (did well on both midterms), but no real grasp of linear algebra. This class would do a lot better with psets that correlated better to the class. Professor Ferber seemed kind, but simply didn't get information across.",
    "MATH 222 is perhaps the worst class I have taken at Yale. It really is a shame, because linear algebra could be interesting if taught well. First of all, the class's title is misleading- there are practically no applications taught in this class. Over the whole semester, only 2 lectures (taught by the TF, Andrei) were about applications. The class is highly theoretical, what was a huge disappointment for me. Asaf is probably a smart guy, but his teaching skills are near nonexistent. He puts some problems on the board, and flies through them without explaining important intermediate steps. He tends to dismiss questions asked in class, providing vague and incomplete answers. Andrei is even worse- his \"weekly\" review sessions were unhelpful if not nonexistent. The grading structure of this class is rather unforgiving. Homework only accounts for 10% of your grade, and both midterms consisted of only multiple choice questions. The first midterm was 10 true\/false questions, so getting one question wrong dropped you down half a letter grade. Furthermore, mistakes in answer keys for practice exams were very common. Just before the final exam, a friend of mine noticed an error in an answer key for the practice exam. She brought this to Asaf's attention, and he said that he was aware of it. Yet there had been no announcement to the class. The only redeeming quality of this class is that you can go watch the video lectures from MIT's version of the course (taught by the author of the textbook used in this class). These lectures were more helpful than our own lectures, and MIT's website has many resources for studying.",
    "I would not recommend this class, at least not the one taught by this professor. It is difficult to grasp the concepts of Math 222 without the guidance of a skilled instructor. If you are not already extremely good at math, this course will give you a hard time.",
    "For fun? Never. We were all in this course because we had to take it, not because we wanted to.",
    "An interesting class. You will leave with a thorough understanding of the rules of linear algebra, and no idea why you learnt them. Fairly easy math class, much simpler than 120.",
    "Absolutely. The material is all connected and pretty simple.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting class where I learned a lot and the psets were short but really made me think and understand the concepts.",
    "To be honest, I felt like most kids learned the material by watching the MIT online courseware videos, so I would not recommend taking this class if you don't need it. You can just pick it up yourself and might actually learn more that way :(",
    "No one takes this if they don't have to; linear's important, so do the outside work to learn the material.",
    "Good intro for linear algebra! Definitely application, and not proof based.",
    "If you like T\/F math test on concepts, take it. Not too much applications.",
    "Math 222 is an easy math course compared to math 120, but it is much more boring.",
    "Expect to rely on Khan Academy a lot if you 1. Have no past exposure to the topic and 2. Are taught with a focus on proofs",
    "This course is the \"applied\" option for learning linear algebra. It is a tremendously important subject as far as applied mathematics goes (for engineering, physics, computer science, etc.) and is absolutely essential for anyone who might need to use applied mathematics in the future. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Good course if you are willing to put in extra work to find real life applications to really know about linear algebra.",
    "A class no one wants to take but everyone has to",
    "Yes I would recommend this class.",
    "Don't expect to learn anything in class. Just get the book by David Lay and self learn.",
    "This is a good intro to linear algebra but not very in depth.",
    "It was not at all applications focused and was really more an abstract linear algebra theory class.",
    "This could be a really good class, and is very applicable in lots of different areas. That being said, I would try to take it with someone besides Professor Ferber.",
    "If you have to take it, it's not the end of the world.",
    "MATH 222 was a really great course. I hadn't taken math since high school, and I felt it was a great way to ease back into it. The problem sets under Professor Ferber were difficult, but they were great practice for the midterms and final, which were easier than the psets. Professor Ferber teaches at a very reasonable pace, and we cover enough material that we still learn a lot of useful stuff. Take this class!",
    "The class is a lot of self learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are looking for an applications based class.",
    "My linear experience was really defined by the professor I had (asaf). It wasn't the best experience because it felt different from the other sections in that both midterms were only 15 true\/false questions and so the range of class grades was so wide and I felt like I got the short end of the stick. Thank goodness that the final has calculation questions otherwise im sure my performance in the class would have been skewed to be really really low just because of the damn true\/false questions. Psets didn't really count for anything. He almost didn't count any of them but in the end 6\/9 made up 10%.",
    "Math 222 is a good course, but pay attention to the experience levels of the teacher who is teaching it as quality may vary significantly.",
    "Great class if you can pay attention",
    "Goes right by Gilbert Strang's book, which is really really nice - he's an incredible professor. The course is lax, but the exams require you to really know your stuff, which is nice.",
    "It's a really useful course, but you only really get a lot out of it if you invest extra time to watch the online lectures and really understand the material. Chances are you're taking it because it's a major requirement, though, so you don't have much a choice. My advice would be to use online resources to make sure you really understand the material--especially if it's explained poorly in class.",
    "Linear Algebra is very essential for many other disciplines. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "A very easy class but you won't internalize linear algebra. If you need to learn linear algebra for later use, take the other section.",
    "I would definitely say Lin Alg is a math class many students should take just because it has easier to follow concepts and applications.",
    "It's a good course that tests your conceptual understandings of the topics. There is not a lot of applications and the way Asaf teaches is fairly proof-based. The class definitely develops your ability to think abstractly",
    "This is a good math course with fairly easy concepts.",
    "Take it! Especially with Asaf",
    "I would recommend this course only to those who want to learn the basic overview of linear algebra. If you are thinking of a major that needs a strong mathematical background, such as math, physics, engineering, etc. I would recommend taking MATH 225 instead, which teaches more rigorous linear algebra.",
    "Don't take this class by this professor. Linear Algebra is usually supposed to be a manageable class but this one is just terrible.",
    "An interesting course if you like your math, I'd recommend it",
    "A different type of math course that is perfect for students who like puzzles. Linear algebra also has many surprisingly useful applications. It'll be a better experience if you take it with friends or find a study group.",
    "useful class",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because it is a pretty fun math class and super useful and even if you are not a math person it's really not that painful but I felt like I still learned a lot.",
    "I had mixed feelings about this class, but I enjoyed it by the end. I liked how we got a solid foundation of linear algebra concepts, although I thought the course was a bit too abstract -- we barely spent time on learning applications of linear algebra. The problem sets were mostly short and not too time-consuming. Taking good notes during class really helped for the exams, and I thought that reading the textbook was also really useful.",
    "The class is confusing but the homework requirements were light. Since this is course that is a prequisite for most STEM majors, only take this course if you have to."
