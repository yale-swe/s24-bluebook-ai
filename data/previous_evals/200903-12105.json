    "yes.",
    "This is an awesome class. Take it! Chauncey is a great lecturer, everything we learn is relevant and interesting, and even (most) of the readings are pretty cool. Also, Chauncey is a really nice man; he really cares about his students and that comes through in his lectures. This is an awesome class; gay, straight, bi, trans--it doesn't matter, just take this class!",
    "Yes, highly recommend. Cr\/D\/F for sure, though.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to both gay and straight students. Chauncey is an inspirational lecturer and I learned a lot. I am usually never able to concentrate in lectures but in this class I never had a desire to surf the web during class. The two essays and two exams are not that much work and the reading is not too heavy for a Hu.",
    "The course looks at the evolution of different theories of and attitudes toward homosexuality over the course of history and the queer communities reactions. I would definitely recommend this course because it's amazing.",
    "Yes!!!! I would recommend it to ANYONE. not just gay ppl, or people interested in gay issues. it is suupperr interesting to see how certain cultural ideas evolve in u.s. american society, and to take a new\/different approach to history.",
    "U.S. Gay and Lesbian History is an AMAZING class that everyone should take while at Yale. It is a lot of work, but it is well worth it.",
    "If you take an intro WGSS course, take this one. But really you should take History of Feminist Thought or Intro LGBT Studies if you want an impression of the WGSS major.",
    "Excellent course. Like any good survey, touches on several interesting facets of the topic and leaves the student eager to learn more. A great way to re-examine American history from an angle that they definitely don't take up in high school. Recommended for straight and gay students alike!",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you are at all interested in the topic.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're interested in the evolution of issues of gender and sexuality over the course of U.S. history -- although be prepared to take a highly gay male-centriccourse (the first half of the course is especially focused on middle-class white gay men). The workload isn't too challenging, most (though not all) o the readings are quite interesting, and the lectures are engaging and often even fun. Professor Chauncey is wonderful and does his best to get to know students, despite the large size of the lecture course. Despite the course's (minimal) weaknesses, I highly recommend it -- whether you're straight or LGBT, you're likely to learn a great deal of fascinating history and to connect this history to the ongoing struggle for LGBT rights.",
    "Take the class. One of the best at Yale, good brief overview of gay history.",
    "course covering topics in lesbian\/gay history in the US, from the 19th century to today. Most of the class is focused on the 20th century.I would definitely recommend it. The material is very interesting, and Chauncey teaches it well.",
    "This class is AMAZING!!! Take it! It's been one of my favorite classes at Yale. The material is fascinating, the subject incorporates great first-hand sources (films, photos, diaries, etc.), and it will expand the way you think.",
    "Excellent course. Really interesting for gay and straight people alike, and also really important information that you won't learn elsewhere. I would DEFINITELY recommend it.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "If you are queer, straight, female, male, American, international, a freshman, a senior, or anyone even remotely interested in the history of the United States, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is an AMAZING class. It is interesting and it is unlike any other class at Yale.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale. It has interesting reading (not too much), fascinating lectures, and fun sections. You should not graduate from Yale without taking this course.",
    "There are very few classes at Yale that I would call special - but this is one of them. Please take it. You will be a happier, more fulfilled, and better educated human being.",
    "I would recommend it if this is a topic you are interested in. The classes are very compelling. One essay due during semester, one over thanksgiving, a midterm, and a final. The tests to require a lot of preparation and a lot of what you know isn't going to come up.",
    "I believe US Lesbian&Gay History is an absolute must-take for all Yale students, whether LGBT or straight. I can't imagine many courses address such important issues about American society and American history. And best of all, this is a terribly FUN class. Chauncey does a great job of synthesizing the history and making it understandable, even for those without a strong background in gender and sexuality studies. The readings are incredible--I always looked forward to reading for this class. And overall, the workload is completely bearable. There were two essays, a midterm, and final. Oh, and Chauncey plays really good music before and after class--reason alone to take this course.",
    "This course is GREAT! It's a part of American History that you won't learn anywhere else. Chauncey is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "This was a really great class, in fact it is partly what made me want to be a history class. It's essentially social\/cultural history, which I've found I love. It's delivered in an engaging and fascinating way. The material is really interesting and still relevant today, but also the method of looking at the material is just really great. Even if you're not that interested in the topic I feel like the way Chauncey looks at history is a great thing to learn. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you're looking for U.S. history from a new perspective look no further. This class is fascinating, taught by a beautiful man who brings a huge lecture together in a near-family like setting. I would take it again if I could!!",
    "I would. Chauncey uses a lot of interesting artifacts-photographs, film clips, etc-to really make the class engaging and dynamic. However, lectures can become boring because he reads from a script. The papers are fun to write, though, and the class overall isn't too hard. If you put in the effort to learn IDs and comprehend themes and patterns in the history, you'll be more than fine. Also, there is a lot of reading, but it only helps you to understand the context of lectures. You can easily get by without doing the majority of it.",
    "Great class. Not too much work (midterm, two 5-7pg papers, final). Prof Chauncey is great. Most kids in the class are gay, but there is a bloc of straight people. If you are gay it's really nice to learn where people in your position have been in the past. If you are straight it's great to understand how fucked over gay people have been in the past and how we need to work together for ALL minority rights in the future.",
    "Absolutely. However, important to know that there is a little more work than is typical for a lecture class.",
    "This is a great course that traces the issue of homosexuality mainly through the 19th and 20th centuries.It reveals a lot of things that you didn't know about gay history and corrects a lot of things you think you knew. Another great thing about the course is that it highlights an entire aspect of a part of American history that you thought you already knew, such as the role and impact of the Cold War on gays in the US.",
    "This was my first (and only) history course taken at Yale, and it was really great--it mixes the survey-style of a sweeping introductory course with more in-depth discussions of primary sources. The papers are fun to write, the films are okay, and the lectures are some of the best I've ever seen. Fantastic course; take it if you have the chance!",
    "Take this. Like, really, take this. It's so relevant, so well-taught, so engaging. You learn not just about gay issues, but about the nature of all minorities, and the nature of identity.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You can't learn about this topic anywhere else.",
    "This class is US Lesbian and Gay History, with a large focus of the course being the 20th century specifically. This is a phenomenal class that I would recommend to anyone, gay or straight. This is a very important history, and a story that is just beginning to be told. What's more, George Chauncey is one of the biggest players in the field, and learning from him is both a pleasure and hugely rewarding.",
    "This is a great class. The lectures are as good as story time: the readings are engaging. You don't have to care about gay people -- this made me see history and my own views in a totally different light.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History is an eye-opening class. I found it much more valuable as a history of changing perceptions of sexuality in America than as a history of LGBT people specifically, but it's a class that everyone should take, gay or straight. I went in looking for some good talking points in debates about gay rights, and I got them. George Chauncey is one of the leaders in the field of queer studies, and his comments are very insightful. The reading is sometimes a bit heavy, but generally worth it and usually interesting. The lectures are good, but get repetitive sometimes.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History is a great, fascinating, fairly easy history class and Professor Chauncey is incredible. Not a lot of reading, the lectures are fun and REALLY interesting - who knew President Lincoln shared a bed with a male friend of his for three years straight? - and the course gives you a great perspective on the history of LGBT rights and the thriving gay subculture that's existed for decades.",
    "This is an awesome amazing great course. Chauncey is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale and this was truly a terrific experience. Definitely take it, and definitely bring all of your friends with you. It will be great and you will learn something interesting new things about Yale and New Haven through the course of the class. The readings are interesting especially the diaries of gay mean at Yale. Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "It's a totally great class that I would recommend to everyone. I took it because a friend who had taken it recommended it, and I'm really glad she did. Professor Chauncey is great, and the lectures are phenomenal. I really think that anyone who is wants an interesting class should take this one! I wish I could take it again.He is so great! I loved listening to his lectures. I actually really want to get to know him as a person because I liked him so much. I think his teaching is great. I do think some of the books assigned should be changed. But he shouldn'tchange anything about his teaching.",
    "It is a great overview of U.S. Lesbian and Gay history, and you learn a lot about Yale in the meantime. Chauncey is great and I would definitely recommend the course. The work and reading is also pretty good.",
    "This will sound incredibly pompous, but hey it's Yale, right?If you're a serious student of history who was taken some of Yale's great History lectures (Total War, Cold War, Civil War, etc.), you'll almost definitely be disappointed by this course. Many lectures are a fairly random mix of cultural observations that are used to make sweeping generalizations about gay life in a given era. George Chauncey is a great historian, as his book demonstrates, but because the other 200-some years of American gay history has not been written yet, he has to rely on very little in the way of solid historical research. The readings only add to this: BS sociological studies, diaries and other primary documents which range from fascinating to ridiculously obscure, and 2 great books of history (Allen Berube's and David Johnson's). Finally, don't come in expecting balanced and unbiased view of gay history: Chauncey makes little attempt to explain the anti-gay point of view, especially with the rise of the Christian right in the late 1970s and 1980s.Pros for the course: good and easy paper assignments, easy midterm and final, engaging and fun lectures, and an incredibly kind and caring professor.",
    "I would say that this is an extremely interesting class that covers the whole social\/cultural history of a group of Americans. Lectures are great, the readings are interesting, and it is a great class.",
    "An excellent course. Chauncey is the real deal--a conscientious social and cultural historian who really transmits the interesting details of life and gives them a lot of meaning. He clearly spends substantial time preparing his lectures, and as a result they are compelling and easy to take in.The reading is completely reasonable and very well-chosen (usually a nice mix of primary source material and historical accounts). The 3 shortish writing assignments are also nicely thought out--not the kind of thing I lost sleep over, but still got me really invested in the topics.In short, this is a model of what a lecture class should be, so if you're at all interested in either American cultural history or queer history, you MUST check it out.",
    "This is hands-down the best course at Yale. I felt excitement to go to class the day before, it was that good. Chauncey is a genius. TAKE IT!",
    "Awesome. Take it.",
    "If you're even considering it, take it! It's so much fun, and it will totally reshape the way you think of sexuality.",
    "Yes, one of the classes you need to take while at Yale.",
    "Please take this class. Take it because it covers a fascinating and much-overlooked section of US History. Take it because Professor Chauncey is the foremost scholar in his field and is a fabulous teacher (and person). Take it because your gay. Take it because your not gay. Take it because it's fun. Take it because it's current and urgent. Take it because you want to learn something about yourself, no matter your sexual orientation. Take it. Please.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in gender studies or american history topics, you do not need any background for this course",
    "Chauncey is an amazing lecturer. This course has made me aware of all the issues surrounding the homosexual debate, in a much more nuanced and reasonable way than the emotional appeal I usually felt. This class was not just a history course but also a journey of self-discovery.",
    "This class is great on its own, but it'll be the most fun if you take it with a big group of friends.",
    "US Lesbian and Gay History should be taken by everyone at Yale. It's a great course! Professor Chauncey is amazing! The course covers everything from homosexual practices in the colonial US to bar culture in the 50s and 60s to Stonewall and Prop 8. Each lecture is great and can stand on its own. Two (out of three) papers are required plus a mini ethnography; two exams.",
    "US Gay&Lesbian History was an engaging cultural history course. It provided a perspective that is rarely the center of attention in American History courses and that alone makes the class a valuable addition to anyone's schedule. Chauncey is an enthusiastic, compelling lecturer who uses a variety of sources and media to keep the class interesting; his own personal knowledge is so vast and his credibility as a researcher is so renowned that the sometimes disjointed sequence of lectures is not a big issue. The workload is generally moderate and the final oral history paper is an amazing opportunity to really get to know a new side of your parents and grandparents. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This is an amazing class. The course content is so interesting, and the professor is terrific. I can't say anything more clear than this: TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Take this class. It's a history you've never heard, and a really fun lecture. The work load is totally manageable and the readings are really engaging.",
    "Absolutely recommended to anyone, this class was amazing. I sort of ended up in it on a whim - I had a bad shopping experience with many classes I had intended to take, and followed a friend - and now I want to take many more WGSS classes. I thought it wouldn't be relevant to me as a straight student, but it was - I realized just how relevant by doing the (awesome) oral history project and seeing how gay and straight history intersected in my parents' and grandparents' generations. Chauncey is a brilliant lecturer, and it's an incredible experience to watch this new genre of history and historiography being shaped pretty much in front of us by one of the greats of the field. There is a lottttt of reading, but it's all interesting - I actually did all of it, which was a first. Take it!!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you're not a history major. Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "Hist 127 is an INCREDIBLE class - mostly focusing on the 20th century but with a good survey on the 19th as well. The lectures were works of art - so many photos, film clips, songs, all crafted into the lecture material beautifully. I would highly recommend the class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. No matter what else you think you want to take. No matter what you know or don't know about Gay and Lesbian History. Take it! You will be so glad you did.Professor Chauncey is thoughtful, engaging, hard-working, knowledgeable, and an extraordinary lecturer. His deep care for his students and this subject is apparent in every lecture. His course is well structured, carefully planned, and brilliantly executed.ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE!Absolutely extraordinary. Everyone should take this class. You should take this class. This is such an important history and it couldn't possibly be taught in a more meaningful, engaging, thought-provoking way. Truly an extraordinary class.",
    "The course summarizes the history of the gay\/lesbian\/queer community in the USA, with a focus on the last century. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in the course material or just wants to learn more about the gay community in general.",
    "This is a really great course. You won't learn this history ANYWHERE ELSE. There's also something exciting about taking a course on living history - you learn about recent events, and you learn about today. You can't really understand the present debates on gay rights without understanding the history behind them. It's also just really fun. Chauncey is a fabulous professor and really cares about his students. The workload is light too! You really have no reason not to take it.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. If you think the course subject doesn't pertain to you or your life, you are wrong. I have recommended this course to so many friends and classmates. Do yourself a favor and sign up for it, even if it's a 5th or 6th course. That's what Cr\/D\/F is for.",
    "All I can say is that you should take this class. Even (or especially) if you're not LGBTQ-this class is one that everyone should take before they graduate.",
    "I would recommend the course because it provides a side of history completely forgotten in most text books. I would characterize it as a course that explores the position of gay men and lesbians throughout America's history.",
    "You MUST take this class. it's like watching a performance. good use of photos, digital evidence. really neat",
    "AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. This has to be one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Chauncey is also one of the most approachable, thoughtful, and passionate professors I have had the pleasure of taking a class with. The material that we learned this course is IMMINENTLY important and also FASCINATING. Chauncey does a great job of using a huge range of different media to illuminate concepts, themes and ideas throughout the course. The work is do-able, enjoyable and really makes you learn a lot. Two more things: 1. This course may turn you into an activist if you are not already (and will help you develop into an effective one if do already consider yourself one) and 2. For me, this course opened a door onto other worlds that should be know to us all. It is not everyday that you find a class that is both so relevant and important to understand for all of its past and current implications but also so exciting and wonderful to learn about. Here is your chance to learn about the history of a complex civil and human rights battle that has been going on for centuries--and to learn what your role in this struggle could be. EVERYONE at Yale should take this course!",
    "A quick-moving overview of the rise of the concept of the homosexual, the homophile movement and the gay rights movement in the U.S. from the 1600s to present day. Definitely take this course if you have any kind of interest in this subject AT ALL because George Chauncey is a kickass lecturer and a prominent figure in gay rights today in his own right. You won't want to miss a single lecture. The class about AIDS at Yale brought nearly everyone in the lecture hall -- all 160 of us -- to tears. Powerful and fascinating course, and the final project, which requires you to interview your family and craft an oral history about their experiences with homosexuality, actually brought my family a little closer together.Do it.",
    "It was an amazing class that was interesting and enjoyable. The two papers aren't bad at all, and the interviews required for the second one were especially interesting.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to another student. There's a moderate amount of reading, but the material is absolutely fascinating and goes by very quickly. The papers aren't very difficult and the exams are very straightforward. Most importantly, the lectures are fantastic. Before each lecture, Chauncey plays songs relevant to the day's topic,which helps put everyone in a good mood. The lectures themselves are loaded with interesting information and entertaining anecdotes (several from his own experience or from Yale history). This is without question one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. TAKE IT.",
    "Pretty much what the title says, and in taking it you will learn how little you knew about what the title says. History with music, movies, books, ideas, shuffled in -- a comprehensive look at gay and lesbian history.",
    "AMAZING. YES. TAKE IT. It was my favorite class thus far of my three semesters at Yale.",
    "An American history class that focuses on an important minority that is often overlooked or skimmed over in other history classes. The class teaches you about how gay and lesbian history fits into straight history. You learn about the major events in American history, such as the Civil War, the Depression, the World Wars, the Cold War, the sexual revolution, etc., and gay people's roles in these events. Chauncey also proves that many of the myths that surround gay and lesbian history are not true.",
    "Not really. The class was interesting, but there was too much reading for me. However, Im more of a science person than a humanities person anyhow.",
    "Yes, if you're looking for an interesting and light course, I would definitely recommend this class. I was never frustrated with it.",
    "I would recommend this course because I it is really important and interesting history, not only for LGBTQ student, but also for anyone in America who wants to understand different ideas and practices of sexuality. Not that difficult of a course, but beware of TAs.",
    "the most amazing course, no matter what your sexuality is.....",
    "This is the best class I have ever taken - no matter what your major or background, this class will change the way you think about history and sexuality. It adds the gay\/lesbian side of history that no one teaches to history that everyone is familiar with. Prof. Chauncey is brilliant and his lectures are so entertaining - he adds video clips, music and wonderful pictures to supplement lectures. Take this class before you graduate!",
    "Great class! Thought provoking, intense, and fun, without being too much work. The assignments are challenging conceptually but not difficult to execute. The professor is fun and interesting and accessible. The class would be great for nonmajors or majors.",
    "I highly recommend this course. George Chauncey is a great lecturer, and a wonderful person with lots of knowledge and stories to share. Lectures are really fascinating. The workload is not bad, mainly just the readings which are usually very interesting. Tests and papers are not very difficult. I really cannot praise the course highly enough, it is an awesome opportunity that shouldn't be passed up.",
    "An overview of gay and lesbian history in the US by looking at prominent figures in politics and popular culture who were closeted or openly gay. Deals with issues of gay social spaces and culture throughout American history as well as trends and historical changes in general perceptions of gender and sexuality. Readings of diaries, articles, ethnographies, and also films.",
    "I would most definitely reccommed this course to other students. It is an very fun, very interesting course. The Professor is amazing and the TAs are very helpful.",
    "Absolutely take it. Lectures are fun, the readings are interesting, Chauncey is amazing, and you won't learn this material anywhere else.",
    "Great class! Take it!",
    "Very moving class with interesting and insightful readings. It really opens your eyes to a rich and vibrant history that is not that apparent looking at today's society. Plus Chauncey is second to none. Take the class.",
    "This course is covers gay and lesbian history in the United States from about the mid 19th century until now, with a particular focus on the second half of the 20th century. I would absolutely recommend this to another student, especially one who has no background but some interest in the subject area.",
    "Good class to take for anyone. Chauncey is great lecturer and you likely dont know most of the material.",
    "I'm glad I took this course, but I wouldn't advise it to another student. The lectures, though interesting at first, soon proved redundant, uninteresting, and unnecessary. Same goes for the readings. Ultimately, I'm glad I did the readings and went to the lectures because I have a good knowledge base on a topic that I find incredibly relevant in both my daily life and in the political life of modern America. That said, I could have gotten much of this from doing a little of my own research on the topic, and that probably would have proved to be a more satisfying experience. The one thing that I really really liked about the course was the last paper for which I interviewed my family members about their experiences with gay culture--I uncovered a lot of stories and people I didn't know in the process, and I think it was a really valuable experience.",
    "I would recommend it with no reservations!!!! Take it whether you're LGBTQ or straight!",
    "YES take it. I'd been dying to take this class since I heard it existed, and it did not disappoint. Chauncey is a great lecturer, readings are fun and there isn't that much each week, and I guarantee you will learn a lot.",
    "History 127 is a great lecture course. While it helps to be interested in the subject, it's a wonderful American history course in its own right. Chaunceyis a legend, and rightfully so. There's a decent amount of reading, but it's not unmanageable. I'd absolutely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Chauncey is a gem. His lectures were the highlight of my week. Just make sure to shop the sections because some section leaders are better than others and I've heard that different section leaders have different writing styles they're looking for-- make sure you find one that suits your style.",
    "Fascinating, dynamic, and well-run. Lives up to all the hype!"
