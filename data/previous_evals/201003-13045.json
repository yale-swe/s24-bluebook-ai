   "comments": [
    "Yes, every student and every person who lives in this era should learn about the subject of this class. He dispelled a lot of misconceptions about an extremely important topic.",
    "Yes. Its a great class but can be alot of work sometime.",
    "This class is terrible",
    "not really. the class is interesting and has potential, but there is too much information that is expected to be memorzied",
    "interesting survey course of the origins of modern islam...i definitely learned some interesting stuff but was not thrilled with teh class over all.",
    "TAKE IT! SERIOUSLY! You have to take a class with Griffel before you leave Yale!",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Really interesting if you want to know the theory and ideology behind modern Islamic fundamentalism. Not too much work either, just do the readings, most of the primary sources are pretty interesting.",
    "definitely take it! Griffel's lectures and readings are SO interesting and very different from other Islam related classes. Its a lot of material to memorize but if you keep on top of your readings, you'll be fine.",
    "Take this is class if you are at all curious about Islam and its role today. The professor assumes no prior knowledge and does a great job in providing the necessary background. However, be prepared to memorize a lot of Persian and Arabic names and words though.The workload isn't too bad: about a 100 pages of reading per week, discussion section, midterm and final, and one 5 page paper.",
    "Yes, if you are already sufficiently interested in the material. Otherwise you'll be bored of the technicality of many ideologies.",
    "straight-up lecture, lots of information and studying for the tests is stressful but good information.",
    "Good experience, definitely worthwhile if you want to learn, and to some extent understand what is going on. But this is a lecture course about a topic that would probably work better as a seminar.",
    "Great course! It opened up my eyes to the richness and diversity of the Muslim world that is far from even hinted at in the news media and general discourse. It also provided a great context for understanding and interpreting current events in Middle Eastern countries.",
    "yes i would. great class that everyone should take because of the way it relates to current events and truly understanding fundamentalsit islam, one of if not the most pressing issues of our time.",
    "Yes but be warned that it is not necessarily about Islam TODAY but is more theoretical.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "yes!",
    "Engaging and relevant material but poorly structured lectures. If you are interested in the history of the Islamic world, you'll probably be better of finding a couple good books about the issue and reading them on your own. there are some interesting primary sources documents that you get to read",
    "YES TAKE IT! Wonderful, wonderful class. You want to know this material to understand contemporary world events. The workload isn't terribly burdensome; the tests are straightforward (big picture, with some specific examples) and the writing assignment is moderate as long as you attend section regularly. My TA was amazing, so that wasn't an issue.",
    "I would recommend the class. Despite its limitations, It is a great background to modern Islamic world and provides a great deal of insight into the current state of the Islamic world and its relations to the west.",
    "I actually have a better understanding of Islam, both mainstream and fundamentalist, as well as a better comprehension of its role in various countries. You realize after this course that the each country in the Middle East is very unique and the region is not homogeneous in any sense. It makes current events more accessible and the conflicts in the region less mythical.This course is well-laid out - it looks at the history of Islam briefly but enough to establish necessary principles to then examine the interpretation and practice of Islam in various countries of the Middle East. Then the course zooms out to look at Islam in the West and some modern issues it struggles with before addressing the question of fundamentalism - which isn't necessary, because fundamentalism is talked about in each country in its own specific practice.",
    "MMES 290 gives a very thorough explanation of all of the important fundamentalist movements, their actions, the political parties that they influence, etc. Regions that the course covers includes Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Palestine, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Students learn all about the history and ideology of movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaida, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Iranian regime, the Wahabiism\/Saudi regime, Taliban, and more. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely. All problems with the course aside, it was an interesting, relevant, and useful course. Even if you are not a political science, religious studies, or MMES major, everyone could benefit from taking this course. Just make sure to pick a good TF. Some can be really good, and others apparently aren't so great.",
    "take it if you want a chill class...reading isn't necessary. just follow the class notes to the t, and you'll be fine.",
    "A very quick survey of Islam, and the history of the middle east, India, and Pakistan. Great course for people with an interest in the subject, but no background.",
    "The best summary would be in the Blue Book. Take it!",
    "Professor Griffel is great. You never feel bored in lecture, and he keeps your attention. There's a decent amount of reading, but it's very interesting for the most part, and a lot of it is primary sources of people like bin Laden, which gives you a real idea of what they're saying. This, however, is not a class on terrorism per se. I was expecting more focus on current events, but the class tends to talk more about the rise of influential thinkers, so there's not a whole lot after the 1980s. Still very interesting and worth knowing, but for the most part not really cocktail party-type fun facts.",
    "This is a good course, although I wouldn't say it was enjoyable. The readings can be dry at times, but in general the subject matter was very interesting. I'm glad I took it for the knowledge I've gained. The scope of the class was very broad, and I feel like I only gained a superficial understanding of many things we studied--but I guess this is inevitable in a survey course of this nature. Griffel is great though, and he has an adorable accent.",
    "Yes, take it! It's a fantastic course and informs a student of the roots of a prevalent religion today.",
    "It is a good introduction to movements of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East, going country by country. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Middle East or Islam.",
    "yes definitely you'll learn alot.",
    "Yes. This is one of the best lectures out there. The course is very well taught and put together. Professor Griffel genuinely seems to care about his students. The workload is really not too bad... just make sure you start studying for the exam a couple of days before. There is a LOT to memorize.",
    "interesting and relevant course. lots of info to know for the midterm and final, but otherwise the workload isn't bad (just one 5-page paper).",
    "This class is a rigorous and completely fascinating combination of history, study of religious philosophy and political science. Those are three areas that I'm really interested in so I was never bored. You will learn so, so much about the history of the Middle East and how Islam got to be where it is today. Take it if those things are interesting to you! It's a pretty difficult course, though. The essay is challenging (but you can choose a good topic) and the final and midterm are difficult because you have to answer all of the ID's, and some of them are very obscure Arabic words or names.All of the reading is really really interesting and I read almost everything for this class. Just takeit if you're interested.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to any student who wishes to have an overview of Islam today. The course is about the intellectual trends and how they were affected by various political factors.",
    "THats one class you need to take at Yale. Professor Griffel very persuasively refutes the hundred stupidest beliefs about Islam beautifully! And I personally felt so ashamed of equating Islam (religion) with Terrorism. You will also find a lot about the selfish policies of USA that only abetted counter-terrorism. quite an eye opener, eh.",
    "This course is mostly an intellectual history of the roots of jihad and fundamentalism, and the course tracks the spread of these ideas from country to country. The class is taught as a set of case studies, taking manifestations of fundamentalist movements country by country. I would recommend the course for those interested in the subject, but it can be difficult to pay attention to the professor, and the class can be confusing at times and in the order in which it is taught.",
    "PLSC 435 is a great class for those who want to learn about the development of jihad as a part of the development of Islamic ideologies, and the different ideologies present in Islam. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to explore Islamic ideologies and understand the idea of jihad.",
    "I really enjoyed Islam Today. It's easy to deride this class as a \"Wikipedia class\" -- in which you learn a bunch of names and dates that you might just as well look up on Wikipedia. And it definitely felt like that at times. But I felt like I got a great foundation in the basics of the Muslim world, which is something you need to understand Islam in the modern day. Most importantly, the class is about ideas, different trends in Muslim thought, and that is what makes it worthwhile at the end of the day. I highly recommend it, I came away feeling like I learned quite a bit.",
    "yeah, it's an interesting perspective on a subject that's all over contemporary poli sci, and everyday news.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to students who",
    "Very interesting material, not necessarily taught the best way.",
    "Excellent for putting the microscope on some of the aspects and implicit assumptions of the \"Islamic fundamentalism\" and \"jihad\" that mark a great deal of media discourse today. Breaks down the various movements and their differences well (did you know that the Taliban and al-Qaida have very different objectives?), while withholding judgment on them. If all you know is what the NYT says, I highly recommend this course.Be warned: I expect that the difference in workload between an A and an A- is very great. Also, the expectations on the exams were obscure (though the paper requirement is a great deal).And for a fun game in an otherwise unspectacular lecture: count the number of times Professor Griffel says \"in this case.\" I got 111 for one of our fifty-minute periods.",
    "I think this is a great class to take. It really introduces you to extreme islamic thinking, and gives you skills to analyse reporting on current issues. The tests are hard to study for, but the grading understands that. I definitely left the course knowing more than I started.",
    "Islam Today will open your mind the world of islamic religious philosophy and history. I now have a greater appreciation for islamic society and culture. Lectures are fast-paced and engaging. However, the tests were stupid. I felt like I was in 9th grade again. They required the pointless cramming of hundreds of people, places, and events that I forgot within hours of the exam. Having minimal knowledge of Islam and arabic coming into the class I felt disadvantaged next to my muslim or arabic-studying peers.",
    "Not as exciting as it could be. The exams are not that hard, but require just straight memorization.",
    "Definitely worth taking! A great survey of Islam in the world.",
    "I came into the class knowing little about the Middle East or Islamic fundamentalism. This class changed the way I view current politics; it should be a requirement for all Yale graduates! Griffel is extremely knowledgeable in the field and passionate about the course material.",
    "This is a good course, with slightly too much reading to do practically. It can be difficult for students with no introduction in Islam because many of the students enrolled were fairly well-versed in the religion coming in. However, this reason alone should not be enough to dissuade one from taking it, as the course provides a lot of valuable information."
