    "I would recommend it to any student of American religious history because it provided fairly thorough coverage of the discipline's history, questions, and contours. That said, though, the discussion of the course never really took off. I'm not sure why--maybe because students had different goals for the course, maybe because so much course time needed to be devoted to the professors' introduction of the material, maybe because the conversation was never especially directed?",
    "It is an overview of the historiography of American religious history. I would recommend it if the student were at the beginning of her graduate study.",
    "\"Readings in American Religious History\"Yes, I would absolutely recommend.If I could make one recommendation to the Professors it would be to push the paper due date back. I'm not sure why, but it seemed like every single Yale\/ YDS course had very early due dates this year (where did reading week go?). Maybe it was the structure of the semester (with Thanksgiving falling so late), but it was incredibly difficult to get everything done well and in on time. Another way to go about this would be to have a week without reading (or less reading...) in which we are supposed to complete a draft of our papers and then have us each present our topics in class...",
    "Thisa reading course in American Religious History, with major religious themes represented. Moreover, the course equips students with the analytic tools for methodological assessment.I would highly recommend the course. The professors are extremely knowledgeable, and the opportunity to engage in critical discussion with them is invaluable."

   "comments": [
    "The course familiarized me with the discipline's history, questions, and problems. It also introduced me to works that I'll surely include on my orals list, etc.",
    "The course was designed entirely to survey the discipline. In that sense, it was very helpful. I wish, in fact, it were two semesters long. That would have allowed an even deeper engagement. As for my own research, it helped incredibly, in giving me the tools to think about the kind of history I want to write and in exposing me to the kinds of field-shaping works.",
    "This course provided me with further knowledge of the historiography of American religious history.",
    "The course expanded my periodization of American religious history, setting my particular interests within a more informed historical context. Moreover, I left the course with a greater attentiveness to historiography and the common methods employed in the field."
