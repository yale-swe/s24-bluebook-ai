    "12. We need more curriculum related to food, food systems, and agriculture. This course goes a tiny waytoward filling a deep need.10. John was fantastic as a resource outside of class and on my research for the course. As a lecturer he is also good. But John cannot facilitate discussion to save his life; his questions did not prompt good dialogue or sharing of material, insights, experiences, etc. Course time should be spent more dynamically with a better discussion\/seminar flow, OR in a more traditional lecture mode with John presenting on the material for the week.",
    "Question 12: There are very few courses at Yale that have to do with food, and for people that are interested in food, this course is perfect. It was highly tailored to our interests because it was so small, and the readings were all really awesome. It was also literally just two hours of talking about the readings and our ideas, and that made the time pass quickly--it was a lot of fun!",
    "Excellent readings, great syllabus. The topics selected were interesting and the readings were well-selected. The course discussion was, however, lacking. I would recommend capping the class to a smaller number of students in the future. The professor is extremely knowledgeable and great to talk to one-on-one.",
    "I think that the course could focus more on solutions to food production system issues.",
    "The class shouldn't be called the future of food. it should be called 'toxicology of food'. it was dry, and did not encourage any creativity. it was entirely information driven. information is important, but not where education happens. education happens in challenge and transformation. consequently, i most learned in this class through being frustrated with how the class went. there was only an exploration of past trends, no analysis about why the trends are that way, nor what can we do about it. i am highly motivated to take classes about food, so this class was disappointing mainly because of the opportunity lost to have an engaging conversation about transformation of food and farming systems."

    "Instructor's desire for us to learn more about our specific interests. I appreciated that we were able to tailor both the class topics and our final projects.",
    "It was great to have such accomplished peers in the class - the material was fantastic and Professor Wargo did an excellent job covering many topics over the course of the semester. Also, the research project really allowed us to tackle a major issue and dissect it.",
    "1. the ability to design my own research paper based on something I am fascinated by, care deeply about, and came to Yale to work on.2. High level overview of issues impacting our food system and supply.",
    "The readings and discussion were both wonderful! I learned a lot from our readings and even more from discussing them with the knowledgeable people I had class with. And of course the trip to a winery and Professor Wargo's house for dinner were both lovely.",
    "I think this course has a lot of potential. Student discussion were fascinating. I think the group at FES has some real experts and we need to make use of them. I enjoyed researching and writing my final paper. It was a fascinating topic and provided me with a great opportunity to dive in and learn a ton.It was helpful to have a diverse set of students - for example, it was great to have Haley explain legal issues, and to have SOM students explain what things meant in terms of a successful business model.I appreciated all of the meeting times and the divided up timeline for accomplishing work.",
    "For me the most interesting part was having so many people with such a wide range of backgrounds that could really bring different perspectives to the table.",
    "The readings for this course were wonderful, and our discussions were always thought-provoking. I learned a lot from the other people in the course who have a lot of background in food issues.",
    "The food!",
    "The best aspect of this course was the level of freedom in the final project. I was able to create a final project that matched my unique interests. I also liked not having assignments in addition to weekly reading and the final paper, as the reading load was significant.",
    "The readings and talking with Prof. Wargo.",
    "Readings were very interesting and the range of topics covered was very wide.",
    "The wide breath of topics and food products covered is impressive.",
    "Comprehensive and intensive",

   "comments": [
    "Structure of class time...sometimes class wandered a bit.",
    "I would say that there should be more field trips!",
    "1. John's facilitation of seminar discussion needs improvement",
    "Maybe assign slightly fewer pages of reading each week; I ended up skimming or not fully reading some of the material just because it was overwhelming.",
    "While the research paper was really interesting, I would much rather learn a ton each week than be given extra time to research my final paper. I think this class did not demand enough of us. Many books on food are quick reads and fascinating. In my environmental history class last year, we were expected to read pretty dense 300-400 page books each week. I think you could successfully require students to read some of the books on that original list - some of those topics (bananas, four fish, on food and cooking) would have been really fun and I think might have led to better discussions. I know we could have read those books, but in reality you can either require readings and people will read, or you can suggest readings and we wont.Following up on demanding more - I think if you want better research projects, you are right to set up a time line that gets students submitting drafts early. If you demand that our draft is in on November 10th, people will submit something and most definitely end with superior products. Soft deadlines are not followed by FESers.It might have been interesting to have a development biologists or hormone expert from the med school\/bio department come in and provide a lecture on why some of these chemicals can be harmful.One possible way to run this class would be to assign two students to lead each week's discussion. Everyone could read a book and then those students could lead a casual discussion about the issues at play. We could supplement this with a few more guest speakers. I thought the person from clifbar was interesting, but less relevant for the class. Maybe someone from the Farmer's Cow or another nearby dairy farm could talk about the role of hormones? Someone from EPA could talk regulation? Finally, if student research projects remain a focus of the class, I think we should share them more fully. Perhaps spend two days and give each student a more formal 10 minute (Hard cap, cut off!) chance to talk and respond to some questions. I was fascinated to learn about some projects, but would have appreciated learning about all more equitably.Finally, it was really hard to hear pretty much everyone in the class. Speak up!",
    "Maybe slightly more structured discussions?",
    "The title \"The Future of Food\" is somewhat misleading. The course is truly about the history of toxic regulations in the US, which gives an excellent background for students as to why we have the food system we have now. However, more focus should truly be on the future of food; namely possible solutions to improving the food system and suggestions as to areas students can work in to create such improvements. I didn't walk away from the course with an understanding of what I could personally do in my career to make changes to the food system, just a feeling of being overwhelmed, and that neither science nor policy would provide good solutions.",
    "The class discussion. Not too stimulating. Fewer students might change that, especially since the professor is really excellent, but does not shine as well in such a large class.",
    "the course should provide more answers and solutions to food issues, rather than focus on current food problems",
    "Defining what the future of food means to the class.",
    "A modified seminar format would help - perhaps more frequent breakouts into smaller groups for enhanced discussion",
    "More interactive discussions.",
    "Nothing really. The syllabus could have been a bit more concise.",
    "the classroom experience needs a lot of work! The instructor and the students spoke entirely to softly so it was impossible to hear. it made the whole experience sleepy instead of exciting and challenging. the instructor controlled conversation too much, and seemed to highlight his past successes more than actually stimulate students to think more deeply on the subjects. information was treated as an end, not a means. instead, students could be encouraged to challenge one another, and explore the foundational assumptions and causes of the trends in the food system, as a way to actually get into what the 'future' of food can look like!"

This course does not fit in a modern food studies program. Emerging critiques of the food system are powerful, nuanced, and productive for creating change. Students will not find that critique in this class, unless they bring it themselves, and even then it wont be received warmly. Nonetheless, the instructor is very knowledgeable about toxicology, so if that seems useful, than students will get a lot out of the class."
