    "Research and historical methods",

    "Research is good! Very self-directed.",
    "I've learned how to use and research primary sources, in addition to synthesize them.",
    "I learned how to do archival research, wtite an extended-form essay, and communicate with an advisor to write it.",
    "Started my senior essay!",
    "Time management is critical for the first half the senior essay! I struggled with this as the history department provides very little guidance. No specific skills, knowledge, or insight learned beyond my specific thesis research. It would be really great if the history department had a colloquium at least for the fall semester!",
    "I was able to strengthen skills I have been developing over the last three years -- such as creating an annotated bibliography, analyzing primary sources, and synthesizing secondary and primary sources into an argument.",
    "Research skills, writing skills, conducting literature review and primary source analysis",
    "This course was a useful exercise in distilling my abundance of sources into a working historical argument. I felt the annotated bibliography and prospectus were particularly helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I think the history department could do a lot better job communicating deadlines, resources, etc. to students. This is a very go-it-alone process; make sure you have a good advisor.",
    "The due dates for assignments were awful. Having the ten page draft due at 5pm the first day after thanksgiving break? What the hell? It's possibly the most inconvenient time possible. Not only did this force us to do most of the paper over break, but it complicated things because many of us have physical resources, like books, that we are using for our research and it's impossible for us to travel with those materials. Why not have it due at midnight of that day? Or at the end of the week? Or literally any other time. Seriously, I don't understand what goes through the history department's minds when you think: \"Oh this will be a great time for undergrads to turn in work.\" Get back in touch with reality.",
    "Really depends on the advisor! Mine is wonderful.",
    "Could have more announcements of when things are due",
    "More large-geoup, or small group, workshops to discuss our work and issue.",
    "Gotta do it!",
    "I think the course is good because it allows some freedom regarding the extent to which students engage, but still structures your fall enough so that you are on track to finish your thesis in the Spring.",
    "Strengths: creates structure to work on research and argumentation. No particular weaknesses. Perhaps more full group meetings with the Senior Essay Director throughout the course of the semester would be beneficial. As every thesis advisor has a different approach, it would be great to have some common ground.",
    "I am grateful for the scaffolding, but certain assignments are essentially useless and\/or assume a specific teleological method of working that is not common to all students. For example, I found the annotated bibliography excessive. I also think the draft at the end of the semester should have been due at the end of the reading period or during finals, and should have been a bit longer (10 pages for a 40-50 page thesis does not make sense)!"

   "comments": [
    "Mandatory to write a thesis so, yeah take it. The first semester departmental deadlines will often feel like busy work if you're working on your research in a committed way already.",
    "Yes! Senior essays are required.",
    "Required for the 2 semester History senior essay.",
    "Of course: it is a requirement",
    "Yes. It is nice to be able to pursue your own project.",
    "Gotta do it!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I think preparing a year-long thesis is a fulfilling way to finish senior year as a History major. The work completed first semester is crucial for developing a sound analysis second semester.",
    "You do not have a choice, but make sure you get a good advisor? It is a largely self-directed project, at least in the fall."
