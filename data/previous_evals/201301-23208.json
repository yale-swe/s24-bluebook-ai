    "Egyptomania is a must-take while the exhibit \"Echoes of Egypt\" is open at the Peabody. If you are at all interested in Ancient Egypt (especially if you have never taken a class on it before) this is a great class to take! Covers topics from art history, egyptology, archeology, history, museum curation and more! Professor Manassa is a fantastic professor whose love for her subject is apparent in every lecture.Reading responses, midterm, final paper (5-7 pgs), and section are all reasonably graded - there are even multiple opportunities for extra credit!",
    "NELC 120 was a wonderful course! Not only do you learn about a part of Egyptian history that is not covered in most other courses, but you have the unique opportunity to learn about museum exhibitions and installations because of the Peabody! Professor Manassa, who is a great lecturer and passionate about the subject, wove many field trips into the schedule of the class. Also, you get to watch Boris' Karloff in the Mummy. Need I say more?",
    "Interesting and easy. But the material gets a little tedious after awhile, especially if you know nothing of Egyptian history.",
    "This is a great class with interesting topics and fun assignments. The multiple field trips were really great.",
    "Really interesting course which gives you a great background on the history of Ancient Egypt as well as the history of the influence of Ancient Egypt on many different civilizations since. Has great field trips and ties in wonderfully with the exhibit at the Peabody Museum.",
    "Yes. This is a great class and you learn something that you wouldn't normally. The lectures and the professor are awesome. You get to go to the Peabody and see the exhibit that Prof. Manassa curated which is really cool.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! This class is amazing! It is sooooo interesting and you get to study Ancient Egypt through an entirely new perspective. The class is more weighted towards a 'History of Art' genre, than intensive History, but you still learn so much about the historical cultures and societies of ancient Egypt. There was so much content throughout the semester, which pleasantly surprised me and I look forward to investigating in the modern world. There is no final, just a midterm and paper of your choice. Professor Manassa is a fantastic lecturer and there is nothing quite like being able to study a piece of history or art and then see it in person at the Peabody. There is quiet a lot of reading, but it is all really interesting, and Professor Manassa is very aware of the heavy workloads at certain times in the semester, and she accommodates for that. The reading responses\/assignments are fun and novel - treasure hunts in the art gallery\/analysing plates at the Beinecke. A must take class - best yet!!!",
    "YES YES YES YES YES: must take must take!!! This class was fantastic. The materials were interesting, readings instructive, and most of all the professor was phenomenal. Absolutely must take! Strengths: interesting topics, dynamic classes (field trips to the Peabody, Grove St Cemetery, etc.), FANTASTIC professor. Professor Manassa is wonderful. She is very passionate about the material, and it shines through in her energetic lectures. I learned a lot, and wish I could take more classes with her! Standard-less workload: 6 reading responses, midterm, and final paper (5-7). Take!!",
    "This is a good class-take it while the exhibit is still up!",
    "Great! The reading is way over the top, but luckily most of the material on the midterm is from the lectures. There is also no final, but instead a short final paper which is great. The TAs are awesome so hopefully Maria and Elizabeth are still around!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn more about Egypt or about how it has affected so many different cultures all around the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn more about Egypt and its influence in the world."
