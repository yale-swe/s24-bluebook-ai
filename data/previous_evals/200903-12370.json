   "comments": [
    "Take it -- never mind that it is at 925 in the morning. It is worth it. Adam Tooze is fantastic and the material is really fascinating. One of the better history lectures I have taken in a long time.",
    "YES. Take this course. A really interesting period of history that relates to the rest of world history closely. Tooze goes through things well (even if he sometimes talks quickly), and there isn't too much reading. Well worth taking.",
    "absolutely would recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course-- a good overview of German history in the 20th century (and thus of European history in general). HIST 266 is taught in a traditional manner, with a chronological series of lectures and readings each week that supplement the material covered in class. The readings are interesting and, for a history course at Yale, are assigned in reasonable and doable quantities (ca. 100 pages per week).",
    "This class is awesome! I highly recommend it because Professor Tooze is great and the subject matter is genuinely interesting particularly if you have only ever looked at the World Wars from the American perspective. While I am interested in Germany, one certainly doesn't have to to enjoy this class!",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in German or world history. The period covered is absolutely fascinating, and you really should have an understanding of the nation which almost tore the world apart twice in one century.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in German history. Tooze is awesome. My only caution is that the work is very end-heavy - there is a final paper and a final exam, so plan your semester accordingly so you have time to prepare for both.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! It was a really interesting history class that examined German history within the greater context of Europe. Awesome!"
