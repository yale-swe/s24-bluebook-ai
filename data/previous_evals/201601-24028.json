    "This is a truly fantastic class. You'll discuss many important aspects of life and how to make decisions as you get older. The readings are hit or miss, sometimes boring, and other times incredible, but either way they are minimally required for class.",
    "Along with \"Life Worth Living,\" David Brooks' classes have a reputation for being \"group therapy\" sessions. \"Successful Global Leadership,\" which should really be called \"Commitment,\" is no exception. The class focuses on how and why we make commitmentsto each other, to spouses, to religion, to family, etc.. You read some interesting books, but the real point is to vent intelligently to one another and David Brooks. Very few classes offer you the opportunity to really share parts of yourself with your peers in a highly intellectual setting. David Brooks is obviously not everyone's cup of tea, but this class really is unique at Yaledefinitely a \"must shop,\" if not a \"must take.\" And yes, he does look like a cute little owl in person! Whooo!",
    "The strength and weakness of this class are the same: we do a number of enlightening readings from which the class is almost entirely removed. The seminar itself follows Mr. Brooks' daily musings and the musings of his students, and although the daily theme is related to the readings, it rarely delves into the nuances of the text(s). Mr. Brooks is a insightful, thoughtful, extremely educated man who can shed new light on nearly any topic. He asks compelling questions. I do wish he were a more thoughtful seminar leader though; at times, it felt as though students just talked passed each other instead of genuinely engaging with each others' points, and Mr. Brooks (as the instructor) could have guided the conversation more closely. Overall, I got a lot out of this course and started many great books that I hope to finish reading in the near future.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's a good course for anyone who hopes to gain good insight into different decision-making processes.",
    "A course on the big questions in life. I'd wholeheartedly recommend it; I think this should be a lecture class so that more students can be exposed to it.",
    "GLBL347 was a class that I felt had more potential but didnt quite live up to it - at least in its first iteration. While some might describe it as book club with David Brooks, our class often failed to discuss the reading at all - so much so that I felt unmotivated to complete the readings by the end of the course (part of that is also my fault). David is fairly good at facilitating discussion in the seminar, especially given the demographic of the class, which I would describe as a mix of your typical ambitious Yalies, aka YCC\/Rhodes\/GS types, as well as some more introspective types (not that those two groups are necessarily mutually exclusive). However, we would sometimes veer off into prolonged tangents that were difficult to rein back in (most notably spending substantial portions of classes discussing dining hall food and loving sports). Classes usually would kick off with David reading an assortment of quotes, some from philosophers and others from more contemporary writers\/psychologists - that was an interesting opportunity to peer into Davids thought process and idealogical inspirations. David would then ask the class for reactions; however, the discussions typically remained somewhat surface-level. Perhaps that was a byproduct of the aforementioned class demographic, or perhaps it was simply difficult being vulnerable in front of someone with the stature of David Brooks. In any case, David really does try to get the students to feel comfortable opening up - he hosted weekly dinners on Monday before class to build rapport, and he also invited various guests to open up about their own experiences. It just didnt quite happen to the extent that I thought it would.",
