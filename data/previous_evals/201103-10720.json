    "Pretty basic reading of Chaucer's early poems and the Canterbury Tales. You will learn to appreciate Chaucer's jokes and get a sense of what the literary world looked like in the 14th century. The course includes one presentation and a final paper. Fun proportional to work put into the class.Alastair is amazing. If nothing else, take the class because he's teaching it. You won't regret it."

    "I'm not a medievalist so this course didn't directly contribute to my research, but it fulfilled a requirement and honestly, I'm very glad I took it. I enjoyed it a lot, I liked reading Chaucer's early works, which I hadn't even heard of prior to this course, and the type of argument I made in my final paper (not subject-wise but method wise) is the sort of argument I want to make in my dissertation, so it was helpful to get a sense of how this type of claim is made, what sort of arguments are needed to support it, etc."
