   "comments": [
    "It was a good class if you'd like to go into policymaking. If you plan on going into academics, however, this is not a good class for you.",
    "This is a very complicated writing exercise, and must be seen as such. The topic, the research process, and the final presentation are all secondary to the process of a collaborative writing effort.This writing effort was exceptionally difficult, but the end product was also very good. The key lesson of this workshop is just how much time and effort must be expended to write truly well. It is not merely a spell check\/once over effort, groups will spend dozens of hours finalizing their products. It is not fun, it is tiring, but the pain is worth it.An invaluable, if unpleasant, professional development process.",
    "Anybody who wants to go out to work in the policy world should seriously consider taking this course. It not only gives you an idea on what is required in a policy paper, compared with academic papers, but it also gives you the sense of working in the real world, working with others.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class if you're interested in policy. It's a good introduction to writing White Papers, so if someone hopes to work in the public sector or contracting for them I think it's a useful course to take.",
    "Workshop to learn how to research and write a white paper on a substantial topic in foreign affairs. Learn how to work in groups. End product is a 15-20 page white paper and a presentation.",
    "I would not recommend it, unless it is a requirement. There are classes around campus were you can work directly with clients doing policy work that seems a little more fruitful."

   "comments": [
    "Since I would like to go into the policy field, I think this course was an important step so that I could learn more about writing for policy makers and how to frame complicated issues in a way that is easy to understand.",
    "It was a very good exercise in understanding the process of writing a white paper\/team paper.",
    "This definitely helped me learn a lot about my topic. I was able to choose something that interested me very much and go deeper in learning it. Having choice in what you focus on made it a very useful course for my degree.",
    "Course greatly deepened my knowledge of policy research in foreign affairs. Excellent preparation for hopeful career in foreign policy after graduation.",
    "I learned about the subject area that i was writing about."
