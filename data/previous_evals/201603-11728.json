   "comments": [
    "Through taking this course, I have bettered my reading and writing skills in Spanish and have bettered my overall ability to analyze literature using critical thinking skills.",
    "I had never actually engaged with a Latin American author the way I did with this class and it has opened up a whole new area of literature that I am now interested in. This class, to my delight, was much heavier in philosophy than I expected. I gained a deeper understanding of a number of philosophical concepts, and more importantly, by the end of the term I learned to truly appreciate the link between literature and philosophy.",
    "I learned many new aspects of the literature of Borges.",
    "I was able to discuss and write about philosophical and literary concepts in Spanish.",
    "I learned to analyze literature skeptically and decipher references made in literature to better understand it's purpose.",
    "This course provides a solid foundation on the life and works of Borges. Students are pushed to critically think, to unpack Borges dense works, and to consider new perspectives and interpretations. The final paper allows one to really analyze and become an expert in one aspect\/area of Borges work.",
    "I had the valuable opportunity to read a number of texts that proved to be interesting and engaging. I also developed my skills in writing an analytical text in Spanish."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is an excellent one for anyone interested in the life and works of Borges, short stories in general, and Spanish literature.",
    "Perhaps mandatory attendance or a more rigorous method for making students involve themselves in class discussions. I often felt like students were insecure about their command over the language and therefore chose to stay silent rather than contribute, which is a shame.",
    "Professor Gonzlez-Prez was an absolutely fantastic teacher. He knew the material inside and out and was such a warm spirit in the classroom.",
    "There are many course strengths. Prof. Gonzalez is extremely knowledgable of the material and presents it in an engaging way, seamlessly linking Borges' ideas with their historical inspirations. Prof. Gonzalez also makes attempts to engage the class but due to his vast knowledge it's not a surprise that he speaks the most in class. The final paper was a good way of applying what we learned to another work by Borges.",
    "The strength of this course was that the material was very interesting and that Professor Gonzalez was passionate about what we were reading. I also really liked the discussion sessions that we would have at the end of the week with our TA. The weakness of the course was that the material could be pretty abstract sometimes and it was difficult to leave each class feeling like I understood the material completely. We covered a lot of stories and I wish that we had gone more in depth.",
    "The course readings were fascinating and carefully selected, and the course structure was transparent and manageable. In order to increase class participation (as some students seems quite shy and rarely spoke up), discussion leaders could be selected, or students could be asked to prepare one or two questions on the readings for that day."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a cursory overview to Borges's work.",
    "Absolutely, the professor is great and the material is extremely interesting.",
    "Definitely--an awesome L5 Spanish class.",
    "Reading Borges throughout the semester was a great way to keep myself contemplative of larger ideas. My main academic focus is in the social sciences so reading fiction and thinking about larger philosophical ideas that were not related to political philosophy was a great change of pace. The course is not very demanding if you start the final essay early and keep up with the readings. Absolutely take it if you find Borges or deep questions about history, time, immortality, or epistemology fascinating.",
    "Yes, but you need to be very comfortable with your Spanish because as a native speaker I still struggled with understanding the reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Spanish literature, especially those who like philosophy and intellectual history. Students just looking to improve their oral speaking or written grammar should look elsewhere, as this course prioritize the literature and content.",
    "For students with strong reading and writing skills in Spanish, this course is a great way to read some very interesting texts with a very reasonable time commitment."
