    "An understanding of counterpoint, fundamental compositional skills, with a focus on function (dominant, predominant, and tonic), augmented sixth chords, modulation, an understanding of basic forms (sentence, period, small ternary, minuet, etc.)",
    "We started with roman numerals and functional base analysis (including this interesting method that was made up by Ian Quinn which was slightly helpful) Then we did voice leading and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd species counterpoint And voice leading, and some harmonic stuff The class was more focused on what are tendencies in music than just analysis chord by chord which I appreciated And although it says composition in the name we composed very little (but analyzed plenty)",
    "I came into MUSI 210 with little music theory knowledge but a lot of familiarity with the music that was studied (18th-century). I expected to improve my composition skills, but instead the course spent much more time on music theory and very little on composition. I did come away with a much larger vocabulary with which to understand and analyze music."

   "comments": [
    "My understanding (ignore the rest if I'm wrong) is that there is not a clear-set curriculum for 210 and that section leaders have a lot of power in deciding what they want to teach. This is great for catering to student interests, but it also means that it is very easy for a class to fall behind. I think I was in one of those classes. I definitely learned most of the things I was supposed to, but I think we moved a lot more slowly than an average class at Yale and missed opportunities to engage in relevant topics that would have prepared us better for 211. A delineated \"these are the topics we are going to learn about this semester\" type of syllabus instead of a \"let's see how far we can get\" model would have been much more preferred.",
    "Improvements could be made to clarify expectations of class and grading methods.",
    "More composition exercises, instead of the teacher just analyzing everything out loud for us, teach us how the language of talking about music (not all of us are rich kids who know all this stuff already).",
    "The course material seemed to depend on the section (and the TA\/professor who teaches the section). My section was very theory-heavy while a friend of mine reported that his section was very composition-heavy. It depends on what you're looking for, and I'm not sure that there's a way to tell what your section will be like. Some of the sections were taught by graduate students, not professors (sections meaning the bi-weekly lectures that meet during classtime--NOT separate discussion sections). My graduate student teacher was new to teaching, and was not very organized."

    "Would recommend if one was a music major.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student involved with, or intending to be involved with, music. The course has helped me gain a far greater understanding of the literature that I am playing and where to place emphasis in solo works.",
    "It depends on what you're looking for. If you want a music theory memorization class, this is a good class to take. If you want a music composition class, this class will probably not be the best fit, although it is a prerequisite for the composition seminars."
