    "The small class size really benefited this class. It helped facilitate necessary discussion that would have otherwise been lost in a larger setting This class should always be taught as a seminar.",
    "The fun atmosphere and the interesting topic. It really is the only course that discusses the big concepts surrounding global transportation challenges, and it will be missed in the overall FES curriculum. Ellen provided a great overview of various tranportation methods and prompted students to think through the pros\/cons\/feasibility of the different strategies for addressing transportation problems.",

    "-more hands-on learning, trips",
    "More cohesive in class explanations of types of transportation and focus on some of the grittier details of a few case studies rather than a vaguer addressing of more case studies."
