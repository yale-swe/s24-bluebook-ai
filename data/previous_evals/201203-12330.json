    "The class is not quite the worst class I've taken at Yale, but close. The material was vague, and I didn't come out with any better ideas than when I went in. Workload-wise, I didn't mind the reading tests every week or so, but felt that they were there just because the professor wanted to proclaim, \"This isn't a gut class!\" Also, your five papers are going to be graded by TAs who can't tell between \"your\" and \"you're\", so that's going to be really painful.",
    "Easy class. Can get by without doing reading except for days with reading quizzes (which is regurgitating answers from questions given to you beforehand, no analysis required). Progressively longer papers are graded fairly easily so by the time the final paper comes around combined with the quiz, i dont think anybody is stressing about grades.",
    "Yes. Take It.",
    "ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE. Dear god, is this class bad. There's no substance whatsoever. You will learn nothing as you listen to Craig Wright ramble on about whatever nonsense crosses his mind. Instead I would suggest a class that can, through depth and focus, give you some real insight into something of value. I picked this class because I heard it was easy, but now I regret it; I wish I had taken a class that, while perhaps difficult, offered some real learning. This is without a doubt the worst class I've taken in my years at Yale, so please for the love of god stay away (unless you really need an easy WR).",
    "Phenomenal class.",
    "Take it! A relaxing class focused more on learning and less on work. The work you do is barely enough to qualify it as a WR credit. The final paper is long but on a topic of your choice so you can make it fun, and the two painful essays, on Mozart and Newton\/da Vinci are less than 700 words.",
    "Yes. Fun and not too much work",
    "I took this class because it involves the least amount of writing for a writing credit. The material was all really interesting during the first couple of weeks after which it got really repetitive and boring. I don't feel like I learnt anything that improved my writing skills either. The only thing that carried my interest through the semester were the guest lectures where the professor invited \"geniuses\" with varied talents.Work load is super light and you don't have to do that much reading or writing. Grades are based on four short papers (500-800 words each), a moderately long final paper (2000 words) and four in-class quizes on the readings. Take this class if you're looking for a super light writing credit or a light fifth class. Otherwise it's not worth wasting a credit on.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a great class to fulfill distributional requirements. Although there are a lot of readings that can sometimes be quite long, they are very interesting. The essays are not difficult, and all except for the last one are relatively short.",
    "Awesome class. Saw some of the coolest people with the coolest talents that I probably will ever see in my life.",
    "HUMS 217 is a survey of the topic of genius and how it has come up throughout history. It talks about defining genius, the idea of genius and how it's evolved throughout history, what things may or may not be involved in making a genius, and several of the most important geniuses of history. I would definitely recommend it - a really interesting course with an informal feel to give you the sense that you're studying a very specific and very cool topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was so interesting, and for me, the speakers made the course SO worthwhile. The course as a whole makes you think about your life and goals and is very encouraging.",
    "Yes if you are looking for an interesting and not to difficult HU or WR. But you might be able to find something more fulfilling out there.",
    "This class is an interesting exploration of how and why we identify genius. Immediately, the idea that there is any one archetypical genius is challenged, and throughout the course of the term (if you challenge yourself), you may eventually find or create a description of genius in it's many forms that is at once accurate and all inclusive. This also makes you question other attributions of greatness to people in realms of acting, sports and sports culture, etc.",
    "This class explores some of the well known geniuses like Mozart, Leonardo, and Newton and other lesser known like Wagner, Picasso, and others. It really gives you a new perspective on genius and intelligence. The readings are all pretty interesting, and only towards the end get repetitive in nature.Don't take this class if you think you'll become a better writing. It's pretty much just an easy writing course (grading is a little difficult depending on TA).But if you are interested in the topic, go for it.",
    "If you're interested in the topic of genius, definitely take the class. Even though there is a ton of reading, it's good material. The essays are manageable.",
    "It induces some facepalming, but it's easy. Don't go into this class looking for a really a deep (or accurate) analysis of anything. Don't be surprised if someone says something that makes you want to slap them. One or two guest lectures are interesting. Workload is minimal. Questions for reading quizzes along with page citations are given out beforehand so about half an hour to an hour's cramming before class is sufficient to get at most one point off. No need to do any other reading. Papers go 500, 500, 600, 700, and 2000 words. Never had any trouble writing that much. Take it for the writing credit if you need one. Don't take it for intellectual reasons.",
    "If you want a gut class where you can get an A as long as you can write well, take this class. Other than that, it is a complete waste of time. The material is all over the place and I feel like after an entire semester I have learned nothing of value. You basically read excerpts of biographies\/ pop psychology books and then hear Professor Wright discuss material that he has no authority over. There are so many better gut classes at Yale where you can learn more and have to work even less! If you do decide to take this class however, know that it is a lot of work (all busy work!) in the beginning, but becomes almost nothing besides a final paper after midterms.",
    "Great course, very interesting, not a lot of writing or reading, good writing credit, the work is interesting so it doesn't seem difficult, quizzes aren't hard, TAs are helpful",
    "Yes, take it! The workload is not bad at all, and the papers were pretty fun to write. The guest speakers were all awesome.",
    "This class is great! Amazing readings, great discussions (although ideally this course would be taught as a seminar, allowing for better discussion of this fascinating subject), and Prof Wright is one of the nicest professors I've ever had.",
    "It's an okay course. I only took it because I needed a humanities credit. It definitely has potential, but I feel like the syllabus does need a bit of tweaking so as to avoid being repetitive.",
    "INCREDIBLE CLASS. One of my favorite at Yale. Material is absolutely fascinating, and I loved the structure of the course. Professor Wright is so great; he's so cultured and brilliant and an overall sweetheart.",
    "I would recommend this class. I liked that it was truly an \"exploration\". I've seldom gone into a seemingly simple topic with so much depth and looked at it from all angles. The readings were very interesting and there was freedom in choosing angles on essays. The discussions and readings on creativity were fascinating and so valuable for any field.",
    "i would highly suggest this course",
    "This is definitely one of those \"only at yale\" courses. There is not too much work and almost all of it is pretty interesting...I learned a ton in this class and enjoyed going every week. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Everything we learned about was very interesting, and surprisingly applicable to other areas of study. It was about genius, but it was more about how to think.",
    "Great course, you get to experience meeting interesting people, and participate in very engaging discussions. The class can be big, so be weary. Learning of the geniuses is fascinating.",
    "This course is a journey. The main objective is to chase an idea present throughout human history from culture to culture and era to era, discerning aspects of what \"genius\" really means and what creativity, talent, and other related concepts mean and how they might work. Each individual used as a case study (Mozart or Picasso or Newton, to name a few) made for an interesting exploration of genius in a different way and there were many fascinating surprises along the way as to what can prompt and support genius. The format for the class is varied between lecture, discussion, and guest presentation, and the topic always felt both meaningful and accessible. Come prepared to chase down the reality behind a surprisingly complex idea (that of \"genius\") and you will not come away disappointed. This was, hands down, my most enjoyable course of the term and I wish it had gone on longer. I give my strongest recommendation for this course to anyone considering it in future terms.",
    "If you are interested about cross-comparison of geniuses from different fields, take this course. Do not expect to get any clear 'answer' from this course. There is no midterm or final, just five papers - but the professor has very high-expectation in grading those papers. Also, there are long readings in the first two months. Go to the classes during the shopping week and decide carefully."
