   "comments": [
    "I learned many methods of speech analysis as well as steps for writing\/delivering a speech. We looked at rhetoric throughout the ages, and I learned that many of the conventions that the ancient greeks developed for rhetoric are defunct for the modern era (which made me question why we spent so much time on them in the first place).",
    "This was a fun course where I got the chance to read on classical rhetoric and writings without feeling pressured to absorb all the information and be assessed on it. Our writing assignments also helped to tie in our readings with more practical uses for rhetoric and group discussions were quite enjoyable.",
    "Ancient and modern rhetorical technique and I love for the art of rhetoric",
    "Rhetoric Strategies, Understood how to better craft a speech",
    "Writing and oratory",
    "This class focuses on ancient rhetorical devices, not necessarily modern ones. I gained a better understanding of these devices, and while many of them are fairly obvious and used commonly, this did improve my speech writing. The class does focus heavily on reading ancient texts, many of which are dense. Though I would not consider myself proficient, my ability to understand such readings also grew. Lastly, though the relationships are not always clear, I did see how the ancient rhetorical strategies connected to modern life.",
    "I learned the rhetorical basis for speechwriting, both from the perspective of ancient rhetoricians (Aristotle, Plato, etc.) as well as the rhetoricians of today (JFK, MLK, Trump, etc.). More specifically, we learned the structures, performance methods, and linguistic strategies that go into effective speechmaking.",
    "In this class I learned a lot about the art of speech, and how to present things in a way that people will want to listen. I learned the ancient style and present application in politics.",
    "I learned a lot about ancient rhetoric techniques and how many modern speakers still use those same strategies."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: analyzing the great speeches of history (MLK, JFK, FDR, Churchill, Obama etc.) Weaknesses: getting bogged down in classical conventions and contexts. It seemed like we'd spend an entire class discussing a classical interpretation of rhetoric and all we concluded was that our speeches should be clear, concise, and adapted to the situation.",
    "I enjoyed most of the readings and the assignments were fun, but the lack of incentive to participate in discussions or even do the readings tempted me to often just skim through and sit passively in class. The assignments didn't really relate to the very specific teachings of Aristotle and Cicero, though some were more relevant than others. In the end, I feel like it was a fun time, but I didn't really learn much and I'm not much better at speaking or writing than I was before. I think the general attitude towards this class of both the students and the professor was one of apathy and tolerance rather than passion and desire to really get somewhere. I think my biggest problem was the lack of clear feedback or individualized support; I didn't really get meaningful comments on any of my work and I wasn't sure why I got an A on some things and an A- on others and how I could improve if I got a lower grade.",
    "Good text sources and nteresting historical examples but lacks a little bit in the practical application of the rhetorical techniques department",
    "More focus on the practise of rhetoric rather than simply readings the material.",
    "Very strong",
    "In theory, this course had the potential to be very interesting- looking at ancient rhetorical practices to influence modern speechwriting; however, the \"classics\" aspect of the course was never really linked to the \"modern speechwriting\/speech analysis\" section, and it felt like the readings didn't relate at all to the graded assignments.",
    "The course's biggest strength is the role students play in the material taught. The professor allows students to submit videos of speeches to be watched in class, and allows us to dictate many of the projects. There is a lot of freedom in how and what we write, which made the assignments very enjoyable in my opinion. Certainly more fun than writing an essay. The biggest weakness is the slow pace at which we move through some of the ancient texts. This is not necessarily a problem if you are interested in Classics, but at times these texts became boring, and the connections to the modern world were unclear. Overall a very strong course though.",
    "I think this class established a basis of ancient and modern speech-giving skills well. I think the presentation of these ideas could be more compelling and interesting. While we learned how rhetoric should be done, I never personally saw the direct ways in which what we learned could be applied to my actual writing. I definitely can give name to things that I already kind of knew about speeches, but I can't say that I now know more about how to craft them.",
    "I really liked the speech watching component of this class because there is only so much you can glean from theory. It really helped me to sit down and see the masters at work.",
    "The seminar discussions were really rich and gave me new perspectives on the material. Sometimes I felt like the readings talked too much about the styles of rhetoric without providing actual examples."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes because the course is really what you make of it. If you challenge yourself to really learn how to write in the voice of someone else, this is the class to do it. Also it helps you learn how to improve a different style of writing (ie: speeches should have much shorter sentences with many more pauses than normal essays).",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "I would recommend this class as a freshman seminar with low workload, but not as a Classical Civ. course because it did not end up teaching me much about the ancient world. Assignments felt like they were being graded arbitrarily without much feedback.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. Professor Bakker is extremely nice and responsive once you get to know him. This is a Classics course, so do not expect to only talk about modern events. There is a lot of open discussion though (much of which connects to modern politics, etc.), and as long as you are willing to learn from both your classmates and the professor, this is a worthwhile class. Also, the writing assignments are very fun. It is a chance to be creative while also practicing argumentation, which I found valuable.",
    "I think this course is great if you want to participate in great discussions and learn a little about rhetoric in the process. As a Freshman Seminar, it was able to accomplish everything that I wanted it to (I made great friends, had fun discussions, learned some pretty cool but not necessarily major-related stuff). If you are someone deeply interested in politics (or something of that sort) and think that this will improve your skills in that regard, I would not advise this course. If you want to learn something pretty interesting, then I would.",
    "I would recommend this as a class for anyone who is interested in public service\/ politics. It definitely helped me consider how I speak, and how I can better engage people in my oratory. It was not difficult, the readings were interesting, and the professor clearly cared about the subject. I loved how small the class was, I really got to know and learn a lot from my eclectic group of classmates.",
    "Yeah, the material was interesting and I enjoyed the discussions. It could be a bit dull sometimes but was an overall good class and a nice way to fulfill a writing credit."
