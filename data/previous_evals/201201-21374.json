   "comments": [
    "One of the best chemistry labs out there. Not too much work.",
    "It's less of a hassle compared to gen. chem. lab because you only need to write one full lab report. Experiments are straightforward, more educational than technical. Sig figs, accuracy, and precision are less important than understanding methodology and theory.",
    "Chem 222L is a great class. I learned a lot about technique and I didn't have to worry about getting points deducted for things like yield and results. The purpose was technique and learning, which was an excellent change from so many other college labs. It is much better than Chem 117L for general chemistry.",
    "As a chemistry lab it is informative and I was able to apply what I was learning from Orgo lecture to the lab. In terms of workload it's not too bad. If you are organized with your lab notes your time spent in lab will be easy.",
    "If you are coming from Gen Chem, do not be afriad. This lab is worlds better than whatever you may be coming from. I learned so much over the semester and had fun the whole time!",
    "Again take it if you have to. Good look at some common organic reactions. Not sure why you would take it if you didn't have to when you could get the same experience and much more (i.e. developing your own techniques, procedures etc.) by emailing almost any chem researcher at Yale and asking to work in their lab.",
    "If you have to take a lab, I'd recommend this one.",
    "It's an okay lab. Which TA you get makes a huge difference, so hopefully you get a good one. Some people suffered and some people found it very easy based on grading. The lab itself is not too difficult and lab write ups aren't bad. They're really nitpicky though, which is good, but sometimes to unreasonable extent in my opinion.",
    "As long as you do the readings ahead of time and understand what you are doing in each experiment, this class should be fine.",
    "I would recommend it because it was a different lab experience from any other lab I have taken (chemistry and physics). It was fun learning new things and doing stuff that coincided what we learned in CHEM 220.",
    "Basically, it's a class required for pre-med and you just have to stick it out. Yes, it's boring and tedious, but the professor is really nice and there's always music playing in the lab so the atmosphere isn't too bad.",
    "This lab is interesting and does not burden you with unnecessary amounts of work (which is what I felt Chem 117L did). You learn a lot of basic lab techniques, then apply it to synthesizing aspirin, then learn a lot more interesting techniques. There was probably one lab report and one semi-lab report, which was an extreme relief after having to write up tedious lab reports EVERY WEEK for Chem 117L. You also learn to work by yourself (while still interacting with those around you, of course). You also really bond with those around you. Rarely, do you leave after 4:00, which is also a relief.",
    "I would recommend Orgo lab to others. It is much more relaxed than gen chem lab, and I feel like I learned more. Most of the experiments are done by yourself on your own time. Often experiments do not run as long as gen chem experiments do, and you are eased into the process of writing lab reports. Grading was a little harder than gen chem lab but the class overall was more enjoyable.",
    "It's really not that bad, as long as you put in a little time, you should be fine. Since it is not graded off of accuracy, it is less stressful than Chem 119L. The reports do not take long at all.",
    "This class really is a breeze. Just make sure you do what they tell you. Sometimes the directions can be obscure, but you learn as you go and from your mistakes.",
    "This lab was much better than Chem119L. I learned a lot, and the grading was not unfair. One nice thing about the structure is the greater freedom: we no longer had to follow instructions word for word from a course packet. Instead, we were given the goal as well as the techniques necessary to reach the goal, and then we were set loose to achieve it as best as we could.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course, it's probably a requirement for you. It's an introductory organic lab course. Not much else to report.",
    "Don't let gen chem labs scare you away from this class. For me CHEM 222L was MUCH more enjoyable than CHEM 119L. I felt like I actually learned chemistry in this lab, not just number crunching and how to hold a pipette. If you're considering this class, it is most likely required, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to learn about the practical side of organic chemistry.",
    "This lab was pretty straight forward. The assignments were always clear, and Dr. DiMeglio is very helpful. It's one of those classes where you just get the work done, and if you do that, you should be fine.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class to be taken with CHEM 220.",
    "Yes, best lab you will ever take.",
    "This lab is a requirement for most people who take it. You will learn much about standard lab procedure, safety protocols and scientific writing style (you will have to adhere to a very rigid format when writing pre-labs and post-labs). Don't expect the labs to be fun or exciting.",
    "Orgo lab is definitely the most exciting lab I've taken so far. It's fun, rewarding, and most of time you get out early. It's cool to make compounds with practical applications and to learn new techniques. Also the music makes for a chill atmosphere.",
    "A good lab course for an introduction to organic chemistry lab techniques. There was less weekly work than general chemistry lab, and a relaxed atmosphere during lab.",
    "Such a good lab. Not only is it very structured, you're pretty much on your own, which is nice. If you stay organized, it's really good because it's such an organized class. Graded kind of harshly, and I did not do so well on the final exam (all multiple choice). The actual experimentation is alright, but that might be biased because I like orgo labs, but you need to take good notes, make good EPs, and do good work. If so, you'll do fine. The atmosphere is very laidback, so it's not miserable going to lab.",
    "Chem 222L is a pretty good lab course. You'll come out of it with a fluent understanding of basic chemistry lab techniques, which is a good enough reason to take the course in itself. The course can be a bit frustrating at times in its grading aspects, though. You'll get \"points\" off for things like leaving out page numbers, which doesn't necessarily test your understanding of the course material. This is a good grading system for first-time lab students, but for those who have taken plenty of science lab courses before, it can be frustrating. Regardless, it's a very good course, and it's also administered very well, which can't be overlooked.",
    "Orgo Lab is more fun that it is stress. You have to do work, but you learn a lot by doing it. The work environment is stress-free, and the assignments are do-able if you budget your time.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this lab. It is relaxed and you actually learn lab techniques.",
    "This lab was so much better than the General Chemistry lab. The experiments were sometimes fun and it was overall more interesting and less stressful. The grading was a little strange since they only had a few assignments which were worth a lot. Otherwise it was pretty interesting and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Yes it is a good supplement to the organic chemistry class.",
    "Good lab course. Take it if you have to.",
    "A surprisingly fun lab experience that, while it requires a significant amount of work\/preparation\/analysis, is extremely rewarding and demonstrates concepts well. Also Professor DiMeglio plays music during lab, which is always a plus!",
    "Its a lot of fun",
    "Take it. If you're pre-med you have to. It's pretty chill, and you learn good organic lab techniques. EP's are annoying though, so get them out of the way asap.",
    "Some of the work we do is rather monotonous and perfunctory. Pre-labs, lab notes, and post-labs often involve copying the same information over and over without much thought involved. The lab work itself is a little dull and doesn't necessarily require an understanding of the chemistry behind the procedures. We did learn some useful lab techniques and chemistry concepts, but I'm not sure if it was worth the time investment.",
    "222L is much more relaxed than 119L if you have taken that before. Dr. DiMeglio is genuinely warm and enthusiastic, but she does hold you to high expectations. Lots of grunt and busy work -- like any lab course.",
    "If you're taking it, there's a 99.9% chance you have to take it (pre-meds). After Chem 118L it's what I expected. Very laid back, DiMeglio's hardly there, so make a good relationship with your TA. Music is playing during the labs which is nice, and there's only 1 written lab report which is great. They're very meticulous with all the lab work, especially the experimental plans that are due before every lab, so make sure you don't forget anything. They're not hard, they just love to find ways to take off points. And then the lab final isn't too bad either, you just need to study the lab packed questions.",
    "Chem 222L is a lot of fun! I definitely recommend it to another student. It's actually much easier than General Chemistry lab and the workload is very easy.",
    "much better than gen chem lab",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The techniques we learned were really useful, and the synthesis labs were awesome.",
    "Take orgo lab! so much more relaxed than chem 119L. Just try to avoid the TAs who have a harsh grading style, I'm sure you'll here about them. The lab is great, but the exam in the end was very specific. so study hard!",
    "It's so much better than most general chemistry labs! You probably have to take it because you're taking the accompanying class, but don't shy away from it. It'll teach you how to come into a class reasonably prepared, self-sufficience, and how to turn in good work. Give yourself plenty of time for the full lab report, and hope for a nice TA.",
    "Pretty easy and relaxing if you've taken other labs before. If this is your first, you may have a hard time in the beginning, since lab write-ups have a bit of a learning curve.",
    "...take it if you're taking orgo",
    "This is a good lab course, the workload is manageable and I learned a lot of key concepts that helped reinforce what I was learning in the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you are already taking organic chemistry. The lab is much more enjoyable and practical than general chemistry lab. The experiments that are carried out are much more useful and clear in their purpose.",
    "Fine lab. Finishing can be stressful, but not too much homework. Better than gen chem lab.",
    "Great lab, great professor. Definitely take it.",
    "CHEM 222L is very enjoyable and fun, especially if you read the prelab assignments and understand the experiment beforehand. Unlike other labs, students generally leave around 3:30 (I only had to stay until 4 once). It is an extremely manageable and fair workload and you walk out of the class with actual skills that you can use in an organic chem lab: IR, extractions, recrystallizations etc. I would definitely recommend this class even if you don't have to take it for any req.",
    "Chemistry 222L is a very good course to take, not only to complement material learned in Organic Chemistry lecture, but also to acquire basic skills that could be useful for a student searching for a research opportunity. The reports are very long and detailed, yet learning how to do them right will be very useful for carrying out research in the future.",
    "For a lab course, this one is probably one of the best. The entire course is fairly straightforward, with a gradual progression of skill in research technique. You begin with simple procedures and gradually work towards synthesis labs that combine all the methods learned previously. The fact that you are not graded on percent recovery or percent yield relieves much of the pressure. Technically, you could mess up on every single step of a lab and still receive full credit if you wrote your EPs and lab reports in the correct format. The workload is pretty manageable as well - EPs due each week that can be completed extremely quickly once you get the hang of the format, an occasional post lab assignment that is also pretty short, and one full length lab report at the end.",
    "So much better than gen chem lab. I would recommend it because it definitely helps to connect things that are being taught concurrently in orgo lecture.",
    "Take it if you plan on doing more research in the future, are a pre-med student, and are taking Organic Chem 220 at the same time.",
    "It's a lab course you have to take when you take CHEM220, but overall the workload isn't as bad as the general chemistry lab course.",
    "Avoid orgo lab unless you have to take it. The labs themselves are rather boring, and though they do follow material it's not at all necessary to take the lab to understand the material. The fact that it is full of premeds (myself included) and that grading is solely based on how well you format your work and how many random details you embellish your work with means that if you want a good grade, you need to put in way more work than you should have to for a half credit course, and that time will be spent structuring your answers in a pretty way and looking for random filler to spice up your responses rather than actually learning the material.",
    "A well run, pretty low stress lab that covers the basics well! Way better than gen chem lab.",
    "Yes. Better than Chem 119L. You get to listen to music in the lab while you work so it's very chill. Only thing is that the grading is very nit-picky like getting points of for not putting the page number at the bottom of your EPs, etc.",
    "Orgo Lab 1 was overall quite good - so much better than General Chemistry labs. It definitely taught us very important techniques, but it did so in a very relaxed atmosphere. It was so nice to have the radio playing while we carried out the experiments. I would say the lab focused more on learning and executing techniques rather than teaching concepts that followed the Organic Chemistry course. The lab staff was really helpful and Professor DiMeglio was really caring. I would definitely suggest though to look carefully at scheduling though. It is suggested that you come to lab 20 minutes before the actual starting time to set up. While it's not required, it was a bit stressful when I wasn't able to come in early (ended up with a class that ended 10 minutes before down in WLH). But even in a scenario like this, the lab was not extremely stressful, mostly because of Professor DiMeglio's reassurance. I would definitely recommend Orgo Lab 1. This lab was one of the more enjoyable lab experiences I had.",
    "This course is an essential class to take as an introduction into techniques in organic chemistry. I would recommend it to anyone who is starting classes in organic chemistry (CHEM 220).",
    "Best lab course at Yale. It is definitely worth 0.5 credits and is just put together well. You learn many things, while also getting to improve techniques. Music is playing in the background. So much better than bio and general chemistry lab courses. I was pleasantly surprised and actually really enjoyed this course!!",
    "It's not exactly a fun course, and most students have to take it as a prerequisite for a major or for premed requirements, but for what it is, it's a pretty good class.",
    "If you're interested in orgo or have to take it, this lab is actually pretty nice. You aren't graded on accuracy, so you can make mistakes without worrying about it too much, and many of the experiments are really cool. The only annoying thing is how important the formatting is on the Experimental Procedures you write before each lab. But if you just follow all the guidelines you'll be fine.",
    "Prepare to learn a lot, because most experiments are completely independent. However, orgo lab is more about understanding rather than yield and purity. Even if you obtained a 20% yield and contaminated product, if you can explain it, you'll still do well in the class.",
    "I would recommend the course if you want to learn the basics of organic chemistry laboratory.",
    "Overall, Orgo lab 1 was a well-planned course that was more enjoyable than gen chem lab. The experiments are generally more interesting and\/or fun to do, and most of them don't take as long. Pre- and post-lab assignments didn't take an undue amount of time, although you shouldn't procrastinate too much on the final full lab report. Grading was fair in my experience. Dr. DiMeglio is really nice and helpful.",
    "CHEM 222L is a well-taught introductory organic chemistry lab class."
