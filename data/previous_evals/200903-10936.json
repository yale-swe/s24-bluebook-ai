    "Great, great course. Loved the semester project - wish it had started earlier and I could keep doing it next semester. Facility visits were wonderful, again I wish there were more of them and that they were longer. I know there was a lot of whining about the course being \"hard,\" but I completely disagree. I thought the class was pretty perfect and in no way overwhelming, and I hope that the whining won't result in major changes!!Thank you for a great semester!",
    "4: Workload came in feast or famine; often times there was nothing, other times there were multiple assignments at once, which requires thoughtful planning on the student's part.5: Instructor responded to about half the emails I sent, which were not many.7: I felt like sometimes the instructors felt they were there for my convenience only and not so much to interact with me. TAs were very good; generally addressed my concerns, met with me when I needed assistance.",
    "There were too many facility visits, and besides the first one, little value added came from the \"tours\".",
    "Q6: This course was too basic sometimes, and did not allow for much critical thinking.",
    "Field trips were a great oportunity to learn about the industries covered. But the visits, most of the time, didn't cover the relevant material to prepare the report. So wrting the field trips reports were very hard.",
    "I took this class almost as an afterthought - my focus is really energy - and wound up really enjoying it and developing a much stronger interest in industrial ecology.The TAs were really great - thanks to both Patrick and BinBin. They were very helpful and responsive, and gave great feedback. I also enjoyed hearing them talk about their own research.",

Class lectures and readings were good to get context, but the visits really made that context useful and applicable. The sites that we went to were all good choices, I think. But would it ever be possible to visit in smaller groups? Sometimes the whole group being there seemed to overwhelm the facility a bit and made it harder for us to ask questions.",

   "comments": [
    "We could be hold more accountable for the readings, I guess? Really no major critiques",
    "The course should address larger challenges that it seems to intentionally avoid. it is one thing to say a business is greening its operations. It is another to begin discussion about how far such greening can really get us. This aspect of the dialogue was avoided entirely.",
    "More explicit expectations on the purpose of the final project and facility reports so folks don't think the final product is the point (the process is what provides the greatest opportunity to learn).",
    "Sometimes the lecture seemed really slow and basic - though that may have been just that I had prior experience with a good amount of the material.",
    "I would have liked to see more materials\/life cycle diversity in the facility visits. Maybe include raw materials processing, waste, and food processing.",
    "I thought this class was too simple. Specifically, I think the class would be better if there were more opportunity for critical assessments of corporate environmental behavior. For instance, what is the difference between greenwashing and real environmental reform?, how can you identify which is which?, etc. Those questions seemed outside the scope of this class, and that is a lost opportunity.",
    "More in depth analysis of the issues, and fewer text-book style lectures.",
    "Make sure the facilities visits are designed to provide the visiting students with the relevant information to prepare the reports.",
    "See above regarding site visits in smaller groups, if possible. Also, I was a bit lukewarm on the LCA exercise. Other IE classes go into much more depth there. There's so much involved with LCA that trying to glaze over it for a quick intro was a little overwhelming and confusing. Maybe just do a lecture on it, or a more simple exercise, and recommend the LCA practicum for those who are interested?",
    "The course often felt too simplistic. Some of the lectures seemed to be diversions from the core purpose of the course. I would have appreciated a much more rigorous introduction to methods of evaluation earlier in the semester that could then be applied and expanded upon with facility visits and group projects.I would like to see the instructors take a more critical approach rather than a series of interesting facts."

    "I had higher expectations for the course. I expected it tobe very challenging and teach us to be critical thinkers about business operations. The facility visit reports did not really test key skills and took more time to complete than they were worth. Rather than a set format, each visit could have focused on a particular method of evaluation or identifying trouble areas."

As such, it seems that more thought was required on the part of the instructors when identifying candidate projects for the semester project.",
    "I was lucky enough to get a wonderful group and very responsive company contact. Things went very smoothly and I really have no major complaints. Schedulig with others is always difficult, as is balancing different workloads at the end of the semester, but that's, uh, life, right?",
    "Loved it. I lucked out with a small, well-organized group. Thoroughly",
    "Pros:Productive and making us become good friends",
    "It was a huge disadvantage working on a group project as there was far too little substance to adequately and evenly spread responsibility.",
    "The biggest advantage, from my perspective, was in the professional contacts I made with UTC and in having another project that I can speak to in an interview. The disadvantage was that I felt, with all of the other course work we had due, it was hard to give enough time to the project. It was also hard having a project site too far away to actually visit in person.",
    "It worked well.",
    "The group project was a great exercise in analytical thinking, and also drew upon what we learned throughout the semester. I'm not so sure if it was as useful to our corporate partners.",
    "A bit dissapointing was to have students with very different levels of comitment to the course, making the preparation of the final report a bit difficult.",
    "It's always hard to get the scheduling down, and there are inefficiencies when you spend your time communicating and working out the collaboration instead of just working. However, I think it's appropriate in this class as it is practical and hands-on, and most professional situations I've been in have required a lot of teamwork and co-management.",
    "For the types of projects, group work was necessary. It was difficult to meet often enough, but it did work out in the end.The group projects were highly variable because they were real word problems with real clients. The client expectations were difficult to manage. A good experience overall."
