   "comments": [
    "So much yet so little at the same time. It was a wild survey of history, yet still not sure what grand strategy is. That's the point though. You learn what you don't yet know.",
    "How do you achieve grand ends with limited means? This is the question that the Grand Strategy program centers on. The first semester was absolutely amazing. I learned to read the classics of strategy--Sun Tzu, Clausewitz--and apply their insight to contemporary issues. I, furthermore, learned to articulate myself in discussions with fascinating peers, to prepare a summer research project and to understand the thinking of exceptional practitioners at weekly dinners.",
    "A dynamic introduction to some of the central problems and questions in the study of strategy in politics.",
    "A pretty cool analytic framework for thinking about networks of things in complex equilibrium.",
    "I learned about the general concept of grand strategy, read the classic works related to grand strategy, and actually got to think about how to formulate it with an actual problem.",
    "SO MUCH. The best class I've taken at yale tbh. The class has opened my eyes to statecraft and theory. The access the class gives is superb. And I am super proud of their efforts to diversify the class and curriculum. It has made a true impact on the program- for the better!",
    "I read a lot of texts that I had heard about but never read before which I thought was very useful. I also practiced the skill of connecting historical decision points across time.",
    "Take GS for its resources, not for the class. I didn't really enjoy the seminars they were all taught by different professors and were no different from anything you would find in a basic political philosophy class. The class proves itself valuable through the summer project and the weekly dinners. We heard from guests like Colin Powell and each received between 3-5k to fund our summer research projects. Those incredible resources alone are why you should take this class, but don't be fooled in thinking you'll get much else out of it.",
    "Got a better idea of how I can effectively analyze a situation and address a given problem - very useful not simply for the GS class but also for other courses and outside endeavors.",
    "I appreciated how seminar discussions allowed students to apply the topics to contemporary issues. It also challenged me to think about how to effectively influence change, particularly within these large institutions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was so extra. Who is in the section really matters. The range of faculty added richness to how the text was approached. Professors are all so dedicated.",
    "The class could be improved by reducing the weekly readings to allow for deeper engagement with the material. Reading entire books each week made it difficult to analytically approach the concepts we discuss in class.",
    "Strengths: The programming\/dinners (I feel like I learned so much and met so many amazing people and loved attending) Weaknesses: This class can get very philosophical at times and I think we forget that not everyone has a philosophy background. I also would have liked midterm feedback about how I was doing.",
    "Grand Strategy is an unparalleled program that is as strong as can be. Each class, several eminent professors engage in the discussion to encourage their students to think outside the box. The participants are hand-picked, which generates not only lively and intellectually stimulating discussions in class, but also fascinating conversations at the dinners and receptions with famous practitioners. I am tremendously grateful to have the opportunity to participate in this program and am looking forward to a summer and another great semester in its spirit.",
    "Even though my overall experience in the course was very positive, the sessions felt hit-or-miss from week to week. This was largely due to the fact that every week's subject was radically different from what came before and after. Moreover, some professors were significantly better than others in leading the discussion and making sure that we actually acquired new insights. Shockingly minimal instruction and guidance with respect to the summer research projects was perhaps the biggest weakness of the course. Given that much of the program hinges on this summer component and that 50% of our grade comes from the final paper written in preparation for it, I would expect there to be a more formal and integrated way of teaching us all how to choose a research topic\/question and how to conduct research in real life. The weekly dinners and discussions with important figures were an important strength. The economic workshops, on the other hand, were disappointingly unengaging and quite unnecessary.",
    "Readings are a little excessive and make seminar often bad; no way to cover everything, even if everyone does the reading, so lots of bullshitting or discussion which doesn't particularly benefit from readings. This makes engaging with class a little more stressful than would be necessary if class were better-designed.",
    "The readings were very well chosen, and I was able to learn about different dimensions of grand strategy. I hope we could delve into the readings in a deeper level.",
    "Execellent course in every way. I do wish that I sections were smaller so students could speak more.",
    "The strengths are the people and professors. The students are excited and interested. Each one of the professors brings a new style of teaching which keeps you on your toes. The weakness is the syllabus. We barely read any women or people of color. We read a piece by Martin Luther King, but it is his early, much less radical work. In general, there is a not a strong recognition of the role race and gender play in geopolitics, especially in the decisions of the white men we primarily study.",
    "I think the class is great overall. The professors are all very dedicated to the program and accessible by both email and individual appointments. I liked all of the readings selected and felt that class discussions were productive for the most part. I thought there could have been a little more connection between the various readings, which is understandably a bit difficult with rotating professors, but would have tied the semester together as a whole. I also would have appreciated slightly more feedback on the first essay, as well as better directions on that assignment. The instructions for the final paper were quite clear.",
    "It was hard for professors to emphasize the \"Grand Strategy\" behind each week's readings. I think future classes should make this point more explicitly and try to bring the different topics into conversation with each other from week to week.",
    "Strengths: Professors who represent a wide range of expertise teaching this class! In particular Professors Bradley, Gage, and Brooks. Weaknesses: It oftentimes feels like this class is pushing a very specific conservative, neoliberal, pro-military ideology on its students. While these views are fine to have, it would be helpful to have more progressive viewpoints highlighted in the course discussions so as to promote better understanding of how to implement strategy.",
    "While some of the readings did delve into healthcare and other less \"classical\" GS topics, I would have appreciated a wider range of topics to explore in terms of GS - for instance environmental issues, or economic inequality. We mostly focused on national security, but the few times we talked about social change (through Professor Gage's classes especially) were very enlightening in their portrayal of a different kind of GS. Exploring a wider range of arenas where GS can be applied would have been very useful. I was also a little frustrated with the session on Turkey in particular - although I have little knowledge of the region and its history, and many other students are probably far more knowledgeable than I am, the readings on the Ottoman Empire seemed to be an over simplification of the region's history. I remembered from my class on The History of the Modern Middle East that this time period was far more complex than the habitual \"Sick Man of Europe\" depiction that this author (along with many others - he is of course not the only one) used in the readings. A wider set of readings with different interpretations would have helped us gain a more \"accurate\" or evidence-based idea of what the GS of these politicians was at the time. This brings me to a final and more general criticism I had of the GS course - very often students were confronted with a single interpretation of the decision-makers' GS because of the single interpretation offered by the readings. As a historian, I'm inclined to desire several interpretations of a single event or time period rather than one person's viewpoint, and I think the class would have greatly benefited from a plurality of readings (a set of shorter excerpts from several authors for instance), so as to really force students to understand the ways in which leaders dealt with the information they had.",
    "I think that this course is great for me to introduce some of the classics in historical thought, but at times, discussions felt repetitive. I appreciated how different professors taught each course, but it also made it hard to connect in depth with the professors. I think that this course needs to do a better job preparing students on exactly what assignments should look like. Because students come from a variety of majors and backgrounds, it's hard to understand what a good \"grand strategy\" would be, especially thinking in what discipline. I appreciated the final assignment as it allowed for more creativity, but definitely the first paper was a challenge, given my lack of background in this academic field. I also acknowledge that there has been an attempt to diversify the course, but there is still a long way to go. While there might have been the addition of more diverse topics, I think the course needs to take a more critical approach, especially in regards to the colonization discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely take it. Start it Cr\/D so you can enjoy it. At the same time, know what you're getting yourself into. Talk to people who have done it in the past.",
    "Grand Strategy has been one of the highlights of my semester. Outside of class alone, the time you get to spend with people at dinners talking about world issues, etc. is worth it alone. It's not a cakewalk, and the papers are graded pretty harshly, but overall definitely a great class!",
    "If you get into this exceptionally selective, life-changing program, you would be more than a fool not to commit to it. With the best teachers, guest speakers, peers you could think of, Grand Strategy is not only a class, but a community of friends. It is a full-time investment into readings, classes, essays, research, dinners, conferences, field trips and receptions. Go for it!",
    "Yes! It provides you with the chance to meet really amazing people and gives you fantastic funding opportunities. However, I wouldn't expect miracles in terms of what goes on in the classroom.",
    "Again, if you got into GS and are looking at the course evals, probably take it. The readings are good, though a little bit of Directed Studies flashbacks at the beginning. Summer program prep was really mind-expanding for me. If you do it right, it can be a really satisfying experience.",
    "\"Too many cooks spoil the broth\"--or too many professors in one small room trying to teach one seminar do not successfully lead coherent class discussions. It did not work having Professor Gaddis in the back of every session derailing the conversation. If he is leading a seminar, great! He is a qualified professor. But when another qualified professor is in charge, the class would learn more successfully if that professor were able to take the class where she\/he wants it to go. This is particularly important since part of the appeal of Grand Strategy is that the faculty leading class rotate, exposing students to a range of academic viewpoints. If Gaddis becomes the de facto leader of every class, however, we wind up hearing his traditionalist take on history ever week. Therefore, I would only recommend this class to a student who is interested in the \"old\" GS, because the program is not changing as quickly as advertised.",
    "I would definitely recommend GS to other students. People think this is just a pretentious seminar, but I actually was able to learn a great deal about strategic thinking by reading seminal, classic works in this field.",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn so much about the world and from interacting with peers and the guests brought to the program.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are either interested in geopolitics OR have a clear summer research project in mind.",
    "I would certainly recommend GS to another student. While the class is only halfway through the year, I greatly enjoyed the foundation in the principles and classic texts of grand strategy. The final paper and summer project are fun to plan, and the instructors this year were truly supportive of and invested in students. The economics workshops and dinners are two more highlights of the program!",
    "Take GS for its resources, not for the class. I didn't really enjoy the seminars they were all taught by different professors and were no different from anything you would find in a basic political philosophy class.

Those incredible resources alone are why you should take this class, but don't be fooled in thinking you'll get much else out of it.",
    "Yes, with a caveat specifying that this is more oriented towards \"classical\" GS",
    "Take it!",
    "This is a unique course at Yale and the strength is what happens outside the classroom. The best parts are the dinners, summer project, and the various opportunities to meet with practitioners."
