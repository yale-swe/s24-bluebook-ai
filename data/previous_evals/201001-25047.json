    "TAKE WR",
    "A general survey about the about western civilization -- namely, the Middle East and the Mediterranean -- from ~500 BC-1453 AD, the fall of Constantinople. In particular we focused on Alexander the Great and his imperial vision, the Roman Empire and the Arab Conquests. Alongside these concepts we learned about the rise of Christianity and Islam.",
    "Great lecture, Professor Foster is incredible! Since I had a fairly heavy workload apart from this class, I went to Friday lectures instead of doing the writing section or term paper. The result was a really interesting class with a fairly light workload, mostly readings and studying for the midterm\/final. The pace and subjects covered by the class were excellent, covering the early history of the Near East and Mediterranean in detail but still addressing the big ideas. I also saw the course as a good balance of political, cultural, and religious themes. I think listening to Professor Foster and his lecture style were the best part of the class -- he was always accessible and engaging, and had interesting slideshows at the end of each class. Because the workload isn't so heavy in this class, I would say that it was sad that not everyone was as interested in the material and more interested in getting the class credit, but still a really solid class.",
    "Interesting class. Not too much work if you are not in the WR class. the WR depends on the TA. Some give a lot of work, others don't.",
    "Good overview of Near Eastern history for anyone who might not have known anything about it before the class. Professor Foster is an engaging lecturer who makes the history accessible and interesting.",
    "Interesting class, substantive, pretty light workload. I would definitely recommend the class to another student IF they have not studied the material before. Professor Foster is really good, but the class does cover a lot of material so it does not go too deep into anything specific.",
    "This is a thematic, though not chronological, look at the evolution of the Near East. It is always worth getting up at nine o'clock. However I would not say the Writing Section is particularly helpful. Doing the readings adds to the lecture but definitely is not always necessary. Everything is very straightforward.",
    "NELC 101 is a survey of Mediterranean\/Middle Eastern history from about 330BC to 660AD. There is a lot of information covered in this course, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good background in this area. Professor Foster is a good lecturer, and the course does not require a large amount of work (unless you're in the writing section).",
    "Yes! A great class. Very interesting, no matter what you study.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter - go for it.",
    "I would recommend this course. NELC 101 is a great survey course of the Near East -- it covers a lot but also leaves room for you to pursue any interests that arise from the material.",
    "Just sit back and enjoy...",
    "Great take it. It is nice to have a clear picture of the important history that took place there.",
    "Must take",
    "An excellent course on Mesopotamian history of the 3rd and 2nd millennia. Lots of reading, please only take it if you're willing to participate in the discussion. Otherwise, you are useless in a seminar.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to a subject most people know very little about. Professor Foster is a very excellent lecturer, but a demanding professor on the midterm and final. He's very kind about grading variations and paper editing, though.",
    "A wonderful look at the early history of the Near East.",
    "Take it. It is learning interesting things from an interesting speaker twice a week, and then studying for the midterm and final. That's really it. A good chance to learn a lot with not so much effort.",
    "I think it is a great intro class to take. You leave learning a lot about the different regions\/people of the ancient near east and it gives a great great foundation for future courses.",
    "You cannot graduate without taking this class. It will change the way you think about the Middle East and the Roman Empire!",
    "Thes subjects covered in this course are extremely interesting and it provides a concise overview of history from Alexander to Mohammad. The lectures were great becuase Professor Foster is extremely knowledgeable and his lectures were thorough and well organized.The slides he shows at the end of each lecture were great! A few of the readings were not interesting, and I wish we had better readings about the second half of the course. However, this is one of my favorite history courses that I've taken."
