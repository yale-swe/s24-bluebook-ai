   "comments": [
    "Question 1 - - I found some of the early readings quite helpful, but found myself not doing later readings out of lack of time. Maybe fewer readings, and reminders to do them (and why) might help. I know this seems mundane, but in a course focused on writing, it was easy to forgot the need to read also.Question 3 - - The workload was very high, but this was the nature of this course, and it seemed just right for pushing us to do everything we needed to do at a very high level of quality.Question 4 - - The pace of the class was mostly good, though in the middle I felt we skipped over some important topics too quickly (mostly due to the snowstorm, i think).Question 6 - - Lauren was great. I probably could've made use of her office hours. Maybe making it clear what kind of advice\/help she might be able to give, week to week, in office hours would help. Her written comments were incredibly helpful and insightful.Question 11 - - Karen was very, very responsive to our needs. She made it clear that this was what this course was about, but also pushed us to do things (like weekly progress reports) that we probably would never have done without the course. She really fine-tuned the course to us and our projects.Question 14 - - This course is invaluable. I can't believe it hasn't been a staple at FES for years. I really hope everyone recognizes how necessary it is and makes sure that it continues. I would not have been able to push my research and ideas in presentation, article, or thesis form as far as I have since January without this course.",
    "An absolutely invaluable class! It kept me right on track, and Karen and Lauren's feedback was just fantastic. It was great to have the support network as well! Great class!",
    "I think the class is extremely valuable and I got a ton out of it. Some of the assignments felt a bit like busy work toward the beginning of the semester so perhaps there could be fewer of those. The most helpful for me were was when we turned in chunks of writing for feedback. I know that this is a ton of work on the part of the instructor and TA and it was very useful. I also like the peer review aspect of the class and getting feedback was great. My writing group was also amazing and for me played an essential role in my success in the class. Much of the reading I didn't do because it felt like a lot in addition to the other work, I had also already done a lot of it.",
    "The course was invaluable for MESc students writing up their work. It was the first year so things could be improved, and were improved throughout the semester (like staying on schedule during classes), but overall I am grateful that this class was offered. The quality of my thesis would have been much lower without this forum for workshopping and getting feedback.",
    "2. Submitting outlines, and pieces of the body were helpful. I didn't find it very helpful to submit the weekly updates. My goals would evolve and stuff, and I just found that it made me feel guilty about not meeting my goals, while not actually helping me to reach my goals. Meeting once a week with the writing group was extremely helpful.6. Lauren was great, very responsive. She is a great thinker and made some insightful comments that helped me shape my paper.12. Karen was fantastic. Very dedicated to her students, and gave very thoughtful and helpful feedback. She has a huge knowledge of literature, so was able to make extremely helpful suggestions with regard to theory and existing literature."

   "comments": [
    "- - weekly progress reports- - support, knowing that Karen and Lauren knew what we were dealing with- - writing assignments to make it all happen- - peer review opportunities, both to give and to receive- - peer review section of the course, learning the ins and outs of this process from people who have gone through it. This was invaluable!",
    "We learned a lot about writing and publishing a journal article. I pushed my article and thesis a lot harder than I would have otherwise. The feedback from both the class, the instructor, and the TF were really helpful.",
    "The weekly assignments (minus the meeting emails which got a bit tedious).",
    "Workshopping and peer-reviewing each others work was useful personally and built a collegial feeling among the social science MESc students.",
    "In addition to what I said above the overall dedication of the instructor and TA were amazing and very much appreciated. The course would not be successful without their efforts and it was really great how much they cared about the course. I also really liked some of the guest lecturers, the in depth comments on my work, the group dynamic, and my writing group. Also I thought the presentation component of the class was particularly helpful.",
    "The responsiveness to student feedback and the time the Professor and TA were willing to take to give feedback and meet outside of office hours. The writing groups were also very helpful.",
    "Working in the writing group, and seeing how focused and dedicated my peers are to deep thinking and analysis. It was kind of a positive peer pressure, with great guidance and insights from Karen and Lauren. Getting to practice giving a presentation was also fun and interesting. I loved being able to feel like I was studying a topic in-depth, which can be kind of rare at FES, depending on your classes and work.",
    "I thought this was an invaluable class to help me improve the quality of my research and keep me on track with my thesis. I especially appreciate the effort that Prof. Hebert and Lauren Baker put in to customize and adapt the class to our individual needs. This class (instructors, workshop group and class as a whole) was the greatest support to me while writing my thesis. I can't thank Prof. Hebert enough for caring as much as she did to put together such a spectacular class. I would have liked this to be a full year course.Also, I thought the pace of the class was well thought out. The first writing assignment focused on using my own evidence, which allowed me to be clear about what I wanted to say before the second assignment (intro\/lit review), which helped me frame my evidence in theory. I thought it was extremely smart to have a full draft peer-reviewed before final submission. The quality of my manuscript benefited from the methodical steps we followed."

   "comments": [
    "- - some of the timing of things can be better fit to the FES final spring. Abstracts, for example, could be due just before they are due to the MESc colloquium. Same with the presentations. Overall, the timing was fine, but next year it could be better fine-tuned.- - Would it be possible to get someone from a peer-reviewed journal to come talk to us? Maybe there's a professor at FES or in anthropology who is on an editorial board? I think that would really add to the peer-review section of the course.- - A bit more focused reading.- - Some of the guests we had were fantastic (Dana, David, Sarah) and others wandered a bit and didn't offer quite the same level of insight. I think prepping the guests a bit more and giving them specific issues to cover would really help.",
    "The weekly assignments and check-ins weren't very helpful, except in the sense that they made me think. I know they were well-intentioned, but I couldn't shake feeling that they were busywork.",
    "Important to include speakers or outside participants who are professors, not just students.",
    "More results section focus. Maybe bring in a guest lecturer to help people with more quantitative background, or find one to be your TA! Maybe ask Max Lambert who will be a PhD next year!",
    "\"brief presentations\" often became longer than needed lectures without clear points.We did not discuss the readings in a way that forced people to read them. I think much of the class stopped doing the readings, which sadly is par for the course at FES",
    "Some of the in class speakers weren't that useful. The best were about the peer review process and presentations and the others were really not very valuable. I like the idea of lots of people with experience coming in but it didn't always relate to what we were dealing with. In that same vein not all of the in class discussions were very useful butI am having trouble thinking of exactly how, I just often felt like the in class time was less useful than it could have been. I also think that peer review session in class of a chunk we turned in could have been better facilitated. As in there were so many great comments and ideas it was hard to hear them all in the assigned time. I know that people were supposed to email the presenter with more comments but that didn't often happen. So maybe there could be a couple people every week assigned to give detailed comments to the presenter (outside of class) and then everyone else (or most people) could do a sheet like the one we filled out for the presentations.",
    "I don't think most people did the assigned readings, and there were a lot of smaller assignments that were difficult to keep track of in the first half of the semester. Some helped, some didn't, but I appreciated the flexibility of the instructors in making the assignments helpful to our own projects.",
    "Sometimes it felt like assignments (like the weekly report) were just jumping through hoops, when I could have just spent that time working on writing a little bit more. I'm not exactly sure why I found the weekly report unhelpful, but it didn't help much.",
    "Nothing major. At times (especially in the beginning), I felt that the class could have used more lectures and less time critiquing fellow students' work. I might suggest resolving this balance issue by more closely linking the student feedback sessions to the lecture topic (for example, if the lecture covers lit reviews, then have a student submit their lit review for class comments). Realistically, this will not always be feasible though.Also, I enjoyed having guest presenters come talk to us (especially when Dana talked to us about the peer review process and when David Kneas talked about presentations). I think it would have been great if we could also have had some guests from soc sci disciplines outside of anthro since the class used a mixture of disciplinary methods."
