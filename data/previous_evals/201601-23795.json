    "I would definitely recommend it if you can get it. Minimal work and has been one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Prof. Ford does this for fun, and it shows: the class is light hearted and collegial. You discuss some interesting cases, and enjoy a uniquely Yale experience with a real world successful alumnus.",
    "100% recommend - one of my favorite classes at yale!",
    "Prof. Ford has had a fascinating career and it is a pleasure to learn from his experiences. He relies on you to make the most of the class so if you have the opportunity to take it, don't waste it!",
    "Good course full of interesting and engaging discussion. Each class period discusses a different trial. It teaches a lot about history and the justice system.",
    "Trials is a great class if you can get in! The professor is a famous journalist, who has worked for NBC, ABC News, CBS, etc. Therefore, the class focuses a lot on the media impact on famous trials throughout the U.S. It's really interesting, and the workload is reasonable!",
    "The most difficult class to get in at Yale but one well worth the effort. Professor Ford is one of my favorite, if not my favorite professor here at Yale. He drives a few hours to be with his students every week and the thought and dedication that he puts into the class is incredible. He is incredibly flexible with the students, incredibly kind as a professor, and just extremely wonderful. Every class focuses on a different trial of the century. Each is incredibly captivating in its own right Professor Ford stands the entire class and has a natural ability and gift for storytelling he gives the background of the case in a way that only an experienced anchor\/lawyer can draw you in, and then you discuss the trial and the medias involvement in the trial. Incredibly engaging and thought-provoking, and very little work. Homework is much less reading and much more watching NBC documentaries that hes produced about each of the trials. One mid-term exam which is really just a paper about 10 pages that you have to do only because Yale forces him to assign one. And one final paper, 15-20 pages about what trial you think should be on his syllabus but isnt. Great class for seniors!",
    "TAKE THIS SEMINAR if you can!! A chill, super interesting seminar that is the absolute best way to spend your senior semester. The workload is perfect for a senior, and you'll want to go to class every week!",
    "TAKE IT",
    "take this class if you can get in. you learn so much-- i don't really like law but we learned about the most interesting cases of the century with some legal details but we didn't get hung up in all the minute things- talked a lot about the media and its role in the trials. super interesting cases and professor ford ROCKS he is so engaging and he actually covered a lot of these trials (like the oj simpson trial) when it was happening. he also works in tv like for cnn and nbc so he really knows what he's talking about. he is very good at conducting a seminar and engaging with his students and he is ALWAYS there if you need help like with your final paper. 100\/10 this course was amazing, i would definitely take it again."
