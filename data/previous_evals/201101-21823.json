    "Awesome class. Great reading and better professor. Reading is pretty manageable and very enjoyable.",
    "Prof. Hungerford is great, and her lectures are always really engaging. I struggled a bit to keep on top of the reading, but since I was taking the writing section, that turned out to be okay -- I needed to read enough of the novels to write the papers, but I didn't have to take the final. Perfect! That said, it's nice to be able to read novels for class instead of essays and articles.",
    "This class is excellent for English majors seeking to fulfill the American Studies English requirement and for non-English majors. It's an excellent survey of many works that have shaped the American literary canon in the past 65 years. And, on top of that, the reading is actually enjoyable. It's surprising how many students take this class, which leads to many unexpected discussions. Not to mention that the diversity of students in the class, from English majors to physics majors, allows for an interesting array of perspectives on the novels we read.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. It's a little reading heavy - but most of the books are ones that you'll want to read and fly through anyway. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It totally informed how I think about literature when I read new fiction. You won't regret it I promise.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to anyone, especially if they are interested in taking an English course but haven't taken many before. Listening to Professor Hungerford's lectures was a great way to think about forming a thesis about a book.",
    "you must take this course",
    "Worth it! It's good to read this stuff, hear how the pros (Hungerford) break down literature, hear some great ideas from fellow students, and just get thinking about things like history and memory. This was a great forum for generating ideas about big topics. Got me going.",
    "As far as English lectures go, this is a good one. Make sure you preview the reading list--the quality varies from year to year. Hungerford is an interesting lecturer, and the course seems at least somewhat self-aware about the questionable validity of certain applications of lit crit.",
    "YES. This was the best class I've taken at Yale. The syllabus covers an interesting array of topics and styles, books you've always wanted to read but never got around to. Amy Hungerford's lectures were spell-binding, often resulting in genuine applause. She is the kind of lecturer you hope to encounter coming to a school like Yale. Her take on each of these novels is creative, different, and entirely convincing. It is a lot of reading, but it will be the work you look forward to the most each week.Take this class.",
    "Yes so great. If you don't have time to read all of the books take it Cr\/D. Prof Hungerford's lectures are great even if you don't get a chance to read all of the texts",
    "Yea the reading list is great and Hungerford is a very interesting lecturer. Paper grading can be a little tough.",
    "I would definitely recommend it; it's not too hard in terms of workload (I didn't take it as a writing credit), and you read great books with a great professor.",
    "Really great course, Hungerford is a boss-woman. She is so smart. Strengths: everything. Weakness: too many books to digest. Also, I expected a little more class participation than she allowed. DEF TAKE THIS COURSE BEFORE YOU LEAVE YALE! HALLMARK!",
    "Yes definitely. If you like reading and listening to an incredibly smart professor talk about books, then duh. It's a lot of reading (a book a week at least) but somewhat to be expected...",
    "Read a novel a week (or try), listen to two great lectures a week, and attend one so-so section a week. It is worth it! If it doesn't count toward your major (English or American Studies), I highly recommend taking it credit\/d, as you won't have to stress too much and it will be very enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class, definitely. Amy Hunger is a wonderful, thought-provoking lecturer, very detail oriented. Reading can get heavy, sometimes a book per week, but it's okay if you miss one week because the class moves onto the next book next week, and you won't have to worry about the missed book until the final or a paper. You get to read a lot of great books, and it will be a great break from your typical historical\/textbook reading.",
    "Take it! I took it Credit\/D and read most of the books and skipped lecture when I needed to and it worked out really well. You'll WANT to do the work for this course. Hungerford is brilliant.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! You read great books and the papers are actually fun to write. While there's lot of reading, it's very enjoyable. Take advantage of office hours.",
    "\"American Novel\" covers 12 post-WWII novels with a wide range of formal and thematic concerns. I would highly recommend this course. I expect thatthe reading skills I learned will stay with me throughout my life as I continue to read novels for pleasure. I also now have a much better appreciation for the novel as a literary genre and its tradition in postwar America",
    "Take it, if only just for the reading list. It's awesome.",
    "A great gut.",
    "A must-take for both majors and non-majors. If you're a non-major planning on taking just one English course, this is the one to take. If you're a major, there is no excuse for going through Yale without taking this with Prof. Hungerford.",
    "The reading list for this class is really varied and interesting. A lot of them were books I've been meaning to read and hadn't gotten to yet. If you're not an English person though, I would consider taking the class credit\/d. I didn't have any trouble appreciating the books or following Professor Hungerford's lecture, but my section's discussions were usually way over my head (we generally spent section comparing the assigned reading to other works, which you can only participate in meaningfully if you've studied the other works). Keep up with the reading and you'll get a lot more out of lecture. Generally Professor Hungerford doesn't assign an overwhelming amount to be read. We also had a few authors come and talk to the class which was pretty cool.",
    "Consider taking it -- your enjoyment of this class, like most lectures, is really dependent on whether or not you do the reading and how involved you are in section, as well as how much you like the books on the reading list.",
    "Dr. Hungerford is an amazing lecturer. She gets across complex, often moralistic or philosophical ideas regarding the novels we read in a concise and logically consistent manner. The strengths are the interesting and thought-provoking lectures, of which I skipped none because of Dr. Hungerford's well thought-out readings. They're not spoonfed to you, however, because this class will give to you as much as time as you put into it, meaning if you do not read the assigned novels, you will definitely get lost in lecture. Look at the list of assigned novels, if they interest you, then undoubtedly take the class! I took the writing section, and my TA Nathalie was great. Overall, I highly recommend this course, Dr. Hungerford is one of the best humanities lecturers I've encountered.",
    "If Hungerford is teaching TAKE IT. TAKE IT.",
    "The reading list is excellent, the lectures are interesting, and the discussion sections were lively. The grading scale is unusually hard for an English class, but the overall experience is worth it.",
    "If you want to read all those books you should read, and probably will never get around to, then take this class. The books are great and the lectures are amazing. However, you need to know that this is going to be heavy on the English dept, and less so on the American Studies side. If you want to really know how these novels affected or were an effect of the times, you're not going to get those answers in this class. I took the class non-WR, and I wish I had taken it WR to avoid the final, which oddly difficult and really obscure.",
    "Yes, though make sure you have time to read and finish the novels. Take good notes, write down Hungerford's argument in complete sentences so you can reconstruct them later. Your writing will probably improve just by being around so many articulate, careful readers. You must be able to close read and be patient enough to think deeply about how the novel's effect is produced by the way it is written.The class attracts people from different majors so you get a good diversity of viewpoints. The novels are not all interesting, many a little too experimental, but the diversity of styles and time periods make for interesting reads. Learning to connect the novels is a fun exercise and crucial for doing well in the class.",
    "It was interesting for a person who's a science major.",
    "Yes. Definitely recommend it. It's just awesome.",
    "If you want an overview of some books that are American, novelistic in style, and written after 1945, take this class.",
    "Yes absolutely. I loved this class everyone should take it.",
    "It's a great reading list and it has interesting lectures. I'd recommend it, but know that you really have to do the reading by the end.",
    "I absolutely recommend taking this class, whatever your major. I'm an Econ major and this is the first English class and second writing credit ive taken at Yale. I loved it, could handle it, and so will you. And you'll want to keep exploring contemporary American lit!",
    "The American Novel Since 1945 is an excellent course. The reading is incredible, fun and accessible (so I recommend this course to people seeking a WR or Hu who also want to bone up on cocktail-party convo and rediscover the passion for reading they've lost since, like, middle school) and Prof. Hungerford's lecturesare incredibly engaging, fascinating, stimulating, and occasionally provocative (so if you're an upperclassman English major seeking to fulfill an American lit requirement, like me, you'll have fun AND get a lot out of it). In fact, I think Prof. Hungerford earned more rounds of applause after her lectures than any other lecturer I've had at Yale. She's awesome, the reading is awesome, it's contextualized by Prof. Hungerford to give an arching narrative of the American canon, and the workload is totally reasonable and not a big deal (you probably read half the books in high school anyway). Wholeheartedly recommended. Also, some of the authors visit, which is fun.One piece of advice -- look at the requirements for the WR and non-WR sections and see which sounds better to you, regardless of whether you need a WR. I didn't need a WR so I automatically picked non-WR, but it turned out that my compadres in the WR sections were doing either a short 5-page paper or a revision of a paper in place of the cumulative final I had to take, and I might have preferred their final assignment.",
    "Take it for the syllabus. These are great books you shouldn't leave your undergraduate years without reading.",
    "Yes I recommend the class. Don't take it as a writing credit if you are not a good writer. You'll just hurt your grade and won't improve your writing.",
    "great course.",
    "This is a great survey course of modern American Lit, in which you are exposed to many different sub-genre within the novel. If you like writing papers, a WR section is the way to go: there's less pressure to get all of the reading done (and there's A LOT of it) because there's no exam.",
    "Decent class--pick a good TA",
    "I would highly recommend the class. Do your best to keepup with the reading. It is fun, but there are a few tough, slow books on the syllabus, and it's easy to get behind. That said, the reading list is great and Prof. Hungerford's lectures are interesting and enjoyable.",
    "TAKE IT. I've never taken an english class before here, and this was a fantastic. Hungerford is a great lecturer and choose great books to read, and most of the TA's were really good from what I heard. Also the WR section is recommended - no final, and just one extra revision of the paper, so you can skip a week for reading because you know it won't be on the final and you're not writing a paper about it.",
    "You read a lot of books, and you learn about them in lecture, and then waste your time in section (Yale Standard). I would totally recommend it, but only if you're actually going to take the time to read the books. If not, lectures will be worthless, and sections will be even more infuriating.If you can take the writing credit, DO IT. You don't have to take the final, and you have to write the same number of essays (and the same length) as everyone else. DEFINITELY take the writing credit.",
    "Wonderful readings paired with well structured, well delivered, and thought-provoking lectures. You'll want to go to class and look forward to the reading.",
    "It's a fun class. Not a revelation or anything, but fun.",
    "No, if you want to read some good modern novels - read them out of the course. It will be just as enriching.",
    "Make no mistake, this course has a lot of reading. It will take up a lot of your time. But it is worth it. You won't find a better selection of books, and you will learn so much about them. I would recommend this course to anyone who is excited about the reading list, or needs to catch up on the classics of modern American literature.",
    "A great opportunity to read a shelf-load of novels. The lectures were fun and entertaining, and the discussion sections were like the meetings of a book club. Overall, I would recommend the class although the style of the readings of the novel did get repetitive toward the end of the semester.",
    "This course is a wonderful way to read 12 or so American novels that you might not read otherwise. The syllabus may surprise some -- aside from a couple obvious classics (On the Road, Beloved), many of these novels aren't what comes to mind when one thinks of the major novels of the last 50-60 years. Nonetheless, the course does cover a range of time periods and styles and deals with a diverse assortment of topics.Professor Hungerford's lectures are intellectually demanding -- there is no way to zone out without the risk of losing her train of thought. This isn't to say she isn't clear; her style is to present complex ideas and to elucidate them. She is down-to-earth and very open to hearing feedback on the readings from students, especially during lecture. Aside from one or two books that even Professor Hungerford admitted might be dreary or bleak or boring to read, she seems to believe wholeheartedly in her syllabus, which is important for a class that provides such an eclectic selection of American novels.Definitely try to keep up with readings as much as possible (if you opt to take an examinstead of a \"Writing Intensive\" section). You'll not only thank yourself during reading week, you'll also get more out of Professor Hungerford's lectures that way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a great way to fulfill a Writing credit or the American requirement for the English major. You even get to read graphic novels!",
    "American studies 261 will give anyone a good basis in the development of postwar american literature",
    "Take it! It's great.",
    "American Novel is one novel a week with two lectures per book. It is a lot of reading and if you fall behind, it is hard to catch up and appreciate lecture because you won't know what Professor Hungerford is talking about. I took it Credit D which took some of the pressure off.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The book list was amazing and Amy Hungerford is an incredible lecturer.",
    "The best English lecture I've taken in 4 years at Yale! Hungerford is an amazing lecturer--you will never be bored. All the books are great (except Blood Meridian, which is a slog), but it is a lot of reading. I enjoyed all of the reading though, and it was more like pleasure reading for me.",
    "INCREDIBLE lit course- reading list is fantastic, especially some of the newer works (although heavy at times, about one book a week); lectures are fascinating; Hungerford is brilliant and engaging. Take this course whether or not you have any English background- if taken credit\/d, it feels like an intelligent book group.",
    "It's surely a good class for English majors, but as a non-major, I was a bit turned off by it.",
    "GREAT books, GREAT teacher, section is typical -- A great English course for majors and non-majors alike. Be sure to keep up with the reading!"
