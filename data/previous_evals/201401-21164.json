   "comments": [
    "Heavy reading of texts that should be read once in a lifetime. I would recommend it.",
    "This course is an in-depth look at the works of the second semester of Directed Studies Literature and was well worth it.",
    "DS is just amazing, I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting a grasp on Western thought.",
    "An important class for understanding the progression of modern Western literary thoughts, and the common themes that run through out (questions of changing temporalities, of types of love, of man's place among books or among nature, etc.)",
    "Depends on the teacher and the class. If you have Professor Groves, I'd say yes because he's a great teacher, but as for all classes in D.S., it WHOLLY depends on the teacher and a little bit on the students in your class. Shop it and see what you think for yourself.",
    "I would recommend DS in general, and especially DS Lit, which was my favorite course. Second semester syllabus is fantastic, the lectures are amazing, and Professor Groves' section was really good. He's a great guy and did a solid job leading section, offering his own view when relevant but leaving most of the time to student discussion (as it should be... though professors don't always consistently realize this...).",
    "I would recommend this class, but warn students that the amount of reading significantly increases from the first semester to the second.",
    "As with all other Directed Studies courses, a recommendation for Directed Studies Literature is dependent on the prospective student's willingness to take all three courses. What can be said is that Directed Studies Literature is a vibrant learning experience, exposing readers to a host of brilliant texts of very different forms. Each section leader is able to provide a unique learning experience. The lectures display a mastery of both the written and spoken word, while also offering a great amount of analysis of the texts. It is a very rewarding experience, when all is said and done."
