    "I don't think I got out as much as I would have liked to. That being said, it was mostly because of my client and not because of my group or the class.",
    "I was expecting to have a higher quality of group members.",

    "Well, good class",
    "very well",
    "Pretty well.",

   "comments": [
    "Strength: Mid-term evaluations help students to improve Engaging speakers What can be improved: In course application, ask students to comment on their personality types and working styles, so that teams are formed not only based on skill sets. I wish Maureen could walk us through more framework examples, before we dive into specific projects.",
    "The strength of the course is getting to work in a real world case. One of the major weakness is the variability in quality of the project\/ client. There is no way of knowing whether you will be dealt a good or bad experience.",
    "The exposure to a real project and client is a great experience. The class could have more proactive mechanisms to address problems of inefficiency with group members.",
    "The client and project selection is excellent. Maureen does a great job setting these up and getting us started. Definitely a strength. Overall, I'd like to see more cohesion across the lectures. With so many guest speakers, it can feel disjointed.",
    "Less in class assignments, more informal with focus on client output",
    "instructor's comments for our final product were a bit out of context and could be more constructive if the instructor took our previous deliverables into account",
    "Some of material is out-dated and project management classes are unnecessary for those who have relevant work experience. Strengths were in class presenters, work with client, some of the early material taught by professor. Weaknesses were feedback from professor - she's not in our team\/client meetings so it's difficult for her to give relevant feedback from afar.",
    "The course should have project overview from the clients itself. Each client should come to the class and explain the project and the expectation from the students."

   "comments": [
    "Talk among your team mates to set explicit team norms at the beginning of the course, regarding communication styles, decision making criteria, milestones, labor distribution etc. When assembling deliverables, do not divide workload by content, which results in inconsistency in styles and unchecked blindspot. Instead, discuss in which way each person wants to contribute, e.g. writing, graphic design, quantitative analysis etc.",
    "Make sure you love the project description that you are applying for. That will make the project interesting even if you client is difficult to manage.",
    "Establish clear guidelines with your group since the very begining.",
    "The most important aspect is the client and the project itself. If you have an engaged client and clear deliverables, all will be well. If not, you'll have to work hard to narrow the scope, define the workstreams and summon the motivation to produce something that you're proud of and is actually useful for the client.",
    "Take it",
    "make they are very interested in the subject, the client and the indsutry",
    "Take this course for an engaging consulting experience. The experience could be good or bad depending on the teammates and the clients but you'll surely learn a lot in the process."
