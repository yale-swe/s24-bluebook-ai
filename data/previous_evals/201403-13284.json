    "Definitely take Korean 110 if you are interested in learning the language. This is because Ms. Lee Smith is just fabulous.",
    "Korean 110 is an excellent introductory course for Korean, and its workload is much more manageable than L1 courses for other East Asian languages. I recommend the course to anyone with an interest in East Asian languages.",
    "Korean L1 is an amazing class and Lee Sunsengnim is an amazing teacher. I was conflicted between taking this class or Chinese and I am very happy I chose Korean. The sheer amount of language you can learn is astounding. The script is very intuitive and will only take you a week or so to learn. From there on out you can focus on actually learning how to speak, write, and connect with other people in Korean. Super fun, great class dynamic and definitely worth it.",
    "After taking this course, you will have a basic, but VERY SOLID understanding of Korean language. You will find the class very enjoyable and useful at the same time.",
    "This is a class you need to take.",
    "During the course of one semester, students obtain more knowledge than can be expected from an introductory language class. The class can be difficult since it does not use English letters and the same English sentence structure, but after getting accustomed to using the Hangul alphabet and the Korean sentence structure, it becomes easier to learn the language. You also learn how to use the present, past, and future tense and how to talk in polite, formal and informal language. Aside from learning the language, this class begins to teach you about Korea and its culture, both which are fascinating. I highly recommend KREN 110 to other Yale students."
