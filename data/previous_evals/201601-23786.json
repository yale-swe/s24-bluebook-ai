    "YES! Both of the professors are brilliant, engaging, and caring. They also bring snacks to every class. Every reading is interesting, and the course load is very manageable. The only caveat to this class is that there is 15-20 page paper as the class' final. Other than this paper, the class is relatively easy and the professors genuinely care about their students. Also, this issue is SO important.",
    "I would say that it is a worthwhile class, but it still has some kinks to be ironed out. Visiting a child care center was such a wonderful opportunity, and getting to know Jessica and Janna was a joy. I learned a lot, but I think there is still room for growth in the curriculum.",
    "Take this class. If you are interested in education, poverty, American politics, policy, or women's issues, this is a must take. Mostly education studies students or those that take a lot of other education courses were in the class, but it is relevant to a much larger range of people. Jana and Jessica are easily some of the best professors and they really care. Additionally, it is really interesting to get a look at some of these issues from the perspectives of people actually doing the work currently.",
    "Take this class! If you are interested in education policy and the societal issues challenging child care then this course is for you. Professor Wagner and Professor Sager provide contrasting viewpoints making for incredible discussion. Work is manageable, like a regular seminar but Professor Wagner and Professor Sager challenge you to ask and answer difficult questions.",
    "A great course if you're interested in the field at all (from any angle--economic, educational, social justice, etc). The workload is manageable and you'll learn a lot!",
    "\"Childcare, Society and Public Policy\" is an intensive, immersive overview of the American child care system. It's easy to talk about \"systems\" in the abstract, and this class helps us get a handle on the assemblage of policies, philosophies, and initiatives that determine what happens to our children when they're at their most impressionable. I would absolutely recommend this class for so many reasons: for Janna and Jessica's mixture of theory and personal anecdotes, for the chance to visit different child care centers and let our experiences complicate our readings, for the civics lesson that this class provides (I've never known more about how federalism actually works), and for the sense of urgency that pervades every class discussion (I loved feeling that my comprehension of the material would inform whether or not I am a force for good in this field).",
    "A course with two of the greatest, warmest professors at Yale that will significantly advance your knowledge on child care policy. TAKE IT!!!"
