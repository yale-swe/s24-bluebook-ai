   "comments": [
    "It's an excellent class, and I would recommend it to any student because the readings are excellent and the format of the class is very engaging.",
    "English 127 exposed me to pieces of American literature that I hadn't had the chance to read during high school, which I value (reading Moby Dick was a challenging way to start off the year, but was a very rewarding read). The course moves quickly,oftentimes covering a work in just a week. I also felt that the course helped me to improve my analytical writing skills.",
    "This class is a great overview of some of the major texts in the American canon. The books are interesting, and the workload is manageable. I definitely suggest it. The classes were very engaging and interesting.",
    "This was a great course. There was a lot of reading, which could make a hard semester even harder, but the reading was great, for the most part, and the in-class discussions were even better. I think the readings could be evened out a bit more, to prevent some days from having 200 pgs due. The final exam could also benefit from a slight restructuring: due to the intense time pressure, the essays on the final exam end up being poorly written--and they are written very differently from the ways of writing we develop during the course. The course was very challenging, but also very rewarding.",
    "A great intro to American literature. While it is reading intensive, it is very rewarding with great feedback on writing and the historical context of the readings. I would recommend researching the historical context of the readings before class and maybe even before doing the reading. Professor Cecire rocks; she is very approachable and takes the time to prepare helpful supplementary class materials as well as provide constructive feedback on essays."
