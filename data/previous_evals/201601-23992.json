   "comments": [
    "This course was pretty cool. I had never used 3D printers before and had only barely touched 3D modeling. I felt as if this class got me pretty well acquainted with each of these topics in a fun hands-on way. However, I do wish that there was more class discussion. For a freshman seminar, I found this class disappointingly lecture-like. Perhaps it will be changed next year (definitely shop it!).",
    "This is the coolest freshman seminar ever. Hands down, Julie Dorsey is great. We got to learn how to model things in the computer and then we flippin PRINTED THEM OUT. It was really crazy. I had never even seen a 3D printer in real life and by the end of the course I was designing movable parts and all sorts of crazy stuff for my project. Def take if you can get in.",
    "Take it. Especially if you are interested in 3D modeling or want to explore something new. It's not a great workload but the skills learned are very valuable.",
    "A helpful introduction to the intersection of architecture and computation.",
    "The fact that the course straddles the architecture and CS departments means that your classmates don't necessarily have same learning priorities as you, which can actually be really useful and eye-opening when brainstorming projects.",
    "This course can be a little difficult at first if you have never taken any CS courses before like I hadn't. However, the professor and TA were really helpful.",
    "Introduction to 3D modeling in Rhino and Grasshopper. I would recommend as a good freshman seminar with light work load and fun projects.",
    "Overall, I think I greatly improved my CADing abilities in this course and increased familiarity with the 3D printers. The final field trip to Big Sky Studios was fantastic, and tied the 3D modeling we'd been learning about to research. Also, because the class only met one day a week it was pretty easy to schedule. However, the second half of the course was definitely a huge improvement on the first half. In the second half of the course, we were working on our final projects. Class time did feel a little bit wasted, but as I said earlier we only met once a week; most of the work was independent and that's when I learned the most. In the first half, there were lectures every day that lightly touched on all sorts of interesting subjects but never went in depth, and so it didn't feel like we were learning anything and it was slightly mind numbing. It would have been nice if we had learned to use the laser cutter in the learning portion of the course rather than shoehorning it in at the end for those who really needed it (I did not, so Ihave no familiarity with the laser cutter consequently), and also if we had had some interaction with our peers earlier in the course. I didn't get to know anyone in the class until the field trip on the last day really, at which point the class was over. That was a bit of a disappointment.",
    "This was the first semester for the course, and it definitely felt like we were the guinea pigs. There was no syllabus for the semester, the class was disorganized, and it seemed like there wasn't any plan. The professor and TA's didn't upload homework assignments in a timely manner, they sent us many last minute emails, and I did not receive any grades on my problem sets. Only received a grade for the midterm-quiz. The lectures were boring, and you mainly only had to pay attention at the end when the TA's gave you specific instructions for that week's problem set. Many of the computer programs we used were not explained that well since the TA's themselves had just learned how to use them. The final project was very unlike what we did throughout the semester. Our main problem sets had to do with designing things using programs like Rhino then just sending it to print on the 3D printer. Few of the projects required creativity or innovative design thinking, which is what I was expecting of the course based on the description. The final project required a lot of design thinking and a lot of knowledge of the production side of design (knowing how to deal with 3D printer idiosyncrasies, making physical pieces actually fit together, etc.) which the course had not prepared us for at all. Overall, the course did not require too much work, but you would get slammed with work unexpectedly every now and then due to several difficult projects or difficulties with the 3D printers. It could be improved by having a better structure, being more organized, and having lectures focus more on the applied side (how to use the programs, how to do design, etc.) rather than just focusing on giving a drawn-out overview of all the different types of image capture \/ perspectives \/ etc. I only used that information for the midterm, but barely used any of it for anything else like the projects or final. The final project was fun though, and I wish that the whole semester had been filled with more things like that."
