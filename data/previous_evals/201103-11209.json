    "Great Big Ideas is a series of video lectures that presents a summary of a different, major academic topic every week. You'll get a synthesis of current thought in each field, along with the topic's history and\/or personal opinions from the speaker, who's always a noted academic or professional and usually a widely-read author as well.Onevideo and several readings are assigned each week; all are interesting and have a clear purpose, and if you stay on top of what's assigned you'll feel like, if not an expert, at least a learned amateur on nearly every subject by the end of the course. Classes are 2-hour discussion sections in which every student participates (though almost no comments are mandatory). You present original ideas, never merely restating the materials, and most of the class is spent attacking or supporting a proposition - the Big Idea - given by a professor at the start (this is often a controversial idea that seems wrong, but is very tricky to disprove). The argument is the class; learning happens when 18 very different students comment on their own areas of expertise with logical and research\/experience-based feedback from the professor.Unless you are 100% sure what you want to do with the rest of your life, I unequivocally recommend this class. If you're one of those lucky sure people, I recommend it anyway, but your life might change in ways you don't expect. If you don't like to talk or risk being wrong in front of the class, GBI might be scary, but it teaches you how to do both of those things, which in my opinion are necessary for any Yale student or thinking human being.",
    "Great Big Ideas was, hands down, the most life-changing, thought-provoking, and worthwhile course I have ever taken in my entire life. And I do not say that lightly. Looking back on this semester, I can honestly say that Great Big Ideas fulfilled and surpassed my wildest expectations. The video lectures exposed us to a wide variety of disciplines and relevant issues. Class discussions pushed us students to the outer limits of certainty and pried our fingers from the safe moorings of half-formed convictions and unquestioningly accepted truths. We were encouraged to speak our mind, change our mind, and speak our mind once more. And the next week, do it all over again on a totally new and exciting topic.I would recommend this course to any student, but especially to my fellow freshmen, since I can't imagine a better way to begin a Yale education, or any college education for that matter.In my opinion, Great Big Ideas is the ideal course. You've got a variety of top professors filmed at their very best, speaking on a variety of pressing issues, available to be played and replayed, paused and restarted, at the students' convenience. You've got fascinating readings that don't feel like homework, and you've got incredibly dynamic seminar leaders, and equally as committed classmates, all willing to argue and dig deeper and continue the conversation outside of the classroom. What more could you want?",
    "Excellent course to take if you can get in. fascinating discussions make you rethink the disciplines you are learning about, reassess the foundations of the liberal arts education. learn to participate in a totally new and energy-infused way.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. You get to explore fields you never would have at Yale in this course.",
    "Yes, I already know this is going to be one of the classes that I will remember after I graduate. This seminar succeeds in becoming a family, very rare for a class.",
    "The class is great if you know what you are getting into (and want just that). It is dynamic and exciting conversation. If you are looking for a seminar to get a chance to argue and bond with students and professors it is an ideal scenario and probably a very rare opportunity. If you are looking to learn more about the specific disciplines that are discussed in the syllabus I do not think this is the class for you.",
    "Incredible classes can come in a variety of shapes. Some courses you look back on and realize that they were critical to shaping your basic understanding of the world. Others, you simply love because going to that seminar is the highlight of your week. In some the professor makes it magically click, and in others its the reading. Great Big Ideas was all of the above. Definitely apply for this class.",
    "You watch an hour-long video about a discipline and read\/watch whatever links the professor sends out, like TED talks and stuff from the Economist, and Youtube videos. There is also a little bit of reading. Then you discuss the discipline in seminar. There is a new one every week so it's always a fresh conversation.DEFINITELY recommend this class. It is relevant for all majors. Take it if you can get in it. You will develop better writing and critical thinking skills and become more articulate. The work doesn't even feel like it's work and you learn about so many interesting ideas.",
    "This class is the best thing you'll take at Yale. The class format is fantastic--you watch well-produced video lectures by experts in each field, you have intense discussions and debates about everything, and you write papers\/do projects on topics that are actually interesting. The class was so engaging that I never once checked my watch during seminar, and our discussions always spilled over into class dinners later in the evening. The best part about the class, though, is that it will help you figure out a little more about who you are and what you're looking for in your education. Mr. Glick and Provost Salovey had a way of figuring each of us out, and their guidance helped me gain a sense of direction going forward in my studies. I gave up tickets to the Daily Show on two consecutive Wednesdays to take this class, and I am so happy that I did(really, that's the highest recommendation I can give).",
    "I don't know how else to put it: take this class, if it's the only thing you do in your four years here. I could not recommend it highly enough.The broad, liberal arts approach (\"an inch deep, mile wide\") was a bit scary to me at first, but it turned out to be the defining benefit of the class. This class teaches you to synthesize between different disciplines, to argue and write more effectively, and more importantly it teaches you how to live. The video lectures are nice and contain some cool factual information, but don't expect to become an expert in anything. The meat of the class is in the seminar discussions, which generally veer completely off topic and end up somewhere around the question of human consciousness. Yes, this is okay, and even desirable, because the point here is not to learn facts, but to learn ideas.Adam Glick is a phenomenal teacher. He has a relatively flamboyant and aggressive style, but this results in much more interesting discussions than the usual mumbo jumbo. He is also willing to share his wisdom with the class, and to give tips on life outside the classroom in a way that you won't get anywhere else. In his own words, Great Big Ideas teaches you not how to think, but how to live.One caveat: Professor Glick completely defined the experience of being in this course for me. With another professor, it could be very different.I'm fairly certain that Great Big Ideas will end up being the most memorable class I take in my time at Yale. It changed not just how I think, but how I live. Take this course and you won't regret it.",
    "Great Big Ideas truly made my first semester of my freshman year. I\u0092ve never been excited by a class as much as I have been by this one. I honestly looked forward to being in class every Wednesday at 3:30. I did all of the work because I wanted to, not only because I felt obligated. Mr. Glick has allowed each of us to expand our horizons to see other people\u0092s point of views, while keeping our individuality in tact as well. He taught us to question everything and changed my entire outlook on how I think and life in general. Through all of our differences, Mr. Glick has bonded our class to an extreme that I didn\u0092t know was possible. Instead of the usual hurried bustle to pack up your books right as the class ended, our class constantly stayed 10, 15, even 30 minutes over just to keep talking and discussing ideas. And then, in addition, we would all clear our schedules to have dinner with each other. Mid Wednesday afternoon to late Wednesday night was monopolized by Great Big Ideas, but because I wanted it to be. I don\u0092t think I\u0092ve said \u0091I love college\u0092 as much as I did walking back to my dorm post-Wednesday dinners. I would walk back and be in the best mood, with my mind so open and so inquisitive as I looked around me. Great Big Ideas truly embodies what I would want an undergraduate education to be. And I can\u0092t imagine the class without Professor Glick. He excited us every class by making us state our opinions, be confident in what we believed, but just as quickly realize that by the end of the class, your whole outlook on life could be turned upside down. He was so passionate about teaching us about life, we all even got piano lessons from him after class or whenever he was free. I\u0092ve truly had a well-rounded education in this class and the skills its taught me have been irreplaceable. I\u0092m actually sad to see winter break come because I never want Great Big Ideas to end.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar to other students for its breadth, different course material, professor, and small class size interaction.",
    "Take it or miss out on the experience of Yale.",
    "I would recommend Great Big Ideas to a student who is eager to get involved in class discussions, who doesn't take ideas for granted, and who has interests in a wide range of subjects."
