    "I would only take this course if it is required.",
    "If you've taken L3, it's pretty much the same thing except the compositions and homeworks are graded a little tougher. If you put in the time to learn the vocab and grammar, you'll be fine. The presentations at the end take a little bit of time, but overall the work is evenly space out. Leon is pretty good at explaining grammatical concepts, but if you really want to remember the tenses then just read the book.",
    "Yes, this class is necessary to further our Spanish proficiency.",
    "I would recommend this course to otra gente. I mean, you sort of have to take it to fulfill your language requirement; plus, I very much want to speak Spanish fluently. This is probably a little easier than L3, if you care. You get to read a short novel and longer short stories, so it seemed more \"real\" to me than L2 and L3.",
    "Whereas L3 worked on solidifying one's base of Spanish grammar, L4 focuses more on developing Spanish intuition. Much more enjoyable the L3, and probably a lower workload as well. Tests and quizzes were fair. If you have to take this, don't fret; it'll be an enjoyable experience. Leon is a good instructor; although a bit intimidating at first, if you approach her sincerely with a question, she responds enthusiastically.",
    "Your Spanish will definitely get better by taking this class. It is a little more work that L3, but nothing too crazy. I would however try to avoid Leon's section. She gives extra assignments that are not part of the syllabus that the other professors follow, and often gives pop quizzes which no other L4 professor does. But besides that it is your basic language class, not inspiring, but not unbearable.",
    "I'd only recommend this course if you plan to continue with Spanish...",
    "HEY! PAY ATTENTION TO ME! RUN AWAY FROM ROSAMARIA LEON! Did you hear me? Just don't take it! Don't give me that excuse that this is the only Professor that fits your schedule. This is just flat out not true! She is going to make your life miserable! Professor Leon, even though very nice outside classroom, is NOT a nice professor. She could be more flexible with some of her requirements, such as late homework. One day I forgot my homework at home and had class right after Spanish. She told me that if I did not get my homework by 12:30 (my other class would finish at 12:50), I would get a zero. I only asked her for a delay of 20 minutes. If you cannot give 20 minutes to a student, I'm sorry! You are just not nice! As a result, I had to get to my next class 30 minutes late! That was just unnecessary. The homeworks are only graded one week later!!!She is a VERY HARSH GRADER and do not take any suggestion as how to improve the class. Sometimes, I also felt that she did not come to class very grammatically prepared.On top of that, the Spanish exams were very poorly written most of the time. Sometimes, they did not make sense just for the sake of asking for one very specific grammar rule. Come on! We go to Yale! Professors should step in for their students and ask for a better exam!I should have trusted my guts and taken Spanish with a different professor. For the sake of your semester\/happiness, RUN AWAY!!! There are nicer professors out there!",
    "Fine class, pretty hard, but similar to L3."
