    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Class with Professor Roemer was my favorite part of the week. I looked forward to attending every Monday. My eyes were opened to classic movies that I know I wouldn't have watched on my own but am forever grateful I was exposed to through this class. Professor Roemer is a delight, he's insightful, funny and genuine. This is one of my favorite classes and I would recommend it to another student - american studies major or not.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to spend a lot of time thinking through life's caveats through film",
    "If you are interested in film and need a fifth class, I would recommend Fact in Fiction. Professor Roemer is really cool."
