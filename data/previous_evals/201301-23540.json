    "This class added nothing to my education. This was supposed to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccapstone\u00e2\u0080\u009d on my time here at FES, and all I did was rewrite poorly written documents produced by my client and my partner, occasionally conducting free research (i.e. Google search) for my client. This could have been done by a high school student. It was an extremely frustrating, worthless experience, made even worse by the fact that it took up valuable time in my final semester.I hated, hated, hated this class. Occasionally the speakers were ok. The class material was redundant with other courses I took at SOM. This class is everything that is wrong with FES.",
    "I enjoyed very much this class. Maureen Burke was an excellent professor and brought great speakers.",
    "This was a terrible course. It was a complete waste of time and a bad excuse for a capstone. I felt like a 3rd grader, required to work that I know is simply to keep me busy rather than really teach me something new. That is not what a graduate school class should consist of. It should be seriously re-vamped before being offered again."

    "Nothing. The course is really good in theory, but completely fails in practice. I learned nothing. In fact, I felt like I was unable to use knowledge I had because of the poorly constructed structure of the class. In theory, consulting projects are a great idea but the course made this more like one long, drawn out, elementary school project rather than any sort of professional consulting project."

    "The guest speakers were awful. They spoke to the class as though we had never heard of sustainability before, regardless of the fact that we are getting graduate degrees at a school of environmental studies. They were often redundant and never interesting. The class meeting times would be better spent working on developing consulting skills rather than listening to the worst speakers to ever talk at FES. Additionally, the professor seems completely unengaged. It is as though she created the curriculum many years ago and cannot be bothered to adjust it. The course requirements should be customized for each project (there are not many) rather than uniform for all. How was she a consultant?? She makes the worst powerpoint decks."
