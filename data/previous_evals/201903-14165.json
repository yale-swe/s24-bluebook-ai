   "comments": [
    "Got to discuss a fairly interesting assortment of case studies and topics about business ethics every week. A smorgasbord, really.",
    "In general, this class gave me an opportunity to learn more about foundational ethical approaches (kantian ethics, virtue-based ethics, locke's natural rights, etc.) and allowed me to expand beyond this foundation to learn about common arguments made in the business ethics literature around certain subjects like affirmative action, corporate social responsibility, interest\/usury, price gouging, etc. I also learned about real world examples from the case studies we used, or from sources that were less academic and more from the news.",
    "We applied different philosophers' ethical theories to modern problems of business ethics, learning how different behaviour can be deemed ethical or unethical from different perspectives and determining which approaches are most convincing."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is the definition of chill, which is pretty great - discussions are good and free-flowing precisely because they are so low-stakes. The intellectual bar is not too high - Prof. Collins definitely prioritizes getting a wide-ranging discussion rather than drilling down on specific ethical or economics concepts, so the class is very accessible.",
    "I think this was a great course. I think the syllabus was constructed well for us to gain the conceptual base we needed, and then subsequently start diving into subtopics and case studies. I also think the small class size was great for us to have good class discussions. Can't really think of any weaknesses.",
    "The course gives an interesting introduction to different ethical theories and makes you think not only about how to apply them to business, but also how you can apply these philosophies to your own life. In addition to being thought-provoking in this way, it is also an interesting look into he ethical problems that businesses face today in a variety of different sectors and contexts. The reading responses are a bit tedious, but class discussion is fun and engaging."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "This class is pretty intellectually light and feels more like an SOM class at times. Discussion was very free-flowing and laid back, and the course was overall a low-stakes environment. Papers and assessments are easy, so students mostly get to focus on reading and discussing the topics that genuinely interest them, which is pretty great. Prof. Collins sometimes struggles to tie the content of a class into a single theme, but at the end of the day nobody really minds.",
    "I would recommend this course to people with an interest in or curiosity about the morality of the business world. While sometimes abstract ethical theories don't really seem like they can do much for us in the real world, the questions we were dealing with in the course were often not abstractions but realistic dilemmas that people in all dimensions of business face. You're also bound to be in class with people who think differently than you, which is definitely going to be a learning experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone looking for an introduction to different ethical theories and to some of the ethical problems facing businesses. It does not go into any particular issue that deeply but is a helpful overview and class discussions are generally interesting, fun and interactive.",
    "Yes!"
