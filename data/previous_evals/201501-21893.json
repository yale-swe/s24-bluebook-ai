    "I wouldn't really take it unless you're Econ\/Math. In that case you have no choice",
    "The worst thing about this class is the brilliant Econ\/Math majors wrecking any semblance of a curve. Yuichi is a decent lecturer (his anecdotes are a huge plus as well), is an understanding lecturer, and most importantly, assigns quite light homework. We had a total of 8 problem sets the entire semester (the longest of which was either 5 or 6 problems). The midterm was also very fair as well. The most important piece of advice I can give you is this: Go to class, and for the love of Christ, TAKE NOTES. Write down everything Yuichi writes on the board (and anything he says you can write, write that too). The notes he posts on v2 are pretty unhelpful, and the exams (open everything) often pull things verbatim out of his lectures. If you have a solid set of lecture notes, you'll do well on the exams and in the class; if you don't, there's little that can help you. Also, Yuichi gives out ~55% A's + A-'s and doesn't have any Stata project like 131\/132. So if you were deciding between 131\/132 and 136 and think you're decent at math, definitely take 136.",
    "If you're gonna do anything with statistics, especially econ research or quant jobs.",
    "You need to be dedicated to understand the material, but it is very rewarding and the tests are not too hard (open notes). The practicality of the course is unmatched if you want to do causal modeling.",
    "Econ 136 is a spectacular class. Though it is required for the Econ and Math major, the work and the material are eminently manageable. Professor Kitamura is the man. He's very approachable, tells funny anecdotes, covers interesting examples, assigns short problem sets, and gives fair exams. What else do you want?",
    "Dry material, but decent course load and fair test. Weekly P sets (take 2-3 hours on avg), a midterm and a final (both open book). Professor Kitamura is a very clear lecturer, and has a fantastic sense of humour. He really cares about the material, and seems to enjoy teaching a lot. He is a great professor, who has structured the course so that students understand the material without being overly burdened with assignments",
    "If you consider taking this class you're probably Math&Econ, so you'll have to take the course anyway. Textbooks for the class cost more than $500, but you won't have to buy them because you'll get along just fine with your notes from class and the notes that are uploaded on classes v2. Tests are all open book, but will be taken more or less directly from the class notes.",
    "Take it!!",
    "Good class covering important aspects of econometrics, primarily best linear predictors, ordinary least squares, and instrumental variables. Prof. Kitamura is a clear lecturer and homework is very light. The flip side, however, is that the class doesn't cover as much material as it could. The lectures are rather slow, so we could have certainly covered additional topics, like time series data.",
    "Pretty boring class that covers very little material and isn't a lot of work.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will calculate the effect of the price of fish on quantity demanded by measuring the height of waves. You will learn how sending letters to doctors can reveal the eficiency of a flu shot. You will read a controvertial paper on a minimum wage increase raising employment. You will learn about the legendry Hal White's heteroskedastic estimator for standard error, and may even hear an anecdote about how Hal White played the trumpet. Trust me, this may be the most interesting class you ever take, and it's taught so well, it seems intuitive and easy. Both Professor Kitamura and our TA Noriko deserve a teaching award for this class.",
    "ECON 136 contains useful knowledge for those interested in empirical work in the social sciences. Although the material is often dry, Professor Kitamura does his best to help you understand the material.",
    "It was a well organized course. The agenda introduced at the beginning of each class was very helpful. Definitely reasonable workload.",
    "Take it. Prof Kitamura is great, and it was as interesting as I could possibly see econometrics being.",
    "HIGHLY recommend--one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Yuichi is great, and the class isn't that much work either. If you're interested in statistics and economics and want to learn how to accurately assess economic factors, definitely take this class over 131. Only kind of bad thing is that you're competing with the studs so the curve is kind of hard, but overall not that much work so I would recommend.",
    "This course gives you a very solid introduction to linear econometric modeling and the analysis of those models given the properties of the variables at play. I'd highly recommend that any economics student, and even any student in the social sciences who's interested in this sort of thing, take this course. Professor Kitamura is AMAZING and really makes this course.",
    "ECON 136 will teach you the skills necessary to actually analyze data and understand exactly what you are doing. It is a course that made me realize that I probably do want to work as a data analyst or work with statistics. Using math (and understanding the math) to predict real-world things is amazing, and ECON 136 teaches you how to do so. Take this course.",
    "Awesome course. Take it with Yuichi Kitamura, vanguard of econometrics and master of the subtle joke. Strengths: Material well presented, questions well-answered. Builds on the concepts presented (hopefully rigorously) in 135. Interesting real-life examples to back up each topic were very appreciated. A great instructor who makes time for his students. Weaknesses: At some points we could probably have moved faster through the material and covered more - especially if the topic is less theoretical\/math-intensive (could be a plus for some).",
    "An applied look at econometrics in the field, building a bit more of a theoretical foundation before jumping into the problems of endogeneity and how to fix them. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone because Professor Kitamura is incredible."
