    "Not unless you have to - interesting but very hard and nothing like you've done before",
    "Take it if you really have to (e.g. if you're an engineering or G&G major).",
    "Take it! If it's for your major, get ready for one of the most challenging classes at Yale. If you're taking it for fun, do yourself a favor and take it cr\/d\/f. Lecture is fast, problem sets are a combination of book problems (mostly easy) and a couple of his own problems (usually very hard). Tests are extremely difficult and heavily test your conceptual knowledge of fluid mechanics.",
    "Only take it if you need to for your major",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "WONDERFUL COURSE!!!!! One of the best science\/engineering courses I have ever taken, and I'm a senior. Very engaging lectures. If Oullette is teaching it, take it. He really really cares about his students, loves to talk to you during office hours, and it's clear he is concerned w\/ his students at all stages of the course. Really clear explanations. This class could make you want to study fluids more and excited. The psets are pretty easy, it's mostly just the concepts are difficult.Class is taught like a physics class, with very practical\/engineering-based psets. Wide range of majors here. Good to cr\/d if you are not required to take it (less worry).The exams are very hard so be warned.",
    "I would only recommend taking MENG 361 if it is required for your major. It is a very in depth course and requires you to be up to speed with advanced calculus and also to have a working knowledge of statics and dynamics. The professor is very technical with his explanations and lectures as if the students already have some knowledge of the information he's presenting.",
    "Great class. You really need a good physics\/math background though, and I'd advise brushing up on multivariable calculus before you get here. More advanced math is also probably helpful, as we were introduced to tensors, something I had never learned before. Ouellette comes from a physics background, which made me (an engineering major) nervous at first, but actually I really enjoyed it. You do end up with a more intuitive understanding of what all those equations actually mean, rather than just looking stuff up in tables. Take advantage of how eager he is to help students succeed. In particular, go to his office hours; they're tremendously helpful.",
    "This is class is difficult and requires a lot of work. You're most likely taking it because you have to for engineering, so be prepared for some late nights doing psets and a lot of studying if you really want an A.",
    "Hard class. Proceed with caution",
    "Definitely a good class. It's a lot of work, but you learn so much and Prof. Ouellette is great.",
    "This is a very difficult class but Professor Oullette is an absolutely incredible teacher. If you take good notes in class and read the textbook you will be completely fine",
    "Loved it! Such an interesting subject, and Professor Ouellette is a great lecturer and a fun guy to talk to in office hours. You hardly even need to have taken differential equations for this class because the only cases you can solve are radically simplified. Multivariable calculus, however, is extremely important because it is basically the whole class.Overall, if you like understanding how things work (especially if you were fascinated by tornados as a kid) and don't mind some appliedcalculus, take this class! Not that you get to learn about how tornados work, but it's related and it's cool stuff. Also, Ouellette's lectures are so energetic that even at 9am they would wake me up.One caveat: if Ouellette is *not* teaching this course and it's someone else instead, I would be more wary of taking it and would read the reviews. This is the kind of material that could be really confusing if not explained well. Of course, if you have to take it, you have to take it, but if you have a choice, wait to take it with Ouellette!",
    "Yes I would. It is a required class for many majors, so that is most likely why you need to take it. That being said, the class was enjoyable and I learned a lot. it is a difficult class however, but you know that going in.",
    "I do not regret learning the stuff I learned in this class, but it was pretty stressful and after a couple weeks I was not motivated to get up in time for class except when I had to turn problem sets in. The stuff you learn is simultaneously pretty cool and pretty basic; you're not going to get into fun stuff like whirlpools.",
    "I'm guessing you're taking this because you have to. Take it with Professor Ouellette and just be prepared to put in the time and work.",
    "This is a good engineering class \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not terribly heavy workload, challenging in the math and concepts but not impossible, and really interesting. Also very useful, and a cool way to learn a more advanced engineering field that builds off other classes. I really liked this class. It was hard, but fluid mechanics is hard. Lectureswere very helpful and well taught (Professor Ouellette was a great professor to take this course with): the material was presented in a very clear and organized way, and there was a good balance of providing the rigorous mathematical explanations as well as the physical phenomena of the topics covered. The topics covered were also useful, spanning a broad range of topics that still related to one another. Homework problems were well-balanced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the book problems provided practice in problem-solving, while the original problems made us think about the dynamics of the fluid. Some problems felt too math-heavy (like something from a calc or diffEq class rather than a fluids class), but in retrospect I think they were good for us to do as an exercise in seeing how those math techniques are applied to and necessary for evaluating engineering situations.Go to office hours with the professor! They were great and really helped me understand the concepts and how to think about solving the problems, and I heard that TA sessions just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really help or confused people. Not only did I understand how to solve the problems, but I also felt like I had a much clearer grasp of the concepts in general afterward. He also is just so excited about fluid mechanics and knows the field so well, you can tell he really likes teaching fluids. He also has research experience and is really approachable. I found myself sitting in class, realizing that I had been watching him derive various forms of nonlinear differential equations for an hour, and wondering why I was so engaged and not falling asleep when I totally should have been giving the circumstances.The biggest challenge in the course was not knowing exactly how to study because problem set solutions were not very detailed and exams and exam solutions were not posted, plus no additional practice problems were given.ChemE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for sure take this class instead of the fluids in the chemE dept!",
    "I would summarize the MENG 361 as a tough engineering course. Definitely make sure you stay on top of the work and review the textbook, as it follows the class closely. You probably are taking the class because you have to, so you don't have a chance, but on the off-chance you don't and are interested, make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.",
    "This was perhaps the most rewarding class I room at yale. I would not recommend it unless you need it for your major. However the amount of conceptual understanding that ouellette gives you is astounding. This is a very theoretical class and is hard for the engineers but easier for the physicists. The tests are hard and conceptually very challenging.",
    "As a heads up: the midterm exams were really difficult while the final was quite easy. Otherwise, the homeworks are decently challenging because Professor Ouellette wants the homeworks to teach you in tandem with class instead of the homeworks being just plugs and chugs.",
    "This course is rather difficult but it is rewarding. Professor Ouellette is very willing to meet with students, and office hours are very helpful. However, problem sets can be frustrating because they don't always relate well to what was taught in class.",
    "The course covers several interesting concepts important for the study of chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. The course covers important topics like pipe flows and external flows, as well as delves deep into the importance of viscosity (Reynolds numbers, etc.) . The strengths are that this course is covered in great detail and valuable information can be found through abundant sources other than the textbook. The weaknesses is that fluid mechanics is a course on individual conditions and depending on those conditions, the end solutions always change. As it is said, \"We can solve questions that are inherently false, or use equations that are inherently true but are impossible to solve.\"",
    "Fluid Mechanics is hard, but with Professor Ouellette, is a very rewarding course. He is a fantastic professor, and is great at explaining the concepts. Make time to meet with him in office hours, you'll learn a lot and get to know him a bit--he's a really nice guy!",
    "Take it! Excellent course, though certainly not easy. Prof. Ouellette is wonderful, and very dedicated to helping you understand the material.",
    "Fluid Mechanics, with the possible exception of diff eq, was my least favorite class at yale. It is not very interesting and you should expect it to be your hardest class. However, if it is required, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much of a choice. If not, I highly discourage it unless you are a physics person, genuinely interested, and ready to commit to 9am class.Nicholas Ouellette is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. This is not because he is incompetent, as there is no doubt he is a brilliant man nor is it because he is not a clear lecturer, as his notes are organized and teaching is enthusiastic and smooth. But he simply cannot relate to his students. He teaches this like a straight up physics class, which is absurd. He also uses a lot of heavy math, which most of us can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow. Consequently, it can be hard to understand even simple concepts and when you try to go talk to him in office hours, he is not particularly understanding and is in fact a little condescending. Additionally, Ouellette struggles to understand that 9am is an absolutely terrible time for the average undergrad, especially for a class such as this.The problem sets are usually a mix of mostly book problems, which are easy to figure out, and his own made-up problems which are nearly impossible. One of the main complaints I heard from students were the exams. Normally, problem sets are a decent indication of what will be on the exam and studying a considerable amount leads to a better score. With his tests, neither of those premises necessary holds. They are difficult to predict and are very conceptual, containing only variables with zero numbers. Now, if you love physics and can deal with somebody like this, you may enjoy it so go ahead and take it. But that is not how an engineering class should be.",
    "As a geology major, I took this as an elective. Maybe not great for my GPA, but I don't regret it all! Fluid mechanics is useful in many engineering and science disciplines, so you should be excited to take this class whether or not it is required for your major. This course greatly challenged and strengthened my ability to apply math and science knowledge to frame and evaluate engineering problems in a more focused way than any other class I have taken thus far at Yale. I am not sure how directly the material applies to engineering practice (after all, we're not studying any lowly hydraulics in MENG 361), but it built a strong theoretical foundation for in-depth analysis of fluid systems that is fundamental to understanding and successfully applying more widely used empirical methods. Oullette is a dynamic and clear lecturer who manages to make complex material engaging at 9am--no small feat! He is very responsive to student questions and needs, spending large chunks of time helping individuals and groups at office hours and also scheduling supplementary TA help sessions. Although I have yet to see my final grade, I get the sense that there will be a reasonable curve--fluid mechanics is difficult, but Oullette is fair, and overall the class was fun!",
    "Fluids is inherently hard, but Professor Ouellette is among the best Engineering professors at Yale. The vast majority of you have to take the course for your major, so the best I can tell you is that you won't regret having to take it. The class is a fair amount of work, but it's almost always painless and fair.",
    "It's interesting and very well taught. However, it is very theoretical and doesn't focus on applications. The little bit of application you do get is in the homework."
