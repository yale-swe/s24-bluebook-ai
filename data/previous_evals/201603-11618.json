    "This is an amazing course; the professors are really dynamic and engaging. The only improvement could be to devote more time to speaking activities.",
    "This course is very well taught. Both instructors have an incredible depth of knowledge and can break down this very complex language. Sometimes there is some miscommunication between the two instructors surrounding test instructions, but overall these are very, very minor.",
    "This class does a good job of teaching Russian at a fast but manageable and effective pace. I do admit that it was easy to slip out of doing the homework, and it might be a good idea to make it more mandatory\/graded."

    "Yes I felt I was thoroughly engaged in the class and felt I've been tremendous progress all thanks to the instructors.",
    "I totally recommend this class! Yale's Russian program is great in general. Russian is super hard, but the instruction is great! The professors are super lovely, sweet, and understanding as well as very competent.",
    "If you already know a Latin language, I suggest taking a totally different and challenging course like Russian at Yale. You can learn your Spanish on DuoLingo.",
    "Yes if they are committed to learning Russian. If someone is just doing it for the language requirement, then maybe not.",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "If you're looking to learn Russian and you have the time and space in your schedule, intensive is an excellent way to do it. The course is definitely fast but also definitely manageable, and both Constantine Felixovich and Minjin are excellent and helpful teachers."
