    "This is a really solid language course. Like any class that you take every day it can feel annoying or boring at times, but you really will learn a lot and practice your Spanish a ton. The class reviews verb tenses and also incorporates a lot of vocab. If you can take it with Prof Reymundi, definitely doshe's really nice and understanding but also a good teacher who you can learn a lot from.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to someone who hopes to improve Spanish skills. Even though I hadn't taken Spanish for 2 years, I was able to keep up and refresh my memory.",
    "This class was good, though the busywork assignments were a drag. It really sucks when the vast majority of people taking the class are only doing it for the language requirement and people are coming in with all different backgrounds. Truth is, tons of people intentionally bomb the placement test to get a good grade, which hurts people like me who have no previous spanish experience. The system is broken and the administration needs to make changes to it asap."
