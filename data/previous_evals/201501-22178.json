    "This course (and remote sensing) is so cool! You should take it if not for the great professors and interesting material, but just to gain the skills on which the course focuses.",
    "A great course! You get to learn really interesting stuff about a relevant topic. Also, it was really exciting to get to apply what we'd been learning to a real world problem at the end of the course for our final project. Well done professors!",
    "Take it! Very interesting subject matter that you probably haven't encountered before in Yale classes. There are numerous applications to remote sensing in many natural and social science fields- many of which are covered by this course. It is also a real treat to find a Yale course that is so practical in that it teaches precise skills, in this case, weekly labs using ENVI software to analyze remote sensing raster data. By the time you start your term project, you will be at a level to do simple, original research, and indeed, several past term projects for this class have turned into published papers!"
