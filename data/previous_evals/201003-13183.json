   "comments": [
    "Do not do Directed studies at all if you aren't naturally wired for the Humanities and really love it. Its just too much reading and too intense to be worth it for anyone else.",
    "DS History of Political Thought was my favorite section, especially because I was in Professor Kasimis' section. She is a great and enthusiastic teacher who makes you grow. The books covered are very diverse and give you various insights into what political thought can look like and how it influences our view of the world.",
    "Get Professor Kasimis if you can! I absolutely loved her. She is so helpful and more relatable than the older professors. It is because of her help that my essays in all of my DS classes got better. She spent so much time with me before and after my papers to really help me improve. I am so glad I was placed in her section.And don't drop DS just because of hte reading load. You do not have to do ALL of the reading.",
    "Traced history and political thought through Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Christian thought.",
    "Yes- unless you don't like a., rigor or b., theory. Otherwise, if you have a chance to take a course with Dr. Kasimis, do it! It is well worth your time and effort.",
    "History\/Politics will give you a solid foundation in knowing how major political bodies and groups developed in different conditions and in different ways. The course also introduces students to what it means for something to be \"history\" (i.e., how it is written, what reading history does for\/to us, why reading history is important.) I would highly recommend the course, not only because of the more factual elements it familiarizes students with (e.g., Greek, Roman, and Christian personalities), but also because of the more theoretical ideas it examines (e.g., types of government, the nature of citizenship, forms of states, etc.)",
    "Kasimis is a great and helpful instructor. I enjoyed writing her papers, which were often challenging. But she would often give good advice on them. I appreciated how she challenged us in class by asking tough questions that made us delve into the text and analyze it. Considering the crazy pace of the Directed Studies, I liked that we concentrated on certain passages and themes and explored them deeply. Overall, she's awesome. I would absolutely recommend her section.Moreover, I really enjoyed thereadings we did. Generally they try to balance more political philosophy works and historical writings and it is interesting to switch between the two, as often the philosophical ideas are staged in the history of Ancient Greece and Rome. Even though the workload is massive, just like in any other DS section, I am still very happy I took this class.",
    "This was the toughest section for me. There is a lot of reading, and some of it is dry and very dense. I learned some interesting things though.",
    "The History and Political Thought section of Directed Studies is an important introduction to some of the major works of Western thought. The class is most beneficial when considered as part of the Directed Studies program as a whole, and in that regard, I would recommend it to another student. The reading is often challenging and difficult to complete, but greater understanding of it is arrived at through an excellent lecture series and fantastic section discussions.",
    "Only take DS if you're prepared for the work.",
    "Basically in this course you read a book a week, and discuss the major points in class. Three papers over the course of the semester help to hone in on the text and look at specific passages that may or may not have been discussed in class. I definitely recommend directed studies to some people-- I think it is especially great in two circumstances: either if you just love humanities with a passion and could spend all your time reading and writing about books no matter what, or if you love to read and write but have never been exposed to great books before. Especially in the latter case, I think students who are unexposed will really love DS."
