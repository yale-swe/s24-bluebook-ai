   "comments": [
    "If you want to totally immerse yourself in a different way of thinking about music, I highly recommend this class. Sarah is spectacularly knowledgeable, and learning to play the gamelan instruments is amazing and face it - when else would you ever get that chance? Some of the readings can get long and dry, but turns out she only really expects you to skim them anyways, and the writing assignments are not at all demanding.",
    "This class is a gem. It is an extremely interesting and fun class, and Professor Weiss is easily one of the best professors I've had at Yale. The workload is reasonable and easily graded (you can also rewrite each assignment for a higher grade). You can expect to write about five 2-page writing assignments, which are easy to write, and a final paper (about 10 pages). Many people in my class opted to do a final project instead of a paper, which often involved some sort of musical composition and a shorter paper. Professor Weiss wants her students to do well and is extremely knowledgeable about Javanese Gamelan, writing skills, and life in general. Definitely take this class if you can you definitely will not regret it. Be warned, however, that it is a decent amount of time. It meets once a week for 1hr 50 min plus a 1.5 hour rehearsal every week. But it's definitely worth it",
    "Not only do you get to learn a fun and interesting music you get to learn about the culture behind the music and all of its theories",
    "It's a great balance between classroom learning and performing gamelan. You really don't need any experience to pick it up.",
    "This class is a good introduction to this truly foreign music. There is not very much reading\/writing (so there really isn't much of an anthropological element), but there is a significant time commitment to learning how to play the music. The instruments are all beautiful and different from anything I've played before, and if you take the class, you can join the gamelan ensemble afterwards.",
    "I highly recommend Music 346! It's a fantastic course, even if you are not a musician! You learn all about the history of Javanese gamelan and how to play all of the instruments. Sarah is a great professor and she really makes class and rehearsal enjoyable. Since it is a writing credit, there are seven short writing assignments throughout the semester and one final paper. The work is definitely not much to worry about for this class. It's a lot of fun--definitely take it if you can!",
    "Definitely take it if you have the time and are interested in learning about a new culture\/new style of music. It would make for a very good 5th credit; the main work is manageable weekly reading assignments, a 2-3 page essay every other week, a final paper\/creative project, and of course, practicing gamelan. Just don't procrastinate too much on the paper...",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to experience something completely different from typical yale courses. The work load is easily manageable and the opportunity to play in a Gamelan is too good to pass up."
