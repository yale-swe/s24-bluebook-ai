    "Cynically speaking, I am glad fewer people take Russian because it speaks well for potential employment\/PhD prospects in the future. However, I really do wish more people would study the language, history and culture of the world's largest and one of its most fascinating countries. If you are at all tempted by Russian, I urge you to take it. It's a great, great language and legitimately really fun to learn. It represents the perfect balance between being non-conventional (everyone speaks Spanish and French) and completely crazy and different to English (Arabic, Chinese, isiZulu).",
    "It's great and a lot of fun if you want to learn russian. Highly recommended.",
    "This course follows beginning Russian through the same textbook, with a DVD and workbook exercizes. I would definitely recommend second year Russian... it's worth continuing the language after putting in the time first year, and the experience is a positive one.",
    "It's tough. But if you love the language then go for it!",
    "Russian is a beautiful language and Russ 130 continues your preparation to learn more and visit Russia. You really begin to gain some valuable abstract vocabulary beyond normal daily situations.",
    "The new textbook continues the hilarious and dysfunctional story of Kevin, Tanya and all our heroes. Why would you not continue taking Russia?"
