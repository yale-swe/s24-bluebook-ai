   "comments": [
    "yes. first of all, mark and alek are a good team. they will make sure you understand and appreciate the material. also, this class unlocks the upper level EE\/AP classes and will explain the fundamentals so it's important that you respect this class!",
    "This course explains the physics behind various semiconductor devices (diodes, MOSFETS, BJT's), which is pretty cool for an EE major who may be already using these devices in other labs. For a student who is not required to take this class, I would only recommend it if they are really interested EE, and specially on individual components. The labs are not too challenging, but the material in the lectures can get a bit tough. However, the tests and problem sets do not cover the more difficult material in lecture.",
    "This course is extremely interesting and enjoyable. Professor Reed is very engaging and explains concepts very clearly. The labs get to be a lot of work, on top of the problem sets and exams, and it is a lot of work for one credit. That said, it is very worthwhile and a great introduction to semiconductor devices. It provides a very strong context for devices that we work with in circuitry based class and really enriches the discipline.",
    "Extremely interesting material with a great professor. Take the class; the labs are long, but it's worth it.",
    "Great class, but be aware that there is a lab with very time consuming lab reports that go along with it.",
    "I would recommend it if they are interested in semiconductor physics. If they are, it is a very good introductory class and will provide all the necessary info for higher level courses without too much work. If not, it probably wouldn't be a good choice.",
    "Great course. You don't really need the EE recommended prereq. Definitely recommend it to engineers of all stripes, will let you learn about the technology that makes our world run."
