    "If you are an Asian person and have not encountered fiction or narratives about being an Asian person, you are missing out on a rich, multi-faceted, excitingly volatile history and discussion concerning the state of being an Asian in America. This class provides a great overview and introduction to thinking critically about what literature and fiction can offer the creation and evolution of this political identity label.",
    "asian american literature is an overview of mostly critically acclaimed asian american texts. the class generally approaches these texts with fairly traditional methodology, though we also talked a lot about the politics of representation, publishing, & art in general. there are weekly reading responses (~1 novel\/week) & two essays on texts of your choice. it would be great in the future if the final assignment could be creative, rather than strictly a comparative literary analysis. professor xiang is a sweetheart & could allow for more organic discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's open to courses in the English major that don't study just old white men.",
    "Yes! Very good class to take if you want to learn more about Asian American politics and learn more about the history of Asian American relations.",
    "For better or for worse, Asian Americans will get more out of this course than others. No matter what your background, be ready for a lot of New Left\/critical theory politics to pervade most discussions.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. Please take it. This is undeniably one of the most enlightening courses I've taken at Yale, and I feel ridiculously lucky that I had a chance to take it. It's one of those classes where you never bother to check the time because you're so drawn into the conversations. It's so, so, so clear how intelligent Professor Xiang issome of the stuff she says in class just blows me away. She (as a person) is much of what made the class so great. She's indelibly kind and generous with her time, gives wonderful suggestions for papers during office hours, and is just overall a wonderful teacher. The assignments themselves were wonderful, and a lot of direction\/guidance\/detail was given about them. Professor Xiang's comments on papers are also incredibly perceptive and helpful, and I feel like I've learned so much about writing, thinking, and reading literature from taking this class. The texts you'll read are, for the most part, absolutely wonderful and have so much to offer in terms of understanding Anglophone literature, race relations in the U.S. and abroad, and the relationship between literature\/art and politics. This is a really amazing class, and if you want to learn about American literature, this course is a staple in your schedule.",
    "No other class is going to teach you Asian American literature.",
    "It's a great class. I highly recommend it to other students! You learn not only about Asian American literature, but are also forced to think deeply about the ways in which literature is political. This is such an important Asian American Studies course that pushes students to think about issues of race and identity and their intersection with literature. I really hope that Yale continues to offer it in the future because it would be a disservice to students not to.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class for any student, whether or not you are a humanities person or have a particular interest in Asian American lit. The works in this course are incredibly diverse and offer a great entry into ethnic studies and the related literature in general - plus many of them are written for a broad American audience rather than works of academic theory (though we certainly worked through theory too).",
    "Yes. Take this course especially if you are from or are at all invested in Asian American communities. This subject is made so invisible and to have an entire course dedicated to it really returns a history that has been disappeared. Also, Sunny Xiang is v. smart and v. great. That said, your classmates can probably make or break this class. I took it with an amazing group of people and it was 300x better for it.",
    "Asian American Literature is important, and you should take it. If you think you know American literature or the American \"canon,\" and you haven't studied Asian American Literature, then you should take this course. If you believe Literature is not a monolith and it cannot be studied without acknowledging its deep connections to other fields such as feminist theory, literary theory, and Ethnic Studies, then you should take this course.",
    "Yes! Take this class if it's offered again.",
    "I definitely recommend taking Asian American Lit. Professor Xiang is excellent and you'll read some incredible fiction and poetry. You'll also read some infuriating novels, but you'll have the opportunity to critique them.",
    "This was an amazing class and the only one that focuses on Asian American literature. A great way to expand the english major requirements beyond just old dead white men. The class looked at Asian American writers and looked at the Asian American genre, including issues such as defining Asian American literature. There was a perfect balance of literature theory and political context to the course. There was also the freedom to explore certain topics on our own, such as asian american art. Professor Xiang was also one of the best professors I have ever had at Yale and is both a brilliant expert on asian american literature and a great educator. Yale needs to keep this course on it's bluebook because it is a great look at a cannon of literature that is often ignored. 10\/10 would recommend you take this course it's a must!",
    "Take it! Or take any class taught by Professor Xiang she's brilliant, incredibly warm, and will make you a better writer and thinker. Asian American Lit gives you a great introduction to the subject as well as teaches you how to consider how such canons or labels are formed and applied."
