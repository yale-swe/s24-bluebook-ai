   "comments": [
    "While the course may not help you definitively discover and avoid financial bubbles, it definitely helps any student gain a better financial vocabulary in terms of past crises and the dynamics that played a role in creating them.",
    "I have taken away an ability to further understand markets and talk about them in a sophisticated way that does not focus on balance sheets.",
    "Thhis was oneof the best classes i have ever taken at yale. Bubbles are a nuanced topic, and I loved engaging with it.",
    "Good reading material all around, and enjoyable guest lectures. Best part of the course was the seminar format, where everyone was able to contribute and debate the readings. As someone likely going into finance as a career, this course gave me a great deal of knowledge on the topic of market bubbles.",
    "A truly wonderful class. One of my favorites at Yale so far. The instructors really care about the students and you learn a lot about finance and economics from a varied interdisciplinary approach.",
    "I learned how to evaluate booms and busts."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was very well organized and the workload was spread very fairly. I also enjoyed the shifting weekly topics and group projects towards the end of the semester, which I felt kept the course continually fresh and interesting. Although even without the format switchups I would have continued to find the subject matter compelling.",
    "Strengths: The professors were both great leaders of discussion and the class was heavily involved in discussion.",
    "Positive, intellectual freedom",
    "Although the readings on the list were all interesting, I could see how some weeks, hundreds of pages was a lot. Perhaps mix up the syllabus to include items like TedTalks, YouTube videos, shorter articles, or more movies rather than predominantly large chunks of books (or scale down the chunks to the most important couple of pages). This would help with discussion participation and more people doing the \"meat\" of the readings.",
    "Very strong course. Well designed to facilitate student learning and highly engaging as well as informative and entertaining.",
    "The course did well in providing readings from a variety of perspectives. It could have provided more empirical evidence and insights from the market timing literature."

    "I really enjoyed this course. Before taking it, I was certainly a bit unsure whether or not the course would be heavily quant-driven and mathematic in nature, but it turned out to be a much more interesting weekly discussion of financial bubbles. The cases studied in the course are all very interesting and the professors take a lens-based approach to financial dynamics (i.e. political, social, psychological, biological, etc.) which keeps the course fresh throughout the semester. Readings were also wonderful--much more anecdotal than esoteric, and the three guest speakers were also amazing (David Swensen included). Beyond that, Professors Slifka and Mansharamani pose interesting discussion questions and seem genuinely interested in connecting with their students (be it for coursework help or just a friendly chat). Certainly one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely take this course. It takes something daunting like financial markets and boils it down to things anyone can understand. The discussions provided valuable insights into how other see the world. You will walk away with a new understanding of finance through different lenses.",
    "Definitely take this. One of the best classes i have ever taken",
    "Would recommend! Take if you're interested in going into finance, or are curious about markets in general. Readings ranging from econ papers to fund manager memos to watching the Big Short. David and Vikram are finance professionals teaching the course, which is a refreshingly different vibe than the usual Yale econ professor. Class will be a blast if the other people in the seminar are engaged. The last couple of weeks were just guest speakers (professional fund manager types) and class dinner afterwards. At least apply for this res college seminar and shop the first section.",
    "Highly recommended. Take it you want to really think about finance and if you're interested in learning more about finance from highly distinguished real world practitioners.",
    "This was an interesting course. I enjoyed discussing booms and busts."
