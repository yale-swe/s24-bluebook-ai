   "comments": [
    "Biotechnology and the Developing World is pretty much what the title suggests. We learned a lot about biotechnology and what the challenges are in implementing these solutions in a developing country. We discussed vaccines, clean water, prenatal care, incubators, ethics, etc...I would definitely take this course if you plan on doing work in developing countries or even just to see the differences between the US and developing countries.",
    "Biotech in the Developing World is a class designed to make you think and consider what needs to go into developing cheap, effective, appropriate biotechnologies for the developing world. It focuses on everything from how to get funding to how to modify machines like MRIs to how to keep things cold in a clinic with no consistent electricity. I would highly recommend it, as it's very interesting and applicable.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone interested in global health or the real life applications of biotechnology. The class was so interesting and I found myself excited to go each time. We talked about some foundational concepts in global health, had a variety of speakers who were all very engaging (which is often hard to say with guest speakers). This class was very manageable in terms of work, one midterm paper and one final paper where you get to choose a technology to present to the class. The best part about this class compared to other classes I have taken is that it is so relevant to anyone interested in field work related to global health where we talk about issues and possible solutions to problems people often encounter.",
    "A great introductory course on understanding the problems and situations that must be considered when implementing technology in resource poor settings."
