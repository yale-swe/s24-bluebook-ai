    "I have a huge problem with the professor not willing to teach the class before we do each pset. We are basically asked to learn the material on our own by reading the textbook, then complete the pset, then come to lecture to check our answers. I'm not denying the inherent rigor and reward in the process itself, but this is not what we come to college for. We learn more efficiently when someone else presents material to us in an organized fashion. It is the very purpose of having classes at all. We can learn by reading a textbook at home for free, without having to pay tuition to come here. This needs to change for the course to be effective at all.",
    "Great foundation in accounting! If you can call it a weakness, both the class and sections are SOM, and there are no sections. This makes getting help outside of class a bit of a chore. I generally don't enjoy going to sections; but they can be quite helpful, and in the case of this class, I think that a section would be. As someone who had never taken accounting before, I found the learning curve to be steep, and having an extra time to meet and go over things would probably help a lot of people.",
    "This was a great course to take Credit\/D\/Fail since its structure (homework due and graded every class) means you can't slack off. So I still learned everything. That being said, grading seemed very harsh and occasionally unfair, so not sure if I'd feel so positively about it if I had been taking it for a grade.",
    "Interesting material, fair homework, horrible lectures.",
    "more interesting class, if thats even possible... There was no reason to go to class, you could teach yourself when you did the homework.",
    "The flipped classroom method for this class wasn't particularly helpful, especially since many of the problems in the psets can only be properly solved by seeing an example beforehand. Prof. Garstka was generous about giving us credit if our answers were logical though.",
    "the teaching style was really hard and discouraging -- we would not be taught a concept, be expected to learn it on our own and do homework for it, and then were graded not on completion but very harshly on how well we understood it. It would've been much more productive to have been taught a concept in class, and then apply it for homework. I constantly felt like I was reteaching myself things incorrectly, and always felt behind because we wouldn't go over the previous concept in class very well.",
    "The problem sets that were due every lecture were good to keep us engaged with the topic, but they were graded too harshly in my opinion, especially since they were only out of 3 points. And because of how numerous and frequent the problem sets were, the TAs could not possibly answer all our questions always in time.",
    "The class is demanding and requires a lot of practice-- this is really the only way to \"learn the language\" of accounting. I did indeed get a lot out of the practice and the course. The self-teaching style of the class was frustrating at times, however. Students were expected to teach themselves the material, complete the problem sets and then come to class the next day to be retaught the material properly.",
    "I thought that this was a very well taught class. The homework was a little challenging for someone who did not have any background in economics\/accounting."

    "Don't take it Prof Garstka. I have a huge problem with the professor not willing to teach the class before we do each pset. We are basically asked to learn the material on our own by reading the textbook, then complete the pset, then come to lecture to check our answers. I'm not denying the inherent rigor and reward in the process itself, but this is not what we come to college for. We learn more efficiently when someone presents material to us in an organized fashion. We can learn by reading a textbook at home for free, without having to pay tuition to come here. This needs to change for the course to be effective at all. Find a class in which the prof is willing to teach. You don't deserve to pay thousands of dollars to come here to learn accounting all on your own.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely not.",
    "Yes. I would caution that it is quite a bit of work early on if you are unfamiliar with accounting (And by this, I don't mean just knowing the fundamental accounting identity - I mean knowing the nitty-gritty of doing journal entries, putting together indirect cash flow statements, etc.) However, if you put in the work, it's really worth it. You will look back and be surprised and proud of all you have learned.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you're taking it as a Credit\/D\/Fail. Like I said, there was enough work (and harsh enough grading) that I think it would have been very unpleasant if I had to worry about my grades. But definitely take it in some way if you're going to be working in finance.",
    "Take this course if you want a basic introduction to accounting and finance. Definitely start it Credit\/D. The lectures are boring (and at 8:45am at SOM) but you can easily teach yourself the material from home.",
    "It is important to take accounting if you want to understand the innerworkings of many business decisions so this can be as valuable of a class as you want it to be.",
    "I would only recommend this class depending on what you want from it. It's a fairly easy class, but you have to keep up with the readings and psets regularly. Lectures aren't usually necessary, but Prof. Garstka is a great teacher\/person which made me want to wake up at 8:45am and hike to SOM. You learn how to make\/analyze financial statements at an admittedly slow pace, but I thought the information was valuable. Check the syllabus to see if it's for you.",
    "There were problem sets due every single lecture, which weighed a lot on my schedule. But otherwise it was a helpful and hands-on class where you actually did learn how to prepare and analyze financial statements by the end of the class.",
    "Take it Credit D, but it is a must take. Professor Garstka is a legend who teaches a no nonsense style of accounting and actually makes sure you learn the material. It's more work than I had for many classes I took for a grade, but this is a basic life skill you should know and Professor Garstka makes sure to emphasize just how many real life applications there are.",
    "If you are willing to put in the work and are genuinely interested in the subject matter, take this course. If you are credit d-ing the course, you will be very frustrated given the amount of time the p-sets require.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in business."
