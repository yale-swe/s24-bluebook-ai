    "Great ready for long long long hours. I have pulled more all nighters for this class than in any other class combined.",
    "One of the better\/more interesting mechanical engineering courses at Yale. Madhu is great. Prior experience working with electronics of with coding in assembly\/C\/Arduino sketch highly recommended. This is a class for people who enjoy tinkering.",
    "Can be a lot of work with the lab reports but overall this class will teach you more about practical engineering (specifically on the EE side) than almost any other. You'll struggle through some of the labs but ultimately come out the other side with a solid understanding of the principles covered and how to implement them in the real world.",
    "A cool class, but the labs are not always a very good use of your time. The professor said the class would be front heavy in terms of workload and then get easier later on, but this was not at all the case! The last day of class was a final test, the next Monday was the final robot competition, and then the last day of reading period had both a homework due and also the final lab report on the robot entered in the competition. It was a humongous amount of work to get the robot ready for the competition. Although the ideas is that you are building up the robot piece by piece through the semester in the labs, the reality is that you don't really do anything practical with the labs until the very last one. To get the robot ready for the competition, there isn't any instruction, either. We are just supposed to figure it out. This would have been fine if we had been allowed more time to get ready for it, but we were given just as much time as any of the trivial labs that came before (i.e. not enough time at all!). Homeworks and tests were simple. The labs took up a lot of time, and most of them were trivial and I didn't really learn very much from them. I wish we had been doing things with actual robots since the beginning of the semester instead of waiting until the robot competition to actually have a robot!",
    "If you have to take it because of ABET, then bite the bullet and expect a lot of work. You'll learn a lot but you'll also spend an inordinate amount of time on this class. If you're not ABET, then only take this class if you have some time on your hands and you're really interested.",
    "This is a fair amount of work but it's a really fun class and You'll learn a lot too.",
    "Mechatronics is a fine course, but with it's annoyances. While the final project is interesting and applied, the amount of work is easily that of two classes combined. With midterms, problem sets, and labs throughout the semester, there are weeks when the amount of work due is excessive. Expect to spend many hours beyond the 3 scheduled lab hours each week trying to just finish the lab, and then beyond that writing the lab report. You receive only minimal instructions on the lab, and for the most part are expected to teach yourself everything. It's difficult to prepare for the lab beforehand by reading relevant reference material because the lab handouts aren't posted until a few minutes before the lab, meaning you spend most of the lab time reading and understanding while attempting to do the lab. Also, the concepts that you learn in class, while somewhat interesting, for the most part do not actually relate to the labs in any applicable way.",
    "If a student is significantly interested in simple robotics, learning how to control a system with multiple sensors and coding in Arduino sketch or Assembly this class is great. If this class is not required for a MENG student then don't take unless you are like the description above.",
    "MENG 390 is a fantastic class. The course is essentially electrical engineering for mechanical engineers, but the crossover between these disciplines is definitely beneficial for all students. Madhu is an incredible instructor, and the labs culminating in the contest at the end of the term are very rewarding.",
    "Almost guaranteed you have to take it for ABET, so buckle up.",
    "I would recommend it for a fellow student who already has some background using assembly and arduino sketch and is willing to devote significant time and mental energy to this class.",
    "A phenomenal class. Would highly recommend this class for EEs and people majoring in other engineering programs as well. Madhu is very passionate about the course and makes it a lot of fun. Labs can be really tough, without much direction given.",
    "This is easily one of the hardest mechanical engineering courses out there. But if you're interested in robotics and designing\/building complex systems, this class is incredibly interesting at every turn. The level of difficulty is definitely worth it.",
    "Don't take this course unless its for your major. If you have electrical engineering experience, it'll be a hell of a lot easier for you. If you're like me and just have a mech. eng. background, you might have a REALLY HARD time. My partner and I spent HUGE swaths of time on the lab work, fixing issues, reading online resources, troubleshooting circuits, etc. The lab reports and problem sets are reasonable, but the lab sessions themselves are the most frustrating labs I have ever had to do. They were horrid. The philosophy of the labs is that you should figure things out yourself instead of having things taught to you. This can be SO frustrating, holy sh*****t! By the end of the semester, my lab partner and I wouldn't even try to finish the lab work during the three hours allotted. We knew we couldn't figure it out in that time. We knew we would have to come back the next week to work more. And that is really, really disheartening. That's kinda the theme of these labs: \"disheartening.\" You work for hours, and feel like your getting nowhere.",
    "Very demanding engineering course that meshes EE and ME. It is very rewarding, but you have to be up for the challenge."
