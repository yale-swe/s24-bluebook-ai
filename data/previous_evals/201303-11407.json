    "It was a good class to get a look into African-American theater. The class covered a good range of topics and themes.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. This is an important theatrical tradition that demands our attention. The readings are fantastic and the discussion is usually on point.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar. This semester's syllabus included some pretty intense and bizarre plays, but the heart of the class were the many fantastic in-depth discussions. It's a class that totally depends on who's in the room and, for the most part, everyone was really engaged with the material and were able to provide a range of perspectives and experiences with various subject matters and performance styles. It's definitely predominantly a literary approach to the plays (which worked for me as an English major), but there are opportunities to perform and to attend theatre in the class. Not much guidance or structure for the papers, though, which could have been better.",
    "An exploration of African American Theater from the 1960s onward. I would recommend the course because you read very interesting texts and its interesting to situate them based on political and aesthetic agenda."
