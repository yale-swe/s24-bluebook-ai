    "yes, if you want to read academic papers that you may not have been introduced to.",
    "Really wonderful class! It's structured so that you read a couple economics papers on a particular topic (retirement, health, savings, elder care, etc.) each week, and then in class there's a fairly structured discussion with people presenting the papers, or leading discussions on the topics, or something. Professor McKee is absolutely wonderful--he knows the subject really well, is incredibly engaging and funny, and cares a lot about whether students learn the concepts. He has a great feel for how well the class is learning, and knows a ton about any topic that may come up. I've rarely seen a professor so able to keep students engaged in the material.It's the first economics class at Yale I've taken that was both not purely theoretical, but that also felt like we were treating the world in an economically sophisticated way (usually, i feel like it's one or the other). More important than the topics themselves, in my opinion, is the opportunity to learn how to apply theoretical frameworks and econometric research techniques to answering real world problems--you come out of this class much better prepared to ask and answer a variety of questions outside of aging itself and even outside of areas you think of as traditionally economic. The major assignment for the class is formulating a research proposal, which isn't too hard but I think ends up teaching you far more than a normal economics paper (you propose a model and empirical approach and actually get in the mindset of a researcher).One of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Absolutely. One of the best senior seminars here. The readings are usually pretty interesting and the workload isn't bad. Prof. McKee gives you a lot of help with the final paper, which requires you to come up with an economic model of your own. I wish more seminars were taught like this one.",
    "You get back what you put into this seminar. I would recommend it because it has a great syllabus, but it is very self-motivated and self-directed.",
    "Great seminar, highly recommended",
    "yes, you should take this class even if you're only mildly interested in the topic, as i was. you will learn: how to read an economics paper, how to formulate a research question, write an economic model and an empirical model (and the difference between the two!), and basically, you will realize how difficult doing research is. workload isn't bad at all- like most classes, you get out of it what you put in.",
    "Read 2-3 papers each week and fill out worksheets summarizing them. Complete a paper proposal throughout the semester where Doug walks through each student. You have to also present one of the weeks papers. The topic is not the most interesting, but Doug makes it fun and much more enjoyable than you think it would be. Definitely take this class because of Doug.",
    "I recommend taking Econ 466. The class is incredibly fun and interactive. The readings can get a little long and vary in the level of difficult, but overall I left this class knowing a lot more than I previously had. Finally, the final project is challenging, but can be very rewarding if you put a lot of time into it.",
    "This is the only course I've taken at Yale that actually teaches you how to read\/write an economic research paper and how to think of research questions in terms of theoretical models and empirical approaches -- I would recommend this course and Professor McKee on this point alone. The material is also extremely interesting and relevant.",
    "Definitely take this class, if you can get in. Prof. McKee is easily one of, if not the best professor in the Econ department. The material is interesting and Prof. McKee does a fantastic job of explaining material. Very engaging classes.",
    "Take it if you're genuinely interested in economics and the society.",
    "It's a great senior seminar. The topic is incredibly important given the rapidly aging population in the U.S. and in other countries abroad. Professor McKee is also pretty much the greatest professor ever. He's a fantastic teacher and structures the course really well. I have no complaints whatsoever about the class, it was one of my favorite classes this semester. If you can get in, take it.",
    "Great class. A really good senior seminar that teaches you how to read real econ research papers. The topic is also super interesting- I didn't think I'd be interested, but it was actually really important material that was engaging.",
    "Interesting material and fun class",
    "Great course filled with lots of primary literature reading, really expands knowledge of academic economics, economic modeling, and how research is done."
