   "comments": [
    "This is a strong introduction to some puzzling but essential texts from the Chinese tradition. Classroom discussion ranged from quite strong and compelling to somewhat ineffectual, often given the nature of the text of the week. Professor El Amine is sharp and very helpful and available for students having difficulties crafting arguments for papers.",
    "I really liked the class, it really pushes you to think about specific political issues in ancient chinese texts as well as the compatibility of ancient chinese thought with the western tradition.",
    "Regardless of previous exposure, if you have interest in the material - definitely do. Strong discussion element and structured but accessible treatment of texts.",
    "It's a great course to introduce one to a more eastern philosophy course rather than traditional western philosophy taught at schools. There is a fair amount of reading but overall it is really interesting.",
    "Yes! Fascinating class with a very reasonable workload. Great introduction to Chinese political philosophy and its vagaries. Wonderful professor, interesting readings, and great discussions if you have a good set of kids.",
    "Yes, if you like discuss political thought (i.e., a lot of highly idealistic and abstract ideas!) that is specifically Chinese. Don't take it if you think this is going to be a history class or something of that nature. We almost always talk about politics and government. In some classes, like the class on Mao's early political thought, we talked about some Chinese history to give us better historical background on Mao and his time period, but that was about as far as we got into discussing history. Still take the class!",
    "Yes - the texts are interesting and are thematically well-connected. You end up having a breadth of knowledge about the canon of Chinese political thought. Prof. El Amine is a good discussion leader.",
    "Recommend! You'll learn so much. Even if ancient Chinese philosophy doesn't seem relevant to you, you'd be surprised how relevant it is in understanding East Asia today.",
    "Not sure--see what else you have in your schedule, but am glad to have read the texts we read, and El Amine is very sharp."
