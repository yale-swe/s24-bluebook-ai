    "I enjoyed (yes, I used the word \"enjoyed\") it much more than gen chem, believe it or not. It's actually interesting stuff, but it's also true that it's really difficult (but you know that already). Ziegler is great if you go to office hours (oh how many hours I spent in there). Lectures follow closely with the text. You don't need me to recommend or not recommend- you're going to take it regardless.",
    "If you have a major that needs it take it. Its kind of fun at times in a puzzle solving kind of way. That being said it is fairly difficult and requires quite some time commitment.",
    "If you're taking this class, you are either pre-med or you a future scientist. Either way, you probably have to take it. It's very difficult and demoralizing. Studying doesn't really pay off, and your hard work will go largely unrewarded. You have to do it though, so whatever.",
    "its honestly not that bad, (though be ready to put in about 10 hours a week every single week), skip lecture the week of the midterms and study till 6am and make sure you go to the math science tutors for psets\/midterms",
    "Great class. I enjoyed it a lot. It might be a bit difficult for people who aren't chemistry-oriented (I'll probably be majoring in chem and physics.).",
    "I mean only people who have to take are gonna take it so whether or not it's a great class is somewhat irrelevant. It's not fun but it's doable.",
    "My quality of life declined palpably as a result of taking this course. Problem sets actually caused me physical discomfort. Ziegler is an awful lecturer. He jumps around a lot, he's never clear, he never gives you any reason to be interested in the material. Problem sets were graded stupidly (only one problem out of five gets graded per set!) Take it with a different professor or don't take it at all. If you must take it, try to review a little every day. It actually does help. Good luck.",
    "It is a difficult course but can be done with a lot of extra work",
    "Take it if you need to. the only positive thing about this class is that you take it with a lot of people and friends, and you're all in this together trying to work the problems out. a bit disorganized though, and lectures hardly helped",
    "If its not a requirement dont take it. It will rule your life (sadly...) But its not AS horrible as everyone makes it out to be... just very hard.",
    "My advice to anyone who is considering taking this class: Unless you are absolutely required to do so, do not take this class. Professor Ziegler is not a good instructor, the tests and problem sets are torturous, and you will hate this class by the end of it. The professor is sneaky and condescending, but his lectures are unfocused and confusing. If you can take this course with a different professor, do it that way. Otherwise you will just have to get through it.",
    "Here's the deal with Ziegler: he knows what he's doing, but is not a good intro class lecturer. He's fascinated with the intricacies and exceptions to the rules of orgo, but the problem is that we're still learning the rules!In retrospect, organic chem is a really neat subject and gets much more manageable with time; the problem is how fast Ziegler moves and what he expects us to be able to do. Be ready to put a lot of time into this class, read the book before lecture if possible, and know that it's just one class.",
    "Not the funnest class ever, but if you like chemistry, or am taking it for premed requirements, it's not that terrible of a course. I think organic gets a bad rep, but as long as you keep up, it's not impossible.",
    "Sucks but you probably are not taking this for fun anyways. Ziegler's lectures are fairly useless; you're better off getting a tutor and going to the orgo help sessions\/reading the book on your own.",
    "Orgo is fantastic! Hahaha no. If you're taking this class for pre-med and\/or major requirements, you don't really have a choice. That said, the lecture is excruciatingly boring, the problem sets take way too long if you can't make giant intellectual leaps from what you learn in class, and the exams are long but fair. You'll survive, but it probably won't be fun. Don't procrastinate, and study with friends!",
    "Chem 220 is a very difficult, very poorly taught class. Unless you have to take this for your major or for premed requirements or you really love chemistry, stay far away from this course. If you do have to take this class, try your best to stay on top of the reading and start your problem sets early! The weekly psets are always tricky and difficult, so get with a group of friends to work on or check the psets... it will not only help you get more of the right answers, but it will help keep you sane. Don't hesitate to go to office hours or get a tutor if you need help, but be prepared to still be wildly lost until you've devoted hours and hours to going over the concepts.",
    "It was fun at times, but A LOT of work with really high standards.It doesn't really matter if I recommend it because everybody who takes this class has to take it as a requirement.",
    "Orgo is not nearly as horrible as it's generally made out to be. As long as one understands the chemistry behind each of the reactions presented, remembering the reactions isn't an intense exercise in memorization. Ziegler seemed quite good at introducing and explaining concepts (for the 4 lectures I ended up going to), but going to class is for the most part unnecessary, since the book isjust as good.",
    "Don't take it unless it's required. And for pre-med students, since you have to take it, you've just got to suck it up. Expect to be frustrated, even if you're putting in a lot of effort. It's one of those classes where, no matter how hard you try, it's just going to be difficult. One helpful thing though, is that Ziegler puts up lots of old practice exams and psets.Go to the tutors!!! Carly - the tutor in Trumbull - is great! Towards the end of the year, everyone found out about her, and we could barely fit in the room. She went through all the problems on the pset in a very clear, logical way. I wouldn't recommend going to her without doing the pset at all though. I'd try to attempt them all, and do as much as possible, and then going her to check and get the rest of the answers. It honestly makes no sense to spend 10 hours on a pset to get it all wrong. Especially when it only counts for 1% of your grade.",
    "Huh. Well, this wasn't the worst course ever... I mean, it's not THAT bad. This course requires A LOT of memorization and reading. But once you get used to it, it isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I would recommend not taking it unless you are premed or need to take it as a major requirement. If you want to be adventurous and take it anyway, good luck.",
    "Lots of work and time. Most of the learning happens on your own so you need to read the textbook and go to the tutor\/ ta.",
    "Organic chem is difficult. You already knew that. You're taking it because you're pre-med or need it for your major. Be aware that Yale orgo is more difficult than at most schools, and a lot of students find that the lectures aren't helpful. My advice: don't get behind on the reading, don't blow off the first exam, and use office hours. That being said, look back over the semester, the material is actually very interesting and I feel like I've learned a lot.",
    "It is a time consuming, challenging, and a competitive science class. It takes a lot of independent learning and you need to have the patience to spend lots of time if you want to do well. I would recommend it because I feel like I've learned a lot over the semester and all of the material is relevant to medicine.",
    "Obviously it's a tough class, but I found the information interesting. It's really rewarding and actually fun to work through the problems once you get the hang of it.",
    "Orgo is a tough course but if you study and read the book you will do fine.",
    "This has been, by far, the least enjoyable class that I have taken at Yale. It should say something about how miserable it was that only an average of 70 students came to each class when there were actually over 180 students in the class. It is so much material that gets covered so quickly, and then you are tested on the most specific things that you learned, instead of understanding overall concepts. Overall just the worst experience of my Yale career. Only take this class if you are premed. If you are premed, think long and hard before taking this class whether medicine is really what you want to do.",
    "You probably have to take this if you are pre-med. try to not take it with ziegler though. hard tests, hard problem sets, bad lectures.",
    "It's organic chemistry, you probably have to take it anyways. If you study and try (to understand, not just memorize), you will be fine.",
    "No. But if you have to take it, you will.",
    "If you are taking this class, you are probably premed, but luckily Professor Zeigler is a great professor and--assuming that you learn all the material sufficiently--you should do great. MAKE SURE YOU GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!",
    "unless you have to take it don't",
    "It's so much as hard as it is hard work. You need to be on top of your crap for this class or you're screwed.",
    "so this is a frustrating class, but only because it demands so much time to do well. you do learn a TON of orgo, and people bond due to communal misery. i wouldnt recommend it unless you're pre-med.",
    "Lots of work and thinking, but in the end you'll feel quite accomplished. Definitely learned a lot.",
    "It is organic chemistry, it is hard! And if you do not have take it with Professor Ziegler, try taking it with another professor. Lots of studying and out of class time required to fully understand the material.",
    "Do not take this course for fun. It requires a serious commitment.",
    "You need to learn the material yourself and depend on learning material outside of lecture. Every exam gets harder. Start the semester strong.",
    "ONLY TAKE IT IF YOU HAVE TO. SERIOUSLY. Ziegler's not a great professor. Definitely make use of the residential college science tutors Yale provides. Really just a struggle of a class to get through.",
    "If you're premed or MCDB, you really have no choice.Ziegler's lectures were very hard to follow and disorganized, so we had to rely on the residential college tutors to teach us. I think it says something about his class when 60-70 kids had to cram into each of the tutor's sessions each week in order to do the problem sets. Many of us thought that he didn't provide us with a lot of the tools to be able to do the psets.His notes weren't very helpful so most of us didn't look at his notes to study but read our textbooks instead.",
    "Orgo is like a giant puzzle. If you put the time into it, it will pay off.",
    "Orgo isn't as bad as people always talk it up to be. If you don't have time in your schedule to do practice problems and then more practice problems, don't take it, you'll only be cramming right before exams and won't do as well. Prof. Ziegler is not a good lecturer, his lectures do not make sense and that's why most people didn't come to class after awhile. He is a nice man, but his classes need to be more structured. I went to class but didn't learn anything - I learned from reading the book and doing practice problems.",
    "I am not even sure what to say. Yale has messed up. It is so sad that we are some of the brightest kids in the world and we struggle so much because we have a very poor organic chemistry professor. The averages on the three exams this semester were 85, 64, and 57. This doesn't necessarily have to be the case.Ziegler really knows his stuff, that's for sure, but he is a very poor explainer. How can you not write meaningful notes on the board in an organic chemistry lecture? What happens to all the people who are not auditory, but visual learners?! I am a visual learner and his spoken lectures (with very little use of the blackboard) went in one ear and out the other. I learned nothing from lecture. The bulk of the work that I did for this class was at home with my textbook, but the textbook wasn't even that good. It omits many important mechanisms that you have to scramble around to get from your TAs or online. Although this is a mandatory class for most people, I don't think that should be a reason for Yale to neglect selecting a good professor.It was very hard for me to deal with his inadequacy as a teacher because I have done a lot of work teaching and tutoring, and am a very effective tutor, as shown by the results my tutees get. Being a good explainer myself, I constantly wished that someone had just instructed him on how to proficiently explain concepts, so they wouldn't be lost upon his audience.",
    "Try not to take it with Ziegler. Not a good intro orgo professor. Many good for upper level classes but not orgo.",
    "its is very hard and a lot of work",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to!!!",
    "Take it if you need it, or are very interested. You WILL learn organic chemistry, this is not a halfway class. Mangeable, but know what you are getting into and come prepared for a semester of commitment.",
    "Orgo is not as bad as it is made out to be. It is very clear in stating what you need to know and the concepts themselves aren't that bad. just practice. Go to review sessions. Go to math\/science tutors for problem sets. Go to office hours whenever possible.",
    "Obviously if you have to take it as a requirement, then you have to take it, but this class is not well taught. Try to focus on the material, which is actually very interesting, and not the flaws in the course.",
    "Orgo is hard. Ziegler is prob not the best professor to take it with. I've heard really good things about Spiegel and Herzon (from friends) and about Miller (from other reviews). I ended up deciding at the end of September that the extra 1-2 hours of sleep every Sun Tues or Thurs night was more important to me than going to lecture. I basically stopped going to lecture and talked to other friends who did the same and other friends who continued going. Basically the consensus was that (at least with Ziegler) his lecture didn't help at all. It was impossible to copy down everything he writes, it was impossible to even understand what he was talking about because he presented the material conversationally while jotting down notes on the board (rather than systematically and in an organized way on the board). I really don't see how someone could enjoy his lecture unless they are a super chem nerd with a particularly good chem background or passion. However, if you're stuck with this class, make sure you make use of the chem tutors (Carly the trumbull tutor is really good). It took me until about half the semester (which is when the material got really hard that it wasn't worth trying to tackle the psets on my own anymore), to realize how amazing going to the tutor is. Try to make it a habit to go earlier in the week, rather than Sunday night, which is the day before psets are due. Sunday night sessions are really crowded and it can be annoying if you have to rewrite your notes\/answers, because that can easily turn into an all nighter. Another tip would be to make youre own study sheets of reactions (you will know what this term refers to, about halfway into the semester). THE VERY MOMENT YOU LEARN A REACTION, ADD IT ONTO YOUR OWN ORGANIZED LIST. Tests are hard, but that's unavoidable. The third midterm had a mean of 55 out of 100, the high score was a 97. There's no escape, so just brace yourself, and do your best to use the tutors and stay organized. I personally didn't go to lecture, and didn't do the readings until very late in the semester, and it is still possible to do well. However, I would recommend staying on top of the readings at least. Lecture with Ziegler is actually expendable.It's frustrating to think that other schools may have much easier orgo classes, because at times you think that they might be learning their material much much better than you, just because everything is so hard, and you have to spend sooo much time on Ziegler's psets. It seems as though a priority of the course (either the Professor or the chem department) is to make a good grade distribution, rather than for everyone to understand organic chemistry, which is unfortunate. I honestly don't see harm in making the class more manageable and having many grades near the top, as long as they really deserve it. I don't think it is worth it to make the tests impossible, just so that you can separate the very TOP few, who have already taken orgo somewhere else, or are chem geniuses, or work in orgo labs.",
    "Organic chemistry is admittedly a class often taken as a requirement, either for a major (or pre-professional requirements). That being said, however, CHEM 220 is often what you make of it. Students typically find the first exam to be pretty easy (mostly review of gen chem and basic concepts that build off of it). The most difficult part is often understanding (as opposed to memorizing) the basic mechanisms of reactions in organic chemistry. Taking this class is like learning a language; although initially everything is foreign, once the fundamentals are in place, succeeding is primarily a matter of being able to fit all the pieces together.",
    "Take it if you have to. The textbook is your friend.",
    "Professor did not take an active role in presenting material to students in a way that could be internalized and learned. However, through group study sessions, working with my Math and Science tutor, and many hours of outside-the-classroom learning, I got a grasp of the material. This course requires you take initiative to learn and apply the material presented in class, which I suppose is a valuable skill. The professor ought to be more in tune\/sensitive to his student's needs and spend lecture time going over concepts and mechanisms that are difficult to his students.",
    "Chem 220 is basic organic chem, but be prepared to study a lot of reactions.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!!",
    "Depends. I would take this only if Prof. Ziegler were not teaching. He was nice and helpful only if you went to office hours. Other than that, the lectures were completely useless and extremely disorganized. The problem sets were IMPOSSIBLE and a complete pain. Weekends would be consumed with hours upon hours of organic chemistry homework. Sunday nights would consist of scrambling through campus looking for someone who might have the answer to question number 7 that not even the residential college tutors were able to do. The tests were hard but not totally unfair. I would study A LOT for tests 2 and 3 because the difficulty level of the class skyrockets once you start doing reactions. If you have to take this class with Ziegler, be prepared for a tough semester. Good luck.",
    "You have to for premed, which is awful. If you can, avoid Ziegler at all costs. He is a relic. The chem department can't kick him out of his office because they have too much space.",
    "If you need to take the course, take it. If you're taking it for fun, you're crazy to be taking it with a class full of people who have to take it.",
    "Orgo gets a bad rep, and although I can see why it would, it really shouldn't. I went in thinking it was going to be the hardest, worst class ever and it was going to consume all my time and rob me of my soul, but it turned out to be one of my favorite classes, if not my favorite, this semester and so far at Yale! There are SO many great resources on the website that are very helpful and the material is really interesting if you try to understand the mechanisms and reactions as opposed to just memorizing what they do. It's all a big logic puzzle so if you like problem-solving, you'll LOVE Orgo! The problem sets aren't all that bad, and the exams are definitely doable. The only issue is the time constraints, but even that isn't that bad. I came into Orgo from CHEM 112-113 and having never taken Chem in high school and walked up bruise-free and really happy; it actually helped me realize I might want to do something with pharmacology just so I can synthesize molecules and deal with reactions like the ones you learn in class. So please, don't be terrified of Orgo! It's really feasible! It will require effort on your part; doing all the practice exams is REALLY helpful and as long as you practice regularly instead of doing it all the week before the exam, you should be fine and you might actually enjoy it! Cramming and memorizing everything will make it stressful. Also, make use of office hours! Prof. Ziegler loves regular visitors (although, be warned he might ask you to answer questions in class once he learns your name). Also, if you can, try to get a section with Patrick McEnaney. Sections aren't required, but Patrick is GREAT! He's really knowledgeable, and very helpful! You're probably taking this class because you have to, but if you don't have to (like me), I still recommend Orgo :) It was a great class; I really enjoyed it, and several of my friends did as well! It all depends on your attitude and work ethic, but if you put in the effort, it'll be painless and well worth it.",
    "don't take it if you don't have to. (premeds, i am sorry). find study buddies and go to the help sessions.",
    "Chemistry 220 is a comprehensive introductory course for organic chemistry. The class size is quite large, but the instructor really took care to answer individual questions after class and to have long office hours for students who were interested in help. I would recommend the course to other students interested in the fundamentals of organic chemistry and who are interested in exploring the different fields of chemistry.",
    "A very challenging course, certainly the hardest I have taken at Yale so far. I have never had to spend so much time studying for any other class as I did for orgo. Definitely do a lot of problems, not just from the textbook, but also old problem sets and exams!",
    "Orgo is super cool. Take it. Use the tutors for the psets. Go to office hours and section. Do the practice tests.",
    "Good introduction to organic chemistry. Everyone complains about the class, but honestly if you keep up with the material, it's not difficult to do well. Sometimes lectures can be a bit confusing, but the book is great at explaining concepts. The practice exams are also extremely helpful because the same types of questions are repeated on exams.",
    "I would recommend this class, b\/c I think I have learned a lot. When they do take this class, remember to go around and find the best TA and go to his section.",
    "Not as bad as many of the premeds say. If you take the time to review on your own (read the text book and understand the reactions) then you should be just fine.",
    "Take it if you have a peculiar fascination with organic chemistry or need it as a requirement.",
    "If you do not have to take this class, don't. If you do, I have thisto say: Organic chemistry is fun if you like problem-solving and have a good spatial sense. For instance, I am good at rotating objects in my mind and this paid off incredibly throughout this course. However, even if you like organic chemistry my guess is that you will hate this class. Frederick Ziegler makes it painful, by not posting answers to practice tests online, and never giving enough time on tests. Be prepared to struggle and get lower grades than you have on any other test at Yale. Then watch as the curve magically transforms your grade from a D to a B! Essentially, this class is frustrating at all times, no matter how much you love the subject. Also - be prepared to never go to class. 9 AM at the top of science hill? Yeah, don't kid yourself.",
    "Grading is a bit unfair; the averages of our three midterms were 86, 49, and 57, respectively, which doesn't indicate that we were either over-prepared or not particularly well-prepared for what the professor expected us to know on any given material. Also, section grades are curved across all sections, and some TAs are much harder graders than others.But, you gotta do it for Pre-Med, so suck it up.",
    "It is a difficult class with a lot of material, but if you put in the time, it is manageable.",
    "This course is undoubtedly difficult, but the material is interesting. Try to get a good TA, because that makes a big difference.",
    "Hard class. Keep up with the work, and DO THE PRACTICE TESTS. While no answers are provided, the same things pop up on every test. Do NOT take this class for fun, but if you have to take it, make the most out of it because it is interesting. Ziegler is a little unorganized, so pay attention during class so you know what is going on. Go to the review sessions as that is the only way you will get answers to the practice tests.",
    "Oh Orgo. If you're reading this review I'm assuming you need this either for your major or for pre-med requirements. And you'll be happy to know that orgo won't actually ruin your life like everyone wants you to believe. Yeah, you have to put in more work than an average class, but if you do the work and use your resources you should be okay. Ziegler is alright, though I missed quite a few lectures. Now, assuming you have no choice and are going to take this class no matter what, I'll give you advice rather than a review. 1. Take the first midterm seriously. The material isn't that hard, so the average will be higher than the other midterms. But at the end of the year, Zeigler takes your two highest RAW scores for your final grade. In other words, your first midterm grade will count. 2. USE THE TUTORS. Our residential college tutor was an absolute godsend when it came to weekly problem sets. 3. Form a study group. This class would have sucked if I was going through it alone. 4. Go to office hours. Zeigler is actually really helpful when you go to talkto him. 5. GOOD LUCK!",
    "Organic Chemistry is a brutal and stressful course. Avoid the class unless absolutely required for your major or premed track. The material is very interesting and engaging, but the demands of the course make for a tough workload and a tough semester.",
    "You learn organic chemistry, it is tough and not very exciting. But what you need out of this course.",
    "It's a tough course but manageable if you put in the required work.",
    "Only take it if you have to. It's a very difficult class and involves a lot of work.",
    "Do not take this class unless you are sure you need to, or if you have a strong background in chemistry. I actually would have found the material interesting had it not been so overwhelmingly difficult and frustrating. Ziegler teaches to the orgo stars and nobody else, so don't expect lecture to make ANY sense unless you've already studied what he is covering. Falling behind is incredibly easy.",
    "Difficult - only take it if you have to.",
    "Wellll, yes. I know for you premeds\/ majority of sciences majors it's a prereq, but I have been so bold as to recommend this class to friends of mine. Am I crazy? Perhaps a little. But I must say that I have truly enjoyed the class.To summarize, you go through standard 1st semseter orgo...with the super suped-up Yale curriculum of course. It is tough. Well, I'd say more time-consuming that tough but you can very well say that it's both. You have a problem set every week, 3 midterms (1 dropped), and the final. You learn a lot very quickly so you should keep up with the work. Time is the most important thing.So I know most of you are reading this to find out how to do well in the class, so this is my recommendation: Read the textbook and know the mechanisms well, get and read the Orgo as a second language book, in class focus more on taking notes than learning the material then and there, go to Ziegler's office hours, and go to a tutor. If you do these things and put in the time, you'll probably get an A\/A-. Good luck!",
    "A really hard class that you should probably only take as a requirement, but that you might discover is actually kind of enjoyable if you appreciate the challenge of problem solving.",
    "Great course. If you put in the effort upfront you will reap the rewards. Very relevant to life, albeit at a molecular level. Definitely recommended.Also, FEZ is the best! His office hours were extremely helpful throughout the year, but especially before finals. He seems to really care about his students, as evidenced by his ability to remember a student's name and something unique about him\/her after just the first meeting. He also went out of his way to make himself available for office hours (often 4-5 hours every other day). I only wish I had more time during the semester to go to all of them!",
    "This was my least favorite class of my Yale career so far. If you don't have to take this class for your major\/premed requirements, don't. Ziegler is a terrible, terrible professor and sucks the joy out of what is actually an interesting subject. Take the class with another professor if at all possible. The problem sets are long and difficult, and often involve concepts you've barely covered in class. I learned more from my TA than Ziegler. If you have to take the class, just resign yourself to a long and hard semester. Form study groups with your friends and go to the residential college tutors for help on your p-sets. Don't try to cram for the midterms because there is too much material. It's not easy to get through the class, but you can do it. If nothing else, you will bond with the other 180+ students suffering with you.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to or are somehow genuinely interested in organic chemistry. You have to commit almost 100% to this class at times (especially near the end).",
    "It's Organic Chemistry I. Most of you are premed and most of you are going to hate it. If you don't whine to much and you work hard, I'm sure you'll do fine. To those of you who aren't premed or who are actually interested in the material, it's a good class, the material is interesting, and it's not too hard. Find people to go over the problem sets with. Ziegler's lectures are ok, especially if you've actually done the reading in advance, which I mostly didn't. He's incredibly helpful in office hours.",
    "If you're taking it, you probably have to take it anyways. It's a challenging subject and one that you need to put considerable time in. Problem sets are doable, but the material on the whole requires a fair amount of dedication. The material is interesting, but dry at times; professor tries to make it somewhat more interesting than it is. The average my year ended up being a B\/B+. You're going to read more scathing reviews I'm sure, but don't take them too seriously. Good luck;know that it's a necessary evil. Just suck it up, study, and you'll be fine.",
    "The first part of the class is actually the conceptual part - and that can be a bit more difficult that you'd think. Then, orgo becomes much more logical, and easier to handle if you put in the effort needed (though still a lot of work). Take advantage of Professor Ziegler's previous exams online, and\/or go to a tutor. Most importantly, don't hesitate to seek help early if you need it! You will regret it later on if you tried to go at it by yourself and end up struggling.",
    "It might be a hard course but if you read the textbook throughly and work on the old exams. There is no way to fell this course.It is better to read the chapter that the lecture is covering prior to the lecture.",
    "Orgo is not as bad as it is made out to be. It can even be sort of fun, if you look at the problems like puzzles.Lecture was pretty awful and confusing, but the book, the TAs, and the tutors are all helpful.",
    "The electron pushing that you learn will be helpful for predicting the outcomes of reactions, but I can't imagine the electrons actually behave like we move them. The course was very results oriented and didn't seem to care about understanding what was really happening in reactions.",
    "This is the toughest material I have come by because it's not so straightforward and there are so many things to memorize. I would only recommend this class if you have to take it to fulfill major requirements or pre-medrequirements, because otherwise it's not worth your time. You would really have to study the material each day to master it and do well on tests. It's not enough to cram",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, especially with Ziegler.",
    "My recommendation will not change your decision to take this class, so here is something actually useful: if the exams portion of your grade is still based on the two highest raw scores out of three midterms, be aware that the grades on the first midterm will likely be so many points higher than the others that you will almost certainly have to count your first exam score, whether or not it is above average. Study accordingly.",
    "Do not take this course if you do not need to for pre-med requirements or any other requirements.",
    "It's an interesting class and the problems at the end are fun puzzles but it's a lot of work. It wasn't really worthwhile to go to lecture though. Ziegler's lectures weren't very clear or focused.",
    "Recommended only if you have to take it, enjoy solving puzzles, or don't procrastinate.Lectures are difficult to follow and the class can get really stressful towards the end.But in general it was a pretty good course, very challenging.Overall pretty fair and taught at a good pace.",
    "If you read the book it will make a lot more sense, the lectures are pretty pointless. Only take it if you have to.",
    "It was, without question, the worst course I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course as a comprehensive coverage of Organic Chemistry, but would caution that it is definitely not an easy course and the environment tends to be pretty competitive. Study groups are encouraged and tutors can be useful, but in the end you have to make sure you know (and haven't just memorized or copied) the material.",
    "just don't take it",
    "Organic Chemistry is a cool subject. If you are premed, therefore required to take it, brace yourself and do your best to not get too down about it, also everyone in the class will be in the same boat as you. If you are not premed, therefore not much pressure, enjoy the class when you understand it. The sad thing is that, you get used to it only at the end of the semester, but I guess that this helps with Orgo 2.",
    "Yes, but take it because you want to take it, not because you have to. You'll get a lot more out of the class.",
    "Organic Chemistry is a difficult class, that is a given. But if you want to be a Chemistry Major or a doctor, it is a class that you will have to take. If you keep up with the material, learn how to use your models and dedicate 95% of your time to this course, it will be manageable. In fact, it is a great bonding experience.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class to any other student, at least not with Ziegler as the professor. Take this class only if you have to, and get a tutor.",
    "The course is difficult but manageable with a lot of work put into it. Professor Ziegler gives past examinations as study guides which makes certain parts of exams not difficult at all since you've already seen them before. Lecture can feel confusing a lot of times, but it follows the book, so if you put time into truly understanding the textbook, you should have a good understanding of the material. He drops one of the three midterms. The final is cumulative.",
    "Definitely take advantage of the science tutors. Carly's the best!!",
    "Take it if you have to. It's not really that bad if you put in the effort to study and enjoy it.",
    "Okay, here's the deal. If you're thinking about taking organic chemistry, it's probably because you need to. And if you need to take it, then you should really choose to take it with someone else. Problem sets take hours, especially the later ones, so if you end up taking this class, look up the tutors and get a quick responding TA. The tests are unbelievably hard because of the time limit, which makes the final easier since then you have 3 hours instead of the 50 minutes for the 3 tests. Ziegler takes way too much time talking about reactions and who invented them, then lightly skips over the part that's actually important (you know, how it happens), or explains them in the most convoluted manner possible. Most people just stayed home, read, and showed up for the test.It is all around awful. You have been warned.",
    "It's organic chemistry. Go into it knowing it's a hard course because of the time it takes. Put in the effort and you will be rewarded, even if you don't feel like it.",
    "Don't take it if Ziegler is teaching. Before I get into the negatives, know that first, to be completely fair, Ziegler can be funny. Sometimes. And the only things that got me through this course were my awesome TA, the extremely well-written textbook, and the interesting nature of the course itself. Orgo is really cool stuff. I advise you to meet with your TA, get a QR tutor from Day One (don't let your ego get in the way of doing so), and stay on top of the reading.Ziegler's weaknesses1) No headings on the blackboard whatsoever, often because his ideas don't flow linearly and logically. Ziegler often introduces ideas because he has randomly thought of them. There is rarely a consistent flow of ideas. Also, his complete lack of headings on the board makes compartmentalizing the information being presented really difficult.2) Lecture content. Simply stated, attending lecture does not help you score better on the exams. This is partly why so many students didn't even bother attending lecture.3) Efficiency. Ziegler presents material that is interesting to him, not information that is truly relevant to our understanding. For example, we learned the Swern oxidation in class simply because Ziegler thought it was cool. We spent a good amount of time on it in lecture, and in the grand scheme of things, it played a VERY minor role--at most--in our understanding.4) Cohesiveness. Lectures, problem sets, and the textbook did not match up with one another well at all. The course felt quite disjointed.5) Impatience. I attended Ziegler's office hours once and never returned because he was clearly impatient and became easily worked up when students learning organic chemistry for the first time didn't understand what he--a seasoned veteran--said immediately. I also emailed him and his responses were brusque at best. He referred me to the syllabus on one occasion in response to a question I had because something on the syllabus was unclear.6) Problem sets. Wayyyyyyyyyy beyond the scope of the class. If Ziegler thinks students really worked through them, he's joking himself. The vast majority of students went to the Trumbull Tutor the night before problem sets were due to get answers from the Trumbull Tutor. Having taken the time to really, truly work through problem sets, I think they benefited me in some ways, but in retrospect, it probably wasn't even worth the effort. And honestly, VERY few students bothered going to half the trouble I did. The problem sets were so far beyond the scope of the class that most students abandoned solving them on their own.7) Singling out students in lecture.PS-Purchase the molecular models. They will make your life a ton easier.PPS-Collaborate and work together with other students. Good luck.",
    "It was a fair\/good course that could have been better. I would recommend taking it with Ziegler because it is not impossible and you could pull off a decent grade with good studying. All in all, not as bad as everyone says. I actually found some of thestuff pretty enjoyable and fun. Depends on your attitude and how you tackle the course. make sure to leave plenty of time onSaturday and Sunday nights to finish p-set's.",
    "If you have totake it as a prerequisite, you will. If you are considering taking it b\/c you think it will be interesting, which i recommend, I would make sure that you allot a lot of time for that class. b\/c the class will not be interesting unless you are able to dedicate some time to learning the material. I also think that the class is largely self-taught, so don't expect inspiring\/ interesting lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Chem\/pre-med\/Chem-E who is willing to accept the rigor. Organic Chem is inherently and consistently comprehensive, and for most it is very challenging.",
    "It's a difficult class, but manageable. Work hard and go to office hours. Do practice problems and get a tutor the first day of class. Don't think negatively about the class because it will make it ten times worse. Every pre-med student goes through it so don't let one class deter you from your goal. This is merely one step in a long journey and although it will test your determination and drive, it does not determine your worth as a person or your ability as a potential doctor.",
    "The only reason to take this class is if you have to. Be prepared to work.",
    "Its a good course and it if fun! But Zeigler makes it really tough!",
    "Interesting topic. Yea, orgo, as a subject, is interesting. The class, however, is painful. It's not even just memorization or application. It's both, in the most painful combination possible. You can spend hours trying to memorize the reactions, but unless you take time out of work from other classes, you are essentially screwed. Just close your eyes and wait for it to be over.",
    "If you're taking this course it's probably because you have to.You've heard the stories, you know what to expect; just brace yourself. Get as much help as you can from TA's, tutors, office hours, etc.",
    "Although a very difficult subject matter, the course was well organized and well taught. Many of the lectures were not the easiest to follow, and careful dissection of notes was required to understand key concepts. I would have appreciated more time taken on presenting\/explaining concepts in the book rather and immediately jumping to more advanced concept application. I enjoyed the lecture and the problem sets, although difficult, were the most beneficial tool of the entire course.",
    "Take it if you have to. Challenging and stressful. Make sure you find a good tutor. If she's still around, go to Carly (the Trumbull tutor) for help on problem sets. She guides you through them and you learn what you should've learned in class.",
    "Most of the people who were in the class had to take it for either pre med or major requirements. For those who must, the last two in class hour exams are in actuality 2 hour exams which they ask you to complete in one. Looking at past exams help.",
    "If you're looking at this class, you're probably going to take it regardless of what you read. The class is hard, but it's actually not as bad as people say - you just have to be willing to put in the work for it. I would've done much better if I had realized that earlier. Ziegler knows his stuff but can sometimes be unclear. Go to the good TAs (not all of them are great) for help. Trust me, you won't die.",
    "Hard. Lots of work. But, if you do put the effort in a get lots of external help, you will get the results you want.",
    "Prof Ziegler was once publicly compared to Prof Severus Snape by a former student \u0097 he then centered a test question on this Harry Potter character after that incident, no joke. Alas, this comparison is not far from the truth. Like this Slytherin professor, Ziegler is a tough, tough teacher of Potions (ie orgo). Half-serious half-bloods will not fair well in this class as he expects a lot out of his students. Each of the three exams is like a TriwizardTournament: the tasks are difficult \u0097 but not un-conquerable \u0097 and only the most prepared will surface victoriously. As draconian as Ziegler might seem, he, like Snape, is a good person at heart. I would highly recommend paying him multiple visits during office hours, seeking out a TA who is able to help you demystify orgo, and reading the textbook like a Marauder's Map as a guide.",
    "I would not recommend Chemistry 220 1 to another student, and hope that my comments will help other students to find alternative ways of fulfilling the organic chemistry requirement. I have nothing against organic chemistry as a subject, and actually entered the class with an extremely positive attitude. However, this particular class is poorly taught and poorly tested. It is time consuming without being rewarding. Please take a different course with a different professor.",
    "Try to keep up with the material as much as possible. Buy a review book for simpler explanations of things than are in your textbook.",
    "I would only recommend that one take this class if one has a passion for organic chemistry or if one has to take it because one is premed. Otherwise, be prepared to ask yourself why you are taking the class if you will gain nothing form it every Sunday night as you scramble to finish the p-set!",
    "Take orgo if you have to for a requirement (premed or major), otherwise I'd say you're crazy to take orgo for fun.",
    "If you have to take this class for your major\/pre-med, or if you are very interested in chemistry take this class. Otherwise I would say don't."
