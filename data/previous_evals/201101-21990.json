    "An opportunity to learn the basic technical foundations of music theory. The workload is high and rote. I suspect that individual enjoyment of the course will vary by professor.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Definitely take this course. It is a really fun class and you get to hear music in class and you get to analyze it. You will learn something new about music each class.",
    "YES!! i cannot recommend this more. i had never taken any music theory and had no musical background but decided to take it since like everybody at yale sings or plays an instrument and is always talking about harmonies and key changes and stuff and i couldn't be happier i did. music theory itself is a wonderful discipline- it's very logical and almost math-y, but with a result that's a beautiful tune or harmony rather than just a number! the class isn't too much work and attending class is really fun. also i would HIGHLY recommend taking it with james park if he's teaching it--he was a fantastic teacher, really good at explaining musical concepts for which we had no frame of reference with analogies and stuff, and very understanding in terms of the other work we have as students. overall, couldn't recommend it higher!!",
    "It's a great fun class to have and you will learn a lot, you will never look at music the same way - your view of music will be more sophisticated. I would definitely recommend Music 110 to another student."
