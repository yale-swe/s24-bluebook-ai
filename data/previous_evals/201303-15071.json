   "comments": [
    "Spanish 130 is a fairly basic Spanish course. It meets every day, but fortunately the workload is very reasonable on a day-to-day basis (max 20 minutes, and typically more like 5 minutes). I found it to be a great review after having not taken Spanish for a year. It covers many of the basic tenses, with more focus on grammar than on vocab. Tests and quizzes were more difficult but overall fairly reasonable. Diaz is an amazing professor--so enthusiastic and friendly!",
    "I would recommend this course. The work level is decent, just make sure to keep up with the online activities so they can boost your grade if you don't ace the harder stuff. Sebastia\u00c3\u00a1n D\u00c3\u00adaz is precious, take it with him if you can.",
    "Summary of Spanish 130 in three words: best class ever. It was a joy going to class every day, knowing that Professor D\u00c3\u00adaz would better my understanding of the Spanish language and my speaking ability. He's the best!",
    "This class is for the intermediate student who really wants to practice writing and using more complex grammar in writing. I would recommend this class to someone who mostly fits these criteria.",
    "Yes! If you have to take this course you might as well take it with Sebastian.",
    "A lot of work, but you learn a lot",
    "This was one of my favorite courses thus far. I learned a lot and definitely feel like I've improved in writing especially. I preferred the online sources to the expensive loose-leaf textbook, but other than that I thought the course was extremely well conducted. Professor Diaz was amazing, take it from him if you can. He really cares about the students and he helped me improve a lot. I occasionally misunderstood one of his explanations, but I think the problem was my translation, not his teaching.",
    "I would recommend this class to peers because it does a nice job covering the basic grammar topics.",
    "Spanish 130 is an excellent class to take if you want to improve your Spanish. There's a lot of work involved but it's absolutely worth it. The class is well-structured and effective."
