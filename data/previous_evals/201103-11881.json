    "This question is always a bit silly for classes like this - if you're looking at it, presumably you're a physics major who has to take it. Whatever.Lamoreaux is a really brilliant, really shy guy. This makes for a difficult lecture to follow because he's extremely flustered most of the time and also thinking about three planes above where you're capable of, unless your initials are WHW. And when you ask questions to clarify, there's maybe a 50% chance he will both correctly interpret your question and give an answer you can actually understand. He's super sweet though, so be nice to him!And if you want to survive this class, read Griffiths. And maybe Shankar too.",
    "If this is taught by Lamoreaux, you will learn quantum largely because Griffiths is a good textbook. It also helps to understand linear algebra beforehand.",
    "If you are a physics intensive major, you have to take it. If not, look to see who the teacher is before you decide to take it.",
    "A course you have you to take if you want to know more about quantum mechanics.",
    "Meh. If you gotta do it you gotta do it. Lamoreaux is a lovely man with a wonderfully wry sense of humor, but his lectures are completely opaque. On the plus side, you won't have to worry about your grade - the median score on our midterms was like a 96, and the final is a take-home with collaboration allowed.",
    "This is of course necessary for intensive majors. It has the potential to be interesting, but is rather painful because of the way in which it is taught. It is hard to follow Prof. Lamoreaux in lecture, as he is kind of all over the place. The class isn't terribly difficult though, two easy midterms, homeworks, and a fairly tough take home final.",
    "I would recommend this class, however I'd like to let you know what you're getting into. The lectures themselves are sometimes hard to follow and the problems sets are not easy. However, Professor Lamoreaux lets you turn the corrected psets in for full credit and the final is a take home open book final which was hard but certainly helped drive home all we've learned this semsester. In short, I learned a lot of quantum mechanics and feel much more comfortable with it now.",
    "you know if you're going to take it already. if professor lamoreaux is teaching, you'll have to put in your fair share of work but know that you'll be rewarded with a nice grade at the end. take responsiblity for your own education as you shouldn't expect to learn the material from the lectures alone",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course, then you've probably heard some cautionary tales about Professor Lamoreaux's clarity in lecture. These are pretty much true. That being said, take this course. It will be some work, but it's as stress free as humanly imaginable. The tests and grading are all extremely extremely low stress (trust me), which makes it easier to focus on just learning the material. Also, just so that you know ahead of time - Professor Lamoreaux is a giant in this field. Wikipedia \"Casimir Effect.\" Yeah, it's not called the \"Lamoreaux Effect,\" but it might as well be. He was also in a NOVA documentary alongside Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking. Also a BBC special on time travel. Oh yeah, also a Discovery Channel show on wormholes. In conclusion, I would like to offer a haiku: This class is taught by Prof. Lamoreaux \/ Whose clarity in lecture is only so-so-so \/ Yet nonetheless I endorse \/ That you consider this course \/ For then your QM knowledge will grow-grow-grow.",
    "If you need to take the course, you will. But try to get another teacher. Professor Lamoreuax is really nice, but really bad at explaining things.",
    "Overall, Physics 441 is a good course. It can be difficult to follow lectures if you don't read ahead, and even then Professor Lamoreaux sometimes has his own way of explaining things (which is usually pretty cool if you know the math involved). Prof. Lamoreaux is great about answering questions, so if you're ever really stumped about something don't be scared to ask about it.",
    "Professor Lamoreaux cares a lot about the success of his students. However his lectures were often geared more towards a graduate level and they were difficult to follow."
