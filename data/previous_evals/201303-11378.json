    "Yes, more because of the prof\/TFs than the course reading.",
    "never never never ever ever take this class. I thought I was going to be a linguisics major and was so excited, but now I'm just done. This class has so many lecture assholes, you won't even believe it\/. he TAs are crazy and grade so harshly even if you've asked for help and spent hours on your homeworks. Don't believe these other awful reviews. I completely and totally regret this class.",
    "If you like languages, are curious about how language works, or interested in the intersection between language and other fields, take this class! If you are looking for a social science credit that is interesting, useful, and not terribly work-heavy, take this class! If you are not a linguistics nerd before taking this class, you will probably become one. I bring up things from LING 110 lecture all the time now in everyday conversation; we use language all the time and learning about it never fails to be fascinating.Without an awesome professor and TFs, this class would probably still be interesting. However, thankfully you DO have an awesome professor and TFs if you take this with Professor Bennett, Emily, and Alysia. They are incredibly helpful and know exactly how to present material in a way that is clear and captivating.You will cover the basic subfields of linguistics: syntax, semantics, phonetics, phonology, morphology, language acquisition, and sociolinguistics among other things. It is an intro class with short units, so you may feel like you want to learn more about each topic. That being said, this was the most successful intro class I've ever taken in balancing depth and breadth, general information and deeper analysis.There are very manageable problem sets assigned weekly, occasional sections, and unit quizzes. These are graded generously, but the TFs take you seriously and want sound justifications for your answers. I liked this class because it encouraged creative thinking and application of concepts, rather than rote memorization. I found the lecture notes more helpful than the textbook in preparing for the quizzes; the textbook sometimes differed from what was covered in class. That's it in a nutshell. I really have no complaints.",
    "Strong lecturer, balanced material. A good intro course. Definitely work with a partner or team on the HW, and study hard for the quizzes, though.",
    "I would recommend it if one is interested in the subject material and hasn't really encountered it before.",
    "It is pretty interesting, the workload is very manageable, the readings are more supplemental than required in order to understand the material. Bennett tries his best to make the boring topics more exciting (with varying degrees of success). Good SO credit, but liking languages DOESN'T guarantee you'll like linguistics. It's the study of language itself, which can get technical and dry.",
    "I recommend taking LING 110 if you haven't been exposed to linguistics before. It's a super interesting field, and even though I probably won't take further linguistics classes, I'm really glad I took this one. It's also pretty easy.",
    "An interesting class about something I think any of us overlook or take for granted. Even if you know you do not want to be a linguist, the class is a great way to broaden your interests and your distributional requirements.",
    "Dropped it",
    "I would absolutely recommend LING110 to another student. It is an incredibly intriguing subject area and is extremely well taught. The workload is reasonable and (in my opinion) pretty enjoyable.",
    "A great introduction to linguistics. You will learn lots of things that you would not otherwise have learned. At times, it can be a bit slow, but the problem sets are easy and the material is usually interesting (even if it isn't that fast-paced of a class). I enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend Linguistics to another student, but perhaps with a bit of hesitation to make sure they know what they're getting into. They should at least have some interest in language, grammar, or something similar to be able to engage themselves fully in the course.",
    "Ryan Bennett was wonderful. He made classes interesting with a great sense of humor, taught well and graded fairly. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic.",
    "Most people don't know what to think about linguistics or don't know what it is. This class does a great job of providing information in an interesting and enjoyable way.",
    "I would recommend this course because (1) linguistics is a super cool, but uncommonly considered, field of study at Yale, (2) Professor Bennett is an entertaining lecturer, (3) homeworks are actually fun, and (4) because you begin to become more aware of conversations, accents, and interesting linguistic differences between people and between you and others.",
    "Linguistics 110 is a good introduction to linguistics. It's not too much work, though you will have to memorize the International Phonetic Alphabet. The problem sets take about three hours each, and it took me about two to four hours to study for each test (and about six hours for the phonetics test, since I had to memorize the IPA). It's a good introduction to linguistics, and more interesting and applicable than most people would expect.",
    "Amazing class. So much more fun and interesting and practical than any other class you'll most likely take at Yale.Trust me, you'll be grateful you did.Professor is soooooooooooooooooooooooo awesome.",
    "I'd recommend the class to anyone interested in learning more about the way language works. It's a good intro course, even for someone not majoring in linguistics. It made me think about language in a different way. Some of the early subject matter was a little dull, but Prof. Bennett usually kept the class entertaining, and his love of the subject was obvious. The last few lectures on sociolinguistics and language acquisition were fascinating. The problem sets weren't overly burdensome, but I'd definitely recommend working on them and studying with other students.",
    "I would recommend this course. Though the class could occasionally be a little dry, i thought it was worth it for the amount of really interesting material we learned. I didn't know how much I would like linguistics until i took this course. I would also recommend going to office hours with the TAs or the professor.",
    "Linguistics 110 is a great intro to the field of linguistics. I would recommend the class to anyone who is interesting in languages and learning what various kinds of linguists do. Not too demanding, but fascinating!",
    "Linguistics 110 is a survey course that dabbles in many of the topics in linguistics. Some of the sections are more interesting than others, but the nature of the course is that it moves quickly through all of them, so if you dislike one, it will soon be over. The course load was also less than I was expecting.",
    "Intro to Linguistics is a course with very, very, little work, but a really broad overview that is alternatingly boring and interesting depending on your tastes. It is often conceptually difficult, and super interesting for someone interested in language.",
    "This class gives you a great introduction to the field of linguistics. Definitely recommended, especially if the same instructor is teaching.",
    "'Twas an excellent course, and I would highly recommend it. It gives a good background in the major subcategories of linguistics, so it is a good starting point if you are considering a linguistics major. If you're not considering a major, it's an excellent way to gain some fluency with a very interesting field of study that you don't really get to learn about in high school at all.",
    "If you're interested in linguistics and\/or languages, take it for sure. It's really not that hard and not that much work, but still interesting and will tell you if you want to take more classes in linguistics. But if you weren't interested in it to begin with, there is a risk that you'll hate it\/will suck at it. Ryan is a funny lecturer.",
    "For anyone even vaguely interested in linguistics, I would recommend this class. I looked forward to going to lecture everyday. The lectures were funny and interesting, and the professor's passion for his subject was infectious.",
    "I initially thought the course would be centered more on language and culture, but the material is more technical than I thought it was going to be. A lot of the topics weren't particularly interesting to me, and so the lectures could sometimes seem pretty endless. I did really start to enjoy the class towards the end, but definitely make sure you actually enjoy the material before enrolling. Ryan Bennett is really, really great and passionate and knowledgeable. As any intro class, however, you touch on a lot of topics, none very deeply.",
    "An engaging survey course of major topics in linguistics. Rather easy outside of a few topics and concepts, but never dull, I thought. Reading the textbook was far from necessary for the class; quizzes, tests, and the final were all based around lecture.Absolutely recommended as an introduction; having shopped and fled from other linguistics classes I think starting with something like this makes the field more approachable.",
    "I would summarize this class as an excellent introduction into the field of linguistics. It covers the basics very well, helps apply linguistic theory to current events, and had manageable course work. I would definitely recommend the class to other students because the topics are interesting and the class is engaging.",
    "Professor Bennett is awesome. He is young, passionate, and has a great way of explaining concepts. He made this class interesting, and even though it was not a difficult class I found I worked more on it simply because I liked it. I talked about things we had learned at breakfast to my friends. I took this class on a whim, didn't have trouble with it, and it was incredible. I wish I were not too old to change my major."
