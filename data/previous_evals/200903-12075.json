    "Definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is certain he or she is really interested in the material. Try to follow the lectures and definitely ask the professor questions if things aren't making sense.",
    "Depends. If youre interested in the subject matter and you have a little background, then yes. I felt a little over my head, knowing nothing about the subject before taking the course.",
    "survey of the major issues of the age of COnstantine. solid history class",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload is relatively light, the readings are primarily interesting primary source documents, and Matthews' lectures are interesting. If you are at all interested in Roman history I would say that this is a great class for you.",
    "This class takes you from Diocletian through Constantine. There is a great emphasis placed upon interpreting significant texts and images from the time period, and sometimes this detracts from the history itself.Sometimes the class moves kind of slowly. The final and final paper, however, really force you to comprehend the material in a holistic way, so I feel that I got something out of the class.Matthews is a charming and endearing lecturer. However, I believe that you should only take this course if you are a Classics major or a History major concentrating in the Greco-Roman world. If you are looking for a more general history class on Rome, you should probably take the Roman Republic or Matthews's own The Roman Empire.",
    "This is a very solid ancient history classes. Professor Matthews really knows a great deal and no background knowledge is required. I knew material from studying ancient Rome in middle school and was totally fine.",
    "Take it if the material interests you, but otherwise it can be quite easy to get bored. The teacher is the definitive expert in Late Roman history, though.",
    "An excellent course, but I'd recommend taking the survey course covering the history of the Roman Empire first. Doing so provides an appropriate context for this course."
