It was a delightful week for me, and incredibly cool to learn so much from the professors, students, guest lecturers and general osmosis. Best of all, I was responsible for actually learning none of the info, so I was able to take it all in as I wished.The other great thing was that intentionally or not, the crew was fantastic. We were an efficient, cohesive and riotously funny group."
