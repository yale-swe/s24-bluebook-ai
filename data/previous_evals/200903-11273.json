    "If you're a chemical engineer, you have to take this class. If you have an engineering bent in your interests, this class will introduce you to a lot of what makes engineering possible, all the real-life calculations and considerations that you have to make. However, like engineering classes in general, I feel, it errs on the side of throwing a lot of tools at you instead of really teaching science."
