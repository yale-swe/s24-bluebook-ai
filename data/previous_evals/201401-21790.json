   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want an easy science credit, but don't go to class. Just learn the material on your own. The things you learn in class are really hard, but the exams are pretty easy.",
    "Yes. Beautiful course. Fairly easy and manageable.",
    "I enjoyed this course - the material is presented clearly, and the work is for the most part manageable. It is not an easy course, but if you are interested in Astronomy, and in particular, what happens inside a star, this is the class for you. If you're looking to fill an Sc requirement and do not want to take a more serious class, you might be better off with ASTR 120.",
    "A pretty easy class for anyone who's taken astronomy or physics before.",
    "Take this if you're looking for a cool, but relaxed Sc\/QR. The workload isn't bad -- a pset every other week that takes ~3 hours, and some very reasonable tests. But if you don't have any background in astronomy, you'll still learn a lot without having to worry to much about the specific details. The work requires a lot of high school algebra, but no calculus, which was nice; the professor occasionally does calculus derivations of formulas in class, but the psets are at a pretty low level of difficulty.",
    "An interesting QR credit. I would recommend it. Pay attention though, the final is deceptively hard.",
    "This class is not a gut. If you are taking it for a science credit (as I did) and want a gut, look somewhere else. The tests cover a ton of material and are hard. You don't have to go to class if you don't want to but you have to study a whole lot for the final. The teacher is ok but doesn't do a great job of making boring material interesting",
    "Speaking from the point of view of an Astronomy major, this is a very easy class. However, I suspect it would be pretty easy for most people. The workload is very light--one (short) problem set roughly every two weeks; and only the higher grade of your two midterms is taken (they are both quite easy). However, you need to be careful to make sure that you are very precise on your homework assignments, as partial credit for small errors is more harsh than in more classes. Overall, if you need a science\/qr class, or if you're an astronomy major, this class is worth considering. Otherwise, you might find something more interesting in another astronomy class. This one just isn't that interesting.",
    "Astro 210 starts with very basic principles in science (e.g. scientific notation...), but later builds up to more interesting material when it starts to deal directly with stellar principles and their evolution (the second 2\/3 of the course). Overall, it is a good survey and introduction course if you have had little experience with astronomy previously. Attending lecture is not really necessary, as Professor Basu posts lecture notes\/slides after every class, but Professor Basu can be a helpful resource if needed. While perhaps not the most fulfilling of courses, this (or Astr 220) is a requirement for the Astronomy major with a light workload (psets every 2 weeks; 2 short midterms; one final) so if you're curious in astronomy and looking for one full credit, this might be a good starting course.",
    "This is a small QR class that is unchallenging if you put in a decent amount of work. If I were to take this class again, I would not take notes in class on the slides and rather on what Professor Sarbani was saying. I would then study\/take down the notes off slides on my own time. Though this second part would take up a lot of time, this is the only way I would recommend some to take this class. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to think about the material deeply and truly understand\/appreciate it. If you have the time for this, I would recommend the class. However, if you just want an easy A you don't have to spend so much time on the notes. Just study hard for the midterm and final and you'll do well.",
    "Please do not take this class. It was so boring and such a waste of time. I think I learned more when someone had randomly set up a telescope on the corner of Elm and York and let me look at Jupiter than from an entire semester of ASTR 210.",
    "Really interesting if you are excited by space and such. If you are a STEM oriented student, the work in this class will be a breeze. Most of the material is qualitative more than quantitative.",
    "Meh. You really don't need to put in much work. The psets are easy and the concepts aren't challenging but the midterm\/final are very hit or miss because you just have to memorize a ton.",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for an in-depth understanding of stars. There is some pretty rigorous science and math involved, so be prepared."
