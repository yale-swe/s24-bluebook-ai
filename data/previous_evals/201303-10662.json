   "comments": [
    "If you are very interested in music theory, I would absolutely recommend that you take this class. It ranges from interesting to mind-blowing, especially as you start to tackle more advanced concepts near the end of the course.",
    "211 is a solid conclusion to the 205-210-211 fundamental music theory program. Dr. D's section focused heavily on text-music analysis of Schubert lieder which I found to be really engaging -- it's definitely a way into the music that caters more to the humanities people in the room, but it works. The workload is not too overbearing as long as you don't mind writing papers and you get to know your classmates better than in a lot of courses. Dr. D's also super friendly and cool and eager to meet and communicate with students if they need help outside of class. If you feel like you want to go forward with music in any direction, take it -- I'm personally not a music major, but taking this class will allow me to qualify for any music course and definitely will help me in all my musical endeavors.",
    "I would not recommend Dr. Duncan's section of this class, because I found his style of teaching to be alienating. The syllabus is really quite wonderful, but I did not enjoy the class because of the instructor.",
    "I would tell any student serious about music to take this course, because it is different from any other music theory course I've taken. I recommend it because it gets you to think analytically different about pieces of music, and provides you with different methods of analysis when music gets too complex for conventional early 18th century harmony.",
    "MUSI 211 was a very enjoyable and comprehensive coverage of analysis of classical and romantic works. It incorporated concepts learned in 205 and 210, and it was very rewarding applying them to monumental works by Beethoven, Chopin, Schubert etc.",
    "What's great about this course is the sheer volume of music involved. You'll be doing rigorous harmonic analysis of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Liszt. In general, this is really good if you're a composer, conductor, accompanist, or theorist, and pretty tough if you're a performer. Dr Duncan is a good explainer, and is very generous with his time if you initiate a conversation. His classes are also pretty fun, due to a lot of hands-on group-work. Not recommended for anyone who isn't serious about music.",
    "This class is the stepping stone to higher level music at Yale. It is well taught, and enjoyable for the most part. Dr. Duncan is funny, and his lectures are usually quite interesting and insightful. I would recommend the class with a few reservations. Personally, I found the choice of music tiresome. Be prepared to listen to a lot of Mozart and Beethoven at the beginning of the course, and then a lot a lot a lot of Schubert songs with German text. I would have preferred more Chopin, which we basically glossed over at the end of the course. Also, the material can at times feel contrived or useless, like putting labels on minutia without really enhancing your overall appreciation for a piece of music. On the other hand, I think I improved as an analytical writer in this course. There is a significant focus on writing, with several short (3-5 page) and one long (10 page) paper. In these assignments I was very conscious about the clarity of my prose, probably due to the fact that the writing was rather technical in nature, and on a subject I had never written extensively about before. Yet, what we were doing was coming up with a thesis and finding supporting evidence in a piece of art, the same as in an analysis of literature. On the whole, the workload is not too bad, although it comes in spurts, and some assignments end up taking really long. Expect anywhere from 3 to 10 hours per week.",
    "Review sonata form with some Beethoven sonatas. Do some weird poetry analyses with Schubert song cycles. Enharmonic stuff with Chopin and Liszt.I can't think of a single thing presented in this class that I hadn't already learned in previous theory classes. The concepts from previous classes were certainly applied to pieces of greater complexity, but it was pretty unfulfilling and really just tedious. This class is necessary to take upper level music courses, so take it for that reason if you must, but otherwise...meh.",
    "The quality of your experience will depend entirely on your instructor. Avoid Duncan.",
    "I'd say take it. It's a good and interesting class, especially if you love music and want to approach it from more than a fundamentals-and-more kind of perspective. I'd say shop a bunch of sections and make sure you like the TF, though, and make sure s\/he runs a flexible enough class that you'd feel comfortable asking questions."
