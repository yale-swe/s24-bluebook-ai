   "comments": [
    "Great class, few requirements, not much reading.However, the tests are fast paced (about 4 minutes per question for a 50 minute test) and expected knowledge is broad.I would still highly recommend the class.",
    "Not as much of a gut as people make it out to be. Don't bothering coming to class as all the lectures are posted online, however there was an extra credit question that you had to be in present for class in order to know the answer.",
    "I would recommended it for someone who wants to get a science credit and still learn something applicable to real life.",
    "This is a really interesting course and I definitely recommend it. It is interesting if you like conservation at all and very accessible for non-science majors. The spread of work (two tests, not cumulative) plus section is well planned as well.",
    "it was a great class to learn about conservation if you are a non science major",
    "Anyone interested in environmental studies should take this class. Everyone should take this class to understand the relationship between human development and activities and impacts on the natural world.Also, lecture slides being posted online after every class was extremely helpful.",
    "I wish I could say \"only take this course if you are serious about conservation biology\", but that probably includes all of 3 students at Yale. My personal experience was weighed down, I think, by unenthusiastic students. It is, all said, a course for nonmajors. Not necessarily and easy SC credit- but not too hard; if you put in enough hours of good hard studying before each test you will be fine. One could probably get by either doing a reading or going to a lecture as the powerpoints were online and the lectures effectively summarized what was pretty dense text. But if you care about the material, you will want to do both- and it is so worth it. Really superb material with an interactive reserve design simulation project in the middle of the course. Thoroughly enjoyable experience.",
    "Read the course description",
    "There's better classes to take for a credit.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you're really into science.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the topic but have little science experience or just need a science credit. Maybe not if you have taken a lot of science courses before.",
    "Dear Person in My ExactSituation,Are you a first-semester senior trying to get a science credit? I will try to help you. I am probably going to get a C in Conservation Biology because they don't give pluses or minuses, which is weirdly cruel of them, but you shouldn't feel too bad for me, because I am monumentally stupid when it comes to science. I lack passion, intuition, commitment, and any previous knowledge of basic concepts. If you still think this sounds like you, and a C will stress you out, then I guess you should look around for something else.Conservation Biology is two half-semester length courses taught by different professors: the first is about conservation genetics, and the second conservation biology more generally. The second was more fun because the lectures were better organized and we got to talk about more animals and look at pictures of them running around&living their lives. Awesome things include that there are no problem sets and only two, 50 minute exams, as well as two annoying section assignment things. The reading is pushed in your face but you can ignore it if you're really determined. If you're like me, you still are wondering what sorts of piece of information these people will be telling you. So, it'll be like \"Scientists debate whether, when habitat fragmentation occurs, it is better for conservation of ecologically functional species to have many small fragments or a single large one. What might be some reasons for each side of the debate?\" And then you'll talk about what happens to species on the edge of habitat fragments, and what influences their ability to move between fragments. Something like that.WOW TOO LONG! This was weirdly cathartic.",
    "Probably one of the least painful science credits out there. I went to lecture about four times total this semester and will probably get an A in the course. The material is pretty interesting and easy to learn on your own before the midterms.",
    "This is an interesting class if conservation and the science behind it is something that appeals to you. Not that much work throughout the semester, but it definitely requires cramming before the two exams. The course is split between two professors which makes for a kind of disparate\/disorganized structure. I'd recommend it for a fairly easy non-science major science credit.",
    "This class is a survey course of the topics relating to Conservation Biology. The first half (Powell) focuses on genetics and is very interesting, focusing on specific case studies and issues that conservation must deal with today. The second half (Jetz) has more mathematical concepts and is a broader discussion of reserve building, ecosystems, and population growth. The first half of the course had minimal reading (no more than 40 pages a week) that was very helpful for understanding course material. Reading for the second half of the course (usually 60-80 dense pages) was challenging to understand and seemed unrelated to the lectures, but appeared on exams way more than was expected. Overall, the course seemed a lot more interesting in theory than it was in reality. Section was a challenge to sit through and lectures were often unnecessary. However, it was an interesting class about current issues and I do feel like I understand more about reserve building and climate change. I would recommend this class to someone who wants a very easy science credit with minimal work for the entire semester. But only take it if you are willing work very very hard before the two exams to learn nearly 1000 lectureslides.",
    "I really didn't like this class. The two professors did not create a cohesive course; Powell understood that his students knew little about the topic, Jetz did not. This made the second part of the semester an unforeseeable difficulty, which I thought to be unfair. I would not recommend this course unless you absolutely need a science credit and can find no other alternatives. The final exam was really not fair.",
    "It's an easy science credit. The first half of the semester is excruciatingly boring for anyone who has taking a basic biology class (probably the reason almost no one came to lecture). The second half was more interesting related to how conservation biology can actually be applied in the real world. The exams are not too difficult as long as you study the lecture powerpoints. If you need a science credit, there are probably more interesting ways to do it.",
    "See Question 1",
    "Good class for non-science majors. Not too hard, not a ton of work, but also not that interesting.",
    "Yes for an easy Sc.",
    "This class was great and very enjoyable. My TA and classmates were always enthusiastic about the material, which made participation sort of a must. As long as everyone remains engaged with the material, this class was painless to get through even for a non-bio major. Very relevant issues as well, as you get to learn about the science behind conservation issues which are often in the news.",
    "Very interesting material although sometimes not the most engaging class since it was a large lecture. I would recommend it to someone who will engage themselves actively in the class."
