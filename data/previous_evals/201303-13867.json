    "Covers the state of the field in theory of mind research quite comprehensively. Would recommend to other grad students interested in this topic.",
    "Yes, most definitely. It's an excellent course for anyone with cognitive or developmental interests.",
    "Demanding readings, but worth the effort. I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who is interested in theory of mind! Great, in-depth discussion seminar that will help you get a broad sense of the TOM literature and its applications to other areas of psychology!"

   "comments": [
    "The topic was directly relevant to my interests and allowed me to start a research project that is still ongoing and will hopefully result in publishable work.",
    "The course was actually more relevant than Iinitially expected, and it helped me generate new research ideas. Lots of themes in the class have implications for topics outside of standard ToM issues. I like that the final project for the class was directly applicable to our own research.",
    "Theory of Mind is a fundamental function of the mind and plays a role in many social cognitive processes. Although I don't focus on Theory of Mind in my research, it does inform many of my projects and the general concepts from cognitive science will be extremely useful.",
    "The course helped me better understand the TOM literature and its applications. It was moderately relevant for my research, but intrinsically interesting to just learn then TOM literature better!"
