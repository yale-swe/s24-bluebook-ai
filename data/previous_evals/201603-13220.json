    "An understanding of the evolution of human rights since the second world war, especially as it applies to sexuality, gender and human rights; and of the strategies and sometimes unintended consequences of human rights.",
    "Human rights is a contested realm of advocacy tools.",
    "Great way to think about advocacy and changing priorities in the human rights discourse",
    "A better intellectual understanding of the development of SRHR. Every concept and every human right has a history, this class helped me contextualize the histories of sexual and reproductive rights by acknowledging the constructed nature of many of the fundamental concepts: gender, sex, human rights. The class also encouraged students to evaluate the contemporary work being done in the field around SRHR with the critical tools developed."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great discussion, lots of engagement from the class, interesting course material, pushes you to think through assumptions Weaknesses: if you come in with not a ton of background, it can be hard to suss out what exactly you're supposed to be getting from the readings",
    "The course, while labeled as a seminar was often conducted more like a lecture, with a few audience contributions. I think this was due to the large class size around 25 students. I wish I had heard more from students, especially given their diverse academic and professional backgrounds. Overall the readings were well chosen. Although certain legal pieces were dry and lengthy. I also don't know if the guest speakers were well utilized, given the large group and large intellectual ground to cover, at times if felt as if the guest speakers didn't get enough space to talk and offer their expertise. Ultimately a great course, in content and intellectual rigor, but at times felt cursory due to ambitiousness of the syllabus.",
    "I deeply enjoyed this class, including all of the dynamics processes and concepts we considered and all the different disciplines and perspectives the course engaged with."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for sure.",
    "Yes!! anyone even remotely interested in these topics should be *running* to take this class.",
    "yes, but only if you are a social minded\/human rights person or someone who is willing to be in a very biased course. There was a clear agenda -- which everyone in the course appreciated and engaged with -- we weren't there to question whether this was a useful overall mission but rather how to advocate and how to navigate the internal contradictions and politics",
    "Take this course if you want to understand the history of SRHR, and the contentious politics in its contemporary forms.",
    "Most definitely. Such a rich course that makes you think in different and complex ways about social justice advocacy. Professor Miller is a phenomenal instructor."
