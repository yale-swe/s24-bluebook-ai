   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in learning history through reading and discussion instead of lectures, this class is worth trying. The topic is very intriguing, more interesting than what most people think at first sight.",
    "Memory vs. history and how testimony sheds light on both. I would certainly recommend this class; I learned about the Holocaust critically and not just in broad sweeping negative statements, as I had perceived it before",
    "I recommend this only if you are ready to read a lot of gruesome accounts of The Holocaust and have a lot to say on the matter.",
    "Great class, would highly recommend. Challenging but very interesting and engaging.",
    "Great class. True liberal arts experience. Really helpful for thinking. Great way to do some real critical thinking and on an interesting topic. Changes the way you think about the Holocaust. Wonderful freshman seminar.",
    "The course was an excellent introduction to the History Department and a great foray into analyzing the broad array of Holocaust Literature. The course syllabus was also structured very nicely with a natural progression from History to Memoirs to Synthesis Type Work. Sometimes discussions got redundant and repetitive but on the whole, the class is worth taking.",
    "It is a great seminar class if you are looking for an intimate setting to discuss a topic as sensitive as the holocaust. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the Holocaust or genocide. If you are not prepared to read about a book a week, however, I wouldn't recommend taking it.",
    "Great class on a very sensitive topic- you'll walk out of it much more knowledgeable about this tragedy.",
    "I often felt that class time was very unproductive, but overall an interesting course on an interesting topic. And a great seminar.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to a fellow student if it is offered again. Even if someone is worried because they don't have too much of a background on the subject, taking this class was a great platform for thinking critically in a safe environment, being exposed to very interesting yet not too difficult texts and being pushed to think and write about things in a different way."
