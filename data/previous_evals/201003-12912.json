   "comments": [
    "A fast-paced, extensive though superficial survey of the evolution of Constantinople\/Istanbul from its Greek origins to Turkish identity today.",
    "Take it! This course is amazing. For someone who has never taken an art history course, this course was a great introduction. There aren't too many heavy art history terms. It's very easy to follow. Professor Nelson is a gem. He wears a bow tie to every class and is really sweet. He has been to Istanbul many times and is able to add a more personal experience to the history and architecture than the readings and photos can do.",
    "A great class to take: the professor is wonderful and the material is interesting. Well-known events are described from a new perspective and their influence on the character of the city is not something you will likely get from another course. Beware of getting behind on the reading though. It's useful on the midterm and final.",
    "Very interesting course about the history of Istanbul through art and architecture. Includes a lot of history. If you like Turkey, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire etc, take this class. If you don't, or aren't interested in art, don't take this class.",
    "Cr\/D, yes, definitely. Otherwise, only if you have time to learn EVERYTHING.",
    "This is a great class, and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely take it again. That being said, it involved a lot of reading each week. Although it's possible to get away not doing all the reading, it did make things a little difficult. If you are not interested in art or history or literature, then this is probably not the class for you. Professor Nelson is truly wonderful and welcoming. He made every lecture great.",
    "Good class, but the midterm and final are hard. Very very hard. This is a history AND art history class, so you have to know all of the broad historical themes and trends in Istanbul\/Constantinople, and also the nitpicky art questions (artist, date, etc). The midterm and final take the entire time allotted, and it's all essay\/short answer based. Be prepared for your hand to cramp. Huge amount of material to learn, and you have to spit it all out in 50 minutes (midterm) and 3 hours (final).",
    "Good Art History class that is not too demanding.",
    "Yes, this course covers so much material that you'll find something of interest in it to you (city planning, architecture, art history, history, east vs west relations, plus Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and modern art).",
    "If you have any interest in Istanbul, take this class!!!! I absolutely LOVED it. Readings were mostly engaging. I've been to Istanbul before, and I can't WAIT to go back with all the new knowledge I have about the amazing city. Wonderful pictures in the lectures. Also, because the whole class revolves around one city, it is inherently very organized so studying for exams is very linear...essentially memorizing a timeline of one place. Professor Nelson is funny and leads engaging lectures, and you can tell he loves what he does. Great class, whether you've been to Istanbul or not.",
    "Good class, as long as youre interested in the topic. Its a mixture of history and art history, and after a while the mosques do all start looking the same...Nelson is extremely enthusiastic about the subject but he does go on many random tangents during lecture. Worth taking if you're at all interested in the city.",
    "This was a great class! And not too difficult either. The lectures were really interesting and easy to follow and the readings were very manageable. I also really loved Prof. Nelson. He was a great professor and was engaging and fun the whole time. He was always very accessible, which I really appreciated, and accommodating and nice. He did a great job. I don't really have anything to say about how the class can be improved. It was wonderful.",
    "It is a very interesting class, great introduction to Istanbul. Only downside is that there is way too much reading, a lot of which was unrelated to the course, boring, and unhelpful.",
    "Entertaining professor, helpful TAs, fair assessments, super interesting subject matter. Whether you are primarily interested in art, history, architecture, society, or culture, you will be genuinely excited by a lot of the material covered. You are able to explore anything you are particularly interested in in your paper. And one reading is assigned for each section, so even if you can only get to a little of the reading, you will be able to say plenty in discussion.",
    "IT IS AN ART HISTORY COURSE. And if you're an art history person, it should be a lovely class - Prof. Nelson is great and Byzantine art is really nifty. However, if you took it because of the other two cross-listed subjects (aka, humanities), it is not a broader history course that will revolutionize\/deepen your knowledge of Istanbul's history, literature or other-non-visual-artistic traditions. Just know what you are there to learn.",
    "This is a very interesting and very fun course if you want to know more about Istanbul, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire, or would just enjoy a course on the history of a city. It is a fascinating combination of art history, lit, and societal change in a city.",
    "A very big overview of 2000 years of history. A good introduction to all cultural\/art\/historical topics in Istanbul, that could help someone find more specific interests they relate to and wish to further pursue. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the area. But I would also caution that it is a lot of material, and that if they get interested in one specific area, there will be no time to explore it in depth because of the pace and span of the class."
