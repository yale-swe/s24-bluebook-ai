    "The field trip was a pain. I went because it was mandatory, but the TA's did not foster a good dialogue during the trip, and Matt wasn't even friendly. We went to Hunter's Point, which wasn't even a part of the zoning of LIC, which I didn't even realize until later because the TA's hardly explained where we were walking! I go into NYC often, and it so happened that I wasn't planning on going in that one weekend. It was inconvenient for me, and the fact that I could have given a better walking tour myself, which some guiding materials, made it even worse! I think providing the option for a walking tour, with guidance and AFTER students have a better idea of what the second game is about would have been much better.",
    "Preparation was generally quite poor - for one of the field trips, the TAs drifted in late, I wondered if I arrived at the correct location. No cell phone numbers were given out to coordinate or call anyone, students were calling each other to report they would be late. Study guides for the exam were only given the night before the finals. There was generally very little opportunity for the forestry school and architecture school students to coordinate a mutually agreeable time to do project work. The course should not be graded only Pass\/Fail in order to motivate students to put in more than just minimal effort to make the grade.",
    "No thought is given to non-architecture students. At one point, for one of the games, information was uploaded to the internal arch student server and none of us F&ES students could access it. Also planning and telling students about things in advance was extremely poor; for our field trip, a few days before we were to go all the way to Queens, NY, they gave us \"details\" which were \"meet outside the Citibank tower.\" There was no attempt at travel coordination, we were not reimbursed our expenses, and we were only told AFTER we arrived that it was not a mandatory trip. Expenses for printing our projects ran me over $30 for the semester (that's AFTER being split between all group members); perhaps this is normal for arch students but that really sideswiped me. I didn't learn what time the final was at, or the format of the final, until 6:30pm the evening before the final. And then when I actually arrived at the final, they had again changed the format slightly. When I had difficulty with aspects of the class, I reached out to my assigned TA via email, who mostly never responded to me, and when I tried emailing other TAs they told me that I needed to contact my assigned TA. I ended up taking on a great detail (most) of the work for both group assignments because the arch students just didn't seem to care about the class. The disorganization, last minute announcements, lack of equal distribution of work in group projects, and my apparent failure to please the professor with any of the work I spent countless hours attempting to produce despite all of these things, was overall very disheartening.",

    "We could all provide input where our expertise lay. However, there were deadbeats in one of my assigned group that resulted in the rest scrambling to pick up the slack to meet deadlines.",
    "I found no particular advantage. It was an intriguing insight into the life of an architecture student, but sadly I didn't find it particularly rewarding. For both group projects, I spent most of the time producing all of the written product while they drew in CAD...since obviously I am not an architect and can't use anything to create renderings...it was a strange amalgamation of work we were supposed to turn in. I felt like I never had much support from my group members- for both projects, we would set up times to meet and then I'd be sitting alone waiting for half an hour or more. And they're only free to meet at very odd times because apparently they just stay up all night, every night, working in the arch school."

    "Be prepared for complete disorganization for the field trip, group projects, and final. Be okay with your TAs, group members, and professor not caring about you if you are not an architecture student. You will learn a lot about planning and different case studies from around the country, but the onerous group work will drag down your enthusiasm until you feel like you're drowning alone, doing ALL of the non-design work for your entire group. The only enjoyable part was attending the regular lectures and learning from Professor Garvin and his readings, all other aspects of the class will test the utmost limits of your patience."
