   "comments": [
    "This was a really fulfilling political philosophy course that walks you through major themes regarding sovereignty--something that you may take for granted. I was surprised to go through readings that constantly challenged my take-for-granted assumptions about political philosophy, and this class really opens up a new perspective on the subject matter.The readings are light (well, some weeks you have to read the entire Social Contract in one week, but for most parts the readings are about one to two academic journals), and the class is mainly driven by discussion sections. Professor Ochoa Espejo is very talented in facilitating discussions, and there are a lot of bright students in the class from different backgrounds--for my year, IR grad student, History grad student, EP&E majors, political philosophy student, etc--all of whom have something interesting to bring to the table. Discussions were always engaging, intellectually challenging and opening experiences.In terms of the assignment, you work on one essay over and over again from posing a research question to finalizing a research paper--through the process you will get exposure to how and what processes research papers should go through.All in all, I had a great time in this class, and I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the subject matter of political philosophy!",
    "Sovereignty covers different accounts of political sovereignty, mixing classical works with more recent papers. Class discussion was interesting, though the questions are difficult to work through and build on as the semester progresses. The professor is engaging and accommodating, and there is a wide range for final papers on the topic - it helps to come in with a particular question about sovereignty that you'd like to explore."
