   "comments": [
    "It is a very amazing course, but definitely depends on the course subject and material. It is a considerable amount of writing, so you must really enjoy the subject to enjoy the class. Overall, I would recommend it to those looking to explore a new subject while strengthening their academic writing skills.",
    "This section of English 114 is not the cakewalk that many of the other sections are. You actually will be doing readings and writing assignments fairly often. Many of the activities are fun and lead to personal discussion and experiences which are unique, especially in a diverse classroom setting.",
    "I recommend this class if you are interested in the arts or abstract thinking. If you can connect whatever your passion is with some level of beauty, you can do well in this class. It does take a lot of work, and you will learn that some of the writing techniques you learned before in high school do not work in the writing academic atmosphere at Yale. If you do not think you can do any of the above, do not take the course. If you are willing to get out of your comfort zone and learn new writing techniques, then definitely take this course.",
    "ENGL 114 'On Beauty' is a very interesting topic. We read about beauty from perspectives of philosophy, culture, and art. Our writing topics were in response to these, so your interest in the course relies on some sort of curiousness in some aspect of beauty. Even if you don't have any before taking the class, from the beginning you start with some interesting readings that should be a good indication of if you'll enjoy the content. In terms of writing, you won't get much instruction on constructing individual sentences, but you will practice the ideas of forming paragraphs and entire essays. I had never before heard a lot of the language used to describe parts of academic writing (such as 'metacommentary'), and this terminology makes me understand academic writing better. Professor Jones in particular is an awesome professor, and I don't know of anyone that didn't think so. Her Australian accent doesn't hurt either.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, especially a students who enjoys reflection, contemplation, and art. The assignments allow for a great deal of freedom, but the class requires a great deal participation. I looked forward to going to this class every week and I thoroughly enjoyed completing the writing assignments, which allow for a great deal of freedom.",
    "YES. It is a very very interesting interdisciplinary approach to beauty. This course gets you thinking and helps you to develop your writing skills.",
    "This course is very much like the other 114 courses, but the topic is extremely interesting. There is never a correct answer to any of the questions posed in this course so it really encourages you to think and delve into the topic.",
    "Should you be interested in a multidisciplinary discussion of the concept of \"beauty\", this course fits you well.But beware that it might feel quite unsubstantial a topic for some.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. It is a foundational English course that sets a standard for writing at Yale."
