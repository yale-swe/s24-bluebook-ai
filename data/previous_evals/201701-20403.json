    "I now know a lot more about NMR than I did before.",
    "I learned quite a lot about various spectroscopic (and related) methods to determine chemical structures. Mostly NMR, but also ESR, X-Ray, Mass Spectrometry and IR.",
    "This class taught us a lot about spectroscopy, and really any method that helps determine molecular structure or other properties. It helped me understand the theoretical background behind many lab techniques and explained some of the new research emerging regarding spectroscopy. It was a tremendous overview of a very important part of chemistry.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is a survey of different methods of structure determination. The level of engagement, was, I felt very low. There was not much to class besides the powerpoint we were presented every day. We only ever had one assignment and it was not asked for or graded.",
    "Great course overall, no weaknesses",
    "I thought it was a good course overall.",
    "This class does an incredible job of explaining spectroscopic methods and the importance of collecting information about molecular structure and other properties. It is very well organized and has enough interesting facts and stories included in the lectures to make class very interesting. If I could suggest one improvement, it would be getting access to more research papers, as they really helped explain some of the newer research that was happening and gave us exposure to scientific literature. Otherwise, this class is great as it is."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. If they really needed another Chemistry class to fulfill requirements for their major, then perhaps. But given that you're paying tuition to come to Yale, it seems like a better option to choose a course that is more worthwhile in terms of experience.",
    "Yes, no workload, one midterm and final. that's it",
    "Yes, I absolutely would recommend it to chemistry majors who need an elective. You learn quite a few things about spectroscopy, and the workload is minimal for an advanced course (one pset, one midterm, and an oral final).",
    "I would absolutely take this class if you have any interest in spectroscopy. It covers NMR extensively and then goes on to explain other methods that you may or may not have exposure to. The class is well organized and Professor Saunders is absolutely incredible. He is an extremely nice man who wants his students to learn and understand his passion for chemistry. This class is a light workload, there is one midterm and an oral final exam. Additionally, we had one problem set at the start of the course, but it wasn't factored into our grades. The oral final is very interesting and gives Professor Saunders an opportunity to meet every student individually and take an interest in their lives. This class is definitely one of a kind, and I would absolutely recommend it to any student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is not a lot of work (one midterm and an oral final) but I learned a ton. NMR makes sense now, and I heard about some cool applications."
