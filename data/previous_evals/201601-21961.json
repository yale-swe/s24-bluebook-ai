    "I would only recommend the class if you need it, or you really know\/love sight singing and dictation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with moderate interest in music theory, but also anyone who has ever wanted to hear a song and figure out how to write it on sheet music or play it on a piano. The aural skills you gain in this course are valuable for any musician. You can never get enough practice listening to intervals!",
    "I would really only take this class if you plan to major in music or absolutely love dictation and sight singing. It was a very good class, but lots of work for a very specific skill.",
    "I was not sure how I would respond to this class because it was taught entirely in fixed Do which was a system I was not familiar with. Nevertheless my site reading and listening skills improved dramatically over the course of the semester. Also picked up some very basic piano skills. The class will most likely be very different next year because Prof. Bakulina will no longer be teaching it."
