    "Great class! Material is super-interesting and you learn a lot of Chinese. Professor Zhang is the nicest guy ever. Classes are graded on homework, twice-a-week quizzes, oral presentations, midterms (there are quite a few of them), the final, and participation. He is a really lenient grader, none of the above should be issues. Plus, class only meets three times a week. Keep up with the reading before each class and you should be fine.",
    "Business Chinese gives you a great depth of business vocab and explores super relevant topics in China-US economies.",
    "Yes, take it. It's pretty relaxed, though not without work, and the topics are for the most part very interesting."
