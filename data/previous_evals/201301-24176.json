    "This class is incredible. It is my favorite course that I have taken at Yale. There's not too much work--the writing assignments are 5 short papers (2-3 pages) and one longer paper (10-12 pages). However, you can shuffle the pages around however you want (for example, you can right a 6 page paper to count for two 3 page papers or write extra short papers in place of the longer paper). This is great because it allows you flexibility to do the work pretty much whenever you want. The reading is really interesting, and there's not too much of it. A couple weeks have as little as 75 pages of reading, and more typical weeks have between 100 and 150 pages of reading. You should definitely do the reading because it's all really interesting, but if you happen to be particularly busy in any given week, you can definitely get away with not doing all\/any of it. Judge Garfinkel is great--he's both really excited about all of the topics and very knowledgeable, which means that class discussions are all very interesting. As a heads up, nearly all of the reading is court cases (in addition to the cases that you see on the syllabus, the textbook is essentially a compilation of court cases). If you are interested in this, it's great, but I know some people weren't expecting how much focus there would be on reading court cases. If you don't like reading court cases, a lot of the reading will not be fun, so be warned. But the cases are all really interesting and not dry at all, so even if you haven't read court cases before, it's super manageable, and actually quite interesting. Additionally, he's really prompt in returning assignments to students, which is definitely rarer than it should be. Overall the class is fantastic, and I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. If you are interested in child law but want a more relaxed version of the PoliSci course, take this class. The readings include readings from outside of the case law book which makes it more interesting and Judge Garfinkel is really flexible with due dates so its a great class to fit into your schedule if you have a busy schedule. We talk about a ton of different child law cases, including topics like foster care, termination of parental rights, juvenile courts, and abortion.",
    "The course is an overview of the issues affecting children within our legal system. We discussed a series of Court decisions, issues in the medical field, and nuances of the foster care system. We had a number of guest speakers--who span beyond the field of law. I would highly recommend the course! One of the best I've taken during my time at Yale, and Judge Garfinkel is basically the greatest person ever. Not a high workload, but I walked away having learned a ton!",
    "Yes! I would recommend this class. It was really popular and hard to get in to, but I loved it. You need to write 25 pages over the semester, but this can be submitted anytime, and broken down into whatever format (long essay, short essay, reading responses, interviews, etc.) you like best.",
    "It's a great class, particularly if you're interested in law but also if you have any investment in children's issues. While reading court cases can be exhausting, there's a huge amount of material that's of interest to future educators, social workers, parents, doctors, just citizens--the issues covered in the class have impacts you haven't even conceived of. It's a great first exposure to things, and Judge Garfinkel does a tremendous job supplying supplementary material and leaving room for you to delve deeper into the issues that interest you most. Wouldabsolutely recommend it. Literally the only downside is the 7 pm Thursday meeting time...",
    "Wonderful course, amazing professor. Judge Garfinkel does a great job of integrating so many different and complex topics into an organized way. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I also liked the flexibility of the assignments in the course (about 25 pages throughout the semester).",
    "Such a great class - you should definitely take it if you get in! It appeals to a wide range of interests, even within the area of child policy, so you get students from a lot of different backgrounds and thus get really fascinating perspectives on every topic we discuss. It was a bit more legally-based than I expected, and I found some topics more interesting than others, but overall I learned so much. There is quite a bit of reading each week, but you learn what's important and what you can skim over. The work for the class is very flexible: the standard is 5 reading responses and a 10 page paper, but you have a lot of freedom and options (I recommend interviewing someone and writing a paper on it for your final paper!). Most importantly, Judge Garfinkel is one of the most caring, amazing professors I've ever had. He is very supportive and encouraging, an expert in the field, and such a wonderful person we were so lucky to get to know. Plus he brings in awesome guest speakers. Take it, one of my favorites!",
    "Take it. It's awesome!",
    "Absolutely. See Question 1.",
    "Child, family, and state is an amazing course. The workload is very flexible--you just have a set number of pages you have to write by the end of the semester and you can choose to do that in one swoop by writing a lengthy final paper on a topic of your choice, or choose to do so in smaller reading responses. The reading is extensive, but it's not required that you do all of it. While the course was certainly demanding, it was easy to manage as one of five courses.",
    "Interesting class, covers a good range of topics regarding children and the law: education, healthcare, child abuse& neglect, juvenile delinquency, abortion, etc. Professor Garfinkel is very sweet and amazingly flexible about assignments - the class wasn't too much work, and you were free to choose the pace at which you completed assignments (which could be both a good thing and a bad thing - if you procrastinate, make sure you're strict about setting a schedule for yourself). I enjoyed the class a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for everyone.",
    "Yes! This seminar is great! Professor Garfinkel is wonderful and always leads great discussions. The workload is great because it's really relaxed, you have to do enough reading responses and papers, but you can do them on your own schedules. Great course, especially if you're self-motivated and like developing your own path of study.",
    "A lot of reading, and flexible reading responses. Weekly discussion can get tiring, but depending on the subject can be engaging. I'd recommend only if you are very interested in the subject."
