    "Learned a ton of Chinese - we got into more focused units for this semester: economy, cinema, history\/culture, and media. It was great to dive more deeply and learn more substantive stuff - I really feel like I can carry on a deep conversation about these things.",
    "My speaking fluency really improved this semester. I'm able to discuss a much broader range of topics after taking CHNS 151.",
    "CHNS 151 is a great class to help develop your abilities in Chinese beyond conversational level. You continue to learn a variety of in-depth, relevant topics that will help any speaker hold an intellectual conversation in Chinese. The topics and discussions help you uncover some of the nuances of Chinese culture and allow you to frame current events within a new mindset.",
    "An extremely useful and practical understanding of Modern Chinese as used in media, film, economics, and life.",
    "CHNS 150\/151 both emphasize more formal language, with a touch of classical and literary Chinese. Most of what is taught would never be used in daily conversation, but rather encountered in writing or in more formal situations (like speeches, news broadcasts, etc.) I think it was a good class to learn those things, but because you don't use or encounter formal speech everday, it is easy to forget."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - they reformatted the class so that the teachers now spend 2 days presenting each text within the chapter (instead of 1) which makes the class SO much better. Last semester, the teachers would straight up not finish a good portion of the content because they ran out of time, but now we have time to finish all of it and then do speaking activities or roleplaying. Teachers are very good and very flexible, but just as importantly they're very fun. Wang Laoshi is very sassy and makes fun of the students in a hilarious way, and Zhang Laoshi is silly and sweet. Both of the teachers genuinely care about us and want us to improve, but also care about how we are doing in our lives. You'll see them for five hours per week - you'll get close. The only weakness of this class that I perceive is that speaking opportunities are definitely harder to come by. This is probably due to the complexity of the topics and the difficulty of presenting all the information, but regardless, it's not like L1\/L2 where you're constantly answering questions\/repeating after the teacher. It's less interactive, which is disappointing, but you still learn a lot.",
    "The format this semester was quite good, though perhaps a bit too lax. I retained fewer characters this semester, although I do agree that the modifications to the quizzes and homework are a step in the right direction.",
    "I think this close is very well suited to helping you hold conversations with substance and depth in Chinese. I do think they are so minutiae that are taught that could potentially be eliminated (some of the lessons have 50+ words you learn in a day, they all can't be extremely important), but overall, you're taught the things that I believe to be essential for broadening your speaking and thinking ability.",
    "Extremely well taught with fabulous teaching staff, but with a very heavy workload.",
    "Strengths: I'm SO glad Wang Laoshi (Yu-lin Wang Saussy) decided to teach CHNS 151 my semester (Spring 2017). She and Zhang Laoshi co-taught after Li Laoshi (Rongzhen Li) left for maternity leave. She really changed the class around for the better: we had more time to spend on each lesson, after Wang Laoshi got rid of the taolun (discussion) days, which were honestly a joke and not helpful in CHNS 150. Because we have more time to spend on each lesson, each day would have a little discussion, which was so much better. There was still a lot of work for sure, but it was more spread out and even among the days. (As opposed to CHNS 150, where the first two days were a lot of work trying to cram both parts of the lesson, with the latter two days being a lot more relaxed). Weaknesses: Literally, none. Great course, by this time you probably know at least one of the teachers so they're really flexible and accommodating with deadlines and assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Absolutely take this class if you want to continue with Chinese. The workload is heavy, to be certain, but it's very predictable, and your grade is fully within your hands. Teachers are great and very accommodating\/flexible, and the class is fun. You'll get close with the students in your class and with the teacher.",
    "Definitely! Keep taking Chinese at Yale, it will only improve and the gains after taking L5 are quite noticeable.",
    "Take this class if you are dedicated towards continuing and making an expanded effort to improving your Chinese. It's a great way to talk about current events, modern Chinese history, and contemporary culture because of the vocabulary and class structure. I found myself being able to speak more fluidly and with better focus.",
    "I would absolutely recommend students take this course to continue their Chinese study, it is truly a fabulous continuation and the teaching staff is wonderful and well worth the additional work. Can't recommend strongly enough!",
    "Great course! Would highly recommend taking if Wang Laoshi is teaching in addition to Zhang Laoshi. If it is Li Laoshi, I might reconsider."
