    "Slow at times, but a good way to maintain your Japanese skills. Hiroe-sensei is funny and very knowledgeable about many things, especially things related to Japanese academic writings (articles written by political scientists, politicians, old Japanese, etc.).",
    "Fifth-Year Japanese is a pretty good way to keep your skills up, although it\u0092s easy to forget some basic vocab from earlier Japanese courses. Professor Hiroe is experienced and knows his stuff. He\u0092s always available to meet, which is helpful. The class is not as lively\/energetic as the earlier years, but on the whole I am glad I took the class to keep up my Japanese. You\u0092ll encounter a good number of heritage learners in this class, and it helps your accent to listen to all of them. Also, there is no final exam, which makes the experience a lot less stressful."
