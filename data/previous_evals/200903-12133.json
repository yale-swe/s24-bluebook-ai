    "I like Romantic poetry very much, but I did not like this course at all. I felt that Brisman's treatment of it was very dry, and the humanity in which the Romantics were so interested was really lost. I would have dropped it if I could have afforded to.",
    "This course is central to the English major. Romantic poetry seems so crucial to the further history of both English poetry and prose that it is perhaps more important for an English major today to read Wordsworth than Chaucer. As taught now, there is much lingering over individual passages; this is Professor Brisman's style. Professor's Brisman's style is an aspect of the course that must be reckoned with. One either likes receiving a moral education through parables and exegesis, or one does not. If one does, there are, honestly, few places to get it, and this may account for the degree to which the same people take his classes again and again. Like Steven Smith for the conservatives, say, or Moira Fradinger for the arty left, Professor Brisman has a distinctive niche at Yale, though, perhaps to his credit, it's hard to figure out what that niche is--a faith both mild and severe, some heterodox version of Bloomian psychoanalysis, something one cannot put one's finger on. You read very good poems. My one quibble is that because, in his infinite kindness, Professor Brisman won't turn anyone away, the class will never really be a seminar.Evaluating Brisman is like evaluating a Dickens character: one is so drawn to enumerate the foibles and idiosyncrasies that one loses sight of the main task. He is very kind, both in and out of class discussion. He likes to draw something from even the most fumbling response one gives. He tells strange, improbable stories. He begins each class by putting a quotation on the board. He cares about students; when one is in the middle of writing a very bad paper, one sometimes wishes he did not care. Discussions are mostly structured, though I believe he secretly likes to be forced off on a detour (he must be forced though--he will not go gentle). He lectures very prettily, though my favorite part of class (which happened less here than in his senior seminar) is when he asks you a very tricky question in response to your first answer.For some idiotic reason, I guess, these evaluations go only to people who already know these things about Professor Brisman. For those people, there's no purpose to this question; I protest now, as I have protested for my whole time at Yale in every evaluation I write. Evaluations should be available, in their totality, to students! They should be a serious part of Yale culture, and should be individually designed by teachers to really answer questions they actually have! For this reason, I will copy and paste all previous responses into text box four, even though, in my experience, this never works.I only know the TA through his grading of my papers; I think this is a very bad system. I write papers for people--the person who's taught me for a semester, whom I think I have come to know and appreciate. I cannot write papers for nameless abstractions. In one of my papers, Mr. Ferhatovic objected to a peculiar choice I made in ending the paper. It was a fair objection, I guess, but of course I'd chosen this weird conclusion because I thought Professor Brisman would appreciate it... anonymous reading is the one lame part of the class as currently configured.",
    "It's a great class - really teaches you to read poetry in a way that a lot of other Yale English classes don't.",
    "Take it. It is a good junior seminar without a lot of work. Only three papers nicely spread out over the term.",
    "Take this if you like the poetry, or if you are interested in becoming interested in Romantic poetry. This class makes the poetry interesting, brings out interpretive issues in poems that you read at first and think you \"get.\" Be warned of the no grades on papers policy--as I leave this comment, I still have no idea whether I'm getting a great grade or a mediocre one. A lot of reading, but good reading over all.",
    "Romantic Poetry studies the main works of romantic poetry. The class is 3\/8 lecture, 5\/8 discussion, and most of the class time is devoted to close reading within the broader context ofthe themes across romantic poetry. Don't take this class unless a) you need to fulfill an English major requirement (like, you skipped 125b and need another class that fits the authors) or b) you REALLY like romantic poetry.",
    "I would no recommend English 250 to students for the following reasons:-It is not the sort of seminar that you want to enroll in, that is, one that will be vigorous and rigorous, stimulating on points at which it should be stimulating.-It is not as compelling as you might expect it to be.-What i got out of the class was not as much as I did not get out of it.That being said, you might still like Brisman's teaching style. So: shop his two classes for sure.",
    "English 250 is a fascinating introduction to Romanticism. The poetry can be dense but Professor Brisman leads the course kindly and tries to meet students where they are. The structure and requirements of the course are accommodating to a range of student knowledge and schedules.I would recommend English 250 to students who are interested in thinking more deeply about nature, the revolutionary spirit, sympathy, and Protestantism, and who have the time to dissect what can be difficult poetry.",
    "Romantic poetry is a difficult class that really requires you to give your all. Be prepared to work very hard, but also to be fully rewarded. Reading the Prelude with Professor Brisman is the experience of a lifetime, and the Romantic poets discussed in the class are all crucial to an education in English literature. Professor Brisman is extraordinary and inspiring; he poses difficult questions to the class and has very exacting standards, but he is always kind and encouraging.",
    "This is a very good class that pays close attention to the particulars of the material and the era. The introductory sequence on the Romantic Sublime, Romanticism and Protestantism, and Romantic Sympathy was especially well polished.Professor Brisman is a generous seminar leader who does really great work with our essays. His comments were unusually perceptive and helpful. He covers a lot of ground in section but also makes an effort to get everybody involved. Brisman has a wonderful ability to relate the material to his life experiences; this only became problematic when it became polemical.",
    "This is not a class to be taken lightly. The reading is heavy all sense of the word. Also, having no grades during the semester is a little terrifying. It would help if you already like Wordsworth. If you're on the fence about hi, you won't be by the end of the semester.Brisman is a genius who not only obviously loves the material, but embodies romantic ideals.Of course, that means that you probably shouldn't take this course unless you're going to try to take it with an intense seriousness at least sort of close to his.Hardcore.",
    "This class is a good survey of the Romantics, although the heavy reading list makes it difficult to study any individual poet in depth. Professor Brisman is a dedicated and sensitive teacher, and his personal anecdotes are always entertaining.",
    "yes, absolutely it's perfect",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you love Romantic poetry with a fiery, fiery passion that will overcome anything. I came in with a mild interest, hoping that through this class, I would come to really appreciate and love Romantic poetry, but that did not happen--quite the opposite, in fact. I appreciate that Brisman tried to really structure the class, concentrating discussions on a single idea. I understand that he was trying to push us to really think deeply and read closely, but it often stifled discussion. For instance, the class might begin with a very difficult question, which people in the class would have difficulty answering, and there might be many moments of silence. Finally, a few people might attempt a groping-in-the-dark-I-don't-really-know-what-I-am-saying answer. At the end of class, I usually felt like I walked away with many such groping-in-the-dark viewpoints on a poem, but that such viewpoints didn't really comment or respond to one another, the way a good discussion should. I get the sense that class was intensely boring and painful for some people. We also might read 1500 lines of poetry a night(as when we were covering The Prelude) and then discuss a total of 10 lines in class. Sure, this is great for close reading, but I really could have used more musing over how the poem works as a whole, or connects to other poems\/poets we had already read. I also think that Brisman, despite his best efforts, played favorites, often calling on the same few people when discussion flagged.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It really gives a comprehensive and interesting view of Romantic Poetry, and you couldn't find a more enthusiastic professor than Professor Brisman.",
    "I would recommend the course to ANYONE with an interest in poetry."
