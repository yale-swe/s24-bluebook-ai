    "I think the course spends too much time having us informally chat with faculty versus coupling informal networking with intentional skill-building exercises led by faculty experts. However, I did appreciate having the chance to ask questions and learn from\/about the experiences of faculty members in our department.",
    "More focus on professional development skills",
    "I enjoyed hearing from the faculty. However, I felt like at times they said too much about their interests and not enough about the professionalization piece. I definitely wanted to meet them and hear about their work, but it is called \"professional seminar\" for a reason - so I expected professionalization topics to be discussed."

    "Necessary for all first year phD students",
    "Yes, but I'd recommend they ask that there be specific talk about professionalization."
