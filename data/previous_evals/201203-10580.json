    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Although the course is intended to introduce students to a broad array of methods and topics in bioinformatics, students should not expect to learn much in great depth. In this sense, I found the course to be rather disappointing.",
    "It gives a general introduction covering nearly all active areas in bioinformatics.",
    "Overall useful but also an annoying amount of busy work (mainly the discussion session).",
    "I could highly recommend this course to students who want to understand bioinformatics as an introducting course.",
    "I would summarize this course as a class that explains what bioinformatics is and how it can be applied in the field. This course also goes into how to use the tools bioinformatists use and what the results mean. I would recommend this course to another student because this course introduces what bioinformatics is and howit is used."
