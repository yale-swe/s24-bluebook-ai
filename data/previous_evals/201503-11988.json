   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are interest in political philosophy and\/or ethics. Professor Kapustin is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale.",
    "Moral Choices in Politics gives an excellent overview of important topics that involve ethics and politics (e.g., how the role of individual moral conscience interacts with the need for social stability\/cohesion, the demands of social justice, the question of civil disobedience, the question of political violence and revolution, the sacrifices that politics entails). You read interesting thinkers and writers like Che, Fanon, Arendt, Gandhi, Niebuhr, Plato, and Robespierre. Professor Kapustin is an amazing teacher, and class was always highly stimulating and thought-provoking. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Take this class and learn from it. Treasure the chance to have a curated walk through some of history's most important texts.",
    "A great way to learn about leading political philosophers and theorists. Would definitely recommend for those who are interested.",
    "Good seminar on broad range of topics",
    "If you're considering taking this class, carefully look over the syllabus and think about if the topics truly interest you. I ran into trouble b\/c I was really interested in the 1st half of the class where you read Gandhi and Che Guevara and it's really practical info, but the 2nd half was much more theoretical (Plato, etc..) and was less my thing. So, read the whole syllabus. It's a class full of smart upperclassman EP&E and Poli Sci majors, which can be really cool. People really know their stuff. Kapustin lectures for at least 1\/2 of each seminar which is nice b\/c he really does help explain things and bring them together in a way that would be hard without him, but there isn't tons of student talking, and when he does ask you to talk you feel very pressured to answer the \"right\" answer. Overall not tons of work and graded pretty easy.",
    "A must take, it provides a strong and deep foundation on political theory and how it relates to normative questions.",
    "I strongly believe that every student should be able to take a class with Professor Kapustin at least once during their time at Yale. This was a great class.",
    "Kapustin is incredible. An amazing lecturer and a very attentive feedback-giver. Readings are varied, some better than others, but interesting on the whole. That said, be ready for a competitive atmosphere - the kids who take this class are very EP&E, and by that I mean YDN.",
    "EP&E is an intense, discussion-based seminar on political and ethical thinking about violence, insurrection, civil disobedience, leadership, and ultimately the balance of the roles of thinker and actor in politics. It had a ton of reading, but once you got into it they were always very interesting. The more you put into it, the more you get out of it - which can be an astonishing amount. One of the best courses I've ever taken - I would recommend it if the thinkers on the syllabus appeal to you and you are ready to do some deep thinking about politics, personal obligations, society, and ethics.",
    "Professor Kapustin's courses always are extremely oversubscribed during shopping week. Which is to say that those of us who are in \"the know\" are aware that he is something of a legend on Yale's campus and that if you are one of the lucky few selected to take his seminars, you will not be disappointed. I've been lucky enough to take every course that he teaches. He's one of the two greatest professors I have ever learned from. This course, \"Critique of Political Violence,\" and \"Classics of EP&E\" are life-changing. Mind-blowing. Anyone who cares at all about political theory, particularly the theoretical part, is doing themselves a tremendous disservice by not taking his courses. I wish, for the edification of students of politics and ethics everywhere, that Professor Kapustin would compose three books that recapitulate and expand on exactly what he teaches in each of his three courses at Yale. Take all of his courses if you can.",
    "A fantastic and engaging class on an incredibly important topic. Not about contemporary politics but informs your opinion on them.",
    "Amazing class, highly recommended for anyone with an interest in political philosophy.",
    "Amazing class. Take it if you can! It's different from his other seminars to a point. I've taken all three and enjoyed each one immensely. They are not redundant! Take it take it take it. Kapustins take on Rawls and Mannheim in particular were brliant.",
    "Overall would highly recommend this course and everything that previous reviews have said are true. I always looked forward to class each week, because Professor Kapustin's command of the material and ability to synthesize complex philosophical ideas is incredible. It was exhilarating at times. He is not only incredibly smart but he truly cares that his students walk away understanding the material. The reading list alone is excellent, and Kapustin is definitely one of the best professors that I have had in three and a half years at Yale. Please take this course if you get in you really won't regret it."
