   "comments": [
    "A wholesome overview of biophysical research techniques ranging from structural biology to dynamics. Yes I would, this provides a good fundamental base of knowledge for everyone to continue into more advanced studies.",
    "Gotta risk it to get the biscuit. It's not that bad; it just...is",
    "Excellent survey course for biophysics of macromolecules.",
    "This class goes over biophysical methods which are important to know, but can be very difficult to understand.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a new first year (as if they had a choice) and tell them that it will definitely be hard but incredibly rewarding.",
    "I would recommend the course, but since the interaction with the TAs is very important in the course, I suggest that the TAs are prepared for this course more thoroughly.",
    "This course will take you on a journey of the popular topics in molecular biophysics and structural biology. It is a very challenging class but you will learn a lot out of it. I would recommend it to other fellow students.",
    "It's a lot of work. If the student were to take the course, I would warn them to take easy courses at the same time to have an even workload. If they have a weak biochemistry background, they'll want to take an additional class either before or at the same time. Biophysics majors who lack organic chemistry or biochemistry classes in their past face a much greater challenge when taking this course.",
    "This class summarizes the most useful and powerful tools in the field of biophysics and biochemistry. I personally think that the course helps a lot. I would recommend this course to another student, but would also recommend to review or take biochemistry first.",
    "This class is challenging but I learned a lot. I would recommend this class to another student because it gives an introduction to many popular topics in macromolecular structure and structure determination.",
    "I would summarize the course as a great class to get an overview of modern and classic biochemistry\/biophysical techniques and the jargon. I would say it is an essential course for anyone interested in structural biochemistry. I would definitely recommend this course for that reason.",
    "I definitely would recommend the course to any student who wishes to understand structure of macromolecules and\/or is interested in learning the techniques used in elucidating macromolecular structure.",
    "A very good class to cover lots of different techniques used in biochemical, biophysical and structural research and the basis of marcomolecules and their interactions.",
    "This class is a great opportunity to be exposed to an array of techniques that can help ones research so i would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "This course is useful for students interested in pursuing structural studies of biological macromolecules as it lays a broad foundation for the types of biological systems and biophysical techniques used to study them."

   "comments": [
    "It greatly enhanced my knowledge of X-ray crystallography, which I may be interested in for my research. The kinetics section did not contribute greatly to my interest in transient kinetics.",
    "I know a lot of general things about biophysics. Since the department I'm most likely joining is MB&B, this is important.",
    "I feel that this course heavily contributed to my preparedness for life as a Yale graduate student and a scientist in general",
    "I learned a lot of new techniques, which I was not exposed to before, like X-ray crystallography and microscopy. This course gave me a very broad understanding of the current state in the field.",
    "This course showed me the interesting topics and techniques used in modern molecular biophysics and structural biology. I have also used a few of the techniques I learned from this course in my rotations.",
    "I did learn a lot from this class. I think most of the techniques we covered I had either limited experience of beforehand or none. I know far more about NMR, Cryo-EM, X-Ray crystallography, and single-molecule experiments than I did at the start of the semester.",
    "I get to know a lot of techniques that I have only heard about in undergrad. I think it helps me a lot getting a basics and overview of the field.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of biophysics and structure determination. I plan to join a more biochemical related research lab, so the techniques I learned in this class won't be as applicable compared to if I was joining a biophysics lab. However, I still feel that the information I learned in this class is really important and will help me in the future.",
    "This course was extremely helpful for providing an in-depth introduction to topics I need to be familiar with for my field. I feel conversant in all of the topics covered.",
    "It was amazing in every aspect, from deepening my understanding of macromolecular structure to learning different techniques used in elucidating macromolecular structure to deciding the most appropriate technique for answering a particular question, it was a great course.",
    "The course gave me the tools for my qualifying exam in the fall.",
    "This course was a great introductory course into an array to techniques that can be applied to any research interest.",
    "This course was helpful in setting the background for the research I will conduct. Although I will not delve deeply into all areas that were covered in this course, I thought it was very helpful in introducing the relevant research questions that are being addressed by scientists in the field today."
