    "In the course, we cover major works of HCS. We also learn about various logics of inquiry that structure HCS. I would recommend it. It was a great place to gain a broad understanding of the subfield. The works we read are fundamental and it is more helpful to read as part of a group. It was also helpful as a refresher on logics of inquiry. It is always fruitful to return to the basics of social science research.",
