   "comments": [
    "You must take this class. The first hour consists of lecture while the second is mostly student presentations. You get to listen as well as speak your ideas.",
    "Spanish 660 is the opportunity to dedicate a semester to the study of the greatest book ever written. Even those who are slightly less effusive in their praise of \"Don Quijote\" cannot deny the profound influence that this work has had in the literary history not only of Spain, but of the whole western tradition. This course covers the entire book in detail, highlighting its most significant themes and innovations. It is a combination lecture\/seminar in which students are taught the critical interpretations that have had the greatest impact on Quijote scholarship while being encouraged to interact with the text for themselves, coming up with new approaches. I would highly recommend the course for all students. You simply cannot claim to be a specialist in Spanish literature of any epoch, genre, theme, or nationality without having read the Quijote at least once. I believe even those who are initially reluctant to do so will leave this course enthused.",
    "This course consists of a leisurely-paced reading of Don Quixote in its entirety, and sparks interesting class discussions about the book. I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "Spanish 660 will invite you to do an in-depth (re)reading of Don Quijote. Through class activities and readings, you will have the opportunity to closely examine student and professor-selected passages and to study different episodes in the novel from a variety of critical perspectives. You will leave the class with an understanding of the extent to which Cervante's master novel has influenced the inheritors of his literary experimentation.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anybody who is interested in the novel - it changed my way of reading novels. I think one cannot think about the novel without reading - and close-reading - Don Quixote. It is a great lesson in reading in general.The course is great, because Pr. Echevarria has a very generous and wide approach to the texts - both textual and historical."

   "comments": [
    "Every student of Spanish needs to be familiar with the Quijote, so this class is very relevant in our department. Also, the emphasis on related theories and the influence of the Quijote on other authors helped to make this text from over four hundred years ago relevant to studies of any era.",
    "While I had read the book before, as well as much of the secondary scholarship, there is so much to the Quijote that every reading reveals new insights, new interpretations, and new perspectives on the text. The course introduced me to a wide variety of criticism written on the book and drew my attention to episodes that I had previously passed over.",
    "This course is essential for a Spanish major or graduate student. The Quixote and its impact on Spanish literature are crucial to an understanding of this discipline, and the high level of criticism and commentary on the book provide a wonderful opportunity for graduate students to familiarize themselves with the world of academia.",
    "I read Don Quijote for the first time in this seminar, so I benefited greatly from the course content, especially considering Cervantes' influence on his successors. The course also helped me develop close-reading skills and encouraged me to evaluate my writing more critically. Knowledge of the Quijote and an ability to place it within its historical context are essential for studying Hispanic literature in general and for the comprehensive exams specifically.",
    "As I wrote above, Don Quixote taught me how to be a better reader."
