    "This course really helped me improve in all aspects of my Chinese, from my pronunciation and vocabulary, to even essay writing and reading.",
    "I improved my fluency and vocabulary in Chinese.",
    "I was able to improve my Chinese communication, reading, and writing skills.",
    "Felt like my Chinese reading improved a lot, and my understanding of Chinese culture improved just as much. My ability to do rote memorization probably increased too.",
    "A lot of writing and speaking chinese, along with reading lessons. By far the area I think I've improved most in is my writing ability, and my vocabulary range has also greatly expanded. My speaking also benefitted quite a bit. Lots of progress in not a lot of time!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Not only did I improve my Chinese, but we also discussed topics on Chinese-American identity. It was meaningful exploring my own background, as well as learning about the backgrounds of my classmates.",
    "I developed stronger skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening in Chinese.",
    "I learned reading and writing skills. The course is well structured, lots of vocabulary, very well taught. Speaking skills have also increased."

   "comments": [
    "This course taught a surprising amount of material in just one semester! I do think however that it can teach more applicable topics (e.g. words often used in everyday conversation vs. words related to art and pottery)",
    "The course was very well designed, and even though I didn't feel like I was putting in too much work, my Chinese improved!",
    "Course was good at allowing students to quickly learn a language to near fluency. However, the design of the course was poor. The exams were not evenly spaced and the time commitment needed for the course was not reasonable. It would help to have the class meet less times per week.",
    "Wang Laoshi is HILARIOUS and really kind, and that makes taking this class worth it, even though it's a lot of work. She really makes an effort to tie the class to real world events, and she has some really cool assignments - like going to an art museum and making a dubbed short movie. The best parts about this class are how we learn about Chinese culture. The lessons about American culture might be a little bit too simplistic, but other than that they were great. I also didn't find the workload to be that bad. Wang Laoshi spaces the assignments out pretty well. Feedback on essays is really great, and Wang Laoshi is really helpful in making corrections to things. Would have loved if Wang Laoshi uploaded things (like new lessons and lesson schedules) earlier. I think a couple of times she uploaded them in the evening and night, and it would have been nice to start working on things earlier in the day. Not a big deal though. It would really be nice to incorporate usage lessons more. In our class, people kept asking what the difference between \"Chinese Word One\" and \"Chinese Word Two,\" and we didn't always have time for that. It was also a BIG part of the final exam and everyone I talked to thought that section was ridiculously hard, and we didn't feel prepared for that. The biggest downside to this class is that the tests are kinda tricky. Some of the sections I felt like didn't contribute much to my learning (fill in the blank without a word bank, for example). The tests also tested \"extras\" like Chinese sayings\/phrases.",
    "Perhaps not enough focus on reading a lot of texts would be my only concern, but the amount of progress EVERYONE made in every facet was truly incredible!",
    "Wang Laoshi is absolutely fantastic. She is energetic and makes the class fun and interesting. She is also incredibly empathetic, able to engage everyone in the classroom even though we all have different backgrounds and personalities.",
    "The strength of this course is that there are many different ways that you get to learn the material.",
    "Very engaging, small class sizes helped facilitate learning.",
    "There is a consistent workload with different activities every week. This is good because it allows students to strengthen reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills.",
    "- Strengths: grammar focused exercises good job working around explaining things in English - Weaknesses: would like more writing practice"

    "I would really recommend this course. Wang Laoshi is a great teacher and as a result the course has really facilitated the improvement of my Chinese skills. This class was also very enjoyable overall!",
    "Highly recommend! is great and extremely engaging, so class was never boring.",
    "Would recommend to a student prepared to put in large commitment and time to studying daily. Great way to learn a language and is a fulfilling course!",
    "YES! Take it. Wang Laoshi is like the cool mom you never had. She's hilarious and really kind, and that makes taking this class worth it, even though it's a lot of work. She really makes an effort to tie the class to real world events, and she has some really cool assignments - like going to an art museum and making a dubbed short movie. The best parts about this class are how we learn about Chinese culture. I also didn't find the workload to be that bad. Wang Laoshi spaces the assignments out pretty well. Feedback on essays is really great, and Wang Laoshi is really helpful in making corrections to things. The tests are kind of difficult but other than that it's not too bad.",
    "YES! Wang Laoshi is one of the most incredible and caring teachers I've had. She really likes to have a lot of fun during class to make it enjoyable for everyone, but her passion and love for teaching also makes large scale learning possible. Loved every bit of it! Please take! Only thing I'd warn about is the workload, which is tangibly greater than your average course. Definitely worth it though!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Not only did I improve my Chinese, but we also discussed topics on Chinese-American identity. It was meaningful exploring my own background, as well as learning about the backgrounds of my classmates.",
    "Wang Laoshi really cares about her students and not just about them learning Chinese but actually about how they are doing. She creates a really fun and exciting learning environment that makes you look forward to class everyday. Overall, I think this class was a really great introduction to my own heritage, and I now am really interested in what it means to Chinese and Chinese in america.",
    "The workload is fairly heavy, but you will learn a lot. There are daily quizzes which force studying basically daily. Teacher is very funny, nice and engaging.",
    "There are audio recordings and quizzes every day, and an essay about every other week. It is a good amount of work, but you will notice improvement in your Chinese if you work hard.",
    "Yes, I think the class is very well taught, though I believe the skill level is highly variable in the beginning. Everyone made lots of progress, though I think for some people it was more challenging. The most important thing is to gauge your skill level during shopping period.",
    "Yes, especially those who are native speakers learning to improve their chinese language skill"
