    "I learned about techniques that are useful for development as well as for other areas of research.",
    "this is a remarkable course that radically deepened my knowldege of development, genetics, and the way that life forms.",
    "-Learned how to constructively read the paper and analyze the data. -Learned how to devise hypothesis-driven experiment",
    "I took this class as someone with essentially no background in developmental biology or genetics (I'm in biomedical engineering), so for me this course was about being introduced to the language, tools, and techniques of these fields - it accomplished that goal."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The quality of lectures varied very widely between professors. One day everyone would be very engaged, asking questions, answering questions, generally comprehending the material, but the next day (new professor) only a few students could grasp the lecture because they had existing knowledge of the subject. My advice would be to ensure the professors assume that their student audience a) does not have any experience in the professors' field and b) may not have any experience with development, genetics, mouse models, human disease, etc.",
    "Strengths: Going over very interesting papers on current work done in important developmental aspects. Weaknesses: None that I can think of",
    "strength: discussion of papers weakness: could have lectures be more engaging with the class participating more",
    "I liked the structure of the class\/discussion because it introduced me to some current literature i the field. I think the assignments were nice (better than having exams), but I don't know if they were particularly useful in testing things I learned in this class.",
    "I think the course jumped quite a bit in topics in development from the beginning. I could follow the first few lectures with basics on early development. Once we got to more detailed aspects of development, I felt like I was listening to lectures that could have been entire courses themselves.",
    "There should be better communication between the professors.",
    "Brilliant course plan. I loved it. Wonderful material, nice organization, even liked doing the assignments.",
    "Could have been better if materials are covered prior to home-work assignment (i.e paper summary)",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures and the chance to hear from multiple faculty members. The 50:50 split of each class between lecture and TA-led discussion was a good balance, and I always enjoyed the discussions. I generally thought the paper choices were great."

   "comments": [
    "Despite the weaknesses of some of the professors in lecture quality, overall the course was intellectually stimulating, generally interesting, helped build skill in evaluating and discussing scientific articles from outside my field of study, and was a comfortable environment for learning (~12 students in class)",
    "Yup, especially if you are planning on doing work in development. It was good to review a lot of the important pathways and processes in development.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes. The course gives the students a feel for the types of questions that are addressed in the field of development while teaching them techniques that are relevant to other fields.",
    "Yes. Take it. Perfect for those interested in tissue science, systems bio, development, and tissue engineering.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about development through a seminar style course. More often than not I left class very excited\/surprised\/intrigued about something I had just learned."
