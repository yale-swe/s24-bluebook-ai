    "An informative approach to the art of Hadrian which strives to connect the material culture with larger issues of historical and literary contexts. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course certainly. I think it is a shame more students did not take the course, but at the same time it was nice to be in such a small class. It made the atmosphere much more informal. I think the theoretical aspects of the course may be applied to other time periods so I think the course would have been beneficial for people in diverse fields of interest."

   "comments": [
    "Because my interests lie in more recent art history, when I want to read about the intentions and receptions and other aspects of an artwork's context, I just go and look it up. The Hadrian course was challenging insofar as I was forced often to speculate about the function and contexts of artworks of which we have very little knowledge. This was very helpful for my thinking because I have often been fearful of overstepping my interpretive bounds. This course, like many courses on the classical world I presume, provoked us to speculate, which lead me to think creatively about the subject matter in ways that I am often prohibited from doing by the immense archival material in my own field of specialty."
