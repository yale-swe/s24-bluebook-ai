   "comments": [
    "not a gut, but still an interesting new field within mathematics. It's not hard if you go to class and pay attention.",
    "Very, very fair, organized, and straightforward QR. Best QR I've taken at Yale.",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Frame makes every single second worth it.",
    "Extremely interesting introduction to fractal geometry and chaos theory. Sometimes more practical applications would have been nice, but overall I feel like I actually learned a lot!",
    "Math 190 showed a class of diverse academic interests the stunningly simple beauty behind the most complex behaviours in the universe.",
    "A fascinating look at the world via fractals.",
    "Fractal geometry is a beautiful field of mathematics that can probably be applied in useful and cool ways to whatever else you're interested in. Definitely take this course if it is offered again.",
    "Fractal Geometry was definitely much harder than what I heard. It took a while for some of the concepts to sink in, but going to the TA's office hours frequently and doing practice exams really helps!",
    "Definitely take the course - it's very interesting and Professor Frame is excellent.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Math 190 to another student, but I would encourage to check out the material of the course or have another conversation with a student who had taken it to see how they would enjoy the class.",
    "An excellent course for appreciating the math behind the beauty in the natural world.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Not the gut that I hoped it to be. Workload isn't over bearing, but the material can get away from you quickly if you allow it to.",
    "A great QR.",
    "Fractal geometry is a wonderful way to expand your mathematical thinking - it is technically considered to be a \"gut\" class, which makes the short assignments very doable, but there is much more to the course than the immediate problems that we are asked to solve. I would highly recommend this to both stem and humanities-oriented people (like myself).",
    "Fractals was a lot of fun. The problem sets were short but interesting and informative and Professor Frame is an absolute joy to learn from.",
    "Unfortunately, this class will not be offered anymore, but if it was, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone - any major. It is accessible to people not very comfortable with math, yet Professor Frame also goes over more complex topics that would be of interest to math majors. In other words, there's something for everyone.",
    "This class is dumb hard and there's actually no explanation for why."
