    "Very good course. Take it--it sounds like a niche topic, but there's tons of room for interesting research. Helped balance my perspective as someone from the north east.",
    "This is a great seminar. I was worried that the subject matter would be a little narrow or boring, but Southern California often speaks to themes of the nation as a whole, and Professor Faragher's ideas of California's myths of its own existence, and its belief in its own lack of history are really cool and and an interesting way to frame the course.Having to turn in a paper topic, prospectus and draft really early was kind of a pain at the time, but ended up being helpful by the end.Professor Faragher is awesome. Take the class even if you do'nt think you're interested in California...you will be!",
    "You should take it if you are looking for an intensive introduction to writing history research papers. It is more of a paper-writing workshop than conventional seminar, but by the end of the semester I really felt good about having gone through the months of effort to write an actual history paper.",
    "A great history jsem that really guides you through the process of writing a history thesis.The first half of the class consists of reading and discussion (a book a week, pretty standard). You're asked to start brainstorming topics pretty early on, and expected to start looking for sources and write a prospectus rather early in the semester. This is great though, because by the time you're three quarters of the way through the class you no longer have assigned reading and you just work on your paper. By making sure you're working on your paper from early on the semester, Prof. Faragher makes sure that you're ready to submit a rough draft two weeks before the end of the semester so you can peer edit and get a final copy in (without too much stress!) at the end of reading period.You end up being guided gently throughout the semester so if you follow along, the jsem paper is never too overwhelming. Plus, Faragher is a great professor who really knows his Southern California history.As a side note, don't worry if you're not from southern California. Half our class had never been, and they did just fine.",
    "Not much work at all. The paper is paced through the semester so you're not in a writing crunch at the end. JMF is a fun professor. A book a week assigned for reading, but you generally don't need to do it.",
    "Learn about southern california.",
    "Very solid class, Prof. Faragher is excellent",
    "Yes, I would take any class with Professor Faragher. L.A. history is really fascinating and the class is basically a white canvas to explore your interests. The hard part was having to lock onto one topic way early in the class, which is really difficult if, like me, it takes you awhile to pick your paper topics. It's a good chance to improve your writing, though.",
    "If you are a history major, you should take at least one junior seminar that is a research paper seminar, i.e., one where you develop a research topic by week 2-3, work on the paper the whole semester, have a rough draft by the end of class, and a final by reading week. It will give you a much more professional understanding of how to effectively research and write a paper, and will be very good practice for your thesis. There are not that many, and this is one of the better ones.",
    "I would recommend the class, especially if you're interested in Southern California.",
    "The class is perhaps better suited for those not from Southern California. If you have interest in land, water, or the history of Native American\/Spanish influence, definitely take it. If you prefer more contemporary Californian issues you might want to skip it."
