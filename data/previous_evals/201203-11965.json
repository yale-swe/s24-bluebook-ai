    "Yeah I think it's a good class and if you're just trying to fulfill the language requirement it's definitely a good way to go.",
    "I took it to complete the language requirement, but probably would not have otherwise.",
    "French 130 is an intermediate french course. It requires a lot of reading, but you will learn a lot.",
    "Overall I think FREN 130 is a good course. There is a good treatment of grammar and vocabulary--one learns the necessary constructions, but its treatment doesn't drown out the oral practice or discussion of the texts. The texts themselves are for the most part quite enjoyable.Sometimes the homework takes a while. I understand the importance of the \"listen and respond\" aspect of the online audio exercises, but the exercises were often quite time-consuming and sometimes felt arbitrary or unnecessarily drawn out. Especially in the second half of the semester, when the professor began to assign extra homework (beyond what was on the syllabus), it felt like a little much. The logistical acrobatics of the course were also a bit bothersome, between the materials online, the testing schedule, the need to print extra practice sheets, etc. It wasn't a big problem, and I understand the importance of such measures, but it felt unnecessarily complex at times."
