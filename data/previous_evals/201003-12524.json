    "Zhen hao!Zhen liaobuqi! This was my favorite class all semester. And although I wasn't the best student in my section, all my teachers were encouraging and SWEET. Strengths are the wonderful teachers and the constant drilling. You have class everyday plus a tutorial, so it's a class that keeps you at attention.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are looking to learn Chinese. Be warned though, you have to work...",
    "I would absolutely recommend CHNS 110 for any other student interested in learning a foreign language. However, be prepared to work. If you have no previous Chinese study, it will seem overwhelming at times (probably most of the time) and you'll have to put in the extra hours, but it's well worth it.",
    "Chinese 110 01 teaches you an amazing amount of useful vocabulary, grammar, characters, and fluency for just one semester. You memorize a dialogue for every day, seven characters, and usually about 10 to 20 new words. You have an exercise sheet that can take 0.5 to 1.5 hours, and you also have weekly recitations, translation exercises, and online listening quizzes. In summary, there is a ton of daily work but if you spread studying out through the day, it's not too bad.The whole time, you're in a section of about ten people, so you have many chances to speak. Never skip class or you will lose valuable practice (also, the teachers take off a percentage of your final grade for every class that you miss or come late to).Take the course if you are willing to spend about two hours outside of class studying - one hour doing homework, and one hour memorizing characters, dialogues, and vocabulary. Even if you don't plan to become fluent in Chinese, you learn enough in just one semester to have simple conversations about everyday things, like people, weather, family, bargaining, shopping, greetings, food, geography, etc..Don't take the course if you're looking for an easy way to get your language requirement out of the way - Chinese tones and characters make it one of the hardest languages at Yale. You need to spend more time dedicated to this class than you would for other languages that are more similar to English.",
    "I strongly recommend Chinese 110. The class is exceptionally well designed, and you will end the semester amazed at the amount of material that you have learned. A certain degree of dedication is important in learning the characters\/vocabulary, but if you are regimented about your studying, the class is fairly easy. Notably, the grades are not curved; the majority of students score quite well.",
    "i would recommend Chinese to anyone if you want to learn the language. the first month is pretty hard because you have to learn the tones, but once you really get that down, it's not a bad class at all.",
    "Take Chinese at Yale! This is one of the advantages Yalies can take during undergraduate years.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 110 to anybody who is interested in learning a language, and not just taking it to get the requirement done. If you're trying to do that, go take Latin or something. Chinese is a language that is very different from any romance or germanic language, and can be very difficult to learn, as consequence. With that said, I found it fun to learn, as well as interesting and challenging. If you're planning on actually using your language after you've learned it, take Chinese- not many non-Chinese speak it, and even fewer speak it well. Also, of course, China's growing prominence will enhance the usefulness of knowing how to speak Chinese.",
    "I would recommend Chinese to anyone who cares about China, or is somehow likely to be invested in its rise. Lets be honest; you'll only be learning Spanish for the sake of ticking the requirement box. Take Chinese to really give you an edge (and make you a lot more interesting of a person). Plus, lots of fun.",
    "Yale's Chinese language system is, I believe, one of the best ones in the entire country. Professors are very committed, and you learn a lot in a short period of time. The workload is not that much. All you have to do is catching up with daily lessons, which will take less than or around half an hour every day.",
    "Chinese 110 is the most difficult class I took this semester. The workload is doable but there is a lot of work--expect to spend more than an hour a night finishing the worksheet and memorizing the dialogue and characters for the next day (I think the teachers said two hours a night, but sometimes I finished in an hour and a half). The language itself is very interesting though, and the teachers really get to know you and care how you are doing. I would say this class is definitely worth the extra effort. I'm impressed at how much I've learned this semester.",
    "Chinese 110 01 is kind of intense. There are recordings to listen to and homework every night (definitely listento the recordings because they explain the grammar). It's great, though. I feel like I've learned a lot of Chinese.I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is a very time-intensive course (homework every night), but you learn so much that it is worth it. Grading is fair, though hard-work is needed in order to maintain an A. Excellent teachers: probably the best in the country. I would take it over Spanish any day.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but if you are interested in languages, Eastern Asia, or just curious about Chinese as a class - TAKE IT. I was on the fence at the start of the term, but I ended up taking it, and I'm very very glad I did. The teachers are very dedicated and good at what they do. Don't be scared away by the syllabus, the teachers are strict, but they are also reasonable.",
    "Yale's Chinese language program is known to be one of the best of the world, if not the best, and after this semester, I can definitely see why. The dialogues are what you would use in everyday conversation, the tones are drilled into you so that it becomes natural, and the grammar explanations are very thorough. The teachers are just as hard-working as the students and are always willing to spend extra time with you if you need help. Sure, the workload is about one to two hours a night, but if you want serious language study at Yale, take Chinese!",
    "Take this class. I made the mistake of waiting until sophomore year. It is wonderfully taught and a great subject.",
    "Chinese 110 is a lot of work but it is worth it. You are speaking in short dialogues by the second day. If you are willing to put in the work (I didn't spend the 3 hours\/day that they said, but it was a significant time commitment), this class is 100% worth it. My section bonded and has its own panlist, eats dim sum together at Great Wall, and hopes to stick together next semester. It's a really great class.",
    "If you want to take Chinese with a burning passion, the time is now and the place is here. If you don't fall behind and do your work, you will learn an immense amount of Chinese in semester. The teachers are incredible and all on board with the program; you can ask any one of them about any assignment and they will all be able to give you the same answer.From talking to students in beginning Chinese courses at other universities, they often talkabout the workload, but I've encountered no other course that puts as much emphasis on tones and pronunciation as the teachers do here. You get both five different teachers as well as a mandatory 25 minute tutoring session every week to work on your tones. I cannot stress enough the benefit of this.However, it is an incredible amount of work. You are essentially learning two languages: pinyin, and the characters themselves. You cannot fall behind, or you will not catch up. For a person accustomed to an alphabet and Romance languages, both the structure and the pedagogy will be a huge adjustment, as the learning is almost all memorization. As a result, the workload if approached properly in the first half of the semester should be around 3-4 hours a night. Also, be prepared for your section to be filled with people who have taken Chinese before. This will irritate you; welcome to Yale.",
    "very rewarding class. it's a lot of work, but you really learn Chinese. and if you do the work, you'll get an A.",
    "It is a lot of work, but so worth it. The teachers really care about you and class is fun. You will learn Chinese.",
    "Chinese 110 was my favorite class this fall semester. Don't let people scare you about the workload--yes, there is a lot of work and it can be easy to fall behind if you don't keep up for a couple days, but the class is structured really well. Basically, if you do what the teachers recommend you to do, you'll do well. You learn a lot, also. And the teachers are so fantastic! I love the teachers!",
    "Yes! It's great! You will learn so much! It helps you develop photographic memory! Not too much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese. It's a great language, both very interesting and very useful. The course is taught very well and you learn a lot through the semester. Despite the large workload, the work itself is not overwhelming and you get into a routine with it. The course is also designed so that if you do the work, you do not have to worry about your grade. The teachers are very engaging and the dynamics of the classes are very fun and entertaining.",
    "YES - try to take it in your freshman year because the Light Fellowship favours freshmen.",
    "At first, I was worried that it would be too overwhelming or that it would be a waste of time because I would never end up mastering the language. However, we covered so much material and the class is facilitated so well that I'm extremely happy with my decision to take this class. I look forward to next semester!",
    "Great way to learn a difficult language, wonderful experience.",
    "This class is a commitment: it meets every day and there's homework every day. But it's worth it because you learn so much Chinese in such a short period of time. The teacher's do so much and are so helpful.",
    "Chinese is very difficult to fail because of the help that te teachers are willing to offer",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You learn a lot more than you might expect you would and the professors are great.",
    "It was very intense yet very effective class.",
    "Yes, take it, but take it for the right reasons. Don't just take it for the Light or because you think it's a hard class.",
    "Faculty are awesome! Would definitely recommend, but please note that it's a lot of work, you have to do work every day and especially pay attention to your pronunciation. I recommend lots of speaking practice and writing characters. But the staff are great, your fellow students are great, and it's worth it.",
    "If you're at all interested in ever taking Chinese, do it at Yale. The professors are all fantastic and it's really well taught, so you end up learning a ton in just a semester. Ignore the reputation Chinese has of being obscenely hard because it's not true. It's work everyday, but maybe an hour or two tops if you're on top of your shit, so not much more than any other class, and definitely not more than a language class. My routine usually consisted of doing written homework right after class so the stuff is fresh in my mind, glancing at characters and new dialogue, and then memorizing them the next day over breakfast. Well worth it.",
    "This class is amazing. I highly recommend it. As a student who took Spanish for all of high school and admittedly got a bit bored of it by the time i reached college, Chinese was a great change of pace. The teachers, for the most part, are amazing. They are funny and helpful and very kind. At first the class may seem to be alot of work to begin with, and it is, but after a couple weeks you get into the groove of it and it really becomes second-nature. Like any language class, having it every day may become tedious, but I never dread going to class and most days it is quite enjoyable. As long as you keep up with your characters and vocabulary (don't be lazy, like me! it takes only ten minutes to review what you did the day before. It WILL catch up with you) it is also quiteeasy to get an A. If you're looking for a language to take, take Chinese!",
    "Chinese 110 was the toughest class I took this semester--and the most rewarding. All of the professors are absolutely amazing--so encouraging, supportive, and ready to explain any concepts students have trouble with. The structure of the class--small sections, around 10 students per--means that each student receives a lot of attention and support from the professor. My section grew really close over the semester, and even when I started the morning tired or cranky, the class' high energy kept me motivated to learn Chinese.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 110 without any hesitation whatsoever. It is engaging, fun, and immediately useful. I am amazed by how much I can pick up in Chinese conversations after only one semester.While you have to put in the work to succeed in class, Chinese is actually an easier language to learn than advertised. If you ever want to learn it, this is the best opportunity you will ever have. Take it.",
    "Abosultely phenomenal. The teachers make learning a hard language achievable.",
    "Take it! It's an amazing course!",
    "Chinese 110 is amazing. The team of teachers is fantastic - funny, supportive, engaging. The course material is hard, but taught in an easy to follow, entertaining way. If you are interested at all, I strongly encourage you to take Chinese.",
    "First, Chinese 110 is an incredible amount of work. Unlike other language courses who say you have a specific amount of work every night but you really don't need to do that much, for Chinese you absolutely do need to do two hours a day if you plan on keeping up. Any less and you'll fall behind. However, if you can deal with the work, Chinese is one of the most amazing courses. The teachers are excellent and very caring and really get the best out of each student. The establish excellent foundations on which one can really learn Chinese effectively. Thus, if you have interest in learning Chinese, and in Chinese culture, and want to commit the time you need to, definitely take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you have the time to put into it. If you want to learn Chinese quickly and effectively this is the way to do it.",
    "If you're willing to work, this is a great class. Amazing teachers, amazing curriculum, and honestly really fun language once you get the hang of it. It's amazing looking back on how much you learn in one semester.",
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT NOW. I was on the rocks about learning Chinese at first because I didn't know how I would use it. Now Chinese is my favorite class. It is so much fun, so interesting, and so much more useful than I imagined. However, it is difficult for people who are tone deaf. Expect to work really hard for the first few weeks, and then the workload becomes completely manageable.",
    "This has probably been my favorite course so far at yale. I started off not sure whether I would like it, but the teachers are excellent and the grading is very generous. They really care about having each student learn the language, and I made a lot of progress this semester. If you're on the fence about this course, take it!",
    "Yes Chinese 110 is a very good class to take.",
    "Absolutely! This is a spectacular course. If you ever wanted to take Chinese from scratch, Yale is the best place to do it. Tons of work and tons of reward",
    "Yes. I would like to recommend the couse for those who are interested in woking in China and who plan to study in China in the future. This is not a easy course, so fellow students should expect to spend a lot of time for the couse. If they are just interested in Chinese, they would feel that the couse workload is too much.",
    "Best language ever.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're serious about learning Chinese.",
    "Chinese 110 is an adventure. It's *much* more work than its 1.5 credits indicates: there were several weeks where it took more time than my other three classes combined. The rewards are well worth it, however, if you have any interest in Chinese: fast and significant improvement on every aspect of the language. Take it if you want to learn a lot, get major returns for the effort you put in, and be in class with an excellent and hard-working group of fellow students. Don't even think about taking it just to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "If you want to make progress in Chinese and have no experience, start with Chinese 110 and you will not regret.",
    "Take this course! Many students wouldn't take a language at Yale if it weren't for the language requirement. Although Chinese is considered one of the more intense languages, the dedication of the teachers and the structure of the course makes your hard work extremely rewarding and even enjoyable at times. Also, you build a strong community with your section. After studying Spanish in high school, taking Chinese added new perspective to my language study (venturing out of the Romance languages proved to be refreshing) and this is a great opportunity to build new skills (ex. try a tonal language or practice your memorizing skills), enjoy excellent teaching, and fulfill the language requirement.",
    "You learn a lot, but it is a massive time commitment. Only take it if you are willing to spend as much time on Chinese as all your other subjects put together. But if you are willing to do so, it is very rewarding, and a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student because of China's growing power."
