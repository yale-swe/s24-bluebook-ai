   "comments": [
    "I learned that gender and technology co-inform one another way more than I thought. Technology seems like a very cold\/objective thing, but it actually has so much to do with identity. I learned how to look at a technology and see who its leaving out. I also learned important and political things that we take as commonplace and universal really are. Lastly, I learned how Western our understanding of some things such as Computer Science and gender roles are.",
    "I feel I am now better-equipped to tackle issues of inequality and disparity in science and tech communities and cultures, as well as in the workplace setting in general. I also learned so incredibly much about the history of and current problems related to the very niche intersection of gender and technology--this is why we come to Yale, to learn things you wouldn't be able to learn on your own or anywhere else!",
    "I learned about the connection between gender and technology in the context of a variety of topics including reproductive technologies, cyborg feminism, and sex reassignment surgery. I also learned how to research for and write a long research paper.",
    "A gleefully enjoyable and informative seminar on the history of gender and technology. It acted both as an introduction and a thorough dive into gender and technology, which takes real instructing talent.",
    "I learned how to critically think and analyze historical primary sources as well as more modern sources.",
    "I learned to look at modern social problems with a historical mindset to better understand how these problems developed. I also think my writing skills improved in the course.",
    "I gained tremendous knowledge, skills and insight from a course that made a vital connection between two things that people often don't explicitly link, namely gender and technology. By examining from a historical perspective the ways that gender has influenced technology and innovation in all spheres it helped me to change my ways of thinking about technology and consider what has influenced the creation and use of technologies from a intersectional perspective.",
    "I now have a stronger hold on different movements and ideas of feminism, making my view on it less as monolithic and pursuing one basic goal, and more as diverse and conflicting inward as self-critiquing as well as outward to the systemic problems in our society. Connecting feminism (and through it gender in general) to something as seemingly non-gendered as technology truly showed me how useful and necessary these critiques are to minimize inequality and prejudice in our society, regardless of (and especially) if they cannot be easily seen and acknowledged.",
    "I knew very little about the relationship between gender and technology before taking this course. This course has taught me to think about both subjects and how their are related in new ways. I also think that my writing skills improved in this course.",
    "Interesting insights into the intersection of gender and technology in the form of medicine, domestic technology, and computation. Developed skills in critically analyzing primary sources and academic literature."

    "This course was so excellent. The material was always interesting and well organized. The activities sin class were always fun and engaging. Perhaps there could be a little more controversy lolz.I mean in that discussion was very polite, and maybe thats because the readings were so obviously pro\/con something that it was easy to be on the same page. Perhaps in the future there could be reading or environment thats a little more debate? I don't know, I think I'm just looking for feedback to give bc class was so amazing...",
    "Strengths: Jenna is amazing, syllabus is great, loved the class structure (we always ended with an activity that grounded our historical discussion in something related to the contemporary era), loved the class blog, Jenna gave us great feedback and met with us individually multiple times throughout the semester, material was diverse. Weaknesses: not many! As we discussed in class, it would be good to draw in a few more non-American perspectives, but overall the course was fantastic.",
    "I really enjoyed the way that the classes were structured, with a short lecture, followed by a long discussion, and then a short group activity that reinforced and summarized the discussion. Professor Healey's questions were always a helping launching point for fruitful discussion. I thought the amount of reading was totally reasonable -- enough to have lots of discussion material, but not too much so that we could never finish it. I liked the way that we read 2-3 short or medium length essays or articles, rather than one long one (or a book). I also really appreciated that I was able to read my classmates' posts on the blog because they were always of interest !",
    "An excellent course with few weaknesses. Excellent readings, though I enjoyed the ones at the beginning of the semester than the ones later. I'm never terribly fond of blog posts, and I felt like an insufficient amount of instruction was given about the midterm paper, but I enjoyed the class as a whole so much that these are relative nitpicks.",
    "Truly an amazing course. The assignments were thoughtful and really pushed me to grow as a thinker. The topics and readings were all very though-provoking and lead to great discussions.",
    "Professor Healey really cares about her students and is very knowledgeable about the material. I really appreciated being able to meet with her about all parts of the final paper. I think class discussion was engaging, though the reading amounts each week could've been a bit more even. I found that sometimes the readings echoed each other and were repetitive rather than additive. I also would appreciate getting more feedback and grades throughout the semester to know how I'm doing.",
    "Very great class, engaging, interesting. The syllabus was carefully crafted and each seminar meeting was amazing.",
    "Most of the readings are very engaging (A Cyborg Manifesto and the nuclear language reading were mind-blowing for example), and I actively enjoyed doing them every week. The discussions were also insanely interesting, as I got to listen to 18 or so other takes on the material I would have never thought of by myself. As for improvement, I would have liked to see a stronger interaction between the blog and the class, as it felt like two different worlds. I'm not sure how ideas from the blog would be brought into the class (as there is so much stuff to cover without the blog anyway), but it would have been nice, as I feel like the point like the point of the blog was to make the readings more applicable. Going back to the problem of treating gender as a black box that never changes, I would have liked to discuss it and other critiques of feminist writers concretely earlier in the course as opposed to later. On that same note, I think it may be beneficial to try to find more writers less influenced by Western conceptions of gender, as I feel that even though we talked about the black box idea at the end, we did end up with a relatively narrow lens of the analytical treatment of gender and power dynamics in many of our case studies.",
    "For the most part, the readings were interesting and engaging. I really liked that the weeks were themed, allowing us to talk about a multitude of things. I think that we did a good job keeping intersectionality in mind. However, it wasn't under the last few classes that we emphasized how a Western lens may impact the way we viewed some of the things we discussed. I think that the reading assignments were fair and I appreciated Professor Healey's flexibility when it came to adjusting due dates for when it made the most sense.",
    "Extremely engaging topics covered. Reading was a bit dense at times and more guidance\/background would be helpful."

    "Absolutely. This class has something to offer everyone. No matter your major or identity, you could benefit from learning about gender and tech.",
    "Absolutely! Very interesting material and Jenna is an amazing professor.",
    "Absolutely, if you're remotely interested in gender and\/or technology! Professor Healey is wonderful.",
    "I would recommend this class in a heartbeat. Prof. Healey is a masterful instructor, for one, and the subject matter is interesting and deep but not inaccessible to someone with little background in gender and technology studies. Much of the class did not have a background in history, but I felt like that in some ways added to, not detracted from, the general learning experience. Great readings. 'Nuff said. If you're blog-post-phobic, you might want to exercise some cautionat least for me, it can be somewhat nerve-wracking to have your work broadcast to the whole class.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. Very interesting material and Professor Healey is a wonderful seminar leader. Hands-down favorite class of the semester.",
    "I thought Historical Perspectives on Gender and Tech was an awesome course -- shedding historical light on a lot of modern problems. I do wish that the course had been taken by a wider variety of majors\/genders because occasionally it felt a bit like an echo chamber. I think all parts of the course were really interesting -- even the parts on defining a feminist technology, which I didn't think I would like. Professor Healey is lovely and great with feedback.",
    "Yes highly recommend this class. Jenna is a phenomenal professor who can keep us all engaged for the entire class period. The readings were interesting and the assignments were also enjoyable. Great class, workload is not too crazy (1 midterm paper, 1 final paper and 3 blog posts) and Jenna gives good feedback for all. She is also always available to discuss the class or your papers.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in gaining new perspectives on technology and the ways it influences how people move through the world, and the gendered nature of technologies. While it is a fair amount of work, it is worth it to take a course taught by a great and very helpful professor who was very helpful and supportive with all of the work for the course.",
    "Yes. Even if someone has no background in gender or technology studies, the content in this course is interesting and can apply to one's own life experience. Even I look at technology differently based on this class.",
    "Wonderful course for anyone interested in exploring the topics of gender and technology. Extremely relevant material and engaging case studies. Slightly dense reading at times, but all really interesting as long as you make enough time to prepare for discussion."
