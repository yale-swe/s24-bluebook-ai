    "This course was a great intro-to-the-thesis course for the art major. Given that students present only twice, most is learned by discussing other students' projects.",

   "comments": [
    "The class was highly inspirational and interactive",
    "More clear guideline was what was expected from us.",
    "I think it was great to have all the art majors together. I wish there was more consistent checking in with the professor and TA; we only talked about our work twice each in the course of the semester, and I would have liked a more sustained conversation, though I understand that might be difficult given the number of students in the class.",
    "I think that more frequent, but shorter check-ins would be very helpful; many students had developed a single stream of concept for their projects, almost too far for critique to meaningfully address. Furthermore, more focus should have been put on developing a theme\/idea at the beginning of the semester. Many students had an idea of what physical object they wanted to make but were unsure of why they wanted to make it, or whether what they wanted to make was even the best way of communicating a message. Perhaps my other courses in the school of art were structured differently than this and therefore this is not what I'm used to; however I found this structure made students less open to questioning their projects and to critique in general.",
    "I appreciated giving formal presentations on my work, but this course had many flaws. First, it would have been nice to have more regular assignments and due dates, as it was difficult for me and my peers to feel motivated to work on my thesis when I had so many other impending deadlines. Additionally, the lack of structure and expectations was sometimes frustrating as I felt a bit lost all semester. If the class had had a formal syllabus and more structured class time, I think it would have helped me make more beneficial progress on my thesis this semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes very helpful for art majors",
    "I'm glad that this class was extended to the fall. It really showed me how short a semester is and got me in the right path to develop my thesis further in the spring. A little more organization and structure to the class would be helpful.",
    "Majority of the course was listening to people talk about their theses. Each student presents twice throughout the semester on where they're at with their work. Preparing presentations was helpful (especially in forcing me to catch up on making the work I was presenting on), and I got a lot of useful feedback from both professor and students.",
    "Would recommend for senior art major!"
