    "Yes! Meets every day though.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, because by the end I felt I learned a lot grammatically.",
    "Yes, it improved my Spanish speaking skills considerably!",
    "Spanish 140 has a lot of work, and it's super annoying to have to do homework every day. The pace of class is very fast, so that's kind of tough to get used to, and I can imagine if you don't get a good teacher, than this class can be really a drag. Pilar Asensio is a pretty good teacher, and I enjoyed being in her section, but sometimes it was frustrating because I felt like I needed to go more slowly but the class didn't let me and I felt like she would get frustrated sometimes also, but overall she's a good teacher and will give you help if you need it. If you are borderline L3 and L4 take L3, but this class is good if you are really prepared for it and have the time to put the work required into it.",
    "A good way to solidify your Spanish, and not too demanding despite the constant schedule",
    "Spanish 140 with Professor Asensio is a great class! She is an amazing professor who works to make the material engaging while also ensuring that you learn a good deal. Even though this was a 9:25 class, her energy and jokes made up for the early start time. Also, because the class was small, she was able to meet individually with every student and give us lots of individual help during class time. Although some of the work was tedious at times, this was a very good class overall."
