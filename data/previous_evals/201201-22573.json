    "I assume you aren't even looking at this course unless this is the sort of stuff you're really interested in. In that case, go for it! Keep up with the readings, the class will be more enjoyable if you do.",
    "This was a very interesting course somewhere between Linguistics and Philosophy, and Larry Horn is one of the top people in the field. The class does this odd dance between very dry and very interesting, but it definitely provides new ways to think about language.",
    "It's hard if you're not an expert in linguistics. But if you are, it's very interesting to learn about.",
    "Its a very specific class. I would recommend it to linguistic majors and linguistics oriented cog-sci majors who care about pragmatics and the complexity of language used in conversation. This isn't a class just to take for the heck of it."
