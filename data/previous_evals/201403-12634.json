    "Take it! There are great field trips, and the whole class is basically hand-on. Days that did not include field trips could get a little long though if you struggle to sit still for extended periods of time, however, really good class. Mary Beth is awesome. Class topics are interesting and important and not covered in really any other class at Yale. Do it.",
    "I would highly recommend EVST 244 to a fellow student. The course provides opportunities to explore coastal environments all over New England and engage with hands-on, relevant scientific issues. I would recommend an introductory science course or a strong background in science prior to this class because the lab assignments are demanding. In general, this is a wonderful class.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. If you are at all interested in the ocean or coastal ecosystems and the effects of a changing climate and growing anthropogenic influence, this class is for you. It was great to get hands-on experience in the field through a variety of different field trips. You learn so much from being out in the field and talking to different experts and community members about what they know and are concerned about. Class size was small so you really get to know and engage with your peers.",
    "This class is a sweet option to fulfill the lab requirement for environmental studies students, particularly for those who would like to be outside or in varied venues (Thimble Islands, salt marshes, a wastewater treatment plant), and getting to touch the surface of a variety of kinds of science in an engaging and low-stress way. There are not field trips every week, so sometimes the lectures feel long, and they're early on Friday morning. But for me it was worth it."
