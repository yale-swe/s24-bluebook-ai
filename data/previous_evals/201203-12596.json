   "comments": [
    "Math 120 was a great course, and I would definitely recommend taking it with Susie. It is no doubt challenging, but the amount of knowledge you will gain is incredible.",
    "I recommend it because it is a prerequisite for a great number of courses and majors. It is not, however, incredibly enlightening or interesting.",
    "Math 120 is a pretty OK class. Not too boring, but there's a limit to how interesting an introductory math class can get. The good thing is that it's not really necessary to go for the lectures, since everything you need to know is in the textbook. The tests are easy and straightforward.",
    "Math 120 is a bit of work, but worthwhile. I felt like it moved at a comfortable pace. Pick your teachers carefully: Susie Kimport is a great instructor and one of the main reasons I enjoyed Math 120, so get her if you can. The P-sets aren't too bad: they're generally interesting problems rather than busywork, and they rarely took me too long.",
    "Take it! You will learn new ways about thinking about space as well as learn to prove formulas you learned in previous math classes.",
    "If you took Calculus AB and BC in high school, then Math 120 is much more like Calc AB. You focus primarily on methods for derivation in integration except in two and three dimensions, which is hardly different from doing them in one dimension. The only thing to watch out for is that it seems like many of the students in Math 120 have taken a multivariable calculus course before, so all of the tests are heavily skewed towards perfect scores. Thus if you are unsure about Math 120, taking it first semester might not be the best idea.",
    "If you're going into math, it's pretty much necessary. It's the course best for right after Calc BC.",
    "Yes. Manageable, interesting course with a god teacher.",
    "Instructor makes or breaks the experience. Suzie Kimport, Igor, Marketa and Michael Frame are all amazing instructors. Calculus is actually both very useful and fun. If calculus gives you sad thoughts, don't reject the course itself; shop multiple instructors and find one you like. Preregistration is not strict -- always ask the instructor you like for permission (though Igor's section is very difficult to get in every year).",
    "Math 120 is the logical next step from BC calculus in high school. That being said, many students take 120 if they have already taken multi in high school. This made the curve difficult, but overall this is a good course that I would recommend.",
    "Good for students wishing to continue to future math courses or course in physics\/economics etc. I would recommend to students if you have enough time to take advantage of all the resources to help you such as the practice exams, office hours, midterm reviews etc.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Math 120 to another student. I actually took it without ever having BC calc or taking Math 115 and it was fine. I had to do a bit of catch up for some aspects (polar equations, parametric curves, squeeze theorem, integration by parts) but it was very doable. If you keep up and really work to understand the concepts, you should be fine.",
    "I really liked this course--it was a great counterpoint to the other political science courses I was taking. It's obviously a lot of math, but the TA's offer lots of office hours, where we really had a lot of fun and also got a lot of help with the concepts. I highly recommend it. Susie Kimport is THE BEST MATH TEACHER I've had--and I've had a lot of really fantastic math teachers. She's great at explaining concepts in as many different ways as she can until one clicks with the student. And she created a totally hardcore Thanksgiving review sheet to help us prepare for the final\/get extra credit. Take it with Susie if you possibly can!!!",
    "Math 120 is difficult, but less so if you put in the work for it.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to someone who wants to take it in order to take more math or to someone who wants to take it to fulfill a requirement. The class in itself wasn't special, which partially may be a function of the subject. Susie Kimport was very clear in her lessons, and I have great notes. She worked hard for us, even writing practice worksheets before the final."
