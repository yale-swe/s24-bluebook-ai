    "A basic understanding of macroeconomics",
    "Macroeconomics basic knowledge.",
    "Basic models of the economy",
    "macro",
    "Develops foundational knowledge on how economies work and how monetary and fiscal policy can alter those economies. Also learn about the clash between current research and theory, and realize much of what we base our models off of is not completely correct.",
    "I love Aleh.",
    "I learned a lot about how to examine modern-day phenomena, from climate change to healthcare, from an economic standpoint. I also learned the basic variables of fundamental macroeconomic models. It has made me a significantly more informed voter.",
    "Learnt basic macro econ concepts on monetary policy, exchange rates, different models of growth and financial crises.",
    "Learned a lot about the economy, markets, and how it responds to changes. Really useful real-world applicaations.",
    "Pretty straightforward, I learned the basics to macroeconomics.",
    "I learned very interesting economic concepts that have now allowed me to have more coherent conversations regarding politics and economic policy.",
    "I learned a lot about the world economy and how government policy can affect the economy.",
    "I learned a bit about economics on a global scale.",
    "Apart from just learning the theory of Macroeconomics, the class put a lot of focus on real world data analysis (this extremely helped when studying and improved understanding.)",
    "Economic reasoning and application of economics",
    "I appreciate the applicability of this course to real life. Macro (more than micro) allowed us to gain insight to different historical events not only in the US economy but the world economy.",
    "You learn so much about how the world works from an economic perspective and about current research.",
    "General overview of macroeconomics, the importance of models and policy making, the complexity of larger economies, how concepts can be reflected by microeconomics and vice versa",
    "i learned a lot about the economy.",
    "Very applicable to real life economics. Helps you understand what's happening around you.",
    "Through this class, I have gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of both the US economy and the international economic system. I think that the information learned is quite useful, especially in regards to applying the theories to the political world today.",
    "This was one of the most useful classes I have taken so far at Yale. I believe everybody should have at least some knowledge of how the economy functions in order to be a better informed member of society. I personally learned the most about how the Fed operates and what the purpose of the stock market is in the modern economy. Also, I valued learning about trade between nations in an open economy and how the U.S. deals with problems like financial crises, inflation, and unemployment. Overall these topics were very engaging and lectures were relevant and informational.",
    "I have a much stronger understanding of how the global economy operates, and some of the important social, economic, and political issues pacing our society.",
    "Worst course I have taken the entire year.",
    "I really don't think I learned much from this course.",
    "Basic macroeconomic models and theories, along with numerous applications of topics to the real world Guest lectures on real-world topics contributed to understanding of how economies really work (health care, 2008 housing crisis, China's growth, etc.) Reviews of key pieces of economic research (on GDP and tax multipliers, on whether deflation and depression are related, etc.) grounded the material in reality, reminding students that economics is a tricky science, and that the models we learn in class are rudimentary abstractions",
    "I learned about real world applications of economic models.",
    "Basic Macro",
    "I took away a general understanding of the economy from an administrational perspective. The general trends and behaviors of economic variables, etc.",
    "Econ 116 is a must take course for anyone slightly interested in the American economy. Aleh shares great insights about current research and brings in guest speakers that make this class unique compared to other Econ courses across the country. I learned a lot of the basics for how our whole economy works, and I'm glad I took the course.",
    "Aside from the knowledge about macroeconomics, which on its own was both profuse and detailed, the course for sure taught me a whole lot about analyzing data, interpreting data, predicting consequences, and using models to analyze the world. the main take away points from the course were simple but at the same time seemed very important. while the course had a high workload and the exams and psets were no were near easy, in retrospect the level of difficulty really pushed me towards thinking hard and plentiful i loved how towards the end of the course I could see all the different concepts and models linking together, and the ability to simplify real world situations and form connections between seemingly distinct variables and changes is also something I learned that seems very valuable",
    "As an introduction to the world of macroeconomics, I learned about various broad concepts and overviews regarding the subject.",
    "I got a general understanding of Macroeconomics.",
    "I basically learned all of Gregory Mankiw's Introductory Macroeconomics textbook, which I relied on entirely because Professor Tsyvinski's lectures were so poor.",
    "I now understand the fundamentals of the global economy, which is pretty cool. The lectures were interesting, and Professor Tsyvinski emphasizes exposing us to current research on China, Climate Change, Health Care, etc. without testing us harshly on it, so I definitely learned a lot.",
    "I learned a lot about contemporary and historical macro-economic debates, which was interesting.",
    "Great class that really taught me a lot and how to think deeply about models.",
    "I gained problem solving skills and learned about macroeconomics.",
    "Great foundational economics course in which we learn, very simply, a lot about the macroeconomy.",
    "How the different economic factors interact on the macro scale",
    "I learned a good amount about Macro Economics although not as much as I would have hoped.",
    "I think this was the best course I've taken at yale in terms of learning concepts related to everyday activities.",
    "basic macro skills- very straightforward in lecture",
    "How to analyze the economys fluctuations on a macro level",
    "I was able to better understand macroeconomic principles. I took Econ in high school but this class went a lot deeper. Also made me much more sure that I wanted to continue pursuing economics and a possible major. My teaching assistant Ravi Balla was not only inspiring and insightful but a good friend as well that was always there to answer questions.",
    "A general overview of the concepts of macroeconomics",
    "I learned all about the macroeconomy and also how to prioritize certain parts of work for a class, because this class had a large array of sources from which to derive knowledge -- book, lecture, outside research, psets, sections, etc. Learning what to ignore and what to focus on was especially important in this course.",
    "Basic economic class with fiscal and monetary policies.",
    "Macro",
    "This course provided a comprehensive introduction to macroeconomics. In particular, I learned about the classical model of macroeconomics, the model of an small, open economy, the Solow growth model, the IS-LM model, the AS-AD model, and many more ways to analyze an entire economy. Our course also covered consumption, the financial system, financial crises, and other larger scale ideas. I also liked how there were guest lectures that extended some of the topics we discussed, focusing on the U.S. healthcare system or even some of the professor's own additions to the text (i.e. climate change and the Chinese economy).",
    "Foundations of macroeconomic concepts and how these concepts affect government policy, wide-ranging economic fluctuations, and our daily lives. A number of basic economic models that form the basis for modern economic decisionmaking. A lot of research articles that took up plenty of class time but were of questionable relevance and importance. Very different from AP Macro: a student who walked into this class with a 5 on the Macro test and tried to take the midterms and final blind would probably fail outright, so theres plenty to learn even if you took AP.",
    "A better understanding of the US economy and how it can be modeled by different theories.",
    "This class has helped me have better insight into how much of a role the government plays into an economy. Also, on a large scale, how does one factor of the economy affect another.",
    "Fiscal policy and monetary policy",
    "You gain a good understanding of macroeconomics. A foundation",
    "I thought this course did a good job of teaching real-world concepts that were both applicable and came up in a variety of other courses that I was taking this semester, often un-related to economics.",
    "Understanding how to analyze large macroeconomic trends in terms of models as well as data",
    "This class discussed the fundamentals of neoclassical macroeconomic theory, and attempted to apply them to current events and recent economic transformations.",
    "I learned basic economic theories.",
    "I learned the basics of economic thought and a variety of models to explain the economy that seem both useful and intriguing",
    "I learned more about economic systems and current economic research and I feel better equipped to read the business section of the news now!",
    "I learned much more about the way the economy works and major issues in economic research. I feel like I have a better understanding of how the world works and how to solve economic problems. I also have a better appreciation of the significance of the economy.",
    "Intricacies of macro",
    "I received introductory knowledge on the various mechanisms involved in macroeconomic theory and in our real world economy.",
    "The course was centered on evaluating how fiscal and monetary policy affect the overall economy. A lot of different topics including GDP, healthcare, Federal Reserves, etc were discussed. Some very cutting-edge Macro research was presented as well!",
    "A broad introduction to macroeconomics",
    "I developed some knowledge of Macroeconomics, and how the world economy works.",
    "real world info",
    "I learned a more mathematical approach to macroeconomics and bettered my skill of studying in advance.",
    "A good overview of macroeconomic principles\/how the world economy works.",
    "You will learn the basics of macroeconomics, but Prof. Tsyvinski isn't that helpful. His lectures are literally straight from the book, though he does occasionally add some cool new research summaries at the end of lectures. On the whole, I learned a lot about macro and various models, but mostly from section and reading the textbook. Section with Dr. William Hawkins was especially helpful.",
    "I learned a lot about the how to view the economy today. Learning things such as the interest rate and how the affects the market as a whole was very useful.",
    "That economics is such a new discipline that much of it that is taken as absolute fact by some is actually up for debate. I learned more about macroeconomics than I expected to.",
    "I gained an increased appreciation for how economics can influence public policy.",
    "The course was well taught",
    "I learned a lot about the real world applications of economics. I am interested in political economy, and I was able to use a lot of this information in my political science classes. I thought the class was a good mix of different topics - we learned about political economy to an extent but also banking and other subjects.",
    "I learned how economy applies to the worlds' purchases rather than just our individual purchases, but most importantly I learned which models were more closely attached to current circumstances.",
    "Macro was a great continuation from Micro and put a lot of the content into perspective. You learn what recession, unemployment and everything relevant around you means.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of macroeconomics",
    "learned so much about how the economy works, government policies, etc. honestly think all students at yale should take this course to become educated citizens.",
    "I acquired a good knowledge of the macroeconomy in general",
    "Bigger pictures of economic world at large",
    "Analytical skills concerning macroeconomics, conceptually and with respect to applications in the real world.",
    "Great introduction to macro topics, especially effects of changing fiscal and\/or monetary policy. Have a good intro understanding of government effects on GDP, consumption, savings, etc.",
    "A good background with which to pursue other courses in economics, more advanced electives, etc.",
    "How banks work, what the Fed and gov do in different economic situations and how this affects industries\/ the common person.",
    "Learned a variety of models to describe how closed, and eventually open, economies respond to changes. Also learned about current research in macroeconomics relating to the Great Depression, debt, the Great Recession, unemployment, development, health care, China's growth, etc.",
    "a valuable introduction into macroeconomics, good general overview of topics",
    "This course gave me an overview of all the topics covered by Macroeconomics and showed me how they applied to the real world through guest lecturers and current studies and present day statistics.",
    "I learned about macroeconomic models and applications of models to current research.",
    "Learned a ton about economic models.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to understand how large-scale markets work and how various consumer models influence money supply, costs and investments.",
    "Great for the basics"

    "Sometimes the course felt a little all over the place.",
    "Organized material with great lecturer. Sometimes the research is confusing",
    "This class is very organized. Piazza is very helpful!",
    "Making lecture more interactive",
    "Strengths: Consistent Weaknesses: seems to be a disconnect between the material in class and our exams (exams seem to expect a lot more than what our textbook asks for), not enough mathematical examples to back up and reinforce our learning Improvements: be more conscious about the exams, try to give examples more instead of just breezing through the concept and expect everyone to understand",
    "super boring",
    "William Hawkin is the ECON 116 all-star and plays a major role in ensuring the accumulation of knowledge by students. Overall, a well-planned course by one of the top economics departments in the nation.",
    "Strengths 1 WILLIAM HAWKINS - MY TF - THE GUY WHO SHOULD ACTUALLY BE TEACHING THIS COURSE. HE IS AMAZING, HE WROTE ENTIRE THESES FOR PIAZZA ANSWERS. ALL HAIL HAWKINS. 2. WEBWORK 3. PSETS - The use of legit data helped me understand concepts better, and distinguish between textbook concepts and real life scenarios. 4. RESEARCH covered in lectures Weaknesses 1. Aleh brushes over fundamental concepts while focusing on research wayy too much",
    "Strength: Structured really well and lots of materials for additional learning. Weaknesses: Aleh's lectures didn't really expand further on the material beyond what was in the book, so I didn't really get an intuitive understanding of what was going on.",
    "The strengths of the course were that it was easy to understand lecture, and Professor T. made the class engaging. the only weakness would be the Pset. They were not very helpful in solidifying the material.",
    "kinda wack class. you learn some basic macroeconomic concepts in a very conceptual and nonrigorous way that didn't really suit me. tests and lectures didn't coincide well. teaching was pretty weak. TA's saved it.",
    "The course needs a professor that is more easily understood.",
    "This course's greatest weakness was that Professor Tsyvinski moved too quickly through lecture slides and students often feel as if they aren't getting enough out of lecture. Lecture was nice only insofar as the professor invited great guest lecturers from time to time who shared their research with students.",
    "I have to say I'm quite disappointed with this class in many aspects. I do think the curriculum is somewhat poorly structured: sometimes struggling to cram too many content into one lecture and sometimes spending excessive time on less weighted materials. The lecture slides do little more beyond reiterating whatever's on the textbook. I appreciate the fact that they try to incorporate real world researches and studies into the class, though. As for intro to macro itself, I feel like many of the *models* are fundamentally contradictory with one another, poor guides in real world economy, fail to shed much light on consumer behaviors. The last few lectures on climate change, health care and China were much more intriguing. The TFs vary in their teaching quality. Most disappointing of all: I went to review sessions held by 2 TFs on the same exam material, and they gave different answers to certain questions that I raised. Also the past exam materials posted on Canvas contain many errors that hopefully were corrected at the time of those exams. Overall, I think Yale can do better than this.",
    "A seminar for economics is much better than a lecture. This class needs to find better ways of helping students and conveying the knowledge necessary in a much better fashion.",
    "The course was very well taught. The instructor is interesting and the material is engaging. It is by far the most organized course I have taken at Yale. Personally, I found the numerical problems interesting and useful.",
    "This class is HUGE. I found I was not engaged as much as possible in lecture because Aleh moves quite quickly, so I was more focused on writing the information on the slides down as quickly as I could than taking in what he was saying. Section was helpful in understanding information, but we often didn't get through all the questions during the 50 minutes. I think a big strength was having piazza because you could ask questions as well as see other people's questions to help you understand the material and homework questions. I'm not sure whether Monday was a great day to turn problem sets in mostly because unless you start immediately after you turn in the pset, you aren't able to ask questions in section on it if you're in a Wednesday section. Seeing as sections are Wed-Fri, changing the day would help one days sections but likely hurt another, so I'm not sure how to fix this.",
    "Amazing lectures, great sections and TA, sooo many resources that make learning super easy.",
    "Strength - head TA was a good idea Weakness - final exam was unnecessarily difficult - did not reflect what we had been taught in the class",
    "I enjoyed the consistent format of assignments and the usage of Canvas and Piazza. However, sections really weren't helpful, necessary, or engaging, at least in my case, so I felt like I never got to discuss concepts with others to really make sure I understood things before exams hit.",
    "teacher good at keeping people involved",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the material. The material in itself is pretty interesting, and clearly has very high stakes. However, I think that there were a few changes that could greatly improve the class experience. Firstly, I think that the TA-student interactions should be on a more personal level. It often felt like there was a disconnect between what the TAs wanted to be doing and what they were actually teaching. For this, perhaps encourage TAs to seem more passionate and excited when teaching the material. Secondly, this class has clear political ramifications, and it often felt that some of the theories we learned were clearly pushing for a political agenda and that the opposing side was left out. The lectures seemed to really push for more conservative economic policies without discussion what a more liberal policy would look like. In this way, it often felt one-sided.",
    "Strengths - Course Director William Hawkins was incredibly responsive on outlets such as Piazza. This was extremely helpful in terms of clarifying information that was unclear in lecture, and because the class was so large to begin with piazza completely expedited the process and in addition to Hawkins' responsiveness, served as one of the most useful outlets we were provided. Discussion sections were also very helpful at clarifying information. Weaknesses - There were no calculators allowed on exams. I understand the rationale not to allow the use of a more advanced graphing calculator, but I was definitely at a disadvantage for not being allowed to do more simple calculations with a very cheap and basic calculator. This is not too much to ask, especially for the level of calculations were are expected to do in this class during exams. As someone who is not very good at doing mental math and as a result may run the risk of making many stupid mistakes on tests that could be easily avoidable, I am all for the use of cheap calculators on tests. This would also save many people valuable time and effort on calculations and would further even the playing field.",
    "The strength of the class was absolutely the Course Coordinator, Dr. Hawkins. He did a great job laying out clear expectations, and was phenomenal at responding to student questions quickly on Piazza. The homework was well-written and fair, and I liked that it was split into a written portion and an online portion. Having unlimited attempts on the online questions really allowed me to master the more quantitative parts of the course well.",
    "One thing that would have improved the course would be to have the professor run the class instead of a T.A.",
    "Nothing was good about it.. I didn't go to half the classes, but didn't miss anything because there is nothing during lecture that cannot be read from the book.",
    "The textbook was very strong, but the instructor could have done a better job of differing lecture from the printed material.",
    "Strengths: Dr Hawkins did a very good job organizing the course and making lots of learning materials available Weaknesses: preparation materials\/practice questions need to more closely resemble the problems given on tests. Also, curve is very difficult",
    "Strengths - Piazza is a blessing. Being able to have questions answered right away while they're fresh in your mind really helps you learn\/remember concepts though in the course. My TA (Kaspar!) was also great and very helpful.",
    "The only strength of this class was William Hawkins. I really hope he is paid well. He went out of his way to help students and ensure that we were on track. The fact that Piazza questions were answered within 45 minutes is a testament to how much Dr. Hawkins cared about his students. He made section clear and was engaging. However, the professor of the class was unhelpful, inaccessible, and not engaging. I realized that it was not worth my time to go to lecture, and barely showed up. He did not help improve my understanding. I think it would make sense for Dr. Hawkins to teach this course and I know many of my fellow classmates would agree. I came into Yale planning on being an economics major, and after this class will not continue.",
    "The test format needs ti be streamilined.",
    "Macroeconomics is a very interesting topic--identifying these moving parts of an economy and how they all relate to each other is fascinating. I cannot accurate assess how well the course was taught, but it was very well organized--as course director, Professor Hawkins, I feel, keep things running pretty smoothly, and was very dependable. A weakness is that the instructor sometimes spent much too long on a subject that didn't need repeating, or too little on an idea that takes time to digest. It is difficult to recognize which is which after the fact, however.",
    "The lecture was not extremely engaging. Often times I felt that topics were rushed through and not covered in depth.",
    "The exams and problem sets were graded fairly as far as I can tell and there were no surprises. Communication was open and everything was very organized and integrated. However, lecture slides were often not very helpful when studying as there was not much detail, yet sometimes lectures went to quickly to take in-depth notes.",
    "Does it have to be in 75 minute classes? I fell asleep after 40 minutes pretty regularly because the SSS seats are really comfortable. If the classes were shorter I would be more motivated to power through the whole thing.",
    "This class contains way too much math and graphing for a class that isn't a QR. I also was expected to know certain types of math that we were not taught\/that weren't reviewed (e.g. derivatives, exponent rules). If the class is going to involve that kind of math it needs to be reviewed.",
    "Teyvisnki could not care less about Intro Macro and it shows.",
    "Strengths: strong macreconomic basis introductory course, great and quick feedback on piazza Weaknesses: sometimes piazza posts are a little too complicated for the question (though this happens for a seldom number of circumstances), strongly suggest allowing 4-function basic calculators on the exam to even the playing field - many of my friends missed simple calculations such as s\/(s+f) simply because they performed an incorrect mathematical operation",
    "I have no idea. This class's material was great, but the lectures were completely pointless sometimes. He spoke so fast that I couldn't even write anything down and the textbook was just as good. So great choice for textbooks!",
    "Current research was definitely the strength.",
    "Main weaknesses i could think of: 1. at times the psets had a lot of busy work that didnot contribute much to our understanding 2 research involved in the class:while I understand the reason behind the research, i think that the way and abundance it was presented in made it too hard to retain any of it and it at time seemed like an unnecessary burden that came at the expense of us finishing the slides\/ consolidating a model",
    "This course was really fun to take. The lectures were a lot of fun and I really appreciated how the lectures tied in current research that was being done in the field. The only source of improvement I could imagine is that there was a bit of a disconnect between the material we learned at lectures and what was tested\/on problem sets.",
    "I don't really understand why we learned all this current events data at the end of each lecture. Like, I understand that it's kinda cool to see how the stuff we learn is applied in the real world, but often times there was no correlation. On top of that, the fact we had to know all of the material on that 20 some page summary of the data was absurd. Being able to talk about one bullet point on that sheet for 2-4 points on the final exam is ridiculous. Nothing on that summary sheet means anything if we don't understand the concepts taught in the book, and we devoted so much time to learning this stuff that we as students were often confused about the whole topic of the lecture. We rarely finished the slides during class, which meant our TAs had to explain to us the stuff we rushed through, which meant we never really got to work through problems together. I definitely think the way this course is taught needs to be reevaluated.",
    "The course is practically designed to keep students as removed as possible from Professor Tsyvinski and the TA's. The syllabus explicitly tells students not to contact the professor or TA's directly until posing their question on Piazza. Additionally, the psets are absurdly vague and poorly worded to the point where one cannot complete the assignment without referencing Piazza for clarification. Psets and review materials also related minimally to concepts covered on the exams. Thus, students never had time to test their understanding of many topics until actually taking the exams.",
    "It's just not very engaging, but I don't know how that can be fixed with the course material.",
    "This class was terrific due to Professor Tsyvinski's interesting lectures and humor that kept the interest of the class. Professor Hawkins was also one of the biggest reasons this class was so terrific. He answered ever piazza question and addressed all student concerns with so much knowledge and wisdom. Having him be part of the course absolutely helped me learn so much better. Most of the test and midterm questions were also straight forward while testing our knowledge, which isn't always the case.",
    "I found the lectures largely unhelpful and uninteresting. I wish they had been more engaging.",
    "Macro used to be a really easy class. This year (2017), it became a lot harder, but the curve was better, and the teaching got a lot better.",
    "Pset grading was SO random. There needs to be a better system of grading.",
    "I like that this course has sections every week, I wish section was longer. I learn a lot from section and it would be nice if we spent more time on section material.",
    "The course director this year, Dr. William Hawkins, was fantastic and the class ran very smoothly. Piazza was extremely helpful and it was very clear what was expected on each student to understand for exams.",
    "Much of the work on the psets was busy work and added little to the understanding of macro economics. However, the lectures provided a good theoretical understanding that was tied to many real-life examples.",
    "I believe that the course was organized very well, which is mainly the doing of William Hawkins. Aleh did not pay that much attention to undergrads.",
    "I really enjoyed the guest speakers and when the professor presented current research papers. I think there should be a greater emphasis on real world applications",
    "nice lectures, sections could be more geared towards psets",
    "I found the lectures hard t engage in especially when it was focussed on \"real world\" examples because I felt like it was too advanced for someone who had no history in macro before.",
    "I am good at the problem sets and completed them well, displaying understand of the course. However I still have trouble with some models",
    "I think that the lectures did not do a good job of clearly explaining the concepts but rather skimmed over them and gave a bunch of case studies that only came in handy after the material was understood. This discouraged a lot of students from going to lecture if they didn't understand something because they would only get more confused. The strength of this course for me was my fantastic TA Ravi Balla who helped me understand the material and prepare for exams. I don't know any other TAs though.",
    "I disliked how Professor Tsyvinski expected the class to memorize a thirteen-page list of studies that had been at best mentioned once in lecture for exams. The lectures should focus more on teaching the actual concepts of the course and less on the semantics of a series of studies.",
    "Personally I thought William Hawkins was a better teacher than our professor. My biggest complaint was also the section -- the content was organized well but it seemed very out of touch with lecture topics at times.",
    "The lectures could be a bit tedious, but one could always tell that Professor Tsyvinski cared deeply about the subject. The problem sets that require utilizing can also be a bit tedious as well.",
    "I really enjoyed the material of this class. It's incredibly interesting and it's a good basic introduction to macroeconomics and various case studies. The greatest strength of the course is the amount of transparency for grading and the amount of practice problems (old exams, problem sets, etc.) with incredibly detailed solutions. Mr. Hawkins really ran a very tightly organized course. The biggest weakness was the dullness of most lectures. Having relied mainly on the textbook, it felt superfluous going to class when Prof. Tsyvinski essentially recited the important sections of the textbook, and introduced studies that were mentioned in the textbook. That being said, the guest lectures and research that came from outside the textbook was definitely very informative.",
    "Lecture isn't engaging and the problem sets are annoying. Discussion sections are super helpful! Basically, you could get the most out of the class by just reading the book and going to section.",
    "The class was structured very well with clear instructions.",
    "Lecture too fast",
    "The strength of this course was that it thoroughly covered all of the material in the textbook and really gave us all the information we would need to build a solid background of macroeconomics. I also felt that we went at a pace that was slow enough to absorb the material, but fast enough so that we would be able to cover the whole book and more. I also found that the head TF was extremely helpful on Piazza and I found my questions always being answered as quickly as possible. As for weaknesses of the course, I felt that sometimes the lecture-style course was not as engaging as it could have been, since the slides were kind of similar to the book.",
    "Strengths: very strong and organized course structure. Although Professor Tsyvinski didnt do much besides read off slides during lecture, a strong TF team, led by course director Dr. Hawkins, handled the course very well. Course policies and expectations were communicated extremely clearly, homework\/exam questions were very precise and fair, and testable material was outlined thoroughly before exams. Dr. Hawkins was also extremely diligent about answering questions on Piazza in a detailed and timely manner. All sections used the same PowerPoint presentation to go over important material, and were very structured with practice questions and time to work on those questions with other students and the section TF. Weaknesses: Professor Tsyvinski added very little value to the course, and left Dr. Hawkins and the TFs to do all the heavy lifting. Prof. Tsyvinski glossed over the relevant material, then dedicated most of the lecture to rattling off the names of authors of economic research articles and their studies. The research was ambiguous, uninteresting, and largely irrelevant to the material the class is supposed to teach. If I wanted to take a class on macroeconomic research, I would have signed up for it. A couple cursory discussions of research are fine, but current research has absolutely no place as the primary focus of an introductory macroeconomics course, leaving macroeconomic fundamentals on the back burner. Luckily, the team of TFs saved the course with Piazza, sections, and office hours to explain all the material we were actually supposed to be learning. My only complaint about their work is that feedback was nonexistent: Id frequently receive problem sets with a score of 2\/3 but no indication as to what I did wrong or how I could improve. Other times, there was just a question mark at the top of the paper, but Id get 2.5\/3. Rarely did I receive any useful comments. I understand it is a lot of work to grade many students papers, but that is why the TFs are there, and their feedback would have helped me do better in the class if I had had it.",
    "I found lecture not helpful, it was just reading off of the slides. Section was where I actually learned. The pacing of the class was both painfully boring and yet we moved through material so quickly that we couldn't learn it well. We need to do practice problems in lecture so that the problem sets are easier. Also, there was too much emphasis on the case studies and not enough emphasis on the material.",
    "The class helps facilitate communication between students and TFs. I can easily access my TFs and ask them questions, and I usually get a timely response. One weakness is probably that the exam often covers topics that which were not fully explored in lecture.",
    "Weaknesses: way the problem sets and tests are worded, final exam was not even comparable to practice tests\/midterms Strengths: interesting material",
    "I think the best parts about the class were section (the problems we did were extremely helpful in understanding the material and for doing problem sets) and the overall organization. Questions were always answered promptly on Piazza, answer keys had thorough explanations, and issues were usually fairly resolved. However, lecture in this class was definitely very boring and I felt like the exams did not test the type of material we focused on\/had prepared for.",
    "Dr Hawkinsand PRof Tsyvinsky are both amazing. They helped us learn very cool research that are relevant to the topics we covered.",
    "I really didn't like the format of this class. The lectures were basically copied exactly from the textbook and seemed really pointless. Also, the tests were either way too easy or way too hard.",
    "Strengths: well structured in terms of core content, exams are fair Weaknesses: research not well structured, psets not great at bolstering understanding",
    "Overall a good course. My only complaint is that the research that is discussed exclusively during the lectures is unnecessary and superficially presented. They don't complement the material particularly well and you'll simply end up memorizing the conclusions from the papers for the exam rather than truly understanding what they're about.",
    "This course does provide a broad overview of the course material presented in the Mankiw textbook, and I also enjoyed how Professor Hawkins added more depth to sections while Professor Tsyvinski focused on the lecture. If there was a weakness, it was that the lecture slides relied heavily on the textbook material, and I was told by several of my friends that they didn't feel like it was necessary to attend lecture to understand the concepts simply because they could \"read the book instead.\" I wish that the class also took more time to address and respond to counter-arguments to the macroeconomic theory presented.",
    "Strengths are it has a great teacher and weakness is that the large class causes it harder to pay attention.",
    "This course was very well organized and we were given alot of resources to enhance our learning outside of simply sitting in lectures. However, the final exam was borderline impossible and I feel that we weren't provided enough warning about the extent to which it deviated from previous years",
    "This course has a great TA\/section system that makes a large lecture seem like a more personal learning experience. The research made the information feel important\/applicable to real life. I wish there were more review sessions before midterms earlier on.",
    "A strength is that lectures are very engaging. Furthermore, the additional research material was very interesting. And, the TA's are helpful. However, the psets are somewhat tedious and often unhelpful.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting, great director involvement",
    "More engaging lecture component.",
    "The lecture was very quick-paced and it was often difficult to initially relate lecture material to assignments. Section was very useful and the online webwork questions were very helpful as well. The current event topics were a neat addition as well.",
    "The TA's were really good. Sometimes it felt as though attending lecture wasn't as useful as reviewing the book alone.",
    "The strengths are the sections, as the vast majority of what I learned, I learned in section.",
    "Interesting but very hard. Loved the webwork",
    "good stuff",
    "My TA was very good",
    "I wish the research was more clear and also reviewed in section.",
    "Some of the lectures could have been more engaging.",
    "I think the material was good and interesting, and William Hawkins (the course director) is probably the best thing to ever happen to this course. He is amazing and super helpful. Go to him if you have a question or concern. His answers on Piazza are better than the textbook. He basically deserves every teaching medal in the book. Lecture was the main weakness. Maybe one day they'll let him teach the class. Prof. Tsyvinski goes very fast and does not really explain anything in a new or helpful manner.",
    "I thought that this course was well organized and enjoyabl.",
    "its good",
    "This class was disappointing - not practically relevant whatsoever, and definitely should not be a Global Affairs requirement.",
    "Strengths: - fairly strong TFs - Piazza was a vital source of information (almost entirely thanks to Prof. Hawkins) - Lecture slides were well organized Weaknesses: - discrepancy between difficulty of past exams and difficulty of actual exams made it a little frustrating to study for this course (exams were much more difficult that I expected, even after being told that they were going to be more difficult)",
    "The course presented an interesting subject but was not as engaging as I'd have liked it to be.",
    "I think section is really important to a big lecture course like this where many students can get confused quickly and easily but not have their confusion addressed until section or office hours. Section could be helpful, but it definitely can be improved. I think the work we covered in section was helpful but needed to be cut down to 50 minutes worth of things, because we often didn't finish what we needed to. Lectures can also be clearer and more related to problem sets.",
    "Lectures were boring and section was not very helpful",
    "Strengths: William Hawkins. Weaknesses: not going through the slides in the time allotted, ineffective lecturing",
    "I think a strength was William Hawkins and his passion for helping students. A weakness would be research papers which I felt took away from the course.",
    "It gives you really great grounding with what is going on in the economy. Having a course director on this module was very helpful. Professor Hawkins was extremely helpful and answered all our questions - PIAZZA was extremely useful.",
    "The strength of this course rest in the work of, Hawkins, the course director who was incredible. The weakness of the course was professor Tsyvinski, who was a bad lecturer.",
    "good, funny, and smart professor! incorporated relevant, current research as well basic models. great TAs. liked the WebWork in addition to the long answer psets",
    "Mr. William Hawkins does a really good job of organizing the class.",
    "I think one of the strengths of the course is professor Tsivinsky. Although sometimes he speaks to fast and went through the material too quickly in the beginning of the semester, he adjusted quickly and got on the right track. He is very passionate and I like how he taught us about economics in the real world. He seems like a great guy. Ways to improve the course involve making the sections more useful. Reviewing material in the book and doing one or two practice problems I feel would be a much better use of time!",
    "Classes always covered too much material ***HW was too long--took so much time between written and online parts. Learned more from the webwork than the long answers, at least in the first half. If there was a way to shorten work, there would be a lot less stress and a lost more learning, rather than trying to race to the end.",
    "It would be helpful if the practice exams could be more similar to the actual difficulty of the tests.",
    "Strengths: really liked that it matched up well with the textbook, it made it easier to follow and study. Professor was warm and loved that he tried to incorporate current research and studies. Loved that it included some lectures on modern macro issues like climate change and health care. Improvement: I think it would maybe be nice if examples with models were drawn out or done in person (as addition to the sides). It would just help to be given a real problem in lecture and watch the professor quickly do it.",
    "One strength of the course was the sections. Not all large lectures have sections, but these were particularly helpful for those who went. And if you didn't no harm done, you could just get the slides online. I would say that one weakness is that the lectures weren't as readily attended. Its not that they weren't interesting, its that they weren't relevant or helpful on the exams. The professor clearly loves his work and knows incredible amounts, but many students might only think in terms of \"is it on the test\".",
    "Lectures weren't very engaging.",
    "Lectures closely followed the textbook, so it was a great study source. Hawkins did an excellent job of answering questions through Piazza and creating documents summarizing the research we needed to know. Mix of webwork and long answer PSETs was good.",
    "I didn't find lecture very valuable, and I think most of my friends agree. Lecturer really flew threw topics and it was difficult to retain, learned most from reading the textbook",
    "The course did a really good job of showing why macroeconomics was a relevant field of study. It did show by incorporating policy, guest lecturers that are currently trying to address the pressing issues of macroeconomics, modern day studies in the field, and current statistics. I wish the grading on the Psets were more consistent, and that we were able to see which questions we got wrong on our midterms rather than just receiving our grades.",
    "I think that the research could have been more flushed out, or we could have discussed fewer pieces of research more in depth.",
    "PSets were generally pretty difficult and seemingly covered material we never learned in class. Furthermore, the scope of the course was too large for the time-frame.",
    "Strength: The out of class research was an interesting element that I have not had for my other classes so this was nice because after learning the basic content, we were able to see how the real world uses it. Weakness: It is difficult to facilitate student learning in the lecture-style of course, but that is the case with any lecture style class. Also, the way that the content was mixed with real world applications made it difficult at times to understand what students needed to know.",
    "Strengths: covers a lot Weaknesses: the lecture is not extremely helpful",
    "The class is huge so it is very impersonal. It could be improved if the professor held regular office hours that students were invited to attend. (The syllabus said in big letters: \"DO NOT COME TO MY OFFICE HOURS\". The homeworks are graded extremely unfairly. There are two questions, each worth 3 points. But each question has up to five parts. If you make the tiniest mistake in one of the five parts, they take of a full point, which is worth 33.33% of the points of the question!"

    "If ya gotta take it, ya gotta take it",
    "Take it with Professor Tsyvinski. Not for the knowledge in the book, but for all the extra research materials he brings into class. He definitely broadens my understanding of macroeconomics.",
    "absolutely not, it is hard to follow and keep up with",
    "Only if you really need Intro Macro to keep majoring in whatever you want to do! Don't take this for fun or if you feel like \"I should know how the economy works...\"- just go learn it on your own!",
    "do not take this class- it was quite painful",
    "Take this if you're interested in governmental policy, the effectiveness of organizations, politics, or social science in general. Basically, everyone should take this course. It'll help you understand the world to a greater extent.",
    "Yeah, it's fun.",
    "I mean its a prereq for a lot of stuff. Easy So credit",
    "Economics is incredibly important regardless of what field one goes into. This class offers a overarching view of economics that covers almost everything that you might be interested in, from finance to climate change.",
    "Any student that is interested in learning about the basic aspects of the macroeconomy should take this class.",
    "Yes",
    "if you want to be an Econ major or need it as a prerequisite, sure. otherwise, no. it's dry and not that great.",
    "Very interesting course, even if you're not super intrigued by economics. Very helpful in real world.",
    "This is a really great course in terms of material-- if you're interested in economics this is a great intro course to macro. It's way better than intro micro.",
    "I would recommend this course to any prospective Economics major. However, if a student isn't necessarily interested in the subject, they will probably be very bored in this class.",
    "Necessary as it is a prereq for econ major Not worth it if you're not econ or related major",
    "Don't take this class if it's not required in your major. Professor does not teach the material well, and you will be overwhelmed with all the material that you need to understand.",
    "Econ majors must take this course, and they will not regret taking it. I would recommend it to an student interested in learning how the economy works (both in theory and in reality.) Problem sets take some time, but are generally useful and improve understanding. Exams are pretty straightforward - you always know what type of question to expect.",
    "Yes, Professor Tsyvinksi's lectures were entertaining and informative and the material is useful for understanding a wide range of topics.",
    "I think econ is definitely a useful class just for life, so I would urge anyone and everyone to at least take a year of econ (micro\/macro) regardless of major.",
    "Probably the best course I have taken so far, Tsyvinky and Hawkin are amazing and if you learn each week you havea lot to gain.",
    "Have to take it for Econ degree, would not take if not an econ major",
    "Overall well taught, but you have to hold yourself accountable for paying attention and learning the material. Midterms were fair, final exam was incredibly hard. Problem sets aren't bad at all.",
    "Yes. Take it in the Spring, especially if William is the course director. All other TFs were super helpful too.",
    "Understanding macroeconomics is certainly an important part of being an educated voter and thinker in the modern world. In this regard, I recommend taking Intro Macro, but perhaps explore the seminar if you think that you would benefit from the attention of a teacher. Do not expect any personal attention in this class from anyone other than your friends (definitely find a study buddy).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I thought the workload was not impossible to manage and if you put in the time and effort you will do well in the class. Also the information learned is very valuable for anyone regardless of interests.",
    "You probably have to take this anyway, but I would definitely recommend taking it with Professor Tsyvinski. His lectures are generally pretty clear and engaging. What really made the course great was Dr. Hawkins, the course director. He was unbelievably quick to respond to questions on Piazza, and I felt like he always laid out very clear expectations. The homework was pretty manageable. Half of each problem set is online, and we were given unlimited attempts at the questions which was super helpful. The written component usually had one question dealing with real-world data, and one question that was more theoretical. As with most Econ classes, the curve is generous, but probably less so than Micro, so don't think you're guaranteed an A if you did well in Micro. The content itself was often very interesting, and definitely more research-based and related to the real-world than Micro. Overall, a challenging course but also a rewarding one if you choose to make it one.",
    "I did not enjoy this class. I only took it for the EP&E requirement.",
    "No.",
    "I would recommend it to others. Certainly if your major requires it, take the course but even if not, it's a useful primer to a lot of important issues and concepts in the world. Even if you never pursue economics any further academically, it still gives you a useful perspective on the world",
    "Yes bc its useful to understand macroeconomic principles",
    "Good intro knowledge of macroeconomics (lots of material). Enjoyed Aleh's lectures a lot. Dr Hawkins does a good job structuring the course - lots of learning materials, office hours, reviews, etc. but curve makes it very hard to break out of B\/B+ range.",
    "Yes, the course is clear and precise. You learn exactly what is advertised. With the help of the TA's and other staff it's a really enjoyable\/useful class in terms of what you learn.",
    "Unless the class is necessary for a student, I would not recommend it.",
    "If you don't like econ and do not want to be an econ major and you don't need this class for anything, don't take it. Don't take it because you think you want to challenge yourself or that it might be interesting. It won't be. You'll be frustrated and annoyed with yourself.",
    "Great as a macroeconomic option.",
    "Always take introductory microeconomics before this class. Once you've taken intro micro you know what you're getting into as you move on to macro. But even if you jump into this course blind, it is very easy to recommend. Knowing about how economies function on a large scale and what economic policies do is both interesting and useful. The workload isn't higher than average -- a simple 2-question (with multiple parts) problem set + section every week. It's a risk-free experience.",
    "I took the course as a prereq, but if I didn't have to, I definitely would not have taken it if given a chance to redo the year. Personally, I found the concepts and lectures boring, resulting in apathy that made sections not very helpful either because I didn't care or prepare until right before exams. Problem sets sometimes seemed pointless. However, there may be people who really love econ and may love the course.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably have to. Tsyvinski is an intelligent professor who cares about the case studies and intricacies he discusses later in in lecture, but his disdain for the introductory level clearly shows.",
    "Yes, because it's probably going to be a requirement for a major. But also, it's just useful stuff to be learning.",
    "Fsho. Econ 116 is a must take course for anyone slightly interested in the American economy. Aleh shares great insights about current research and brings in guest speakers that make this class unique compared to other Econ courses across the country.",
    "Even if you've taken micro, taking macro really gives you another lens of econ and hence I believe anyone considering econ \/ global affairs as a major should take econ 116. Aleh is a great instructor who is very passionate about the subject and is a great professor, and the material is engaging and interesting. definitely not a fun\/easy class, but you will learn a lot, and it helps you develop a basic understanding of everyday life related econ: you'd have a deeper understanding of topics like inflation, financial crises, government spending.. hence it would be easier to relate to the content than micro was",
    "This course is a great look into the world of Macroeconomics. The class is certainly large, but with discussion section, not too intimidating. It was a fantastic class to take.",
    "With the way it is currently taught with the random current events stuff we are responsible for knowing, no. But a lot of people need it for a major requirement.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to for a major. The class is incredibly poorly organized and Professor Tsyvinski is well intentioned but a bad teacher and unable to convey the material effectively. This was, without a doubt, the worst class I took my freshman year at Yale.",
    "I would only recommend it if they had to take it. It's not interesting enough to take on its own, but it's not awful if you have to take it.",
    "This class is wonderful if you like economics! I had a terrific time learning about the new research in the field, and the guest lecturers are really fascinating. Just stay engaged and you can have a good time.",
    "I think I would recommend it because the information is important to know, but I found the presentation of the material unhelpful. I found the reading much more helpful than lectures or section.",
    "If you are interested in Economics, this course will be great. Professor Hawkins did an amazing job directing the course and really improved it.",
    "A necessary evil.",
    "This is a good course, going to section helped me learn the material better and the lecture slides are very good.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course as an introductory economics course over the seminar. The workload in lecture is much more manageable and you're allowed more room for mistakes and growth.",
    "Yes, but it wasn't taught very well.",
    "I would, but I believe that this course could be much better.",
    "It's a great course to take. It's pretty easy, and it helps you understand the world better.",
    "yes a good survey course to take",
    "Yes t is good for learning about our economy",
    "If you are interested in majoring in economics, this course is necessary but if you're not quite sure yet, this course may not give the best representation of what is to come as it could be run more efficiently. It is very easy to fall behind if you don't understand something and you have a TA who doesn't want to help too much.",
    "I would, but not super highly. It's a class I don't regret taking, but may consider taking something else if I could do it again.",
    "If you want to major in Economics, take the class. It's nothing special, but it gets you through the basics pretty well.",
    "If you have to take intro macro then definitely take this class over the seminar. The grading curve isn't that bad. If you stay on top of the problem sets (fairly short, ~2 hours\/week max) and study for the exams then you'll do fine. Class can often be a waste of time since Tsyvinski usually just recites the important parts of the textbook and puts all of the slides online. However there are some guest lectures and research Tvyvinski pulls up that are really interested. William Hawkins absolutely runs the show with this class. He lets you know exactly what's going to be on exams, exactly how your grade is going to be calculated, and posts incredibly detailed solutions and grading rubrics for every question you do on problem sets and exams. The exams for this class got a lot harder this year from previous years, but the curve is generous.",
    "Even if you're not an Econ major; I would definitely recommend",
    "Not really unless you have to. Very confusing",
    "I definitely would. I thought this class built a solid background for macroeconomics and I emerged with an understanding of what I thought were core areas in macroeconomics. It is definitely a great and important intro class to take and I think the resources that you need to succeed are there if you take the initiative to seize them. The professor and teaching staff were really great and you learn beyond just the basic theories--there really is time dedicated towards bringing in recent macroeconomics research that extends the ideas in the textbook or bringing in guest speakers who connect issues we discuss frequently today to economics ideas.",
    "It all depends on the people running it. If Professor Tsyvinski is teaching but you have a strong course director like Dr. Hawkins, its probably fine. Lecture wont be useful, but youll have the support you need to understand the material and do well. If its just Professor Tsyvinski, Id stay away. He lacks the ability to teach well, and more importantly, he lacks the interest in putting in time and effort to run the class effectively.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. If you don't, don't.",
    "I would really recommend this class to anyone who wants to have a good comprehensive introduction to macroeconomics. They lay a good foundation for the basics of macroeconomy, and the lectures often incorporate interesting relevant points about the topics in the real world.",
    "Yes, in the sense that it's extraordinarily interesting and useful information.",
    "Not particularly. If you have to take it as a requirement it's definitely not terrible, but if you don't have a particular interest in econ and just want to learn more about it I don't think it's worth taking.",
    "HIGHLY recommend.",
    "I would say take it if you have to in order to fulfill requirements or something. Other than that, I don't recommend it. I took the seminar last semester and I liked it much more.",
    "It's a good introduction to macroeconomics and certainly provides a different perspective than an AP macroeconomics class, but is not particularly engaging. That said, this class does not take much effort and provides a high return on investment.",
    "Well, it's a prerec for a lot of things so... yeah",
    "For those interested in the fundamentals of economics, it is a good introductory course that presents a wide breadth of material.",
    "Yes. You learn a different perspective to view the world from.",
    "Yes I think that generally speaking this course gives a useful and exciting introduction to macroeconomics",
    "Yes if you would like to improve your general understanding of the economy.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning about the economy and issues surrounding the economy.",
    "Yes, very interesting.",
    "The course was full of interesting material that brought out ideas regarding economic productivity for not only the USA, but also other nations. The course covers basic macro theory which is very applicable and helps one to better understand core political (economic) issues.",
    "I would recommend the course if students are interested in Economics, Global Affairs, or Political Science.",
    "Only if they are truly interested or want to major in an Economic field.",
    "Good basic",
    "Hawkins is the best!! Take the class if he is involved or take his seminar.",
    "yes",
    "Yes. Helped me understand logic of the economy very well",
    "If you like macro, sure!",
    "If you want to learn more about Econ, or just be an informed citizen, take it.",
    "I would recommend the material and Dr. William Hawkins, but not the class on the whole. It's probably a pre-req and you have no choice, but I would still not objectively recommend the class on the whole. However, do whatever you can to take advantage of Dr. Hawkins. He is amazing, and really should be teaching the class.",
    "I am a social science student who has struggled with quantitative courses in the past, but I really enjoyed this course, and was amazed at the huge effort that was spent to make sure that there were enough resources to help us.",
    "Yes it is very interesting.",
    "Absolutely not - take another class that is more intellectually interesting or more relevant to the real world.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a great foundational course and it'll teach you a lot.",
    "I would recommend another student to take this class if they're interested in economics and real world applications of it. Lectures can be dry though",
    "I would only recommend it if you really enjoy economics, otherwise it is boring",
    "Overall, I'd recommend it if you want to go into Econ\/GLBL\/poly sci. Just make sure you get a good TA (hawkins) or you'll struggle throughout. I find that lectures aren't very helpful or engaging. The book is well done though, so I just based my studying off of that. For tests: make sure to do all the previous midterms and tests! Super helpful!",
    "Intro Macro is a lot of work but it really really depends on who your TA is. Prof. Tsyvinski is a great lecturer, he's really engaging and is always cracking a joke or two. It's a typical econ lecture, you have your psets, you have lecture and section. If you do the work and ask questions when you need help you'll be fine.",
    "Yes. Not only because it is required for Econ majors, but because I personally found it interesting.",
    "Yes, it is by far the most interesting course I have taken. If you want to understand the world around you, this is the life 101 course!",
    "take this class -- you will learn so much practical knowledge that will help you better understand US and global politics, and its a very reasonable workload. go to lecture!",
    "Yes. It's a good introduction to macroeconomy.",
    "Ehhh-the only reason is if you're majoring in Econ (or think you are, before taking this class).",
    "If they are interested in economics, then this is the class for them.",
    "While it can be boring at times (as many intro classes are), I actually really enjoyed the class and appreciate the knowledge gained. It's nice to know how fiscal and monetary policy affects economic growth and GDP -- important skills for life and for understanding policy.",
    "Take it if you want a better foundation. If you are more comfortable with Macro, you could simply take intermediate instead.",
    "Probably not, my engagement with the course was very low, and I did not much care for the material we learned.",
    "I preferred it to micro, but I know many people who felt the opposite. It was interesting for someone who had no econ experience before college.",

    "Yes -- it's good for the basics",
