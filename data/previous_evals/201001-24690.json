   "comments": [
    "Its a fairly easy and interesting course. The first half is a lot like Winter's fall course (Total War) simply because its about Britain during that time. The second half was kinda dry for me - I'm not too big into modern politics and once we started talking about Thatcher and Blair I was pretty bored.Great course-load: midterm paper (10pages) comparing 2 books from a list that was graded leniently. Basically a glorified book report. Final: he gave us 12 essay questions, 4 will be on the final of which we will write three essays.Section is mandatory and a large portion of your grade apparently, though. Page responses for section each week were not too hard to pound out. The reading packet was monstrous however, which definitely detracts, but you can get away skipping some.Definitely recommend for an easy 5th that you don't necessarily need to take Cr\/D or if you're into British politics.",
    "Pretty much exactly as described in the syllabus--a discussion of Britain since 1900, focusing on political and cultural changes during the period. Jay Winter is one of the best lecturers at Yale, and as a former chair of History at Cambridge he's an authoritative source on the subject. Some of his lectures editorialize a bit (his hatred for Thatcher is barely concealed), but overall I couldn't imagine a better person to teach. Even if you don't take the class, his lectures on WWI and on Churchill are amazing performances in and of themselves. Highly recommended, and not much work (10pg book report--yeah, seriously--and a final exam).",
    "Yes. The biggest problem is the weekly reading response which is a waste of time.",
    "Excellent--really interesting. Even if you're not a British enthusiast, this is a great class because it touches on so many other issues--empire, world wars, economics, politics, trade unions--it's just really great. Work is fine--1\/3 class participation(which includes weekly reading responses of 1 page) 1\/3 ten page book review 1\/3 final(with Q's given out beforehand) --plenty o'reading, though",
    "A classic Yale history lecture, with a very manageable workload. Winter is incomparable. Invariably a solid choice.",
    "Everyone at Yale should take this class at some point. It offers a great perspective on the history of the 20th century, not only British history. It expanded my thinking about conflict and politics and the way people interact with and shape their history.",
    "Survey of British History. Straightforward but good",
    "Yes. It's a really good class with tons of reading but little work otherwise that gives you a solid picture of modern Britain.",
    "This is a good class if you're interested in WWI and WWII, as that's the focus of the class in the first half, but it also gets to present day which is cool.",
    "A survey of 20th century Britain that feels unlike any other survey history course because of Professor Winter's brilliant teaching style.",
    "Take the class. It's fantastic, the workload isn't overbearing, you will learn a lot.",
    "Yes, recommended",
    "A lot of reading, but what history class doesn't have that. Definitely recommended but not as fully as other courses.",
    "This is a wonderful class to take if you have any interest whatsoever in British History. Professor Winter is a very engaging lecturer, and also very helpful outside of lecture. He does have liberal political views, which you have to ignore occasionally if you disagree with him, but he is a great historian. As a junior history major, I felt that the reading load was fine but I have heard other people say its a lot of reading."
