    "I learned about the relationship between form and function in the evolution of invertebrates by discussing examples from a wide variety of taxa. In parallel, I also had the opportunity to engage with specimens from the rich collections of the Peabody Museum not only by looking at selected examples during class, but also by conducting a short project based on one or a few museum specimens. This gave me experience designing my own scientific research project and writing a paper based on my results."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the hands-on format of the class in which we looked at specimens which illustrated the topics and questions we were discussing. Additionally, I also appreciated the opportunity to hear from a variety of guest lecturers, each of whom had different research interests and different approaches to studying their specific topic. It was a bit worrying at times that the entire course grade was based on the final research project and presentation, but I wouldn't be very keen to have examinations either."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone who thinks they would find the material interesting. One thing to keep in mind when deciding on this course is the workload; although there are few readings and no written work assigned during the semester, there is a research project that will require a substantial amount of time outside of class."
