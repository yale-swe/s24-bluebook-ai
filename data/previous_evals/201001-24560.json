    "Take this course if you're planning to make a documentary for a senior project (or just have a lot of extra time). It's a difficult class. You'll need to shoot and edit the film yourself.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but be wary depending on who is teaching it. You will come away with a great film, but the process will not be the most enjoyable.",
    "yes.",
    "I think any F&ES student interested in using mass media to involve in environmental debates and try making positive changes should take this course. I think all the students directly linked with the Environmental Film Festival at Yale should take this course, and gain from the insights it provide on how documentary film making differs from other forms of visual media interactions.",
    "This is the second part of the year long documentary class, if you have an idea and have shot a lot of footage before coming in, you'll be ready for this course. You can do a good documentary in one semester, but its a lot of work and by the end you can\/will make an awesome 30 min documentary."
