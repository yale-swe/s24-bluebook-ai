   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're interested. I would say it's an okay class overall.",
    "Great class, pretty simple exams and cool field trips. Didn't talk as much about larger animals as I thought we would though.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who genuinely has an interest in ocean processes and how they interact with the entire globe, specifically people with environmental interests. Otherwise, the dryness of some lectures would not feel worth sitting through. In the end, you get a really good background in just about every topic in oceanography, so if that's what you're looking for, this class is great!",
    "Biological Oceanography is a class that is definitely worth checking out if (a) you're interested in successfully learning about the physical and biological properties of the ocean(beware--this class is NOT about whales.); (b) you're interested in a small, intimate classroom experience; (c) you're prepared to work hard and learn a lot from the graduate students in the class. The course isn't NOT a gut science class, since the exams are graded pretty hard and since the course does entail a fair amount of other assignments.This class is very rewarding, especially since its designed to allow students of all different learning styles to engage with the material. From creating our own presentations to going on field trips to collect plankton Long Island Sound and the local NOAA office, you will learn a lot in the class (that is, if you are willing to put in all the work)!",
    "This is not a marine biology class, if that's what you're looking for. It's definitely an important class to take, however, and gives a good foundation for the physical processes in the ocean. Prof. Decker may not seem like the most fascinating lecturer, but the material is super interesting, and she does a really good job of answering questions and trying to involve the class in discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was one of the best classes I have taken and the information is extremely relevant to modern environmental concerns."
