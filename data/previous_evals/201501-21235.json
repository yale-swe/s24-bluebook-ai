   "comments": [
    "Yes! Everyone should take it.",
    "Yes. I took the class to learn about neuroimaging methods in psychiatry and I did. The class covered several neuroimaging methods and how they are currently being utilized in imaging psychiatric disorders. It delivered what it promised. I wish we could have done one or two sessions on epilepsy.",
    "This course is especially useful for students interested in clinical neuroscience research. However, students who come into the course with a foundational understanding of the neuroimaging methods discussed in the course (fMRI\/PET\/MRS\/SPECT) will profit the most as the details of each method are not really taught in this course (this is more the focus of the Fall semester course in this series). This course is really more focused on applications.",
    "The course is a seminar where various professors share their research on neuropsychiatric disorders and how they use neuroimaging techniques to do so. I would recommend the course to another student, if they have a sufficient background in neuroscience.",
    "This course is a good introduction to neuroimaging methods and how they are used in research. I would recommend it to any neuroscientist who is not already familiar with PET, SPECT, MRI, and the use of these methods in current research. Even if you do not use neuroimaging in your own research, the knowledge contained in this course will help you understand the literature. This course also contains interesting discussions on psychiatric disorders and drug development.",
    "I would recommend the class."

   "comments": [
    "The course did not contribute to either my research or dissertation. But it did offer me what I wanted: to learn neuroimaging methods and how they are used in assessing and therapy of psychiatric disorders.",
    "My dissertation research involves a translational component using fMRI so it was useful to learn from the experience of faculty members involved in both basic and clinical work.",
    "I think going forward, I can identify methods that may be appropriate for the type of research that I plan to do.",
    "Neuroimaging taught me the basic theory of PET, SPECT, and MRI, along with some examples of their application. I became accustomed to reading and interpreting imaging studies. The guest lecturers provided a variety of insights on neuropsychiatric research and how the pharmaceutical industry works. I do not use neuroimaging in my own research, but I frequently come across it in the literature and in colleagues' research presentations. Neuroimaging class has made me more competent and confident at interpreting these studies.",
    "Improved my understanding"
