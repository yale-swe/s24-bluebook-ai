    "I am interested in international political economy, and the course was also very useful in seeing how domestic and international economic structures respond to or create political outcomes. I feel it gave me a much better grounding in recent global economic history.",
    "I am much more able to understand now the international flows which contribute to stability or instability in different currency regimes. Also, I now understand the role of the central bank and what takes place while upholding a currency exchange rate. Also, the pros and cons of inflation and deflations. These are critically important to my studies in developing markets."
