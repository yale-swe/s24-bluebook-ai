    "This is nothing after Pchem lab.",
    "This course is required for the major and is surprisingly useful in terms of connecting key concepts from the other engineering courses you have taken. It involves a kinetics, membrane separation, heat transfer, and 2 other biology based labs that gives one a nice overview of engineering techniques. The lab reports are not ridiculous and the labs themselves are not too tedious either. Overall I would recommend this course because it contains a lot of fundamental techniques a chemical engineer should know and understand.",
    "My answer to this question is supposed to reflect broader concerns within Chem E. There are professors who are smart, capable, and overall decent people but who just don't have enough time or energy for the Chem E's. My general impression of this class(but maybe this applies to life in general) is that the professors did try to make it better, but it ended up just being an average course in the life of a Chem E.It was a decent experience, but certainly not at all life-changing.",
    "If you're taking it you have no choice.",
    "A fine lab class. The lab reports take a while, but nothing like p-chem. There is a lot of bio, which was surprising, but the integration of bio will probably go better as years go on. You will likely lean on your TA quite heavily to help with the reports and procedures."
