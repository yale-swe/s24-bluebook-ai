   "comments": [
    "A good, relatively easy overview of ancient civ. If you're a history major, I'd definitely recommend this class as a way to get an LAAA credit and a pre-ind credit all at once. Can't recommend the lectures much, but if you do the reading you barely need to go anyway. I took this credit D and it was barely a factor in my life at all.",
    "Not be best course around but it's alright.",
    "If you are interested in the ancient world good survey",
    "Was an interesting course on a topic not previously covered, but as it is a new course, the professors are still getting everything together. Wait a few years perhaps, and take it then--",
    "I would recommend it, but be prepared for a lot of readings!",
    "This was a good survey course on Ancient Empires, and I would recommend taking it if you already have a decent background in the area. Do not expect to gain incredibly in depth knowledge on any given empire (each one could comprise the material of numerous courses), but this will provide you with a framework for comparing between them, and maybe ruling your own one day...",
    "If you would like a general overall view of ancient and classical empires, this is a good class to take. It's a great intro course and a nice warm up to more advanced courses. The TFs do all the grading though, so that might be something you have to keep in mind. But Andy and Francois were easy graders.",
    "An incredibly broad survey of ancient history, full of fun anecdotes you'll want to tell your friends about. Not too much work, some interesting theory of empires, and you'll feel like you learned a lot. I'm really glad I took this class, and I'm not a history major.",
    "An awesome course. Really interesting material and readings and the workload is manageable, especially if you're really interested in the subject. It's basically a survey course, they don't go into that much depth on every empire, but it's still really interesting. The exams were not that hard. Good humanities credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Especially anybody interested in history in general, it is a great way to survey different areas one may be interested in, and it is also good to grasp a background in the understanding of areas and times around a particular segment in history one already enjoys.",
    "A survey of Imperialism from New Kingdom Egypt, through Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Athens, Macedon, Rome, Byzantium, and Ummayyads. Not too much work; in fact, a midterm, final, and a paper was it. Incredible faculty, and lectures based on information that most people don't realize. Take it.",
    "It was a solid history class. It was in depth and the themes were interesting, but what they decided to teach from each empire often seemed somewhat random\/not always parallel. I would recommend the class, if the teachers were to spend a little time paring down the readings and working on English fluency.",
    "Great overall view of ancient empires!",
    "This is an interesting class for anyone wishing to put history into context and to see how history can relate to real life. If you are not familiar with the empires covered, you get a nice rundown of the main points of each and then under a team of world-class experts, you also learn how they're all connected."
