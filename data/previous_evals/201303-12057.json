    "Take it with Crawford if you can! He's a really great professor, and I now feel that I have a good grasp on the material- something I never felt in orgo 1. I had a very positive experience with this course. There were only 5 problem sets, so the workload was very manageable, though the 3 midterms did require a good amount of studying.",
    "It is a prerequisite so most people are taking it to fufill that requirement.",
    "I assume you're either pre-med or need the class for a major. No one takes this for fun. It is not fun. It can be interesting at times. But mostly, learning in this class is like taking a drink of water from a pressure hose. It's too much, but hey, what can you do about it...",
    "Its a lot of memorization of a lot of material. However, because the tests are just regurgitating mechanisms that Crawford writes on the board, if you are thorough with your memorization you can get nearly a 100% on everything. It is not very similar to the first half of orgo. Always come to class, take good notes, and be prepared to copy your notes multiple times.",
    "Crawford is really not bad! This is all organic chemistry of biological molecules which means you get rid of the KMnO4 and \"heat at 1000 degrees in concentrated sulphuric acid\" in favour of stuff that actually happens outside of lab (an in biochem lecture). It's cofactor based and the TFs were b*tches about grading so it really is a good idea to focus in lecture and write out any mechanisms he does with specific cofactors in one spot (for example, keep a paper for all the times ATP comes up). With a few exceptions (fatty acid synthesis comes to mind- it's his thing), the cofactors were more important that the pathways. Psets weren't bad and there were only 5. They cumulatively count for as much as a midterm though. The midterms can be all over the place but the class is actually decent and you probably have to take it anyway so just put your head down and enjoy it.",
    "If you have to take this course, take it with Crawford -- he's definitely your best option! He only assigns five problem sets (which are all very doable) and doesn't focus on memorization. Instead, you learn cofactor chemistry, which is much more interesting and useful.The course is well organized and Crawford is an incredible instructor, so take it with him!",
    "CHEM 230 was a good course. Professor Crawford's lectures were clear and easy to follow. He contextualized each mechanism within its overall biological pathway, and helped us to understand and apply them to other cases. Professor Crawford made it clear what he hoped for us to learn, and exams were very fair. It feels like we learned a lot of information, but Professor Crawford helped us understand it all in vey digestible amounts. Only 5 written problem sets for the semester, and they were never assigned too close to a test, so never felt overburdened with orgo work. Overall a positive experience with Professor Crawford!",
    "It is an interesting orgo II lecture with biology attached. The bio made it a lot more interesting and I would recommend it for an organic chemistry requirement. Decent workload but if you have to take organic chemistry its a worthwhile course with Crawford.",
    "This course was my favorite course of the semester (yes, my friends are surprised when I say Orgo was pretty stress-free and enjoyable). I think Professor Crawford's style of teaching and willingness to be flexible in terms of what the class could understand and accomplish made this class an interesting and enjoyable course. Material was great, tests were just challenging enough to require hours of studying but honestly pretty fun to take if adequately prepared.",
    "As far as organic chemistry goes, this class was not too bad. Professor Crawford is a good teacher to take it with and there were only five relatively short problem sets for the whole semester. If you are thinking of taking this over freshmen orgo 2, I would highly recommend it.",
    "CHEM 230 is a pretty relaxed second semester organic chemistry course. If you have the basics of general chemistry\/first semester organic chemistry, this class is not difficult. There are only 5 problem sets that take around 1 hr each and the 3 midterms are complete regurgitation. To do well on the midterms only requires you to memorize the 10-15 or so reactions Professor Crawford went over in class. While this is can be a lot of memorization, it really is all you need to get an A on the midterms. The final is the only examination that makes you apply the reactions in different scenarios, so it's in your best interest to do well on the midterms. Overall, the class is taught very well. Professor Crawford is a slow and clear lecturer so it's easy to understand everything in class. However, I would recommend annotating notes to provide context for each reaction so it makes it easier to look over notes. Section is not very helpful because they go over homework and tests even though the solutions are posted online. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class because the material is interesting, the workload is light and manageable and the class is well taught.",
    "At first this course took a bit of getting used to; compared to CHEM220, CHEM230 involved complex biological mechanisms that seemed quite different from the more simple and straightforwardly-logical concepts in CHEM220. I would recommend taking very good notes right from the beginning - Professor Crawford is very fair about only testing you on material he has covered in class. I did not realize this at first and studied the book more than the class notes (which was the best way to go in Ziegler's CHEM220), which was a mistake for this course. The TAs graded the problem sets and tests quite harshly, so it would be best to really have all the concepts covered in class down before tackling the problems sets or tests.",
    "Take it only if you're chemistry of premed.",
    "If you are a science major yes, but if you're just looking for a science credit look elsewhere.",
    "Professor Crawford was so straight-forward during lecture! It was refreshing. And he always had an exam focus day on the Monday before the Friday exams where he told you exactly what pathways and molecules to study. So I had no complaints at all.",
    "Much easier to learn than chem 220, good class, but more biochemistry than orgo.",
    "M\/W\/F lecture, 5 problem sets, 3 midterms, and a final. The problem sets are short, usually 2-4 problems, and are not too difficult once you figure out which pathway to use. The midterms and exam are cofactor based, so understanding the cofactor chemistry is key. I found this course to be much more interesting than Orgo I.",
    "If you are thinking about taking Orgo II, I would not hesitate to recommend taking it with Professor Crawford. His lectures are generally easy to follow and engaging, and he also was particularly careful to make his expectations clear so that there were almost never any nasty surprises on the exams. His p-sets were perhaps a bit too difficult and long at first, but the last few were shorter - and there aren't many of them to begin with. His exams tend to reflect his p-sets (except simpler), rather than the practice problems in the textbook. The textbook is reasonably good, but covers a lot more material than we were able to get to in class. I wish we had been able to cover a bit more of it, but Professor Crawford kept the course load at a very manageable level.",
    "So reasonable! The psets were either 2 or 4 questions, and every other week. They were actually really helpful and effective. Definitely the most reasonable science I've taken.",
    "Chem 230 isn't a class I would take for fun, but if you need it, it's not bad. It is more memorization and electron pushing than anything else, but Crawford is good and tries to reduce the amount of rote memorization as much as possible. The psets are short and the tests are fair. Just be sure to allot as much time to the class as the material demands (which is a lot).",
    "Take this class! Professor Crawford is the best science professor I have ever had. I loved orgo this semester. Challenging material but he teaches it very well and all of the midterms are very fair. Crawford is the best!",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student, unless he or she really desires an academic challenge. The TAs are not very helpful, and there was little to no partial credit. Enjoy.",
    "Orgo II was interesting, well-taught (Crawford is the best Chemistry prof I've had thus far), and overall really enjoyable. It is easier than Orgo I in the sense that we know what we're in for. Professor Crawford is a god-send. After enduring self-teaching in Orgo I, having a professor like Crawford was amazing. He does a great job of teaching things that are only in the book (so we aren't scrambling last minute for details during midterm studying) and also tells you exactly what you need to know. He is approachable and clear. With that said, GO TO CLASS. He oftentimes pulls mechanisms and cofactor chemistry directly from class lectures, and if you don't attend, you'll be studying things that are irrelevant for the midterm.",
    "If you're going to take Orgo II, you probably have to take it no matter what for pre-med or your major. That said, Professor Crawford was an excellent professor. He is one of the best lecturers I have had at Yale so far, and he was able to explain the material very clearly. The course is really, really hard no matter what because there is a lot more material to memorize than in Orgo I. However, Professor Crawford is a good professor if you have to take it.",
    "It isn't very much like 220 in that it focuses on mechanism memorization rather than concepts. It is also nothing like AP Chemistry. From what I've heard, the freshman orgo series is more like traditional orgo series, and I would recommend taking that if at all possible.",
    "very hard!!!!!"
