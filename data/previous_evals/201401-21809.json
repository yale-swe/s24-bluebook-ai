    "yes yes take it",
    "Great way to spend your Friday afternoons. Take it.",
    "I would, but not if you expect to do a lot of painting. If you'd like a fairly technical art historical class in which you apply some of the techniques you've learned about, take it. I learned a lot, but I did not paint a lot. The painting you do is mostly self-motivated. There are three practice paintings and a final painting, but the bulk of the assignments are either in presentation or written form. Mark has high expectations for these. Overall, the course is really interesting and you learn a fairly wide breadth of techniques. I look at paintings differently now that I know something about how they were made and subsequently restored.",
    "Great class, relaxed and interesting! Grading hard",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS - I learned a lot that I never would have learned in a traditional studio course. It provided me with a new perspective on the craft of painting and will certainly impact the way I view art in the future.",
    "Yes! Even if you've never painted before, you'll still enjoy the class. You learn a lot about the old painting masters and different techniques. You'll never be able to look at paintings in a museum the same way again.",
    "Yes. This is an awesome class different than any class you will take art or otherwise."
