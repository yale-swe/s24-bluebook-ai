    "it's an okay class. we learned about countries recovering from conflict--pretty straightforward. frankly, it's a class you can do well in without putting in a lot of work. you don't really have to do the readings since almost all of the class grade is based on papers (but incorporate a couple of relevant readings in order to boost your grade). i would say i learned more from writing the papers than from listening to the lectures.",
    "Take it as a 5th class, don't expect it to be the crown jewel of your schedule.",
    "Yes, without doubt. It was a great class. However the writing is pretty heavy duty. You'll end up doing a lot of research by yourself and at the end of the semester have a comprehensive knowledge on the aspects of post-conflict scenarios. Also, there is a lot of reading but you can be selective about it. The Professor is great and always willing to help you out."
