   "comments": [
    "Modernities will probably not be the way I took it for you. That's because the major changes this core seminar every year. As a first go, Modernities was quite successful. We traced the origins of modernity in a DS H&P\/Lit mode. Class was organized into a lecture and seminar section each week, 75 min each. Very worthwhile, because this class is taught by two superstars. Oh and only two 10-12pg papers during the semester.",
    "Redundant with other canon-oriented courses I've taken. We read good texts, but the same you will find in courses like DS. Not too many assignments, and the readings were often interesting (because they were seminal, canonized works by Rousseau, Proust, etc.) We read almost exclusively white male authors, which made for repetitive conversations. This lack of diversity in course material made the class much less compelling than if it had examined the implications of modernities for more than rich white males.",
    "The course has a ton of potential, but I probably wouldn't recommend it as is.",
    "You read many interesting modern texts and lambast them thoroughly with Smith and Bloch.",
    "I would encourage other students who have some background in political philosophy to take this course.",
    "Great class, take it!",
    "A strong course with an excellent reading list. Professors Bloch and Smith were entertaining and enlightening, and you will read fantastic pieces here you will likely not encounter anywhere else. I took this class having not taken DS, and I imagine it to be equally rewarding to a student whether or not she has taken DS in the past.",
    "A good overview of several works and modernity. Sort of a hipster DS that is low-stress.",
    "Modernities has a wonderful reading list, and if you do the reading, the class really comes together by the end of the semester; however, because it's very easy for the discussions to fall flat (since you only have one seminar per book), it can also become easy for the books to feel disconnected. You can skate by the class without doing much, unfortunately, but it will be way, way more fulfilling if you do the reading, work on your papers with real effort, try to start discussions in class, and ask questions during lecture. This may all sound obvious, but I found this to be especially true in this class: it's what you make of it.",
    "Modernity is a huge and important topic for a holistic understanding of the history of western literature, philosophy and political thought. This course is a good general survey of the development of ideas characteristic of modernity, such as individualism, moral relativism, death of God, the fluidity of time-space etc. The lectures are insightful and draw connections between different works in the modernity canon. But maybe due to the broadness of the topics and the diversity of readings (including novels, essays & speeches), the discussions can often be scattered and too general. I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the discussions. They weren't as philosophically rigorous as I would like. There also wasn't a clear methodology of interpretation. Some of the earlier works were a bit boring to read. Be sure to sample some of those when shopping the class e.g. Robinson Crusoe, Benjamin Franklin's autobiography and Descartes' Discourse on Method. If you are interested in the philosophical aspect of modernity, I would not recommend this course. Don't worry about the Humanities major requirement-you can always do the old major... Although this course did inspire me to further study the works of Nietzsche and Max Weber.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student unless the course is substantially revised. The course felt like a very surface level exploration of various trends in literature and philosophy that can be construed as modern in different respects. We did little substantive comparative work among authors, breezed through a lot of the texts we covered, and had very general section discussions that were not very rooted in specific or deep textual analysis. I would also add that it did not feel great being a woman in this class. Discussions were very dominated by my male peers, many of whom were allowed to make sweeping, grandiose points that were wholly unrooted in the text with no faculty intervention or effort to redirect discussion. We only read one female author (and really, in a class concerned with modernity, there is no justifiable reason for the absence of women from the syllabus; there are so many works by female authors that could have greatly enriched the syllabus).",
    "I already have. I feel that it offers a nice backbone to one's humanities education (particularly for those that did not take directed studies and wish for something similar)",
    "I would definitely, although 9:25 is early!"
