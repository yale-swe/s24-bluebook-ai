    "I think this course provides an excellent chance for gaining some hands-on practice and experimental skills in physical chemistry. Thus, I wound recommend this course to students who are interesed doing research in these fields",
    "Chem 560 includes and introduction to computer programming and data manipulation, electronics, raman and laser spectroscopy, and vacuum systems; much of which will be useful in an experimental physical chemistry research lab. I would recomend this course to those interested in experimentation in physical chemistry, physics, or chemical enginearing. I would caution other students not to procrastinate because some of the modules do take a lot of time."

The experiments and report-writting also trained my reasoning and experiment design skills. But I'm still not sure how much this course wound contribute my future research in computational\/theoretical chemistry.",
    "I have not started research yet, but I forsee much of the course matterial being usefull."
