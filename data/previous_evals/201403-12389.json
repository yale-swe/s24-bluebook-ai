   "comments": [
    "I would say that the class is structured around a close reading of selections from Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" (roughly 100 pages out of a book that is 500+ pages long) and Schelling's \"Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom\" (an essay, roughly 80 pages long). Both of these readings are quite dense and require a good deal of unpacking on the part of the reader. The first part of the course is designed to properly situate these two works in the context of the time in which they were written (with short readings from Jacobi, Lessing, Kant, Goethe, etc). The course also devotes some time to explaining the relationship between Hegel\/Schelling and the Kabbalah (which I personally found very helpful, since I would have never considered this). I would recommend this course to any student of philosophy, on the basis of the quality of the class (and the professor), and also because it provides an opportunity to do close readings of the key texts of two tremendously influential thinkers in the canon of Western thought. The material is very challenging, but I thought the class was worth the effort.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in German Idealism."
