   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is dry, but it's an easy QR if you go to section. Skip the lectures though, they're useless. Also, all the tests are open book\/open note. Print out the lectures which are posted online and you're set.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that is made up of problems sets, tests and a paper, but it is not too difficult. I would recommend this class to someone.",
    "I would highly recommend Astro 170. The material is interesting and the format of very student-friendly.",
    "I would recommend this course highly. It is full of amazing content and passionate teaching.",
    "I would not recommend it.",
    "I do not recommend this class if you actually want a good introduction to astronomy. The physics is too advanced for your average student going into the class, so you are presented with a lot of complicated equations without understanding the concepts that underlie them or how they are derived (which the professor sometimes tried to show but it was honestly lost on everyone). It was also a lot of work\/effort for a gut QR class, which is what I suppose most people were hoping to get out of it. Three tests (all open book\/notes), six problem sets, and a 12-15 page final paper. However, the math we had to do was BEYOND minimal. So if you don't have a problem with having to go to section every week for the answers to the problem sets and exams in advance and writing a long research paper for your math credit, then this would be a good course for you. You also don't really have to go to class (although I did, which I realize now was a mistake because I never really got anything out of it) because all of the information you need is on the lecture slides. In fact, the professor recommends that you not take notes so you can really listen to what she has to say. It never really made sense to me though beyond a few concepts she introduced at the beginning.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU NEED AN EASY QR.Even if you need an easy QR, this course is a total waste of your time.-Lecture is boring.-Section is \"optional,\" but if you don't go, you won't understand anything.-There are three exams, seven problem sets, and a huge final paper. If you have half a brain, you will do fine in the course, but it is still a lot of work.",
    "I would summsrize this course for a fellow student in this way, challenging and informative. Yes I would recommend it to another student for the same reason I mentioned earlier.",
    "3 in-class OPEN BOOK OPEN NOTES tests (one is a midterm, but the same length and depth as the others), 6 (although there was supposed to be 7) problem sets and one 12-15 pg paper on a topic of your choice somehow related to Cosmology- it can even be on the Aztec's astronomical models. The problem sets are kind of annoying and they're graded pretty tough, but there aren't too many and they're usually only 4 questions (two quant, two qualitative). Go to the test reviews- the TA's tell you what's going to be on the tests- you'll basically just have to copy the lecture slides for the test.",
    "This class is good if you are looking for an easier QR. The material was pretty interesting and the professor was enthusiastic which made class more bearable. I would definitely recommend this class for someone who needs a QR.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with some interest in trying to understand the universe. It is not easy but very possible for non-science majors. There is very little hard math or science.",
    "Class is pretty interesting. All notes are posted on classes v2 server, which contain all material for the exams. Would recommend as a science credit for non-science majors.",
    "If you want a decently easy QR\/Science class take it. All the tests are open note.",
    "Gives a great overview of modern cosmological theories. Definitely recommend taking.",
    "Gut quantitative credit for humanities majors. Not too much work until the final paper.",
    "An easy class that I would highly recommend. Weekly problem sets that are easy, open book tests (all of them) where you can bring a calculator and all your notes and problem set solutions, and a teacher that explains a lot. Downer: 15 page paper at the end.",
    "Take this course if you need a QR."
