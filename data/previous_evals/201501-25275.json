   "comments": [
    "If you already have some background in R or other programming, this course might be frustratingly slow at times, because many of the other students will have to catch up. On the whole, however, it's useful if you want to gain an understanding of open-source GIS tools or species distribution modeling.",
    "You'll gain exposure to a lot of modeling tools, but I'm not sure that you'll come away with the ability to apply them to your own work - so be aware of that limitation.",
    "The course was an introduction to spatial analysis via coding platforms. I would not recommend it to my fellow classmates. Although you do cover the basics, the pace of learning in class was too fast and you have to do a lot of work to keep up. There wasn't enough practical learning in the classroom.",
    "I would recommend it only if the person has some experience with coding.",
    "With the current style of teaching, I wouldn't recommends the course to a student who has never had experience before with linux programming. It can be rather frustrating without prior knowledge. However, if someone is willing to go more than the extra mile or, has some knowledge of programming, this course would suite him\/her perfectly.",
    "The course introduced me to an array of current open-source spatial data analysis tools, and how to interact with and manipulate those tools, especially for environmental niche modeling. Coming from a background of zero experience with coding, R, BASH, VirtualBox, etc., I was able to successfully drive the Yale supercomputer cluster, OMEGA; create an environmental niche model; and use programs like Hex and Map of Life. That said, after the first third of the class, I felt like most of the information was over my head. The barrier of not knowing R script was a big obstacle. A lot of in-class assignments were follow-along, copy-and-paste. At times I felt I was copying rather than learning. I did not gain a great ability to use open source GIS tools as I had hoped. However, it was worth it to me to see what is available and learn what I don't know, so to speak. I cannot use the tools taught to any helpful extent, but I know now where I could go to learn, and how to better to communicate ideas and needs to experts who can use those tools. It was frustrating to not become an expert myself, but excellent to see the possibilities and get to know some of the experts in the field--Walter, Adam, and Giuseppe.",
    "This course is an excellent way to learn spatial data analysis. I would recommend the class to another student, because it teaches you many helpful skills for future research in spatial modeling."

   "comments": [
    "The course broadened my understanding of Program R's 'sp' package - however that was due to my own undertakings.",
    "I was hoping to use this course to do some analysis for my dissertation, however it didn't end up working out. I hope that sometime I will be able to learn this stuff, because it's very interesting. However I didn't really learn very much in this course.",
    "I do not feel like I mastered any skills with this course. It was definitely not for beginners.",
    "Demonstrated what tools are available in the open source spatial data analysis realm, which is helpful for small or low-budget non-profit conservation organizations who have a data person on staff. Helpful for environmental managers who may need to communicate with or direct projects involving data analysis.",
    "This course expanded my spatial data analysis skills greatly and will be very helpful when analyzing future data for my research."
