   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength is the well structured course design. Students have a clear sense how far they are progressing down the teach plan, and how each individual parts are tied together. The professor should have identified a strong backing textbook for the class and led the students in relating the lectures to the textbook. Otherwise it is very hard to deal into the mathematical details while looking at the slides alone.",
    "Strengths- a lot of relevant and coming of age material. Weaknesses- less support with the coding features of the class which can be hard for non CS majors. A lot of our PSets required data cleaning in addition to statistical analysis and while I think that is a relevant skill, I would have appreciated a little more guidance or time devoted to that in class.",
    "Course topics are very relevant to econometric analysis used in academic literature to establish causality. The final third of the course focused on prediction using machine learning. Weekly section is vital to understanding course material and learning how to apply it. The course would be improved with an additional section or recitation (perhaps once every other week) covering R and Stata implementation.",
    "I liked that the course taught us to think critically about the various methods, and to really understand the assumptions underpinning them. I am more ambivalent about the machine learning part. It felt a bit rushed, and some parts (like neural networks) was touched on so superficially that they were not very useful. Perhaps neural networks could be cut next time. I also thought that the part about ethical research design was not very relevant. Also, the first 2-3 lectures covered material that I think most students already knew, so we could have learned more by skipping right to the econometric methods. Finally, I think there could be a little more of working with the math - not just being presented with the occasional proof but actually learning how to understand and work with them.",
    "This course was excellently organized and taught. My only complaint is that we could have received more guidance on the coding parts of problem sets.",
    "Lectures (and a good proportion of the reading) seemed to bear little resemblance to problem set or discussion section content. Much of the technical knowledge required to answer problem set questions required self study. Lectures should have prepared students better to tackle the problems they would later be asked.",
    "Good contents. It would be better to have more TAs and get quicker response to assignments.",
    "Strengths: good clear explanations of the philosophy and the intuition behind causality and prediction. Yusuke is a pretty clear lecturer too Weaknesses: sections would go off on tangents (which I mostly enjoyed) but they were sometimes extremely complex and had nothing to do with the source material"

    "This is a great introduction to the techniques used in economic research. After taking this class, I feel I can now understand academic papers.",
    "Take it if you have the same syllabus! Prof. Narita is new this year, currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cowles Foundation and starting as an Assistant Professor next year. He significantly revamped this course compared to previous iterations, de-emphasizing much of the statistics content and mathematical detail in favor of providing a unified view of causal inference and adding a significant component of machine learning and prediction. Towards this end, he made all-new slides (that look beautiful because they are in LaTex) and all-new problem sets, and eliminated the pesky project that everyone hated from Metrics I. These changes made for a compelling syllabus and very intellectually stimulating class. Every lecture has one or more applications in the form of papers in the literature, from which Yusuke extracts the relevant features in an easily digestible format in the slides. Problem sets are long but interesting, and then there is just a single midterm and final. This class gives you the econometric tools to tackle the empirical papers covered in any field course in the department or write a senior essay and introduces you to machine learning techniques like regularized regression, neural nets, random forest, etc. that make the world go round. The only major weakness of this course this semester was on the administrative and logistic side. Prof. Narita and Mohit, the TA, would routinely show up about five minutes late to lecture and section (and then spend five more setting up). This wasn't an issue of availability, as they were willing to stay later than the allotted time to answer questions and set up appointments, but it did artificially constrain lecture time and poorly respect the time of students who showed up on time to these class meetings. Prof. Narita was also making the slides, problem sets, and exams in real time during the semester, and this eventually caught up to him; the five problem sets originally planned shrunk to four, and the practice exams lacked answer keys. Problem sets were also not returned until weeks after they were due; as of this writing, part of problem set 3 has still not been returned to us. But I am sure these things will improve with time, if this course in this form gets offered again, so the takeaway is still that this semester's iteration has breathed new life into Metrics II, and the department should strongly consider keeping the new syllabus.",
    "This is an old econometrics course with a new professor. The teaching is engaging and the emphasis on application through coding is refreshing.",
    "Some useful stuff if you're Econ and trying to write a thesis. I took it with Professor Narita, who emphasized the machine learning aspects of the class more than previous instructors. This was cool but also made the course more challenging.",
    "Expect a major commitment to problem sets (approximately 4) and, more importantly, to teaching yourself the material and fully comprehending it. You will be asked to provide and understand a number of proofs, theories, and assumptions. The course uses key academic papers to develop students understanding of the economics field and how the literature advances concepts and techniques. This course is very challenging and requires a high degree of self-discipline and motivation.",
    "Take this course if you want to gain a deep insight into the challenges and joys of careful causal inference through looking at methods applied to the \"biggest hits\" of econometrics as well as machine learning.",
    "I loved this course, but I am not sure I would give a general recommendation. we had a great classroom community and we all pushed each other and worked together and were pushed by \/ and pushed back on our TA. I had a great time and learned a lot and felt that people were often excited by the material. That being said it was a lot of work, so if your class' dynamic is different it wouldn't be a great class.",
    "Yes if the student has strong background on statistics; no if the student is new to econometrics or statistics.",
    "Yeah definitely even if you're not an econ major. I didn't do 131 but if you know a little stats you'll be fine"
