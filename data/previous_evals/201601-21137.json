    "If you have any interest in understanding how political news gets made and\/or the basics of human social interaction, then take this course! I recommend it for all class levels. Professor Mahler is a delight and a great moderator. All comments that students make are valued, and he works very hard to get you to understand him and him to understand you. There are a couple weeks with long readings, but the longer ones are the easier and less-dense ones. If he keeps the readings like my semester, there are a lot of insightful readings about campaigns, in addition to the history of journalism, what the lives of journalists are like, and how humans behave in social interaction. It's all great. Some of the sociology is dense, but you appreciate it if you understand it. There is a lot of writing, but the Reading the News assignments are easy to do. Space them out! Mahler will tell you to do that and you will shrug it off like me, but if you shove them into the end of the semester, it will be very stressful. But to be honest, they are the easiest-graded assignments. Write 2-3 pages that analyzes an article that discusses some aspect of how news gets made in and through the relationships between journalists and political actors. If you ask for help, you'll quickly pick up an understanding of what kinds of articles work. I under-performed on the midterm, but I had a really busy week away from campus while writing it, so I'm sure you can do better than me. (I got a B.) The final paper was actually fun, maybe even the best 8-10 pages I have ever written. (I obviously don't know my grade yet, but I appreciated how much help I got from the professor.) Start working on the midterm and final papers right away! He doesn't introduce them that far in advance. I also like both because of how much he cares about your analysis over what you can cite. Breakdown: 10% participation (just don't go a class without talking; he is excited to call on you if you are speaking for the first time in a particular class); 25% Reading the News assignments (all combined); 30% midterm; 35% final paper",
    "This course was one of the best during my time at Yale. I loved the ways in which is mixed sociology and political science. I think more classes like this should be offered at Yale. It was especially relevant during this election cycle!",
    "This seminar is perfect for you if you're interested in looking at why the news the way it is, how crucial political news reporters are for the image of political actors, and how personal politics really are despite how professional they are portrayed as being. After this class, I have realized that journalists and politicians are actual people whose feelings towards each other play a large role in how the news is made. In addition, you learn about how \"the public\" as a concept is so crucial to news making.",
    "If you are engaged with this subject material, it is fascinating and very applicable to every day life. The actual class experience definitely depends on who your classmates are, as with any seminar, but the material is worthwhile for sure.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's interesting material that gives you a unique perspective on the production of news and its importance in our democracy. This class is good for those interested in journalism and its relationship with the people and political actors.",
    "This class gives you the chance to learn more about how news is made and how political actors influences news. It also adds in communicative sociology to show how this relationship is complicated."
