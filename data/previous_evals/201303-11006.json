    "Medical Impact is an awesome class for MB&B majors! Mondays are lectures about a certain biochemical pathway and an associated disease, and on Wednesdays you work in groups of 3-4 to answer a few questions about research papers from the medical literature that are relevant to that Monday's pathway. It's a great way to learn about some new pathways, and more importantly how to read papers! You really get a good sense of how to read a scientific paper critically, which is no easy feat.",
    "Take it if you're willing to spend some time each week reading papers. You probably get more out of the class if you spend more time reading the papers, but it's a good class in any case. You really get to know the people in the class through groupwork, which is something you don't often get in MB&B.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is not too much work, you just need to read a couple papers every week. Most of the graded assignments are group work so it's not too much pressure and you can focus on absorbing the material that you are interested in.",
    "Take it. Best MB&B class I have ever taken. Now I can read scientific papers with clarity and ease.",
    "VERY good course. Take it. It's really laid back compared to a lot of MB&B courses. It's also a good follow up to 301. Joan is amazing in general and it's a lot like real life if you plan to be a PI. You learn from seminar style lectures and papers sort of like a journal club. You answer the questions about the papers together in small groups on Wednesdays so you get to know your classmates really well and you actually get practice talking to other people about science and figuring things out together. It was definitely my favorite course that I took the semester I took it. Also the Wed class period is the section so the two times a week are the time that it meets. One criticism is that the final paper is worth a lot and it's very unrelated to the course material in terms of actual content or even what you're doing. They structure the deadlines for the abstract and the outline of it so it's good in that they won't let you shoot yourself in the foot with procrastination, but it's still very difficult to write and the class itself doesn't help much with the actual writing of the paper.",
    "You absolutely HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS. It was by far the best course I have taken at Yale. Finally an MBB class that isn't a lecture with disengaged professors. You get to hear about what professors are actually interested in and because they are interested, lectures are interesting. Plus, you only have lectures on mondays. On wednesdays, you work in groups of 3-4 people and answer questions. This part is really fun, its like doing homework but you get to do the homework in class time with your friends. So the workload is really really light. Just carefully read ~3 papers\/week on Tuesday nights before class on Wednesdays. But seriously take the #1 science class at yale you won't regret it. A chance to learn about cool science stuff from cool professors, read really interesting papers, hang out with (and make) MBB friends, all in a fun low-stress environment. if you can't tell, i can't rave enough about this class.",
    "It seems intimidating at first, but this course is taught and TA'd in a way that is relaxing and conducive to learning rather than stressing. A great course for any MB&B major, pre-med or otherwise.",
    "I really loved this class. It felt like I was finally taking the training wheels off after 3 years of basic science lectures. The guest speakers are able to talk about their work to an audience that understands it, and it's cool to be a part of that. The discussions are what grading is based off of, and they require critical thinking in a rewarding way. I'm no straight A student in the sciences but I still found it very rewarding and do-able, and it renewed my interest in the basic sciences. The final paper is something I actually enjoyed writing- you get to pick a disease and propose an experiment, and it is graded by leaders in the field, very cool. Take it if you have the chance!!"
