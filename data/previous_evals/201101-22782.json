    "Spring DS H&P is probably the weakest spring course, but is still an excellent run-through of modern political theory. The works are vibrant and reading them in close succession allows for a real understanding of the responsiveness of the ideas. McCarty is a fine section leader, especially if you like a \"close analysis\" style, but did fail to really bring out the weight and consequence of some of the works. A good course, if more \"high school style\" than other Yale\/DS sections.",
    "The second semester of DS History and Politics is a great continuation of first semester. From Machiavelli to Arendt, all of the authors are equally thought-provoking and interesting. Professor McCarty is a great professor who makes sure that everyone participates in class. He made sure that the material was accessible and worth our time, and he even took our section to the Beinecke to see first printings of some of the books we read. Thissection is definitely one to look forward to.",
    "Professor McCarty is one of the most zealous teachers in the Directed Studies stable. His approach is very focused on understanding the text itself--bringing out the major points of each argument, and catching the nuanced meaning of each term as the author uses it. This is very useful, but also very challenging. One might also feel that his section doesn't leave enough room for independent discussion. Nonetheless, I thought his section was totally worthwhile and left me with a much deeper understanding of each writer than if I had read them independently.Like many post-docs, Professor McCarty has bizarre and entertaining mannerisms galore, which you can always focus on in mute fascination if you find your mind wandering (shame on you!) from the material.",
    "Yes H\/P is excellent in the spring and McCarty is a very helpful section leader.",
    "Matthew McCarty is a fantastic instructor, and more so, a fantastic section leader. He brings a vivacity to class that animates each student and makes them willing - or at least feel pressured - to participate. His approach to each book, however, could become a little formulaic. That is, he would always ask questions with one certain, right answer in mind. This is bad because it does not facilitate discussion or sincere intellectual engagement with the text, but at the same time, I felt as if I knew the main points of each work in the end, partly because of McCarty's info-bite approach to class. He is kind, entertaining, and highly focused. Sometimes class felt too much like Jeapordy, but overall, I recommend McCarty as an instructor.",
    "As someone who at times found the works of first semester HP a bit dry, I would say that second semester HP is much more engaging, as the modern works get into a lot of questions relevant to the modern era of politics \u0096 the origins of the state and legitimacy, the challenges of democracy, etc. Dr. McCarty was excellent \u0096 he runs section very efficiently and emphasizes the connections between works effectively. He does have a habit of cold calling on students if they\u0092re being especially quiet during section, but only really during rare gaps in the discussion. He also provides a lot of specific and helpful feedback on papers, including fairly lengthy written responses attached to each one."
