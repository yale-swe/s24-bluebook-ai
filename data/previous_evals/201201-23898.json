   "comments": [
    "I expected the studio would be an environment were exploration and personal student growth were encouraged. Unfortunately, I did not find it to be this way.",
    "I had high expectations for this course. Not only was it the final semester of three years at Yale, but Scolari has taught this course several times, he should know how to talk to students, what to expect from them, what their limitations are, what they excel in, how long it takes to make a chair, how to encourage them, how to discuss his opinion\/criticism in a useful way; however, this was not the case. Scolari singled out one or two students of whom he approved and then did not participate with the rest. Muttered comments or lack of interest were frequent in reviews and a general look of dissatisfaction or disgust was often seen. We are students at Yale; we know how to take criticism and even desire it so that we might push our projects further. However, this semester was not even close to constructive criticism. It was not only insulting, but harmful since this is the last memory of a Yale studio we will have. I have been impressed with all of my critics here\u0097some I count as the best educators I have ever had. Scolari was not only the worst professor I have ever had, but it makes me furious that I paid a large amount of tuition to take his studio. His demeanor and treatment of students is often excused by the fact that he is \u0093old school\u0094 or by translation errors, but that does little to help when you have to deal with such an attitude all semester.Scolari is a talented artist and I do believe he has great architectural intuition; however, he is not an educator. He does not take an interest in his students and he is not invested in their projects in the way that other professors have been. Those professors\u0097the ones that think about a project even as they drive home\u0097are the kind that I would expect at Yale, not one like what we experienced.This course needs to figure out what the chair is. Is it a 2-week project and then dropped? Or is it something that is worked on all semester and is an important portion of the project? Right now it is neither. It is expected to take all semester to design and make, it takes a lot of unreimbursed money and then is absolutely ignored in the review. The chair either should be dropped completely or have its own review and get the acknowledgement that such an undertaking deserves.I am extremely disappointed with this studio.I would not recommend it to any upcoming students, in fact, I would probably dissuade them from listing it on their lottery sheet.",
    "I cannot begin to describe how disappointed I was by this studio. I had hoped to investigate materiality and structure both through the chair and the challenge of working with a historically preserved site. As mentioned, Massimo was not very interested in the chairs. Although there were restrictions on what we were allowed to do on the site (which changed continually over the course of semester), we spoke very little about materiality, preservation techniques, meaning of the site, how to creatively solve the problem of intervening there. The focus of the studio turned out to be the gateway to the site. Massimo continually drew the same symmetrical portal idea, and in the end, everyone's scheme was some variation of the diagram he insisted upon. The challenge of boundary was never thoroughly discussed, however- we did not look at precedents or discuss alternative ways of answering the question of entry and boundary. The expectations of the studio were always changing and never clear.Again, I do not understand how the school considers this studio as a valuable learning experience.",
    "I expected this studio to encourage the exploration of ideas and was most disappointed in the lack of communication and feeling of open dialogue. (see above)",
    "My expectation for the studio was to end up with an actual architectural project that was my design and not the product of a professor\u0092s overpowering aesthetic or direction. I came back to school to go through the design process again with some actual professional work experience in hopes of sharpening my own skills and clarifying my process. This studio was perfect for this. As I mentioned before, Massimo wasn\u0092t an overpowering professor in terms of injecting his own aesthetic into your project. He worked with you and your ideas and helped to clarify them instead of pushing his own. The studio allowed me the freedom to explore what I wanted and end up with a project that was reflective of me as a designer.",
    "Massimo supported and was receptive to the student's exploration on the meaning of form. This studio has been one of the few occasions where such issue was given due attention.In contrast to, or perhaps as a consequence of the studio's pedagogical approach, some students felt they were not being \"properly guided\" through their project. This type of passive attitude towards one's own project seems to have contributed to the mediocre quality of work produced over the semester."
