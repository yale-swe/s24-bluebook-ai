    "Eh. If you're a physics major, I would not recommend this class. The useful things I learned include basic theory of Fourier analysis, Legendre polynomials + spherical harmonics, and the theory behind the separation of variables method of solving PDEs (slightly different than in ODEs). Professor Frenkel is a nice dude, but his lectures are totally incomprehensible 80% of the time. Like, I literally had no idea what he was doing on the board and could just as well not have gone to class on more days than not. The majority of his lectures are dedicated to proving boring existence and uniqueness theorems, which you might understand if you're a math major but which will annoy you immensely if you're not into that kind of thing. The three midterms are laughable easy. There are 5 problems of which you can choose 4, but 3 are problems that are taken directly from previous homework sets. I learned the material for each test by studying for a few hours the day before, while having had no idea at all what was going on in the several weeks leading up to each test. I guess if you must take this class, you can be reasonably sure you'll get a good grade if you're not totally incompetent. But given that I feel like I've learned almost nothing, you better have a pretty compelling reason to suffer through this twice a week if you're going to take it.",
    "You should take Math 247 (especially if you are a physics major) because it teaches a lot of important concepts. You will learn how to solve several PDEs, but more importantly, you'll get a feeling for how classes of PDEs behave, which is far more valuable. You'll also prove existence and uniqueness theorems for certain PDEs, which are nice additions to your problem-solving toolkit. With that being said, Math 247 isn't a lot of fun. The problem sets are fairly boring, and much of the material is somewhat mundane. It's a useful class, but don't expect it to be as enjoyable as your other math classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This class is fast moving, but for any STEM major, it provides a good foundation for alot of the equations you may see, especially in Physics. I really wish i had taken this class before I took the more advanced classes for my physics major. It would have made life alot easier. The material can be challenging, but Professor Frenkel's test are quite fair and doable if you keep up with the homework.",
    "Overall, the course was a bit below average for me. Professor Frenkel is always super nice and will always try to help, but I found it hard to follow his explanations, probably because his level of mathematical knowledge is way above the level of this course. You will need to work with at least one of the other 10 to 15 people in the class on the PSETs. I would recommend this class if you have a very firm background in multivariable calculus because this class draws a lot from that. It's good to know how all these systems in the world can be modeled in concise equations, but if you want to learn about them more concretely, take a physics class.",
    "I don't really know how to describe PDEs. It was in some ways exceptionally enjoyable and in some ways had me banging my head against a wall. I think it's a very different approach than the ENAS version. You'll spend most of your time memorizing proofs if you're like me and very little time applying the mathematics to anything real world. That being said, you'll leave with an exceptionally good knowledge of PDEs and you'll look back fondly on it. The exams are pretty easy too, which is nice because they could easily have been made impossible.",
    "I would recommend it! It can be pretty stressful trying to stay on top of the material. A lot gets covered, and I did not always find Prof. Frenkel's notes very helpful. But he's very funny and understanding. Go to office hours! I only went to one review session the whole semester but it was great.",
    "This is a pretty difficult class, but don't be intimidated if you feel like you have no idea what is going on the first few lectures. Prof. Frenkel really wants you to succeed, and is very nice and a great guy. If you are coming out of ODEs, this is a very different class - it is a 'real' math class. It is proof-based and does not focus on just solving the equations, but understanding how to use them and why the solutions are correct.",
    "This is a very useful and interesting course for Physics and possibly Math majors. Professor Frenkel allows you to make the course into what you want it to be, depending on your level of math interest."
