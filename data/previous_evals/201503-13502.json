   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This was easily one of my favorite physics courses at Yale, mainly because the material was so cool. I especially liked how we covered not just the physics fundamentals, but also some applications such as transistors, diodes, etc. It was in general a very good course, so if you are looking for a physics elective I would certainly take it.",
    "This was a pretty solid class (ayyyy). The homework is helpful toward understanding the material and not all that challenging. The exams were very big picture and general knowledge and plotting things and basically no calculation, so as long as you have the right expectation, it shouldn't be a difficult course. Material is interesting and not stressful the way some of the earlier physics courses are. Definitely would recommend.",
    "This is probably the least quantitative physics class I've taken at Yale, although not necessarily the easiest. Most of the lectures were about building physical intuition around a few given formulas and comparing different models of solids, and we did very few mathy derivations. The problem sets were not too challenging, and probably take 5-7 hours most weeks if you take advantage of office hours and work in groups. The midterm and final were also not hard, although most of us struggled on the midterm because we were not expecting to have to have to know so many numbers (typical length scales, energy, time, etc., to the order of magnitude). Professor Henrich is a reasonably clear lecturer, if not the most inspiring. Overall, I would recommend 448 as a high-level introduction to the material, in preparation for more rigorous study later on. Students with prior exposure will probably find it hand-wavey and unenlightening, but I certainly learned a lot of new physics.",
    "I thought this class was a very solid introduction to solid-state physics. I really enjoyed it and learned a great deal about material including crystal structure, lattice vibrations (the classical and quantum theory of phonons), metals (again both classical and quantum), band theory, semiconductors, and the electrical properties of solids. I found Professor Henrich to be a very clear and organized lecturer, and I appreciated his organized written notes on the board and his emphasis of the important conceptual material (which in other classes is often more likely to get lost in the math). I also found him to be very approachable and happy to answer questions. (As a side-note, I took this class concurrently with statistical mechanics, which is technically a pre-requisite, and I was able to follow the material with some additional attention to a few topics, but you should expect the course to take knowledge of statistical mechanics for granted and plan accordingly.) I would definitely recommend the class to anyone looking for a good introduction to solid-state physics.",
    "The class was a bit disappointing. I was hoping for something more detailed and rigorous than what this course ended up being. The materials science class in the mech. engineering department ended up being more mathematical than this class. It was never entirely clear what material was important, what wasn't, and what we were responsible to know about for the exams. Henrich writes very little on the board with minimal explanation and commentary. The key concepts and points he does make will often be glossed over in his soft, mumbling voice. Only near the end of the class did the material get interesting (semiconductors, devices and material applications), but again we didn't discuss them in as much depth as I expected."
