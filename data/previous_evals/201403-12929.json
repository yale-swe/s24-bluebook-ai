   "comments": [
    "Take the class. It starts pretty easy but gets harder about halfway through the class. That being said, you'll learn a lot and it is a fun and engaging class most of the time.",
    "This class has a very consistent workload and is relatively easy to keep up with so long as you don't fall behind. There is homework most nights, but it is extremely manageable and helps with the coursework and tests. Overall, it is a good course to build on what you know if you hope to move on to L4 and L5, although many of the students stop German after this semester.",
    "It's a language course. The emphasis is almost entirely on grammar and syntax structure, which is nice since it felt breezed over in L2. Vocabulary is something you'll have to learn on your own. There is significant online work which you will not be reminded of and which is due almost daily (including after exams).",
    "I would recommend taking it with another instructor; this class was too disorganized and poorly taught. I ended up having to look up most things by myself, since so little was covered in class."
