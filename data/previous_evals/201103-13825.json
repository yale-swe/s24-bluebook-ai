   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course (especially with Professor Kinder) to another student. The workload is manageable, the grading is fair, and the class is engaging. I learned a lot and enjoyed each session.",
    "Don't come in expecting an A. You're going to learn a lot, it's going to worth it if you seriously want to become a better writer, it's a lot of fun, and you get to know your classmates pretty well through their writing. I thought it was a really rewarding class.",
    "You will write five essays in the term. You will submit a draft and the next week submit your final work. Your drafts need to be fully developed. Each week there will readings of essays. On week's when final essays are due, three students will be work shopped and the class will help critique their essays.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to any student, especially to you freshmen out there -- there is no better way to kick-start your writing skills. The readings were fascinating, thought-provoking, and at times, hilarious, and class discussions were always engaging. You write a draft or turn in a paper each week, and get the chance to workshop your peers and be workshopped -- a truly valuable experience that taught me a lot about the mechanics of effective writing and revising. In short, if you take this course, you can't help but become a more effective writer. TAKE THIS CLASS! And take it with Professor Kinder if you can. You won't regret it.",
    "recommended - my writing improved dramatically with this class. Professor Kinder is a great teacher, and provides insightful comments",
    "English 120 is a great course for both English majors and non-English majors. A draft is due the first week, your professor gives you feedback, and then the polished is due the following week. There are about six essays in total. This class greatly improved my writing skills. I encourage others to take it.",
    "English 120 is great if you have a good professor. Surely recommended -- things you write about are super interesting.",
    "You're going to hear that this is one of those classes you need to take before graduating, and it totally is. I know Professor Kinder doesn't have as many evaluations as some of the other professors, but I had a GREAT experience in her class, and would highly recommend her section. She's very open to meeting about papers, and her comments will really help your writing improve. The class was fun but rigorous, and definitely one of my favorite Yale experiences so far.",
    "You are truly treated as a writer in this class, and though the readings are copious, you will definitely improve your writing skills if you work hard in this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 03 to another student. Professor Kinder was absolutely fantastic. I felt like the writing techniques that we covered went far beyond what I had been taught in previous English classes in high school, so as a first semester freshman this was a great way to improve my writing. The workload was manageable, and although the grading was difficult, it was not impossible to receive an \"A\" and the challenge motivated me. English 120 03 is not just for English majors--we had a great variety of interests in our class. A student who would like to improve his or her writing for any type of future classes or disciplines would benefit from the class.",
    "This class is an excellent introductory English course that teaches upper level writing. The readings and special speakers presented in class help to give great examples on how to write more attractive essays. The workshops and discussions also held further help to improve ones writing as one is able to get extensive feedback on ones' written work. I would recommend this class highly to anyone as it is a great way to get on the terms of writing for college.",
    "It was an amazing course! It is definitely worth taking. If you are interested in improving your writing skills this course is definitely for you!",
    "This is the first time Prof. Kinder (a writer herself) is teaching a class at Yale, and I found it quite refreshing to learn non-fiction writing from her. She is very attentive to what students say in her class, and is always willing to meet outside class to offer extra help and advice. Her suggestions are concrete and helpful on the paper, and she really tries to make us better writers.Since this was her first time teaching this course, the readings could have been a bit more relevant, but I\u0092m sure she will find more interesting ones next semester. Her grading is a bit harsh, but it\u0092s clearly because she wants us to be better.Overall, this class is quite good, and the professor nice enough. Take it!"
