    "Jose is great, but the readings are very dry causing class discussion to be the same.",
    "I definitely recommend the class for anyone who is looking for a manageable, less quanty econ senior seminar. Weekly class sessions involve discussion of 2-4 readings, with a few psets (that definitely require some math and group work) interspersed between.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for a low workload senior econ elective. The class can be a little slow at times, but I thought it was pretty fun by the end of the semester. The weekly reading and worksheets are not overly cumbersome and the problem sets are similar. There are only three of them and while they might take you a couple of hours to complete the night before, it's definitely not as strenuous as most other econ psets. Participation is not technically a part of your grade according to the syllabus, but if you do the readings its very easy to participate in class and that will definitely bump up your final grade.",
