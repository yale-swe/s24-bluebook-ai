   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about organometallic chemistry. The structuring of the course is pretty relaxed, with a problem set most weeks, two midterms, and a final (the lowest score in these exams is dropped). While Professor Crabtree is accomplished and seems to be a nice man, his lectures are pretty unorganized, hard to follow, and we had to spend time interpreting the slides when reviewing them outside of class. My TA, Kelly, helped with this and was important in building my understanding of the material. As for exams, it was difficult to know what to expect on them, but they turned out ok.",
    "Inorganic chemistry is for sure really interesting, and Crabtree is a really cool guy to take class from. However, the class is really disorganized, and you don't have much preparation\/expectation for tests at all, which can vary wildly in difficulty. Plus, the grading policy is pretty harsh (40% gets A or A-, halfway mark is B+\/B border) so you want to study up for the exams. Go to class because the powerpoints are not at all clear or helpful. Not a very stressful course though, especially in comparison to your other chem courses.",
    "If you're taking this class, you're either a chem major or a premed who needs another chem credit (although the latter is rare). If you're a premed, though, don't take it with orgo(at least 1st semester orgo)-it can be very overwhelming and also you use many of the concepts you learn in orgo in inorganic, although it's not a formal requisite. It wasn't my favorite class by any means, but maybe that's partly because I wasn't ready to take it.",
    "I would take this course if you have to as a requirement, though it is not the most exciting chemistry course in the department",
    "It is quite interesting if you're into chemistry in the first place. You learn the actual reasoning behind many general principles that you just have to thoughtlessly accept in gen chem. Don't be decieved. The class starts out as a seemingly easy review of the type of nuclear chemistry gone over in gen chem, but the class goes from zero to 60 in no time so be ready to adjust your study habits as needed",
    "A low workload chem class that is a good introduction to metal chemistry. The material can be a bit disorganized, so ask your TFs questions if you have any!",
    "This course is more work than it seems.",
    "An overview of inorgaanjc chemistry. Hard to predict what would be on the exam. Concepts not presented in clear fashion. Low amount of work",
    "It is a good class and you'll learn a lot, but you might find it hard to study for since the class is very disorganized.",
    "A rigorous overview of the various applications and methods of inorganic chemstry. Much different than general chemistry and organic chemistry, this class offers interesting alternatives to how molecules are viewed in a chemical setting.",
    "Crabtree is a brilliant person, but his lectures lack innovation. He lectures through muscle memory and his testing material does not match his teaching.",
    "A course that I would encourage students to take, but maybe not if you're interested in learning that much material. I liked the combination of history and science, which I think may be a unique experience because Crabtree was teaching the class. I was entertained by the lectures and my section was great, but there are many other Yale classes with more interesting material that I might consider before this one.",
    "The material gets exponentially harder. If you take the course, make sure you do really well on the midterms so you can drop the final.",
    "Take this if you have to. But expect to read his \"optional\" textbook if you want to actually do well in this class.",
    "This class is frustrating. It's not terribly interesting, and it's pretty poorly organized, but the material is pretty easy. That being said, the tests are so short that grading is a crapshoot, so don't expect to do well just because the material is easy and you studied a lot. Only take this if you need to.",
    "A great, great class that everyone should take! I was one of the few non-Chemistry majors in this class but I enjoyed it a lot. Crabtree is a wonderful lecturer and the class really focuses on understanding: there is almost no memorizing of mundane facts. Professor Crabtree is very good at explaining things in a new and interesting way so that you gain a new understanding of a topic, even of things that you have already learned. The problem sets\/tests are also very little work so you should definitely take this class.",
    "Not bad but tests are graded kind of strictly"
