    "I learned about the dire situation the world's environment and species are in. Especially, that humans are the main cause, but that we can also still save species and habitats by being more conscious and focusing on conservation efforts.",
    "basic understanding of conservation",
    "This was a really good class if you are at all interested in environmental science.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the currents concerns of the environment.",
    "This class gives a good understanding of what is happening on the earth right now, which is really important to know.",
    "I learned quite a bit in this class about the changing environment. The topics are fascinating and I left with a newfound awareness of the planet.",
    "I learned to be able to view conservation from a macro scale and think critically about issues that don't always affect my daily life.",
    "A deeper understanding of the ecosystem and how it effects society and humanity as a whole.",
    "I enjoyed how much I actually learned about Conservation Biology",
    "I learned how to critically analyze different problems and solutions facing the earth and all of its inhabitants.",
    "This course taught me how to think critically about human impacts on the environment and conservation efforts, which are both important to understand during the rising global warming. I also learned that there are many different facets of climate change and species extinction,including ocean acidification and habitat fragmentation. Overall, I gained knowledge that will be invaluable toward fighting climate change in the future.",
    "Knowledge of the current mass extinction we are experiencing, how to develop effective conservation plans, etc.",
    "Great intro course about conservation today... lots of info",
    "I developed a lot of knowledge of the complications behind developing conservation techniques when there are multiple interests involved-this class is very policy based but also incorporated the science behind climate change and conservation",
    "Learned a lot about some really inspiring animals in the world.",
    "it was fine",
    "I learned about conservation biology.",
    "How humans have impacted ecosystems, extinction, the planet overall",
    "I learned a considerable amount about the natural world and conservation biology from this course. I am a history major and have previously had limited exposure to conservation biology and conservation. It was interesting being exposed to this field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is strong because it teaches about an important, and yet understudied, subject. It is also good for non-science majors that need a science credit. The weakness is its workload in the sense that it is a lot of different things.",
    "easy to understand for non science people",
    "Great course!!! I loved learning new things about the environment and natural world, and really enjoyed having Professor Puth as a teacher. We took a couple of trips to the Peabody, which were amazing, and the topics chosen for lectures were really interesting. A weakness of the course was the lack of feedback - it's reading period now and I still haven't gotten any feedback on any of my written assignments or debate participation.",
    "Linda is a great instructor. There are 3 exams and 2 papers, which seems a lot but is manageable if you stay on top of your work.",
    "The material for this class is actually pretty interesting. I'm not big on science so I took this course to just get my credit out of the way but was pretty engaged the whole time. BUT I would honestly say the tests are super challenging despite the material being pretty simple. It's good that total the tests only make up 50% of the grade or else I wouldn't say this class was amazing.",
    "The tests really need to be improved. The questions were really poorly worded so even if you knew the material it wasn't clear how to answer the question. Also they were time test -- if you are a fast test taker you do well, if you're a bit slower you'll do poorly. Prof. Puth claims that she doesn't want students to \"memorize\" but wants us to apply our knowledge. But that is totally inconsistent with a time test where she wants us to jot down concepts rather than explaining our thinking. She needs to pick one or the other -- either have a memorization time test, or a test where we apply our knowledge thoughtfully and have enough time to do so.",
    "The exams for this class were a weakness. The exams were way too long, and it didn't seem like Dr. Puth really thought about how long to make the exam to fit into 50 minute class periods. The exam should not be accompanied with the hope that the next class in the room will stay out as long as possible to let us get through the exams, but that was the case here. It was very frustrating because people who studied a lot could very easily not do well, and people who just guessed could do well. There was no time to check over the work at all, which I think favors people who are good at test taking rather than people who understand the material. But this isn't a class about test taking, so the exams could have just focused on the material. Plus, going through quickly and having no time to check over work doesn't even seem like a very good way to let the students show what they know and think about what they have learned because there is no time. Luckily, there were papers to write, which seemed a much better way to think about the material. Also, the lectures were very clear and organized, and the variety of assignments was good.",
    "There were some very interesting outside lectures, as well as field trips to the peabody which helped keep the class exciting. Linda Puth is a wonderful professor, I really enjoyed her lectures.",
    "Strengths - Topics are interesting, especially case studies. TAs did a good job making time for students. Weaknesses - Exams were difficult. Lectures were often boring.",
    "A strength is that the course moves at a good pace and each unit is related to the previous one. A weakness may be that the format of the exams changed with every coming midterm.",
    "A strength would be its accessibility. You do not need to know anything about Biology to benefit from and do well in this course.",
    "Strengths: An effective combination of STEM and humanities; the assignments are unique Weaknesses: Tests are formatted differently from what is usually expected",
    "The exams are the greatest weakness. They are designed in such a way that you can study extremely hard and do poorly, and not study at all and do well. They are also way too long and give fast test takers an advantage.",
    "This course teaches you to think critically about human impact on the environment through different methods, including examining case studies, reading scientific papers, creating your own examples of species extinction, active conversations and debates during discussion section, policy papers that make you engage with the material, and exams. The exams are perhaps the only weakness of this course in that the structure of each test varies, but if you do the reading, go to discussion sections, and study then youll be fine!",
    "Overall great course",
    "The lectures are pretty engaging in the course and you do some interesting activities in section-the exam questions tend to be confusing because they are built off of concepts in the class and require a lot of interpretation on your part",
    "Should bring in live animals in future years.",
    "thank o hard for what it's supposed to be",
    "I think it could have more field trips. Those were fu n.",
    "A lot more work than I expected. Too many assignments and exams. The expectations for each exam varied and were not clearly explained.",
    "The main strength of the course was its content. Conservation biology is an interesting and important field. Besides that the other main strength of the course I think was the debate we held towards the end of the semester. Literally everyone involved got incredibly excited and invested in the debate, which was great to see. I would say the main weakness of the course was the amount of assignments - three exams, two essays, and a debate. I think the debate should be kept, as should the position piece, but I think the outside lecture at least is unnecessary."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, It teaches about an important topic, and it is not very difficult.",
    "recommend if you want a fairly low workload science credit",
    "Take this course if you're interested in the environment\/outdoors\/animals! It will totally change the way you think about the natural world. Great class!!",
    "No--there are better Sc credits. I was personally interested in the material covered, learned a lot, Stephen\/his discussion section was wonderful, but there was a wide consensus that the exams were unnecessarily difficult. The way they were graded and structured prized test-taking skills over engagement with the material (reminded me of high school).",
    "Highly recommend for a SC credit. Engaging, interesting, not difficult, and very obvious what was necessary to obtain a high grade.",
    "Take this class if you just want to get your science credit out of the way. Big caution though: the tests are not a walk in the park. You get lucky though because you have a lot of opportunity to do well in other areas. I thought I'd be walking out of the class with an A range grade when I looked at the material but I honestly doubt I will now because I don't think there is a curve. That being said, the TAs and Prof Puth realized that the tests were different and weighted them differently (said the best 2 out of 3 would be weighted 20% of the grade, other one would be 10% I think).",
    "If you're looking for an easy science credit don't take this class. Even if you go to every class and study for the exams, you aren't guaranteed an A because the tests are too long for the allotted time and the questions are poorly worded so even if you know the material it can be hard to answer the questions correctly. Plus there's a ton of work -- three tests, an outside lecture report, a paper, and a debate. I much preferred Issues Approach as an easy science credit, mostly because the tests were very fair and you were rewarded for doing the work.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "I would not recommend this course because it really frustrated me. I thought I could improve because I thought the material was interesting and tried to figure out how to take the exams, but the exams felt very arbitrary and too long and specific, so I didn't feel like improving on how to take the exams was possible.",
    "Yeah! Would recommend especially if you are a non-science major looking for an interesting and applicable science credit.",
    "Yes, If you're interested in the changing environment, I would definitely recommend this course. It is a lot of work, and the exams are challenging, but I learned a lot from it. It's a good science credit but I wouldn't say it's a gut.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because the teaching by Professor Puth and the TF's was great. Their commitment to always answer questions and hold review sessions was very helpful.",
    "Absolutely, if you need a science credit and want to take a class that will give you different perspectives to carry over into your other areas of interest, you could do much worse than Conservation Biology.",
    "I would; it's an interesting and important subject, and not too difficult of a science credit",
    "Yes, especially someone who is not a science major, because it serves as the bridge between the humanities\/social sciences and STEM.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to everyone (both STEM and non-STEM majors) because the class teaches you to better understand the current state of our earth and the history as well as future consequences of climate change.",
    "Take it if you if you are interested in species\/conservation efforts, because you will absolutely learn a lot. It is not a gut! The tests are application based so even if you know the material it may be hard to score well on those. You should go to class, because the slides are mostly pictures and it is hard to understand material for tests if you skip. Discussion sections were fun though",
    "If you're looking for a science credit you might wanna look into it but there is a good amount of work... three tests 2 papers and a debate",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone looking to take an easier science credit that will still end up being engaging and with some great readings that especially apply to anyone social sciences.",
    "Yah take this class if you even remotely care about saving the bees",
    "not really",
    "I would if you need a science credit.",
    "Probably would not recommend this class. Too many assignments and too confusing exams. I don't feel like I learned much even with the amount of time I put into the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a non-STEM major looking for a science credit to fulfill their distribution requirement. The course is relatively straightforward, has a very reasonable amount of work, and is also rather interesting."
