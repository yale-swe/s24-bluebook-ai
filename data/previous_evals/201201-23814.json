   "comments": [
    "Good",
    "I find the seminars to be very interesting, and the pizza to be very tasty.",
    "The course provide a broad perspective on the different types of work being done mainly in research with speakers that will appeal to a subset of individuals. I wish there was a way to organize the talks so that there is a theme or general topic for a few lectures before moving onto a different topic. Although research is the focus, I also wish there was more application of public health and research into practice as to realize what kind of job opportunities are available for those not continuing on with further education.",
    "I really enjoyed the talks this semester. All in all I enjoyed the subjects more this semester than last semester but that might also be because my knowledge for infectious disease epidemiology has grown since first semester and therefore can be more engaged by the speakers.The speaker from Stanford was the best lecture of the year. I wish that lecture could have gone on for another two hours followed by a discussion at a local bar.",
    "Interesting and keeps students up to date on current research which is useful",
    "Borden your horizon in infectious disease control and development.",
    "Excellent speakers. I will continue to come to the seminar next year even though it is not required anymore.",
    "A great way to introduce students to various areas of research.Strengths: Glad that we are introduced to so many lecturers, concepts, etc. Like collaboration with CIRA. Really appreciate the generous lunch provided.Weaknesses: Material is often not catered to students. Lecturers covering advanced laboratory techniques may not be appropriate for students. Feels like these lectures are more geared toward faculty. Lectures some times run long. Perhaps we should schedule these lectures for 1 1\/4 hours? Also, my biggest suggestion is to show students more career options for when they graduate with their MPH in EMD. I feel that some other divisions are inherently easier for students to understand where they will take their careers after graduation, but some, like EMD, are not so easy. Some students know they will apply for PhD programs, or medical school, but I feel that others may not know what to do with their degree. Perhaps presentations by professionals that are not research based are appropriate, such as hospital ID specialists, immunologists, etc.",
    "The lectures were good this semester, they are typically diverse.",
    "The speakers this semester, especially the one who spoke on network epidemiology and the one who spoke on the history of cholera, were excellent.",
    "I really enjoyed the different seminar presentations in general. There were a few that did not seem to be targeted to specialists.",
    "I think it is great."

    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0He was very good about opening the floor to students and encouraging students to ask questions.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Albert Ko made sure that the MPH students had a chance to ask their questions to the speakers before the PhD, post-docs, faculty and staff asked questions.The addition of salad to the seminar was also much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0He did a good job facilitating. I commend him this semester because he would always set a little time aside at the end of lecture for MPH students to ask questions.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0He is listed as the instructor but does not really play an instructor role in seminar",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Responsible asscessible , kind to students and thoughtful.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Funny. I wish I can fall asleep during seminars and still ask some profound questions in the end.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0All the instructors provided decent introductions.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Because of the nature of the seminar, there was not much teaching that Dr. Ko did. He was an adequate host.",

    "The seminar was good and had no work outside of the hour. There was always and interesting topic and lunch. I think there would be opportunities to meet the speakers on occasion. This could be really good to make connections in areas that interest you.",
    "I very much enjoyed EMD Seminar. I think the seminars were very applicable to current research and merged nicely with subjects under study in the classroom."
