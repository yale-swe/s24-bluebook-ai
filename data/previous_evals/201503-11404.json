   "comments": [
    "A great course (it's probably required for you). Even though it is generally required, I would 100% recommend it. The Italian department here has it's sh*t together and is a wonderful group of people to deal with. They take your learning seriously, but not in a miserable mean way. If you even mildly apply yourself, this course will help you reach actual conversational proficiency. It's a great course that's less intense than L1 and L2 but just as learning-filled.",
    "I would definitely recommend ITAL 130 with Prof. Iacovella. If you need a language credit, this is certainly the way to get it.",
    "I already have recommended taking Italian so I thought very highly of this class!",
    "I would say that it is a very interesting and rewarding language, however there is a decent amount of work so be prepared to do work almost daily. Overall I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Good class. Very low workload. 6 tests, weekly essays, and a final, but everything is really straight forward. You watch several Italian films which play a large role in the class. Overall a good course and a great way to help fill the language requirement.",
    "I would recommend ITAL 130 to another student because it strengthened my Italian to a considerable degree and provided an enjoyable classroom environment.",
    "ITAL130 was a very good course. I strongly believe that the professor makes all the difference and Anna Iacovella was fantastic! She is a native Italian, so you actually hear the accent and the overall learning experience is richer. Like ITAL120-ITAL130 you have a weekly Tema that's due on Monday and the final draft that's due on Friday. There are chapter tests every week-and-a-half (workbook chapters are due then too). The textbook for ITAL130 is better than ITAL110-ITAL120 because it presents the grammar all together and all the vocab in complete lists. ITAL130 feels like you're reviewing and solidifying the grammar you learned in ITAL110-ITAL120, so it's nothing really new. The only thing is that you're expected to be reviewing the material, old and new, every night for class the next day."
