   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you are genuinely interested in urban politics and are willing to put time into the reading. Professor Horan wants to see discussion and wants to know that you put time and energy into the course. This was probably my most time consuming class of the semester because I had to put in a lot of effort to do a good job.",
    "If you interested in the political science literature on cities and the different frameworks for thinking about cities, this is a very good class to take. Horan is really good. However, for someone who has more of a policy interest and isn't very interested in reading academic papers, this isn't a good course.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in Urban studies. At times it almost seems to be about political philosophy, if that is at all interesting. But it is a really interesting examination of the connection between specific cases (New Orleans, urban bureaucracies, and urban sprawl) and larger theories on the functioning of cities. The papers are incredibly difficult and pretty tedious, but there are only two and Professor Horan is helpful throughout the process.",
    "Yes, if you're really interested in urban policy and you're willing to put in a lot of work.",
    "Great class if you are interested in taking a more hard-line poli. sci. approach to urban studies, rather than the usual \"urban lifestyle\" or design approaches. You will learn an immense amount about \"political frameworks\" and the other ways in which policy is made in cities, and read the important literature on these subjects. But beware, this class is a lot of work. You have to do the reading very closely, and weekly reading responses are basically short essays.",
    "Spectacular seminar. If you are interested in urban studies, this will teach you how real academics think about municipal problems and solutions ranging from education to metropolitan planning. Also a great class for thinking about how government workers make sound policy, which is incredibly practical if you're planning on having any sort of policy-setting job ever in your future in either the public or private sector. Be prepared to really dig into the articles you read, though; you have to use your analytical skills to answer the paper questions. I could understand how people with only a passing interest in urban political economies might not be thrilled about doing all the challenging thinking required. But if you are interested in investigating how governments, citizens, corporations, and markets interact to govern at the municipal level, take it!",
    "Only if you are particularly interested in urban policy. Great course, but very tough if you have no background in the subject. Much of the reading is dense and jargon filled, but necessary for class. Horan is tough, but fair, and will push you as a student.",
    "Hard, but interesting.",
    "I deeply regret taking this course and do not recommend it for another student. It was a lot of work with little return.",
    "Professor Horan will definitely not let anything by her. You will NOT get away with just throwing together a paper the night before (and let me tell you, that usually works for me). This is a very difficult class in terms of grading, so beware! However, if you're prepared to do hard work and risk a lower grade, go for it. I learned an incredible amount in the class!",
    "This class is a solid, really thorough introduction to urban politics. A lot of students taking it will have urban policy backgrounds, but I did not and did not have trouble with the class at all. Prof. Horan is great, and easily-approachable. The first half of the semester is spent on theoretical models of urban politics, and the second half is spent on case studies (with student groups leading the discussions). There are weekly 1-2 page reading responses. These take more time to write than I anticipated, but it's not that difficult to figure out what she expects from them. There are two papers, but these are more like combined reading responses."
