    "My knowledge of german speech comprehension and writing abilities improved in this course.",
    "German reading, writing, culture, speaking.",
    "My writing improved, as well as my grammar.",
    "I gained better knowledge of German vocabulary, grammar, and culture.",
    "As this is a daily course, in general, we gained proficiency in speaking and listening comprehension in German. In addition, we learned new vocabulary for each test. We learned new verb tenses, such as Plusquamperfekt, Konjunktiv I, Konjunktiv II, and Passive, in addition to reviewing Perfekt and Imperfekt. Since each chapter was centered around a different German city, we learned about the German culture and history, as well.",
    "I improved my grammar, vocabulary, and confidence in German.",
    "I learned Level 3 German and about the German culture",
    "German speaking, listening and writing.",
    "I believe the telenovelas, video portions of tests, and conversations in class have improved my listening skills. I have also become more comfortable speaking spontaneously, without preparation beforehand. As each unit centers around a specific German state, I have gained more knowledge regarding German culture and every day life.",
    "I greatly improved my German speaking abilities through this course. I became much more comfortable both reading and speaking German."

   "comments": [
    "The course was taught extremely well. Its major strength was our teacher, Thorsten Wilhelm. He made himself available outside of class whenever a student needed help, and he presented the course's concepts in a very easy to comprehend manner. One of the courses weaknesses, I believed was its lack of rigorous vocabulary based learning. Often I found that I would try to learn the words required for each chapter in a short period of time before each test, and was able to use this method to do well on the tests. However, a lot of the vocabulary didn't stick with me for much longer after the tests. I think that having vocabulary quizzes or check-points throughout the two week between each test would help with longer term learning.",
    "Strengths are that instructors look for feedback from students and adjust the course as necessary for the students.",
    "Very engaging",
    "This course does a good job of covering a variety of topics succinctly and through a number of different projects within and outside of class. I only wish that during the weeks when we have tests that we would have gotten more of a chance to study for it outside of class rather than getting extra homework assignments during those weeks while having less to do outside of class on the weeks when we didn't have exams.",
    "This course does a very good job in improving students' comfort level in the language, through enhancing skills like listening comprehension, speaking, grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing. The class is interactive, with lots of work with partners\/small groups, which makes it easier to always make sure one is understanding the material correctly. The professor was always willing to meet, and gave very prompt and clear feedback on assignments.",
    "Strengths: -reviewing grammar from L1 & L2 and building off that knowledge -Thorsten truly cares about all of his students & will do anything he can to help them learn -the email exchange was very beneficial Weaknesses: -the ordering of the curriculum didn't always make sense -the final project isn't the best fit to showcase everything you know",
    "Well taught but quite a bit of work, make sure to plan accordingly.",
    "Strengths of this course include having the class speak entirely in German (gives us the opportunity to practice our vocabulary and grammar in a regular setting). I found the telenovelas and the efforts to improve listening comprehension beneficial as well. I believe it would be beneficial to provide more exercises when giving instruction on new grammar skills. When learning a new skills, we only practice with a few examples and students are sometimes left uncomfortable with the degree of their skill mastery; additional worksheets or exercises would help students better understand and retain these skills. Additional practice with reading comprehension would also be appreciated.",
    "I genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses of the course. Professor Wilhelm made an effort to always ask for feedback which I greatly appreciated. I felt that the course was well organized to facilitate student learning."

    "I would recommend this course. I felt that my german language skills improved greatly throughout the semester, and I also gained a much deeper insight into german culture and history as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their knowledge of German, especially those who have just taken L1 and L2.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course! Of course, if German is the language you have selected for the language credit requirement, this course is inevitable, but it is an excellent course that will improve your German capabilities by leaps and bounds.",
    "I would recommend taking Thorsten's section because he truly cares about his students and their progress.",
    "Yes. It is a great course and very fair.",
    "I believe this course provides good instruction into the German language and German culture. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. If you would like to learn German in a friendly, low-stress environment, this is the class for you."
