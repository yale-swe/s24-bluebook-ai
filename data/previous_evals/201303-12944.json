   "comments": [
    "Better for those with some previous knowledge for micro.",
    "No...I will only recommend this class if it is purely applied econ.",
    "The course teaches the basics of microeconomics, through a theoretical framework as well as practical cases.I personally would not recommend GLBL 801 but it is because I have very little interest for economics. If someone was trying to find an introductory course in economics, I would recommend it.",
    "The course is an effective reintroduction to underlying economic principles. For students who want to take more econ, it helps resharpen the tools. I would recommend it most for students who took an intro econ course in college, but perhaps have been away from the concepts for a few years.",
    "The course is mandatory for Global Affairs students. It is one of a number of microeconomics classes on offer at Yale and, regrettably, I am unaware of the comparative standards between the classes.",
    "GLBL801 provides an introduction to microeconomic concepts for aspiring policy practitioners without significant backgrounds in economics. It had a more \"applied\" focus that other similar courses, as evidenced by the use of business school-style cases used in the latter half of the semester.",
    "This is kind of a moot point, as 801 is a required course. However, I think I would give it a mixed review, as it proved to be at times very frustrating during the second half of the semester.",
    "This class was a micro introduction but very much focused on issues that would affect policy types. I wouldn't recommend this class to people that just want a basic micro econ class.",
    "I would recommend GA 801 to other students.I would summarize the course as a basic micro-economics course with an emphasis on applying the basic concepts of economics to a wide range of activities and current events. Very useful.",
    "I would recommend the course for beginner of Econ. As introduction, this was a good course.",
    "Interesting course, useful to strengthen your understanding of Microeconomics. However, the main problem remains with the instructor (M. Moore). The first half of the semester was very satisfying (with J. Levinsohn), but the second half was not.",
    "Good course. For those with no background or interest in economics, it seems like it moves at the appropriate pace. For students who have more of a background or interest but not enough to skip out of it, the pace was a little slow. On the one hand that's good because it leaves more time for courses with heavier workloads, but I wish the course had been a little more advanced."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Not much.",
    "very little.",
    "It mostly helped through the analysis of practical cases but otherwise, it did little for my discipline\/future profession (again, my interest is not in economics).",
    "Not really applicable. This course was good for building foundation around my area of interest\/specialty. No relation to any research I'm conducting.",
    "The course would have been better if it had been paired with a course on macroeconomics. The interaction of the two was and remains an area of interest of mine and I could not help but feel that I was hearing only one side of the story. A partial answer would be to take an additional course in macroeconomics, but it seems that many Global Affairs students want a greater understanding of macroeconomics, perhaps leading to the necessity of including a macroeconomic course in the mandatory requirements.",
    "The course provided a foundation upon which I plan to build with further economic coursework in the course of the M.A. program.",
    "This course definitely expanded my knowledge of micro and introduced a few very important concepts that are critical for understanding for a Global Affairs professional. The course appeared more technical than I would expect it to be, but not overly technical, obviously. Overall, it is a great foundational course for Jackson Students.",
    "This course certainly provided much needed economics background and review. Depending upon the precise dissertation topic, this course may actually be critical.",
    "This course reminded me of the basinal knowledge of Econ.",
    "Useful to approach the business field, and SOM courses like Comparative strategy.",
    "The course was very helpful in deepening my interest in economics as a discipline and confirmed my desire to pursue a lot of economics coursework at Jackson."
