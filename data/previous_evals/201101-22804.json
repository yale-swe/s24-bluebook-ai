    "I loved the flexibility in the course, especially that we could do the final paper and presentation on virtually anything. It was at once broad and specific, and you could choose what to apply what you learned to. That was another reason that I really enjoyed it.Also, Professor Brown is very nice and always willing to help, through meeting in or outside of class, if you don't understand a concept or need direction for your paper.",
    "Very good class. 3 tests and a final paper which offers you a lot of freedom.",
    "This is kind of like Brain and Thought. If you haven't taken that, though, a good course on how sensory\/motor systems work and the ways that the nervous system guides behavior. Recommended if you haven't studied this before.",
    "Not really. It's kind of boring."
