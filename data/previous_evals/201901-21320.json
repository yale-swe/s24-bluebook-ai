   "comments": [
    "This course taught me how to be a more confident performer, how to prepare a performance, how to write about musical theater, and how to make strong choices that emerge from character and circumstance. It also taught me valuable practical skills necessary to navigate the professional world (auditions, dance calls, music rehearsals, etc).",
    "I refined all of the skills that are most important for musical theatre performance, including my musicality, acting\/song interpretation, discipline, knowledge of musical theatre history\/the canon, my critical discernment for others' artistry, and my self-awareness regarding my own strengths\/weaknesses and selecting material for myself that reflects how I want to present as a performer.",
    "Highly interactive workshop on performance skills. Zeroed in on weaknesses as a performer and worked actively to address them.",
    "I learned how to successfully audition for a musical, how to find my strengths in the industry, and how to prep a song and tell a story.",
    "A greater vocabulary for describing musical theater technique and a book of audition materials.",
    "I gained a real insight on myself as a performer and as a person from this course. I became more present and more specific with my intentions when acting. Also by taking the course, I learned a lot about how to approach pieces -- where to begin and how to end. Audition specific skills like how to carry yourself in a room, sheet music, headshots, etc. I also learned a lot about various directors, choreographers, theatre makers, etc. whether through readings or anecdotes in class.",
    "I learned about audition techniques, how to identify and work on internal, external, and technical type. I learned how to identify my flaws as a performer and how to work on improving those aspects. I learned from industry professionals about choreography, auditioning, and vocal technique."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure of the class is extremely conducive to growth and improvement. Being able to perform in front of your classmates and receive feedback, as well as watch your classmates perform and provide them with feedback allows you to see how other people think and approach musical theater and learn from them.",
    "I really liked how structured the assignments were, because they often pushed me to select a piece to work on that pushed me out of my comfort zoneI ended up learning the most from the assignments that I felt the most challenged by\/afraid for, i.e. the choreography selection. Annette's teaching is the main strength of the course, but I also really liked the guests she brought in and the workshop discussion style because they allowed for us to receive a wider array of opinions on our performances. I would like if the readings and the writing assignments could relate\/apply more to the work that we actually do in the class.",
    "No weaknesses. Well-rounded, highly effective.",
    "I found feedback to be very concrete and straightforward, which was really appreciated and helpful.",
    "Strengths: rigorous and disciplined approach to performing, Annette is a genius, workload is manageable, performing in class is scary but cathartic, access to industry professionals who give us honest and constructive feedback. Weaknesses: class is long, readings are interesting but never talked about in class."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you are serious about musical theater and intend to pursue it beyond Yale, taking this class is a must. You get the theoretical and practical background necessary to grow and learn as a performer and student of musical theater.",
    "I definitely would if they are a musical theatre performer or a singer who is looking to develop as a \"smart actor.\"",
    "I'd recommend the course to any music theater performers looking to hone their skills. This is the most pre-professional space you'll find as an undergrad.",
    "You will learn so many skills, both professional and artistic, that will serve you when you begin to try to break into the industry. Annette is phenomenal and caring person. She will push you and tell you exactly what you need to hear.",
    "Yesits very useful, but you need to put actual work in in order to get anything out of the time.",
    "If you are serious about performing, you should definitely take it. You learn so much about yourself as a performer and the self-awareness you gain is extremely valuable.",
    "Yes!!! Annette is a genius and youre never going to find a better theater educator who also has years of practical experience. Youll grow as a performer so much.",
    "Yeah! Anyone who wants to do musical theater (in any capacity) should try to take this class. The class forces you to grow as an artist in a very exciting way."
