    "This class is primarily discussion based, with weekly viewing responses and a final essay on a director. I would definitely recommend this class to any AfAm studies majors, and film studies majors with an interest in race depiction in film, because this class is definitely an intriguing one.",
    "This class was great. It's a nice change of pace from book a week readings or problem sets. It introduced me to a lot of ideas about film and was a nice ease into the film studies major. It still focused on a lot of social\/psychological impacts of black film so we weren't just talking about the films in the strict framework of film the way one might in other film studies classes. This made it easier for me and alot of the other non majors to be engaged in the films and the class.",
    "A lot of films, with some reading\/reading responses. Not too bad for a class that meets only once a week. Take it if you can make yourself stick to the task of watching 1-2 films every week. Having readings on top of some of the longer film screenings can get a little time consuming, but try not to stress out too much.",
    "I would recommend it, just be prepared to spend a lot of time watching 2-3 films each week."
