    "I would absolutely recommend it! A lot of reading but it's all interesting and the papers aren't bad at all. I don't know if this course will be offered next year because Professor Engelstein (who was wonderful) is leaving, but this was a great class.",
    "Two 5 page papers and a final 10 page paper. Not too much written work considering the amount of pages we had to read throughout the semester. Great class, highly recommended.",
    "would only recommend if the student has a strong background in 20th century european history to begin with. reading primary sources should supplement an existing knowledge of the history. if you dont know the historical context, you wont really learn too much.",
    "Read the memoirs on your own, don't take the class for the discussions, which often devolve into students expressing how they feel about each memoir. Definitely too little political, cultural, or intellectual history was ever discussed.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Amazing class!",
    "Amazing class. I don't think it will be as good without Professor Engelstein but the readings and the discussions are worth it.",
    "Professor Engelstein is simply brilliant. amazing class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Memoirs of 20th-Century Europe to students who are interested in grappling with rich primary sources. This is one of the most unique courses in Yale's History department in that its focus is on primary sources rather than secondary source analysis. The course also explores the history of Europe during the 20th century through the lens of individuals experiences and voices. Unfortunately, Professor Engelstein is retiring this year and will no longer be teaching the course at Yale. I encourage Yale's History department to find another professor who can teach the same or similar course."
