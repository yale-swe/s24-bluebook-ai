    "Better techniques and experience in drawing.",
    "I learned about proportion, shading techniques, and drawing moving objects.",
    "I had already taken art classes in high school, so a lot of the techniques were really familiar to me already. However, professor Gibson really forced the close to think and look at the art differently. He might make an offhand suggestion to try something in a different way, and you should really try to do that because often it helps.",
    "This course gave me new ideas on how to look at objects\/people\/the world - e.g. shadows, size, etc. - in order to put them onto paper. Just the process of sitting down and drawing every week made me improve.",
    "I learned what I most need to improve on in my drawing. I became much more self aware and have grown significantly. I have a better understanding of perspective, contour lines, composition, and much more. And I have learned to experiment with shading, hatching, and different mediums as well.",
    "I learned a more formal approach to drawing, and to be a little looser in my drawing styles.",
    "This course teaches basic drawing skills (contour line, perspective, hatching) in a variety of media including pencil, charcoal, and ink."

   "comments": [
    "It was a very good course in learning to draw. I gained much experience. There the only suggestion would be more individual technical help.",
    "It was a well-organized class. One weakness was that we spent a lot of time sketching and didn't produce many highly developed works.",
    "The only problem I had with the class is that there was no homework schedule, so I had no idea when to expect them. The pro to that was that Professor Gibson could really cater the assignments to what we needed. Another problem was that all announcements were verbal. So if you weren't listening correctly you would miss the assignment, or the location for the next class if we were going to the galleries. He never came out and told you that your art sucked. Just you are having a bad day. That is nice because it is an intro class and not everyone in it is taking it seriously as an art major or has the skill that others do.",
    "Very little information was given about the course up front (materials, schedule of assignments, etc.), but it felt like there was a good variety of topics and assignments.",
    "At times the course feels like too much work but at other times we have none, so perhaps making more frequent smaller assignments could be improved.i really enjoyed the class though.",
    "The class was had interesting prompts and assignments, but I wish they were written down somewhere or where given as a handout because sometimes the prompts could be a little unclear.",
    "An overall great course - no matter your level of skill going in, you will improve."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I loved the class. It was very different from normal more intellectual classes, but it was a highlight of my day.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who really loves drawing. We spend several hours a week just drawing people or still-lifes with very little instruction time.",
    "If you've ever been interested in drawing, this course is a good boost into trying it out more. I'm not sure that I improved tremendously in practice, but I do think that I've developed the skills for how to approach a drawing.",
    "Yes. For anyone trying to improve in art.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who seriously want to improve their drawing skills, rather than people just looking for a fun art course. You definitely improve and try to think differently about drawing after taking it, but if you were expecting an easy art class you might get frustrated easily because their were some grueling assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend - you will definitely learn a lot, and experience a different kind of intellectual challenge. I found it was an especially great balance to my STEM courses."
