   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to a student who had sufficient preparation in highschool. I took multivariable calculus my senior year, but this was still a challenge. Be sure to keep up with the problem sets and practice problems.",
    "Math 120 is a great class. If you are intending to be in the sciences then this is almost necessary and well taught if you have Frame.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if Michael Frame is teaching it. It's definitely difficult, but it's worth it at the end when you realize how much you've learned. I took this course because I needed to for a prerequisite, and it was very hard, but also pretty cool.",
    "Take 120 if you need and TAKE IT WITH FRAME!",
    "Recommended only for those who likes mathematics.",
    "Math 120 is hard, but manageable if you put the work into it.",
    "Its what I imagine most calculus courses are like. Expect to spend a couple hours a week on the problem sets and a good amount of time studying for the final. It is not an easy course, but it is doable.",
    "Take it if you have Frame. The course is quite hard and will take a good amount of studying. But it gives you a very good overall picture of Multivariable calculus.",
    "I would recommend this class to those students particularly interested in math or a math related subject. I took this class coming out of BC calculus, and taking it for a pre-med requirement. I took it because that is what all of my friends were taking. It was manageable for the most part, but the last bit of material was fairly difficult. I did at times wonder why I was taking such a course, since most of the math is far beyond anything needed for what I intend to study. However, it was really a rewarding class, and Michael Frame is one of the best professors that I have had.",
    "While maths in general is taught badly at Yale, Frame is the exception! I had heard this so I go to section sign up an hour and 15 minutes early and I was the 2nd to last person in his section. (some crazy kid got there at like 5am) YOU MUST GET THERE EARLY!!It is not fun, and it is not easy, but if you're going to take it, then take it with Frame.Tests were hard, but not impossible.",
    "Difficult course with lots of material presented very quickly. Hard to keep up and visualize a lot of complicated concepts, but if you put in the work it can be very rewarding and doable.",
    "Don't jump into it without looking at the lower math levels. Some of these kids have taken multivariable before and you just fly through the material and it's easy to get lost and frustrated.",
    "I liked it. It was pretty hard. I was VERY glad I had Prof. Frame. He was amazing. Go to all the classes and do the Psets BY YOURSELF. doing them in a group means you don't learn how to do it and you will fail the exams. this is not an easy course. but it is satisfying. Take it with Frame. I really hope he doesn't retire.",
    "A challenging course that is equally rewarding, commensurate with the effort you put in to it. In fact, rewards are probably increasing in proportion to effort.",
    "Take it if you need to or like math. I'd recommend it.",
    "Math 120 extends single variable calculus to include multiple variables, but does not use too many concepts taught in Math 115. Most people in Math 120 are math majors or pre-meds trying to fulfill requirements.",
    "If you love math, you'll love it. Because it's math.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "This class starts off easy and doesn't really get tough until the last chapter. You'll probably never have to use this stuff in real life, but it's a nice follow-up to calculus in 2 dimensions. Stay on top of your work (know what's going on, don't just copy other people's problem sets), do the practice tests, and you should be fine on the midterms. The final is a character building experience... oh and Michael Frame is the most inspirational professor I've had at Yale.",
    "This is a comprehensive course that covers the foundations of vector and multi-variable calculus. The material is essential for higher-level math and physics courses at Yale. The material is difficult in nature but very manageable if you put in the time outside of class to read the book and understand the concepts.",
    "I would recommend taking mathematics 120 to a student who is sure they are going to use it for their major. It is a challenging course, and I think that it is not worth taking this class just to fulfill a QR.",
    "It is simply not a very interesting\/fun course to take, I would not recommend it unless it's absolutely a requirement for your major pre-professional track..",
    "This was one of my favorite classes ever. Professor Frame is one of the best teachers I have ever had in my life, so definitely try to get into his section if you take the course. The material is dull sometimes since we don't do proofs, but Frame always made class really engaging, and his passion for math was extremely contagious. I really hope he keeps teaching the course.",
    "Frame's class is the only way to go. I don't understand some people who complain about going into math preregistration at 6am to get Frame, because it's really just one day of waking up a few hours early - geez - for a decision that will affect your perception of the class (and grade) for the whole semester. Frame will keep you at the top of the curve because he explains concepts so clearly. I actually really loved this class, and I wouldn't even say I'm a math person at all - I might even major in something requiring math now, because 120 was rather enjoyable. I felt like I was well taken care of. It's clear Frame genuinely enjoys teaching, and I hope he can continue... I will miss his jokes from Garrison Keillor [at]Prairie Home Companion. The class itself is some challenging material: p-sets may take about two hours or so, some are longer than others, but really manageable -- no surprises, really! Oh, and if you wondering if this is the class you should take, don't worry, I took AB and BC and was fine -- you really don't need that much AB\/BC material for Multi. That said, a lot of people who've taken Multi before in high school take 120 for whatever reason.",
    "I loved Math 120 and didn't expect to love it. Michael Frame is a one-of-a-kind individual whose warmness and enthusiasm to teach is evident every of moment. He is an inspiration. I feel so lucky to have taken this course with him!",
    "TAKE IT WITH FRAME!!!!!",
    "The class was very aggravating because the way they taught the material was not conducive to any attempt at conceptual learning. Presentation of the material was disorganized and no attempt to state the relevancy of what was learned was made. If not for the organized way Frame presented the material and his discussion of its relevancy to physics and geometry I would have been lost. Overall though, the material is fascinating. If you want to do anything in physics or science\/engineering I would advise you to take it. Besides a lot of prerequisites for those kinds of majors require two semesters of calculus anyway. Again, the material was so cool and I found Multivariable to be a rewarding culmination to my highschool calculus.",
    "With the tragic illness of Professor Michael Frame, I can only hope that a teacher of similar merit will step up to the plate as his successor. The subject material, being the foundation of so much other math, is required for any serious pursuit of mathematics. Its theoretical basis makes it more interesting and perhaps less tedious than its twin class in the engineering department, but I can only hope that a teacher of Frame's merit will be able to take hold of the reins before the less able teachers drag down the reputation of this class any more than they already have.",
    "Yes, Math 120 is a great, but challenging course. Definitely get Frame if possible.",
    "I would say that Math 120 is a quick spring through all of the geometric analysis of calculus, and although you'll know what you're doing when you're doing it, you probably won't understand why. I would recommend it for those who need to take this as a prerequisite - it moves too fast for those who aren't actually going to need it to want to go through the trouble.",
    "Math 120 is not the most fascinating course, but its concepts are probably essential to many fields and applications. There were very few application-based problems or strategies, and sometimes that made the class difficult.The p-sets are very fair, and are worth so little that it almost doesn't matter if you get full credit for all of them. However, this causes the tests to be worth so much. On a midterm, I made two simple mistakes, each in only one part of a multi-part question. That cost me half the credit for each question, losing 11 points out of 80. This brought me down to only a little above the mean. Math 120 is not a fan of partial credit. If you are hoping for a grade in the A, A-, B+ or B range, it will be simple mistakes (or their absence) that will determine your grade. Granted, the curve is supposed to be kind. Michael Frame was a fantastic teacher. Take him, if he still teaches next year. However, I heard some of the TAs who had extremely small classes (my friend had a 3-person class) were also very good in those personal settings.",
    "The class is taught quickly and one must know previous calculus material very well. I would recommend this course to someone who was very well prepared in calculus.",
    "Very hard... make sure you really like and math and that you're good at it.",
    "This is a standard multi-variable calculus course. Most people who have no affinity for math need not apply. That being said, the material is covered at a brisk pace, but as long as you pay attention in class, and make sure you understand things before the next lecture, you should be ok. Everything is covered in a logical order, and you learn all you need to know in class.",
    "If you don't like math you won't like this class. If you do, you'll love this class. Frame was excellent, but from what I've heard the other professors aren't bad either.",
    "Challenging course in Calculus. A lot of learning by heart, but that is rewarding when done."
