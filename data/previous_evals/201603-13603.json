   "comments": [
    "Basically, this course in 13 weeks taught me what a year of econ classes was supposed to. It's all the real life, applicable things that happen in markets, how to be a knowledgeable consumer and basically prepares you to be an adult in this world. Professor Powers did a wonderful job of providing interesting theory as well as really concrete examples from his own work and his friends' experiences. An absolutely essential class to take--I feel like I actually understand how economics, markets, investment and consumers interact in an applicable way.",
    "I developed a fuller view of real estate markets and how they function.",
    "Philosophy of private property, housing crisis, modern real estate.",
    "This is an amazing course. It touches on so many real estate topics, including the origins of the 2007 housing crisis, state sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, office space, retail space, and affordable housing. You can't learn this stuff from any other \"liberal arts\" course.",
    "The truth behind the financial crisis of 2008, the theory behind private property, and some technicalities behind housing finance",
    "A really broad interesting look at real estate from the origins of the western legal canon to modern day analysis. GREAT course!",
    "This course provided a decent survey of real estate from basic property law to the 2008 financial crisis to investing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Powers is awesome and chose a really interesting group of students with varying and cool backgrounds. The course does a great job examining many areas related to real estate and providing interest points for each different student. The guest speakers Prof Powers brings in are also really unique and awesome. Weaknesses... I guess the papers were a bit hard because I felt like there were not enough concrete expectations laid out ahead of time.",
    "We had a lot of technical issues that impeded slide presentations.",
    "The course subject is very interesting and relevant. Richard Powers created a comfortable class environment to encourage everybody to speak up, but sometimes I wish to have more of a lecture (with more content) than that. The topic is so broad that I felt like we did not go deep enough, but it was still an interesting class. Grading was a little bit fuzzy (probably because this is a college seminar?). The guest speakers are all experts in their fields, and it's great to see the instructor drawing on his connections of classmates (Yale alums) as guest speakers.",
    "Many people in the course without economics or real estate backgrounds had a hard time keeping up with some of the terminology and concepts when we were thrown into the material about government sponsored enterprises or about the details of the crash. It would be nice to be linked to Real Estate 101 materials as reading prior to taking the course. The guest speakers were amazing and really added to the dimension of the material by providing firsthand expertise.",
    "Strengths: content of the course, accessible professor, theoretical and practical skill\/ Weakness: the course covers three areas--everyone had a different interest so course engagement would peak and crash whenever people wouldn't be interested or uninterested",
    "The outside speakers and articles really provided great background for learning about real estate and for applying that knowledge to other fields",
    "Too many guest lecturers in the middle of the course disrupted the flow from week to week.",
    "Strengths: touched on a wide range of topics, brought in good guests (particularly Dan Mudd, ex-CEO of Fannie Mae and Jake Siewert, former Clinton press secretary and Geithner advisor) Weaknesses: a bit disorganized, discussions in class could stall a bit, the divergent background in class prevented us from going deep in any single subject"

    "Absolutely.",
    "I'd recommend the course - it's a great way to gain a broad view of real estate. Not too much work; personable professor.",
    "Yes. Richard Powers is an amazing and kind person that you should get to know.",
    "Yes, absolutely, if you can get in, take it! This is an amazing course. It touches on so many real estate topics, including the origins of the 2007 housing crisis, state sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, office space, retail space, and affordable housing. You can't learn this stuff from any other \"liberal arts\" course.",
    "Yes if you are interested in real estate, urban studies and planning, and\/or interested in pursuing finance as a career.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Powers is a gem, the readings are interesting, and you really get a wide variety of perspectives from the industry in addition to some really cool historical grounding.",
    "Definitely would recommend - great introduction to real estate markets, knowledge that you will use if you chose to work in a real estate equity field but also very applicable as just an educated person",
    "Yes, although Id recommend the course primarily to students who have a broad interest in real estate but also a particular background in one of the covered topics (property law\/housing regulation\/investing)."
