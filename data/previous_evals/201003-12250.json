    "A trial by fire for composers. You should have some theory ready.",
    "MUSIC 214 is a hands-on musical composition seminar designed for students fluent in music theory and notation (must be able to use Finale or Sibelius software), and interested in writing music and lyrics for musical theater. Composers should be prepared to present new work or revisions to existing work every class, accompanying themselves on piano and\/or singing their songs. Academic song analysis papers also comprise a portion of class discussion, as does listening to and evaluating the work of composers like Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Stephen Sondheim. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, but only one willing to put in many hours over the course of the week composing music and lyrics and formally analyzing the work of others. The ability to take criticism well is also a must.",
    "An excellent application-based class that will push you to produce high quality work. You will begin writing musical theater songs right away. Instead of studying the subject academically, you will pick knowledge along the way as you write and revise your songs, which is one of the best ways to learn anyway. Alexander Gerle is a great teacher(who will critique your work honestly) with industry experience."
