   "comments": [
    "Learn A LOT in a very relaxed way. I really enjoyed this class, and feel like a fountain of knowledge now! Professor Brown is incredibly sweet -- I would love to have him as my grandfather! It is clear that he really wants his students to do well, and he makes us really WANT to do well, both for ourselves and for him.",
    "Lectures are very dull and Professor Brown moves very quickly so it's hard to take notes. Lectures are pretty much a summary of the readings though so you don't have to go to do well. The exams are difficult and you have to put in a good amount of time studying for them, but there's no other course work so it is definitely doable.",
    "It's a requirement for the neuroscience track of the psych major, and overall, I liked it. It's very comprehensive -- you go through an entire textbook in one semester. Brown's lectures are clear, and he as a way of interjecting his dry sense of humor every so often, which was always nice. It seemed like Brown wanted us to succeed, but he still made the class relatively challenging. The exams definitely are not easy -- you really need to know EVERYTHING from the slides if you want to do well, because he will sometimes test on minute details. Overall, I would recommend. Neuroscience is awesome!",
    "This class is strict memorization. Make flash cards. The first test seems impossible, but the chapters get a little easier over time. I wouldn't take this if you are just curious\/interested in how the brain works. This class is just for people that need the fundamental information for other classes.",
    "Class is very straightforward. All you do is memorize the lectures without any conceptual functioning. Professor Brown tells you this and that the best students are the ones who make note cards and study them constantly so there really are no surprises with the exams but be ready for a lot of memorization",
    "Psychology 170 is a very informative introduction to neuroscience. The class does cover a lot of information; the natural drawback is that this course will require a lot of brute memorization. Professor Brown is very informative, but he talks rather quietly. If you can make it past that, Psyc 170 will be a rewarding class.",
    "Yes, I would, as long as they do well with memorization and enjoy the material. There is a lot of material and it comes at you very fast. Preparing just the night before without having done any other work will not be sufficient. We're also talking hardcore rote memorization, so if that's not your thing, then don't take this class. Also, flashcards are a must.",
    "If you are not passionate about Neuroscience, don't take this course. Only a select few seemed to enjoy the course. The subject is very dry and narrow in its appeal.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 170 as an intro neuro class. It might not be as fun as Brain& Thought sounds, but the material is all super interesting and Professor Brown's a pretty good lecturer. The exams are tough and require a fair amount of studying, but they're manageable, especially considering there's no homework and no final exam.",
    "Umm if you are a psych major it is pretty fascinating.. but, it's pretty hard... no need to go to class which is nice but the power points aren't simple... I enjoyed it looking back but it was stressful at times...",
    "You learn a ton of material and if you are interested in neuroscience I would definitely recommend taking the course. Professor Brown isn't the most engaging lecturer and the information presented in class is pretty much identical to the reading in the textbook. The workload is manageable, but the exams are tricky, especially the multiple choice questions that ask ridiculously detailed questions about things that were hardly covered in class. Very hard to get an A, but with a considerable amount of studying for exams an A- is definitely attainable.",
    "PSYC 170 was a solid course. It was memorization-intensive, but that seems like the only way to learn the information that the course was designed to cover. I enjoyed what I learned from the course and often could see how it applied in real lift, which was neat. The workload was not too heavy, as there was no homework other than reading and studying for tests. There are 4 non-cumulative tests and no final, which is nice. I found that the reading and the lectures were very similar, so I rarely did the readings and instead just went to lecture. Studying from the lecture slides which were posted online taught me everything I needed for the tests.",
    "If you're a psychology major, take this course-though it would be useful to take another intro to neuroscience class first (i.e. introduction to the human brain). If you're not in the major, the matrial is still interesting and not inaccessible to the non-science major.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who are really interested in the course material. The lectures are filled with lots of information and are not always the most engaging. It's kind the kind of class that should be taken for its content, because the classes can be dull at times.",
    "Yes, it's not terribly difficult. You can pretty much study only the powerpoints and do well. Also, no final which is good.",
    "You learn a lot, but I thought it was all really fascinating and I enjoyed basically every single lecture. Studying for the tests can be tedious (it's a lot of memorization) but it's really rewarding once you've mastered everything.",
    "A lot of memorization, but if you like neuroscience, it's a cool class and I'd recommend it. Definitely not easy, but you're taking neuroscience, what'd you expect? Workload is actually pretty low - just 4 exams over the semester, which are pretty fair. They tell you mostly what you need to know. He did choose to include some random picky details that I thought was a little unfair, but averages on the exams were like 85-90, so it was pretty good.",
    "Take it if you're a psych major and the subject seems interesting to you.",
    "Awful, boring lecture. Thank goodness he posts the slides. Only take if you need it for psychology and if you can, take it credit\/D the whole thing is all based on rote memorization.",
    "This class gives a very good comprehensive look at various processes within the brain. I'd recommend it if you're looking for an intro to neuroscience. The class honestly isn't that much work. With only 4 exams, you only really need to work hard and review all the information in the week or so before the exam. The tests aren't that tricky, but because each one covers a decent amount of detailed information, it's a good idea to study early with notecards. With that, you'll be totally fine.",
    "Professor Brown may not be a good lecturer but he really cares for his students. Grading was based on 4 tests each for 25% of your final grade. LOTS of memorization so be prepared if you plan on taking this.",
    "Take it f you need it for the neuroscience track. If you need science credits, there are probably easier and more broadly reaching classes.",
    "This is a great introductory class for neuroscience.",
    "If you want to learn about neuroscience take it. Brown isn't the most exciting but the material is cool enough that it's fine. You also won't be bored in class because you'll have to take furious notes to keep up with the pace. Really relevant stuff that not enough people know about. Not even very much work. The tests aren't easy but they're just serious memorization, so your grade is just about how much you study.",
    "If you're not doing it for a major, you're probably better off doing Brain and Thought.",
    "I would recommend it- work load is fine, just read the textbook, and be ready for the 4 tests. No final, which is cool, it just sometimes feels like the tests are just one after another. But a lot of interesting information, and if you're a psych major it's a great choice for a list B.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Super boring lectures.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in neuro. It is not very difficult and is a pretty good introduction to the field.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in getting an in-depth introduction to neuroscience; the material will indubitably be used in other courses that you might be interested in.",
    "No. Material is interesting, professor is definitely not.",
    "Definitely take it! If you want to understand how the brain works and what happens when it doesn't this is a required class. It makes reading papers so much easier which is important because relative to other fields neuroscience is still new and understanding the existing literature is essential. Professor Brown is really approachable and puts in a lotof effort into creating the lecture slides so you should put in the effort to know them thoroughly. Also Melissa is always around to answer questions. The format is very straightforward. There are 4 exams and no final.",
    "This class is awesome if you enjoy\/are interested in neuroscience, but if you're just looking for a random class to take, you probably won't like it. Professor Brown is a bit dry\/boring (read: sleep-inducing), so you might be put-off by his lecturing. But if you have any interest in this field you will really enjoy learning this material. One thing that impressed me was how well Professor Brown organizes and presents the material, in terms of the content of what he's saying\/putting on powerpoints (ignoring his actual presentation quality).",
    "If you're taking this for the Neuroscience track of the Psych major, remember that you can take this Cr\/D\/F and still have it count towards the major. Take advantage of this if you can! There are only four grades in the class (four exams), and your worst grade is only weighted worth half of the other scores. Since this class is straight memorization, you can still be successful in this class without a ton of effort (and be successful in your other classes).",
    "This is an extremely rewarding class if you are interested in the material. Be prepared to work hard and really study for the tests. On a bright note, there is no final, and the tests are not cumulative.",
    "I would recommend the class. You do get a good overview of neuroscience. There was more attention to some of the basics than I would have cared for, like the neuroscience of sight and hearing and olfaction. I would have liked a bit more attention to the neuroscience behind psychological disorders and drug addiction.Lectures very closely followed the textbook, and sometimes moved so quickly I didn't really absorb much in class. Still, as long as I took time to review them on my own, I felt in control of the material.The class feels very manageable because it has a very straightforward structure: unit followed by a midterm, x4."
