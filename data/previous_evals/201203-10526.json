    "It taught me some skills that will be useful in my research such as sealing elemental vials and how a piece of glassware could be mended.",
    "This class gave me a practical understanding of the importance of the chemical composition of glass and its many uses in innovative research of all types. It also allows students to do many simple tasks themselves, such as sealing oxygen-sensitive NMR samples. This can save time during the research process.",
    "This course taught me important fabrication skills key to research. More importantly, it taught me how to approach an entirely foreign set of questions, how to obtain systematic knowledge in the face of complete uncertainty, how to work things out for myself and how to tell when to ask for help. This course was a great exercise in focus and discovery, and it made me a better scientist."
