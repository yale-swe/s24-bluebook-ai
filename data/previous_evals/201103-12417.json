    "YES. If you're willing to put in the time. You will spend more time in 489 than any other class ever, but the end result is well worth it. You actually accomplish; for what other MENG classes can you say that? Professor Morrell is incredibly helpful and an awesome person to know, really makes the class. So it's a lot of work, but you WILL be able to contribute (I doubted my ability to do so for a while) and really do something cool. So awesome. Ties together everything from the past few years in a great way.",
    "It's an amazing class. The workload is a bunch, but the rewards are amazing.",
    "Take it. It'll be worth it, even if it is a lot of work that occasionally takes over your life.",
    "I would take it, even if you don't have to. It's a ton of work, but even if your project ends up not being that interesting, the skills you gain in the ideation and concept development process, the problem solving as issues come up along the way, and the intense amount of teamwork involved are totally worth it.",
    "This is a really excellent course. Essentially, the class begins with lectures on mechanical design and the class is divided into a few smaller groups. These groups then complete an intense design project by the end of the semester. The course is extremely time-consuming, but well worth it. This is probably the best course I have taken at Yale, and Professor Morrell is awesome, so I highly recommend it.",
    "Mechanical Engineering is the very much the capstone to Engineering classes around senior project time. Take it, especially when you feel you are at the height of your skill in Engineering at Yale.",
    "This class taught me that I never want to go into industry or work on a design project again, and in terms of that insight I'm grateful I took it. This class won't teach you much in terms of specific engineering knowledge or skills: if you know how to manufacture stuff you're gonna be manufacturing stuff for your team, and if you know how to program you'll do the programming. What the class does teach you is how to approach a design project, work in a team, deal with team deadlines, and manage group dynamics. In other words, it will put your people skills to the test. Another frustrating aspect is the unpredictability and unevenness of the workload: there were times where I felt I spent all my waking hours in lab (especially towards the end of the semester), and other weeks where I hardly set foot in there. Overall, I think its a pretty accurate simulation of what working in a real design team is like, except with more inexperienced and more selfish people on your team.",
    "The best class I have taken at Yale. It is the application of everything you have learned thus far, put into the real world setting of designing a product. Take the feeling of satisfaction you get from the designing of an individual senior project and multiply that by the efforts of your team mates, who allowed you to help create something you were incapable of by yourself.",
    "This course could be fun if you go into it with a good group of friends with whom you workwell. However, it's a ton of work, and it'll suck up all your free time. Also, if you're a gradegrubber, know that the grading is totally opaque: you'll have basically no idea how you'redoing until you get your final grade. You do get to play with a lot of stuff that can injure youin this class, though, and that's why you wanted to be an engineer anyway, right?",
    "Overall a good engineering course; I am not sure I would recommend it to any kind of engineering student though. Professor Morrell is a great teacher. He puts a lot of effort (and time) in the class and he cares about his students. That said I wish the course was a little bit more structured. Students with specific skills (machine shop, programming etc.) have a huge advantage by immediately assuming responsibility. Also, the course is a looot of work, but you are never sure how you are doing until the end, because no grades are given out throughout the year; only feedback on presentations and the lab notebook."
