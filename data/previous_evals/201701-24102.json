    "General insights",
    "This course taught me how to get my ideas out to the rest of the world through popular writing. Emma will give you skills, tips, and advice on how to write engaging articles for the \"bored and tired Internet reader.\" Emma also brought in numerous guest speakers - such as writers from the NY Times, TIME, and Huffington Post- that spoke to us about their journey to becoming a writer. This course also taught me extremely important life skills that will help you build your resilience, gratitude, and happiness. I will forever cherish the techniques and skills I have learned from this class.",
    "Writing popular science articles!",
    "This course was amazing! I truly feel that Professor Seppala's class filled a knowledge gap for me. This class taught me the personal skills that I need to actually be well, not just academically successful. This course is so important, and so needed at Yale! Emma makes sure this course is experiential for every student. I came away with a toolkit of strategies to use on a daily or as-needed basis to make sure that I stay mentally, physically, and emotionally well. I have not found anywhere else at Yale to gain these vital skills. Again, Professor Seppala's class is truly filling a gap at Yale that needs to be filled.",
    "I learned how to better manage my stress as well as meditation and breathing exercises. I learn about population writing strategies.",
    "This class has the most practical application to the real world in terms of being able to land you a job. The instructor is practically throwing you into the field of online writing and giving you real world connections that you could use in the future. Online writing is not my thing in the end, but I really appreciate the exposure. Learned a lot about writing and finding my own writing voice in a popular style.",
    "Meditation and happiness practices, as well as learning how to write popular science articles.",
    "we learned about positive psych but more importantly how to write about it.",
    "This class has been the most valuable class that i have taken at Yale. I learned positive psychology information and concrete writing techniques that enriched my academic experience and mindfulness and wellness techniques that improved my personal well-being at Yale.",
    "Definitely improved my popular science writing skills Gained a ton of knowledge into specific aspects of positive psychology, and I really appreciate the fact that readings were a mix of popular science articles and the original studies themselves Gained insights into how to best manage my personal stress, and to actually put those tools to work"

   "comments": [
    "Everyone should have to take this course!",
    "Strengths: The guest speakers Emma brings in are amazing! I loved learning from amazing writers who have such great perspectives on wellness. Weaknesses: I would have enjoyed it if the class were not scheduled right after lunch. I was always in a post-lunch lull at the beginning of the period.",
    "I LOVE the interacted part of the class; however, maybe a little less writing guest lectures. Some were really interesting, but some weren't as interesting as a normal class. The meditation was also amazing and the pitching made you feel powerful!",
    "A more clear syllabus could have been used in the final weeks (not a huge issue, the instructor was flexible). Overall material was very strong and you could learn so much from that even if you ignored all of the writing tips. The writing tips are great as well!",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses! It was a great course",
    "It was a great mixture of discussion, activity, and guest speakers. Loved hearing other students' perspectives.",
    "This course is incredible. The structure of in-class exercises, guest speakers, and community conversation truly makes this class a unique and special experience.",
    "Strengths: -the broad survey of different useful tools proven by positive psychology was great; these were things I could actually use in my own life and tell my friends about -I absolutely loved how many guest lecturers we had, whom we interrogated about what real life as a journalist, writer, etc. is like; they also provided a great diversity of experience -I really appreciate the fact that readings were a mix of popular science articles and the original studies themselves Weaknesses: -it was easy to slack off on actually implementing stress reduction strategies sometimes; maybe in addition to the weekly article assignments, make an ungraded assignment of journaling what techniques you used\/how they made you feel\/ before v. after, that kind of thing Areas for Improvement: -this course definitely should have been a writing credit!"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely!!",
    "This course was amazing and honestly changed my life. To me, this was more of a \"life\" course than an academic course - I learned so much in this class that will be extremely relevant throughout the rest of my life.",
    "Yes definitely take! Unlike other psychology classes, we actually applied the readings assigned to us. This class significantly helped my mood and stress levels.",
    "Take this course! It was literally life changing. I gained popular writing skills that I can now use in my career. I even had an article published by the end of the semester! Don't be intimidated by workload. Emma bends over backwards to organize the course in such a way that the workload will not be overwhelming. I was done with assignments well before reading period began, and never felt burnt out by this course. Emma also brings in amazing writers to speak to the class. I loved hearing from a Huffington post editor, a New York Times writer, published authors... The guest speakers were great. The real strength of this course, however, is the experiential element. Each class, we were learning about AND TRYING different techniques to increase our wellness. I've now adopted breathing strategies and meditation techniques that help me manage stress, manage my time, and feel happy on a daily basis. Every Yale student should take this course! It will make your life better now and in the future!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Emma Seppala is amazing. You get to meditated every class, and it is a very interactive class. It helped me better manage stress.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Emma is an excellent instructor.",
    "Definitely take. The instructor is fabulous and the course material is almost as good!",
    "Yes! Emma is great, and I would recommend this course",
    "Everyone should take this coursE!",
    "YES! All people can benefit from this course. However, if one has a love of writing, they will truly love this course!",
    "Yes! This course was a great way to learn in an unstressful environment (we meditate in class!), improve the specific skill of popular magazine\/blog writing (very useful for working on getting to the point\/writing for mass consumption), and overall a very wholesome, life-enriching experience. You can make of it what you want, and if you WANT it to be a reason to motivate yourself to implement destressing techniques, then that's definitely something the course has to offer."
