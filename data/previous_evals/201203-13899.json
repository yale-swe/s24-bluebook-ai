    "Hour per week varied from 2 to 15 depending on the reading for the week (some weeks novels were assigned).",

But the books that we read took several hours more. The final paper also was one of my more substantial projects for the semester.I think that the work load was appropriate because it was all extremely relevant to the course.",

   "comments": [
    "Very interesting with a unique perspective from international relations and eastern asian study majors. Small class size and discussion based classes were a major strength.",
    "I really enjoyed the course because I learned a lot about epidemics and contextual factors in Asia. Most of the information was new to me and I found the readings and seminar helpful. One characteristic of the course that has made me somewhat nervous is that our final paper is the only graded component. There is a lot of pressure to produce great work and a little ambiguity about how it will be evaluated.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "This course is informal in that it is a seminar. A lot of reading and a 25 page term paper is required, but the discussions in class are interesting and perceptive.",
    "Really interesting subject matter.Discussion was very interesting. Loved having a mix of students from different disciplines and unique perspectives in class. Really enjoyed learning and finally talking about how culture and history influence the way in which disease start and then spread.",
    "Absolutely loved this class. I enjoyed discussions and really enjoyed the selection of readings. Tuesdays were my busiest day of the week and this course was my last class of the day. Regardless of the previous classes I always looked forward to and enjoyed this course and time in it flew by.I on't think it was that big of a deal and in the end enjoyed working on my final paper. But it might be helpful to have a few guidelines about the paper. I understand that structure limits creativity and if Dr. Summers was satisfied with our final papers he shouldn't change this about the course. However, if he wanted papers to be more focused in a certain area then I would suggest a few more guidelines or an example.",
    "Seminar based class that provided a historical context to epidemics. As a cross listed class it was nice to have students from a variety of disciplines to provide different perspective to the various topics.In the beginning, the material was not always readily available and there was no grading information provided in the syllabus. However, the readings were interesting, but wished we got to talk more about the impact on future epidemics and how that has shaped control of epidemics today.The Final project gave a way to delve into one particular area\/theme that really let me explore a new country, its history, and how a specific disease has impacted the health of the people and shaped the country as a whole.",
    "Discussion was incredibly interesting with many different opinions and perspectives from interdisciplinary classmates. I enjoyed the breadth of material from both a science and humanities approach, esp. from an instructor who valued both.Reading more outside material, besides assigned reading, really improved my experience by being able to add to discussion."

    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0I really enjoyed class with Dr. Summers. He brings a great perspective as an MD, global health and history expert. He chose great subjects for each class and led the discussion without dominating it. I felt lucky to take his course.",
    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0Very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0The instructor is knowledgeable and it was great to listen to him speak about the historical, social, political and environmental context behind epidemics in Asia. Some of the things that were brought-up were interesting and that I did not known before.",
    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0Very knowledgeable and intelligent. Asks you to think about why disease has spread in different contexts.",
    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0Dr. Summers was an excellent facilitator and he was vey knowledgable about asia and medical conditions. I don't know what else you could ask for. Thank you.",
    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0Vast knowledge in the history of diseases studied and culture and history of parts of Asia.He is laid back but more feedback would be nice over the course of the semester.",
    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0Values both a scientific and humanities perspective, encourages debate, incredibly knowledgeable about all source material."

   "comments": [
    "Great class.",
    "The course is a seminar design and very discussion-based. If you have the discipline and motivation to do the readings, it will be very rewarding. I would recommend it to anyone interested in infectious disease or global health in general. I am very glad I took 588!",
    "Very interesting.",
    "This course offers students, especially EMD students, with the opportunity to discuss the historical, social, political, and environmental contexts influencing epidemics instead of focusing on the molecular and scientific implications of epidemics.",
    "Unclear instructions\/lack of structure\/discussion of expectations\/how we would be assessed in the class and on final papers. A little more structure and information on these points would have been helpful. Something like a project or discussion where students would work with individuals in the other disciplines more directly once during the semester might be something to consider.",
    "This class has been one of my top classes at Yale. I would suggest this course to students who like to discuss and hear other opinions. Others that are happy to sit in a lecture and take notes should look elsewhere. Dr. Summers is an excellent professor, but the class is highly dependent on the enrolled students and their ability to discuss.",
    "Great seminar style class that provided a new perspective to infectious disease epidemics and touched upon the social, ecological, historical, and cultural aspects to disease.",
    "Yes. Course is a good overview of many epidemics from a historical perspective, excellent instructor and classmates make the class a must-take."
