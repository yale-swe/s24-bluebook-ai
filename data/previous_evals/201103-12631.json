   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a course on historiography, not someone looking for a course on the greater ideas history teaches us. However, I also might not recommend the course due to the sheer amount of work it presents and the often confusing (and therefore stressful) paper topics.",
    "What History Teaches is a great class for someone with an incredibly open mind and ability to think abstractly. It can definitely be intimidating for a first semester freshman seminar but if you're up for a challenge in terms of work and analysis and don't go in expecting to leave with all the answers, it's definitely a worthwhile experience in philosophical thinking.",
    "This is an awesome course. It is a lot of reading and thus very time-consuming but at the same time very rewarding! I would definitely recommend it if you can get in. It completely changed my perspective on history! This course looks at history from a philosophical perspective. I would recommend this seminar to everyone who is interested in philosophy and history.",
    "A dull seminar with a famous professor. Really interesting reading and writing assignments but not worth the hype.",
    "Whether or not you are interested in History as a major, TAKE this class. The reading load is slightly more intensive than regular classes at Yale, but the satisfaction that you gain from completing the reading list is absolutely fantastic. An amazing introduction to the various nuances of History, with class discussions that delved into other disciplines like Biology, Math, Philosophy, Psychology as well, The writing assignments aren't particularly difficult\/numerous (most of them involve writing about your life\/personal experiences!!), but they really, really helped me grow as a writer.",
    "It was a good freshman seminar. I would recommend it if you are passionate about history and willing to do a ton of reading.",
    "Yes, only if they are prepared for a heavy load of reading!",
    "I would highly recommend taking HIST 022. You will read a wide range of books over the course of the semester, including macro- and micro-history (one focusing on a five-day period and the other focusing on all of human history), two books by Professor Gaddis, and War and Peace. The workload is quite intense in terms of reading (although it's fine if you can't get through all of it), but otherwise quite reasonable: our class had to write only four five-page papers. The assigned topics were difficult but definitely thought-provoking and interesting to write: an autobiographical \"classic\", a reconstruction of your life on a specific day in October of that year using archival materials, a history of anything, and a reflection on what history teaches. Class discussions are very interesting and Professor Gaddis does a great job pulling in a wide range of ideas and material (we watched a bunch of videos and discussed topics such as chaos theory). I'd recommend this class for any incoming freshman, not just those interested in histories. You'll learn a lot and will hopefully leave the class as I did, with a new perspective on the remainder of your studies.",
    "This is one of the best classes that an incoming freshman can take. No matter your interest, if you can get in, get in. If not, try and get in by emailing Professor Gaddis as soon as possible (minutes, seconds) after not getting in through the lottery, and then show up to the first class, because our year he accepted 3 people (the first three who emailed him). This class is hyped up to unreasonable levels, and is one class all freshmen knew about. Being in it attracted the envy of countless others who weren't so lucky to get a spot, and is sort of as exclusive a class as is available for freshmen, with one of Yale's most famous professors. It does not entirely live up to the hype, as many in our class felt, but that's because no class really can. Not considering Professor Gaddis's celebrity status, it still is a history seminar, but one of the highest quality. The reading list is very well thought out, and if you take the time to read them all (if you can, read all of War and Peace. It is worth it. I regret that I did not) it will profoundly influence how you see the world, really. But the reading is not required at all. Many could participate well in discussion without it, and the writing assignments do not draw upon them. The essays are those of a creative writing course, and they were all a joy to write (the best assignments of my freshman year). Professor Gaddis is excellent at helping you hone your writing, and despite his fame is very accessible outside of class. He is also such a kind person and cares about his students - again, amazing from a professor as important (and busy) as him. To make the most of this class, take a semi-light courseload otherwise, because it can be a lot of work if you do the reading. It can also be the best class you take freshman year. Best of luck, and pray that you get in!",
    "Take this course if you get into it -getting a seminar with Professor Gaddis as a freshman is very hard to do.",
    "I would recommend this course because the professor and the material are great! It is also very nice to take a freshman seminar in general because you get to know a smaller group of students and interact with them in a tight knit classroom.",
    "A class looking at the variety of methods in which history is taught. I would recommend this to anyone who loves reading and thinking about the way history is presented.",
    "If you are looking to take an intro History course this is not it. Essentially what you end up doing is reading various books and excerpts that may not seem to be related at the time but which you will eventually find links with at the end of the semester. There is a lot of reading involved and you may feel a little overwhelmed in the beginning, but you will soon realize that you don't have to do all of it, skimming is key. Just make sure you get the jist of it and have some material to talk about during class.",
    "What history teaches is worth it just for Gaddis. The course may not impress you, but his personal stories will.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with reservations. The course consists of massive reading assignments, class discussions of the readings, and four essays. The reading assignments are mainly well worth the time, and they are the main benefit of taking the course. The class discussions can be frustrating due to lack of depth or to overly philosophical nature. The writing assignments can also be frustrating due to their obscure and often ambiguous natures."
