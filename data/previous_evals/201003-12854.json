    "pretty decent class. small and intimate. teacher is decent and the TAs are cool. class sometimes goes over allotted time, so dont have a class scheduled for directly after. tests and quizzes are pretty good if you study",
    "Kiswahili 110 01 was an amazing language course and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn an East African language. Just like any language course you will have to put time and effort into learning Swahili, and although the course may seem to be relatively easy in the beginning, the intensity picks up. But again, if you are serious about learning an African language then this course is definitely manageable and enjoyable. This course, I feel, provides a solid foundation for the Swahili language and East African culture.",
    "Yes, yes!! Take Swahili. It is a fun language and you will be able to have a real conversation by the end of the first semester. It is also taught well.",
    "This class is unbelievable. The teacher is amazing and you will honestly learn so much. I went from knowing no Kiswahili to be able to do a 10 minute presentation and write essays without a problem.",
    "Kiswahili 110 is a fantastic course. Swahili is such a fascinating language, and we\u0092ve learned so much. At the beginning of the semester, we knew no Swahili, and we can now speak about so many topics and even give an entire 5-8 minute presentation in Swahili. Though an early morning course, it\u0092s an awesome group of interesting people, and you get to know the other students in the class well. With class and Swahili table, the class really feels like a community. In this class, I\u0092ve learned an amazing language, learned about the culture of East Africa (definitely an amazing part of taking this course) and made great friends. Swahili is structured differently than any other language I\u0092ve learned and is such an interesting and fun language to learn. I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning Swahili!",
    "Swahili is beautiful. Language classes require such different mental muscles, and in conjunction with reading-heavily humanities classes especially, can be very refreshing, and even calming. I came into the class with no exposure to African Studies, and no previous interest in East Africa, yet every day, my desire to travel grows. It's very little work, and yet so much learning is somehow able to take place. Professor Wa'Njogu is masterful.",
    "I absolutely would recommend it. I have tried learning Kiswahili before in a classroom setting, and this was a completely different experience in that I'm leaving first semester feeling as though I could get by on some level were I to go to East Africa tomorrow. Looking forward to improving next semester!"
