    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. Even a complete newcomer to the subject would take away a good grasp of how the Russian Revolutions played out in history and how they fit into the grand scheme of European history.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for any student interested in Russian history of the early 20th century -- even for those who are already familiar with the content. As this is not a survey course, it can be a bit difficult to follow if you are not already knowledgable about the basic facts and chronology of the time period. However, the readings provided an excellent international context.",
    "The course was about the Russian Revolution in European context. We studied not only the Russian Revolution and Civil War, but also other European revolutions (German, Hungarian) occurring in this period and how they were related to the Russian Revolution. Yes, I would recommend this course because it allows students to learn about the connections between Eastern and Western Europe in this period."

    "This course helped me better understand a period of history in my field which is well removed from the period on which I focus. Fleshing out my knowledge of this time in Russian history is crucial to my understanding of it as a whole.",
    "This did not directly contribute to my own research, but it provided needed context and background for the time period in which I am interested.",
    "It helped me understand the broader context of an important period in European history."
