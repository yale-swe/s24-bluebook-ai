   "comments": [
    "You have to participate to get anything out of the class, but if you do, it's fun.",
    "I learned a great deal about the roots of the modern horror genre in Slavic folklore and 19th century literature.",
    "The themes explored in this class are applicable much more widely than one might expect. In addition to enhancing close reading and analytical skills, the course teaches how to take a new perspective on what may seem familiar material.",
    "The Living Dead in Literature gave me the opportunity to really engage with the texts, practice close-reading and close analysis, and understand the different means through which artists convey death, the undead, and the living dead. In addition, the course allowed me to grapple with broader topics such as the blurring of gender lines and the impact technology and science had on the writers' depictions of the undead. I also began to think a lot about the difference between what the author is writing and what the author wants the reader to believe (aka, are we supposed to believe that supernatural events are taking place, or are we supposed to believe the characters are mad?). I also found it fascinating to discuss why it is that many of these stories came about, and how often stories of the supernatural were means through which to understand the inexplicable local death or sexual transgression. Overall, this course has challenged me to think about literature through many new lenses, and it is one of the most exciting and stimulating classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "The ability to follow trends over the entirety of a course and throughout multiple novels. Comparative analysis between pieces of literature but also between various artforms (music, movies, paintings etc) and literature.",
    "I gained writing skills and seminar participation skills. I did close reading, larger theory based analysis, and creative assignments as well. Definitely learned quite a bit!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is really engaging. I read a lot of things that have been on my reading list forever. The assignments are very open-ended, and I enjoyed that. I really have no complaints about the way this course was set up or taught.",
    "I think the course could be narrowed down a bit for more specificity. There were a few readings that didn't really feel like they fit in with the rest of the course\/were unnecessary, and because we got so behind on the syllabus, it seemed like we missed out on stuff that was more relevant.",
    "A strength of this course was that the material was fun and engaging. However, the professor isn't great at fostering good discussion, so you have to be really active if you want class to be interesting.",
    "The course covered a wide variety of fascinating texts and was always very engaging. I'm not sure how it could be improved.",
    "The course was well structured and the syllabus included a wide range of texts. It could have been slightly better paced so that some of the original texts on the list were not lost.",
    "I don't think I can list a single weakness for the course. The work was consistently manageable, enjoyable, and challenging in a good, thought-provoking way. The class discussions were always engaging, (even when it was clear that not all of us had finished the readings) as Professor Brunson was an incredible seminar leader. In addition, I really liked the creative final assignment and thought that the presentation day during reading week was the perfect way to end the semester.",
    "Strengths-- material is just generally very interesting and culturally relevant (who wouldn't want to talk about vampires and weave in Buffy or True Blood?). There's also a lot of opportunity for creativity, and I highly suggest that interested students fully embrace the \"creative project\" piece of this class. Weaknesses-- we got super off-track with our schedule, partly because I think we read too many unnecessary short stories that we 1. never got to properly discuss and 2. didn't really add anything to the course. I would rather have spent more time discussing some of the novels than, say, Hoffman's Sandman.",
    "Very strong course -- keep it as it is."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The reading list was wonderful, Professor Brunson was fantastic, and the themes that we explored were so much broader than I would have guessed. The course utilized many media to demonstrate the place that the living dead have in our culture. Overall a really fun course!",
    "Take this class if you want something fun and relatively light on work, but be prepared to participate because discussions can lag sometimes.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Professor Brunson is the most engaging, intelligent, and warm-hearted professor I've ever met. You won't regret it - plus, you get to read the coolest pieces of literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, especially if they're interested in the horror or gothic genres. I learned a huge amount, and it was a a lot of fun, especially the creative project.",
    "This was a fun, interesting, and rewarding course, whether you are a major or not. There is much to learn that can be applied especially in today's culture that is increasingly more obsessed with the nonhuman in media and film portrayals.",
    "I think every student, regardless of his or her major, should take this course before graduating. The readings are enjoyable, the class discussions are engaging, and the workload is incredibly manageable. Professor Brunson is a remarkable seminar leader and there was truly never a dull moment. Even though it is listed as Russian literature, our class analyses always tied everything to broader themes and contemporary issues.",
    "Super fun class. Professor Brunson is chill and engaging, willing to work with students and their interests. The papers are all short, and the creative project is actually super fun. If you grew up with Twilight, Walking Dead, and paranormal romance (like the rest of us), reading the origin stories for these pop-hits was a fascinating experience.",
    "Yes -- a wonderful and engaging seminar. Take it!"
