    "I learned the basic grammar and vocabulary to continue my Spanish learning. I also learned about culture.",
    "I learned basic Spanish vocabulary and grammar. I am comfortable speaking about my family, activities I like, food, and my classes.",
    "I learned how to speak spanish.",
    "I learned elementary Spanish. For an intro class, you'll get to learn a good deal of vocab (mostly useful) and all the basic verbs you need to get by.",
    "I developed more knowledge about the language of spanish and how to use it in every day life",
    "My ability to speak and read Spanish grew tremendously over the semester.",
    "Spanish 110 is a great introductory class to Spanish. I think that it's a little fast paced, especially for people who have never taken the language before but overall a good course.",
    "I gained a rudimentary ability to read, write, speak and listen to the Spanish language."

   "comments": [
    "I had a wonderful professor who really helped me understand the material. Even when I made mistakes she would correct me in a way that didn't make me feel bad. The only weakness I can think of is that some of the homework assignments weren't that helpful. I would have liked more exam practice in class.",
    "The course is interesting and highly interactive. You do many partner activities and have a lot of opportunities to practice speaking in class. However, for those that are just beginning to study Spanish it can be difficult at times to keep pace with grammar lessons. It would be nice to spend an additional day reviewing some of the more difficult concepts.",
    "My professor was amazing. The course packet and textbook were useful but the cost of the textbook is prohibitive for some people.",
    "Stephanie was very helpful in preparing us for exams.",
    "The strengths of this course are the curriculum and how it is taught but the weaknesses is the fast pace it is taught at",
    "It was a fairly standard introductory spanish course I found nothing particularly great or disappointing about it.",
    "The class does go pretty fast, especially with complex grammar, so you have to make sure to do all the homework every night and definitely study outside of class.",
    "I think the biggest strength of this course is the frequency with which we speak the language. I've never had a language class where I felt empowered, or even confident in my ability, to speak. I loved that I felt able to speak in this class, even if it was incorrect 90% of the time. Also, having it every day is incredibly helpful in this endeavor. Finally, there was a variety of activities in the class, which made it enjoyable and a class I always looked forward to. Perhaps trying to find ways to make the classes a little smaller would give each student even more individual time to speak and learn."

   "comments": [
    "This is one of the easiest and most fun classes you can take. Spanish can be fun with the right professor and a group of good students!",
    "If you want to learn Spanish definitely take this course. It is interesting and a great option to satisfy the language requirement. You will have assessments throughout the course so there is no final exam or specific midterm. Even if you do badly on one of the tests (I got a C on the first one) it isn't very difficult to end the class with an A. If you haven't taken Spanish before, you can make it easier on yourself by studying as you learn new concepts instead of only just before the test. Office hours were also very helpful for specific concepts I was confused about.",
    "I would definitely reccomend this class. I did not think I would enjoy learning another language but I loved it.",
    "I would recommend this course. Stephanie is a great teacher. She grades fairly. :)",
    "I would recommend the course because of the help they offered and how they went about teaching us was fantastic",
    "To someone trying to learn spanish from scratch yes",
    "I highly recommend this course. It is a decent amount of work, but I really enjoyed my professor and section and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes I would recommend it! The daily classes and homework can get a little tedious but overall its a good course.",
    "Spanish is a useful language, which is why I switched over from my high school language of French. I thought it would just satisfy one of the requirements I had to get done, but surprisingly enough, it was one of my favorite courses of the semester. Not too difficult, but I still felt like I was learning a lot."
