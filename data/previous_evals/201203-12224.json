    "This seminar is about as obtuse as its name suggests. It's both a good and bad thing: you can make it mean mostly whatever you want it to mean, but there's also not a ton of structure (hah!) to the class itself. Professor Sussman is REALLY nice and warm but he unfortunately lectured for about 90% of every single seminar, and the only people who spoke in class were a few of the overconfident (read: sometimes annoying) grad students and one obnoxious (read: obnoxious) undergraduate. It wasn't a class I really looked forward to being at every Monday. Sussman also scheduled an extra section on Fridays -- this on top of a Monday 3:30-5:20 class, which felt like a lot to ask for out of students. However, the reading list is excellent and if you are willing to put in the work to both arrive at class on Mondays with your own full reading and interpretation good to go AND to then process his, and compare it to the garble your graduate student cohorts are spitting out (some are brilliant; some are not, and it's sometimes hard to tell if someone is smart or just full of it). Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this to an undergrad.",
    "I would recommend a course with Dr. Sussmanwithout reservation to anyone I respected."
