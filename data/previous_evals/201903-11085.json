    "Deep understanding of adaptive approaches to climate change through a lens of justice and equity. Comprehensive overview of contemporary topics in climate change adaptation and multi-level structural change, community-based participatory research, stakeholder engagement, and future directions in climate change policy and research.",
    "I learned about global health in the context of climate change adaptation, different adaptation mechanisms, along with how to evaluate equity, sustainability, and vulnerability in settings.",
    "I learned about the ways in which climate change will affect the health of humans on this earth. We learned to critically analyze papers discussing various types of adaptation to climate change with a focus on how they can improve\/hinder health.",
    "I learned a lot about the framework of environmental health and all of the important work going into it. This class focused on the research happening in health adaptation in climate change and the limitations and strengths of the studies we read. There was very little focus on the policies, but i felt like I got a solid understanding on the differences between adaptation and mitigation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is its seminar format. The weaknesses are 1) the course packs too much material for such a small amount of time (the course was scheduled for once every week), 2) the professor could have provided more constructive criticisms in the assignments and feedback mechanisms for the course to make sure that students adequately grasped concepts.",
    "This course was new, so I felt that certain assignments\/methods of teaching could have been more clear\/organized, but the course overall was great! For someone who wants to go into this field after taking this class, I am saddened that there are so few courses like this one taught at Yale. Prof. Whittaker exposed a new topic to students that should be focussed on so much more than it currently is.",
    "In this course every class follows the same format. We did a recap and then discussed the readings every class. The articles we read were interesting and the class discussions elevated my understanding of the material, but it made class sometimes feel a little repetitive"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Prof. Whittaker is a great professor with a very deep understanding of and personal stake in the topics at hand. The readings are super interesting and the course is well structured to explore these topics.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in climate change and global health studies academically. However, if this student wants to engage with these studies in a practical setting, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the material! This subject is pretty niche, so most students in the class come in with some background in public health or environmental studies. They're also pretty passionate about the material. Nevertheless, this material is incredibly important so take the course if you're at all interested!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the climate change and health. It gave me a wealth of knowledge and assigned some landmark studies about climate change and health."
