    "I would highly suggest this class to someone else. Professor Winter is one of the best professors here.",
    "Do take this class if you're junior or senior history major (others are unlikely to get in) who is genuinely passionate about the craft of research, writing, and doing history. Don't take the course if you're looking for an easy seminar, are unwilling to do the work, or have no interest whatsoever in the First World War.",
    "The course changed the way I study and interpret history. The paper required for this seminar is an excellent opportunity to prepare for the senior essay.",
    "Take it. This course teaches you to think in a different way.",
    "It is a combination of military and cultural history of the First World War. Military first, cultural second.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Best history seminar at Yale. Each week you get to explore and debate a different area of the historiography of the Great War under the tutelage of one of the world experts in the field. Professor Winter also does a very good job maintaining the level of the discussion in the class; section \"idiots\" will not survive this class."
