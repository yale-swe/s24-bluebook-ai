    "It's a continuation of fall DS HP but the texts are a lot more interesting.",
    "Yes, good base for future studies in western history and politics",
    "This course, like all DS courses, has a heavy load of reading. However, if someone is interested in studying basic Western political philosophy from the Renaissance onward, they should consider this course. Professor Engelstein facilitates each discussion by assigning a team of students to the reading. This team combs through the reading for discussion questions and summarizes the ideas of the author. Oftentimes, this is also accompanied by historical context. I found this generally informative and helpful, and I would recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in political theory and philosophy.",
    "Overview of western canon history.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is seriously interested in humanities. I think this course can develop my reading and writing skills to a great extent.",
    "An interesting class whose readings were sometimes dry, but mostly manageable and often very cool (Tocqueville, Nietzche, Rousseau and Marx ... all fantastic!). Professor Engelstein was fantastic, and did a great job of trying to give historical and intellectual background for the works we were reading.",
    "Absolutely! Though once again, I think after first semester DS you should have a pretty good idea of if you want to continue.",
    "Yep. Take DS if you're interested in the subject matter! The reading\/writing really is not that bad if you plan out ahead of time.",
    "I would recommend Professor Engelstein for DS. I felt adequately prepared for the final, and our class discussions were stimulating, though you will have to go beyond the guess-what-I'm-thinking mentality she sometimes has. She is also a very fair grader and gives you very specific feedback. She really puts the time into the class, even though she is extremely busy otherwise, and I really appreciated that from her."
