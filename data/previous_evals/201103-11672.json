    "The class is great, you see a lot of films you wouldn't otherwise get to see in America, along with class staples of Italian cinema",
    "Short answer: TAKE IT! The papers are well spaced and the films are legit.Long Answer:I took three film courses this semester, and Penny's director approach to film was sublime. Each week she presented a new director in the context of a particular film movement and each week I felt inspired to change my own approach to film making. Honestly, I usually don't read for courses. But after her lecture, I revisit the text to deepen my understanding.Prof. Marcus loves all things Italian, especially film. when a professor brings their own love to the subject, it's hard not to see the fire in their eyes and feel it catch on with you. However, she does shy away from the grittier, darker realms of cinema, but to each her own, right?",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in Italian cinema and cinema in general.",
    "Film Studies was a wonderful, wonderful class! Well-organized, passionately taught, thought-provoking and unforgettable. It opened up a whole new genre of cinema to me, and I'm so glad I took the class! This is a particularly great class if you enjoy engaging with your peers and professor in discussion. There is no need to have taken any film classes before\u0097you quickly get the hang of it (especially if you've ever done literary analysis). And the four 4-page papers and final exam are all extremely manageable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The movies are great, the professor is amazing and I found that writing papers about films (at least these films) actually is really fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Prof. Marcus is excellent and you learn a lot about the directors, their films, and Italian history and culture. The movies are also wonderful.",
    "Take it.",
    "YES! I initially decided to take this class to fulfill a requirement for the Literature major, but it ended up being one of the best classes I've taken at Yale thus far. I'd never taken a film studies class before and always felt very comfortable with the material thanks to Professor Marcus, who is both brilliant and a wonderful professor. The workload isn't bad at all - four four-page essays and a final. Take it. Please. Take it.",
    "Most definitely would recommend for both film aficionados and novices alike.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, even those not majoring in Film Studies. Not only are these films foundational to a broader knowledge of international cinema, they are extremely enjoyable and thought-provoking in their own right.",
    "Take it! One of the best classes I\u00b4ve taken. A great set of films. The papers might end up being longer than 4 pages each (it\u00b4s hard to write about three films in four pages) but they are all a pleasure to write when Professor Marcus meets with you to discuss them beforehand.",
    "This was overall a very good class, even if the films diminish in quality during the last half of the semester (even then the class remains interesting because of the Italian history and culture you work with). Considerable amount of paper writing with four short papers, but the reading isn't that much and overall the workload is quite reasonable. Prof. Marcus is incredibly knowledgeable and open to helping students. I'd happily recommend anything she teaches."
