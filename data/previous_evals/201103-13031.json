   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "Spanish 150 was a good class to get a lot of speaking practice. However, there is not a lot of review of vocabulary and grammar so you are responsible for having a strong understanding of Spanish vocab\/grammar already. There is a lot of reading assigned for every class, to be discussed in every class. I would recommend SPAN 150 if you have a strong background already in Spanish grammar\/vocab and if you want a lot of practice reading and speaking.",
    "yes, it's great because you only meet 3 times per week and I hadn't taken spanish since AP in junior year and I was able to catch up and be in this class without a problem",
    "go home, read something, talk about it in class. Occasionally write a response. there are some debates and mock trials that are fun as well.if you want to speak in spanish without rigorously learning more spanish this is the place for you.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to improve your conversational skills. I really felt that my Spanish speaking has become so much better since the beginning of the semester.",
    "For someone who wants to get out of the language requirement after placing into L5, definitely a great option. However, don't take it if you're looking for a challenge or a lot of intellectual discussion.",
    "Need an easier transitional L5 course from high school or if you just finished L4...? TAKE THIS ONE!",
    "This class is a lot of fun! It's basically involves just having interesting conversations with people (who become your friends since the class is so small) in Spanish. While in the beginning it was intimidating (for me at least), by the end, I could tell that my speaking and writing skills greatly improved.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to keep practicing before going abroad or something like that. I think that a literature course might be more engaging and would probably be more challenging too, but I enjoyed this course.",
    "Yes. Especially good if you took AP Spanish in high school and want to ease into Spanish after the summer."
