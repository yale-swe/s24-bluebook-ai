    "This is a rare class that's both interesting and useful. I'm sure I will use what I learned in this class again, and it's also fascinating. It contains a final project which could lead to publishable research if you do something useful and continue it after the class. Ron Smith is a great lecturer, the guest lectures are cool, and the TAs (at least this year) were very helpful.There's no final, but the project is a lot of work, so be careful about taking the class in a semester when you also have a lot of other very difficult classes. But if you can at all afford the time commitment, it's worth it.",
    "Take it. It's awesome and you learn a lot. Do not take it credit\/d because you won't end up putting as much into the final project as you want to and should and will lose some of the best part of the class this way.",
    "Observing Earth from Space was an excellent class - I would recommend it to anyone who foresees using satellite imagery for any application (studying ocean, atmosphere, geology, urban growth, land use changes, etc). The class is split into a third on physics of acquiring imagery, a third on methods in the software ENVI, and a third on applications of remote sensing (with guest lecturers. The class also has a mandatory lab (basically the only homework, but it can be time consuming. Fortunately, you get 24 hour access to the CEO lab and can work on your own time!) There's a midterm, but a final project on a remote sensing application of your choice instead of a final. Overall, this was one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale - I feel like it was one of the few in which I acquired a tangible skill set which I will definitely use in the future. Professor Smith, Larry, and the TAs were extremely supportive and helpful throughout the semester - it was great working with them!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to another student. It was a great class! I learned so much about remote sensing, which is such an applicable skill to have for many different fields, from geology to urban studies to public health to climate studies. The class and especially the final project is definitely time-consuming, though, so beware of that!",
    "This course will open your eyes to an extremely relevant and essential tool to examining a variety of environmental issues. I think every environmental science major should take it because it is so applicable to a variety of interests involving the environment. Professor Smith is phenomenal and you will walk out of the course feeling confident to use this technology even though it's an introductory course. Be prepared to work and make sure you work on your final project throughout the semester but this course is definitely worth it. This is a course that I know I will remember and use what I've learned for years to come.",
    "A good overview course of the capabilities of ENVI and remote sensing."
