    "Stat Mech II served as a pretty great guide through phase transitions and renormalization groups. I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone even slightly interested in statistical physics, as you'll benefit from Leonid's teaching and problem sets even if the course isn't specifically related to your research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another students; the theory of phase transitions itself is enough motivation to make the course worth its while.",
    "I went from knowing only very simple and primitive ideas about phase transitions, to starting to understand the modern interpretation of phase transitions.",
    "Take it!"

   "comments": [
    "I found it helped solidify my statistical physics 'toolbox', which I find indispensable. My discipline primarily deals with out-of-equilibrium systems, so while these specific systems are not what I study, we deal with systems statistically, and I can still apply these methods of thinking and solving problems to the research I do. I kept finding that I understood the language in group meetings and papers better as I continued through the course.",
    "This course gave me an understanding of large-scale systems that I didn't have an intuition for before. This will certainly be of use in my further research."
