   "comments": [
    "Yes, despite the general lack of organization it was definitely a good course and my German definitely improved.",
    "German 150 really helps to polish your language skills through a lot of writing assignments. We also had an exchange where we skyped with students in Germany and worked on a final project together with them. This aspect of the course in particular helped us become more comfortable with conversational speaking. I would say that the only major weakness of the course is that it only meets twice a week, so I felt like between thursday and tuesday I would forget most of the stuff we learned and would have to start over on Tuesday. I think that 3 times aweek would actually help with retention a lot.",
    "I had a great time and would highly recommend the course to anyone looking to improve their German."
