    "I wouldn't recommend to another student, since it's really not helpful. But unfortunately it is a required course.",
    "The department requires everyone to attend research-in-progress talks, which used to be optional but are mandatory now for some administrative reason. They're fairly annoying because of how they break up your research time every week, but at least you get decent feedback the one time a year you present.No, I would not recommend this course. But as mentioned above, that's not an option. (In fact, it's being mandatory is precisely _why_ I wouldn't recommend it; an optional one I would heartily recommend a few times a semester to see what other labs are doing.)",
    "I would recommend the class, as it is a great way to learn about other students' research and to get ideas about how to improve your own presentation skills",
    "Apparently you have to take the \"course.\" It's not a course. It's a poor attempt to make the department friendlier.",
    "Good when talks are geared for a broad audience."

   "comments": [
    "It is a good opportunity to practice talking in front of a broadish audience, in an informal way. It is helpful for your networkingand career skills. It still does not replace giving a real talk at a conference though.",
    "Deepen knowledge of discipline: It exposed me to work going on at other labs, though often in too much detail. (I am, for example, thoroughly sick of neural crest cells by this point, no matter how important they are.)Contribute to dissertation\/research: This course did little if anything to contribute to my dissertation\/research, and probably harmed it. I have lost count of the number of experiments I had to postpone because this class was occupying a critical period of time.",
    "The course is required for my degree and is very helpful for learning about presentation skills",
    "It made me even more frustrated with the politics and bureaucracy of science in academia. These professors think they know what is best for grad students as a whole and so they impart this requirement. They fail to get to know us as individuals and make suggestions for what each individual may need. The professors don't care about the students. They care about what students are writing on evaluations.",
    "Learning about other people's labwork was interesting."
