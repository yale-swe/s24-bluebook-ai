    "Looking ahead at freshman spring, I'm a little concerned that I've already taken the best class I will ever take at Yale. It's the perfect combination of the artistic and the intellectual (quite possibly the only class at Yale where you can visit an exhibit of brains in jars and have an art critique all in an afternoon) and Professor Helfand is absolutely incredible. TAKE THIS CLASS. IT\"S AMAZING.",
    "Take it! This class is amazing. It is great to have work for a class that is not a written assignment - it really pushes you to be creative. The field trips are great; not only are they very interesting, but they will also familiarize you with the tremendous amount of resources available at Yale. You will learn to see things with a new eye.",
    "It is a very hands on course but interesting and a great freshman course in that you get familiarized with many resources and people at Yale. I would recommend it.",
    "Studies in Visual Biography is a great Freshman Seminar if you're looking for a non-traditional experience. It tends to be anywhere from eight to fifteen freshmen, Professor Jessica, and a TA. Every week you go on a field trip and have a studio session, and each week you produce a piece in a Moleskine notebook to present to the class. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class, particularly if you haven't taken art before. It's a nice mix of visual \"artists\" and total neophytes.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. TAKE THIS CLASS. Jessica Helfand is one of the most accessible, inspiring and amazing teachers I've ever encountered. The classes are incredible in terms of putting you in touch with Yale's resources. Without writing a single paper we visited more primary source collections than any other freshman student, guaranteed. The classes have the perfect balance between studio work and theory. Get ready to become better art critics. TAKE IT.",
    "It is an art class in which you are given a subject and must depict it's essence in your notebook. Not sure if I would recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Professor Helfand is a captivating speaker who will really challenge the way you think visually, whether you are an art major or have never taken an art class in the past. Each week the class invites a guest artist or visits a collection in one of Yale's libraries and creates a two page spread inspired by the collection. The assignment is then presented and critiqued. The class will change the way you perceive everyday ephemera and will expose you to Yale's wealth of primary resources, from Kurt Weill's papers to the brains operated on by Harvey Cushing."
