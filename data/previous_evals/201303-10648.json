   "comments": [
    "This is a really interesting class about something I wouldn't have otherwise been exposed to in my more mainstream, less theoretical political science courses -- the theoretical nature of the topics made it a little challenging to navigate some of the reading, but I recommend learning more about collective choice theory since it's surprisingly cool and applicable to many areas of interest! Sometimes the discussion in the class was a little slow but I imagine that had more to do with the composite of students than Donahue's teaching; he is very engaging, helpful and super well meaning.",
    "Definitely helps develop clarity of thought, will help you make comments and write essays that professors like in future classes. The grading is not so hard but the subject matter is very rigorous. Brings up a lot of interesting questions about democracy that will be interesting if you like political philosophy, but the class in general is a bit boring. I definitely feel like I've learned a lot.",
    "It was a great class; take it with Professor Donahue!",
    "Yes, a great class and a side of polisci theory that most people don't think about\/learn in a lot of other political philosophy classes",
    "I would summarize EPE 220 as an in-depth look at the field of social choice theory and as a class that emphasizes students abilities to think critically about the scholarship they read. I would recommend this course; I think it's an enjoyable way to learn a lot about a significant field that many students might not be very acquainted with.",
    "A solid class on the foundations of democratic voting systems. I would recommend if you are interested in learning about paradoxes\/impossibility results, where democratic voting should take place, and how it should be justified. If you're interested in discussing democracy from a sociological perspective, the class is not for you. Most of the classes center around technical literature which exposes counterintuitive issues in democracy.",
    "This is a discussion-heavy class with a very technical focus. Readings are manageable but complicated, and it's essential that you do all of them. Donahue is very enthusiastic but classes can be a little dull.",
    "Take this class! It is a great way to learn some basic theories about democracy and majority rule. You also get a lot of practice in argumentation.",
    "i wouldn't recommend it. it wasn't a very well-structured class.",
    "The class has an interesting syllabus but you should definitely look at it to see if you're interested in the topics. Professor Donahue is nice, but the class can move a little slowly - I think the biggest factor in whether the class will be good is who else is in the class with you, so definitely scope that out. The workload\/grading doesn't seem to be bad, so the real question is just whether you'd enjoy the class."
