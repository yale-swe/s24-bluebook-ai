   "comments": [
    "A really great seminar on US-Russian relations that goes through all the major issues and regions of the world and discusses the substantive issues and differences between the perceptions, approaches, and interests of both parties. Also limited (and short!) writing assignments.",
    "This class was amazing. I recommend it to any students without hesitation. Thomas Graham is one of my favorite professors at Yale. I highly recommend going to his office hours - there is nothing like spending hours getting lost in interesting conversation. He is a fantastic mentor and friend. The course itself - albeit less than inspiring - is also very interesting and rewarding. As someone with limited knowledge about Russia, it was very enjoyable to learn about that country's history and foreign relations.",
    "Highly recommend taking this course. Professor Graham organized it very well - the class goes over a number of regional and functional issues, teaching you how to systemically think about US and Russian interests before finding areas of conflict and cooperation. The topic areas are generally very interesting and discussion is a great supplement to the reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class -- not only for global majors and people who care about the US and Russia, but for people who are interested in unpacking some of the contentious issues of our time (energy, terrorism, democracy promotion) in the context of two great world powers. Also, honestly, take the class for Graham. I did, and I'm glad I did.",
    "YES! Amazing class, great professor, and you'll improve your writing skills.",
    "If you are a total nerd for U.S.-Russian relations I cannot recommend this course highly enough. It is a must take for anyone interested in international relations and especially for those interested in U.S.-Russian relations.",
    "An overview of US Russian relations that focuses on each country's conflicting worldview and goes through a new topic\/area of potential cooperation or conflict each week. It's a very thorough exploration of the bilateral relationship that also provides a background in Russian-Chinese and Russian-Middle Eastern relations. I'd recommend the course since this has been and is becoming one of the most important international issues, and the class provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship and each country's worldview (perhaps one of the most valuable takeaways), even if primarily from the US perspective. Graham has lived the relationship representing the US and knows it inside and out. It is reading heavy and Graham is a very tough grader, but worth it if you're interested in the topic or foreign relations.",
    "An amazing IR class that managed to successfully boil down complex issues into manageable topics for lively discussion. Graham is a brilliant pedagog who kept the entire class engaged with his sharp wit, easy demeanor, and obvious expertise on Russian foreign policy. Professor Graham is probably the best teacher I've had at Yale. He is the perfect counterexample to the prejudice against practitioner professors that many students outside of Global Affairs may hold. His experience was certainly an asset, but it is Professor Graham's clear commitment to sharing knowledge and explaining ideas that made US-Russian Relations Since the Cold War so worthwhile. He is an amazing asset to Yale University and should be appreciated as such.",
    "US-Russia relations is a phenomenal seminar and should definitely be taken by anyone interested in Russia or international relations\/global affairs. You do not need to have a heavy background in Russia to excel in this course. Professor Graham has an incredible background in US-Russia relations and contacts (including some very BIG names in the Russian government) add immensely to the course experience. The course also provides for some application of international relations theory and argumentative writing. Ultimately, you will walk away from this course with a very deep knowledge of Russia, its foreign policy and relations with the US. Compared to a lot of other courses and instructors, Professor Graham offers a very balanced and nuanced perspective on Russia that breaks down many generalizations and misconceptions. Easily one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale.",
    "Professor Graham is awesome! Definitely take the course if you can get in.",
    "I would recommend this course. It explores US and Russian relations through multiple security concerns and regional concerns."
