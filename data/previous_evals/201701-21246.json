   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about older painting techniques and materials used for oil painting in history, and the effect that out could have in interpreting paintings today.",
    "I gained a knowledge of how supports and materials can be used to achieve different visual effects and how an understanding of them can help reinforce the meaning of a painting.",
    "I learned so much in this class. Even if it had only been a technical art history class, it would have easily been the most interesting art class I've ever taken. But the combination of history, science, and a sort of craftsman's approach to art (that was so much more grounded and sensible than a lot of painting\/drawing classes can be) was truly amazing. We learned how to look at paintings critically, gaging condition, quality; we learned how paintings are created structurally and materially, and how to make our own. 10\/10 most actual skills gained from a Yale class.",
    "I felt like I learned a lot about painting, how to paint, but especially the process of painting itself.",
    "Painting Materials and Methods was an excellent course that I thoroughly enjoyed. The sessions with Mark Aronson at the YUAG and BAC taught me how to analytically observe a painting. I learnt how to distinguish what materials, methods and techniques where used to create a work of art and how the painting was subsequently conserved and treated till today. I consider this new observational skill, one of the most valuable teachings of this academic year."

   "comments": [
    "The extended class period is really good for fitting time to paint, but the museum trips were very informative, and it was great really understanding the material from the readings.",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of this course (museum\/studio time) and diversity of assignments. I think doing less still lives at the beginning (maybe around 5 instead of 10) and having more time for the final project would be better.",
    "I would have been interested in reading more historical background; I thought the readings we did have were intriguing and informative. The assignments did take many hours, but were both manageable and enjoyable. It may have made more sense to do fewer \"underpainting\" still lives and spent more time on the final project, which I ended up doing in a few days, but would have liked to spent more time on.",
    "The course very much accomplished its goal. Every class clearly fit into the structure of the semester. It could be improved by clearer expectations and organization.",
    "I would suggest to start the final painting assignment earlier on in the semester. I would also try and tie in some painting exercises specific to the chosen author or painting, in order to get more out of the final painting assignment."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about the history of oil painting or wants to study under someone who has worked very closely with them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to delve into traditional painting techniques, which often aren't explored very much in the Yale art department.",
    "If you have any interest in making art or studying it, you should take this class. It changed the way I look at art in galleries and provided solid knowledge of how to create a painting. It is a perfect mix of spending time in the galleries and hands-on work in the studio, and was one of my favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "Yes -- the class was super fun and I learned a lot. At times it can be a lot of work and not always well organized, but overall I loved every Friday.",
    "I think the ability to observe a painting and understand the way it was constructed and preserved is an invaluable skill for life. Mark Aronson's explanations are very clear and concise and his enthusiasm for the topic makes even the most niche details interesting and even inspiring."
