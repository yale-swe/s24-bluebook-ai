    "Math 931 is an ambitious course that requires knowledge of basic representation theory and algebra. Knowledge of the theory of semisimple Lie algebras (as covered in Humphreys, for example) makes affine Lie algebras a lot easier to understand. Knowledge of Lie groups also helps. Though these requirements are fairly modest, the better your background, the more you will get out of the course."
