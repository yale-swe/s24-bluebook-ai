    "So...I used to think of possession pretty simply. I have some things. Other people have other things. Sometimes we share things. Then in came this class and I don't even know what to think anymore. Possession seems like such a simple concept, but taking time to analyze it deeply illuminates so many things about society, religion, and humanity.",
    "This is a course that is very hard to pin down. It is a multidisciplinary exploration of the concept of \"possession\" and how it appears in different ways in different societies, everywhere from property law to spirit possession. As a class we got better at synthesizing very different sources\/materials and being very intentional and careful with our language, examining our own worldviews and how they are not shared by everyone.",
    "I learned to think critically about possession in all of its forms: religious, philosophical, political, cultural, linguistic, and more. The contents of the course seemed a little far-fetched in the beginning, but I really began to see how its themes shape everyday life.",
    "The kind of learning that takes place in this class (most of Khawaja's classes as far as I can tell) isn't something you can pin down it's not a set of facts or concepts. It's more like a reading practice. You're pulling at all the threads the concept of possession is connected to: distinctions between being and having, persons and things, identity formation, agency, land, property, language, kinship, spirit possession. And the work of the class is building this concept web and seeing what the connections between those concepts consist of, where there are interesting tensions. So when you encounter a new work where one or two of those concepts comes up in an immediately recognizable way, the class gives you a way of reading the work through possession, a way of connecting those concepts to others that might not be readily legible without the concept network you've built. At the same time, the class is also building the skill of connecting concepts that way, of tracing recurring themes deployed in new waves over a series of widely divergent works. In that sense it's a very \"Humanities skills\" type class.",
    "possession -- in every sense of the word. spiritual possession, material possessions, love and intimacy, colonialism and slavery, what it means to have a sense of self, have feelings, have knowledge, the difference between being and having, spanning linguistics, sociology, history, evolutionary biology, psychology, anthropology, philosophy, politics, film criticism, and religious studies.",
    "I learned to consider more deeply and carefully the systems and structures that make up our existence through the mechanism of possession. I learned to question the influence of language over ideas and understanding. I learned to build an intellectual community and environment among a class in which our ideas were not competitive or self-interested, but rather collaborative, generous, generative.",
    "This class is really about exploring the idea of possession and more generally how to explore a concept deeply. One learns how to approach an idea from different fields and how to modify or refine questions according to the perspective.",
    "The most valuable skill from this class was probably a different way of thinking-- a more abstract way of approaching a question, topic, philosophy, etc. It took me a while to adjust to this approach, but once I had it was like seeing a new level of connections between seemingly divergent topics. The abstract approach ironically allowed me to have a deeper understanding of each reading.",
    "Amazing, amazing course! Over the course of the semester, we had the chance to read some life-changing, world-opening texts that challenge ideas of possession. From looking at Indigenous relationships to land that fall outside of settler notions of property to watching The Exorcist and talking about demonic possession, Prof. Khawaja has designed a course that covers so many aspects of possession. Every week it felt like we could talk for hours more about the texts and the different perspectives that everyone brings to the course. This course has taught me how to think differently, how to expand accepted ways of knowing, and critically discuss my interpretations of the text we read. We read some pretty amazing authors from Achille Mbembe to Octavia Butler and Marisol de la Cadena. The texts span from ethnographies to political theorists and we touch on issues of gender, race, economic inequality, labor, love, and more. Most importantly, you get to shape the course to match your interests and needs. The assignments are pretty flexible (keeping a journal for a week about your relationship with the idea of possession, weekly reading\/discussion posts, memorizing a passage, open-ended final project). The assignments ask you to think deeply about how possession shapes your life and encourages you to think about different ways to process what possession means to you. Through this course, I feel like you are equipped to not just start asking appropriate questions about the world around us, but also start developing some answers.",
    "It was a great course in critical and comparative thinking around one complex topic. It made me think a lot about systems of knowledge and truth production, which I hadn't expected, and it was wonderful to read from a broad range of disciplines (including linguistics, psychology, sociology, literature, religious studies, legal theory, philosophy, etc) and to try out different modes of thinking. The level of discourse was high. I questioned a lot of my assumptions, and I think the class will continue to pay off in ways I can't anticipate.",
    "This course takes everything you thought you knew about \"possession,\" broadly speaking, and explodes it. Insights are too numerous to list; \"knowledge\" as a paradigm is problematized; skills include the Khawaja way of deconstructing the world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings are often dense. There are great ideas inside of them but goodness gracious, it takes a LOT to figure out what they're trying to say. With about 100 pages a week, it was always a challenge coming to class ready for discussion and often I wasn't. The assignments are interesting and have a lot of flexibility. You can get through the whole class without writing a traditional academic paper, which can either be terrifying or amazing. I liked it. Class discussions were sometimes just us struggling to understand a reading and then Professor Khawaja summarizing it at the very end.",
    "STRENGTHS: Everything we read was super interesting, and most of it was unlike anything else I'd read in class before. Class discussions were really engaging and Professor Khawaja is fantastic. WEAKNESSES: In order to tackle possession we read such disparate material that it was sometimes hard to tie everything together or feel like there were any \"answers\" or concrete takeaways. There was also no good linear \"path\" for the course because we were coming at it from fundamentally different angles.",
    "This course was AMAZING!! It challenged me so much intellectually and the overall structure was really good. Sometimes there were too many intense readings in a single week.",
    "One of the massive strengths of this class is that it gets very deep into theory from very different disciplines without presuming a lot of prior knowledge because the syllabus is formulated to follow a set of concepts around; it's not bound to any particular canon, genre, time period, or department. And so it attracts a diverse group of students; that diversity of thinking and expertise is essential for a seminar like this. In that sense it's a very accessible class. But because many of the texts are quite dense and work with a lot of field-specific jargon, it would have helped to take more time to understand each text in its own right rather than launching straight into comparisons. Likewise, staying closer to the texts when the conversation began to stray might have been more productive than some of the tangents we got onto. The assignments are unconventional and very different from one another, which was a strength in that each allowed a different kind of thinking about possession than a strictly academic paper might (I want to say it allowed a more integrated or embodied or concrete kind of engagement, though the assignments could also be pursued in a very theoretical way). But that often meant they were difficult to get useful feedback on maybe the journal assignment especially. I might have liked more time to debrief the experience of writing the assignments as a class since so much of the thinking about possession came up in the act of writing more than in the final products. Some very specific changes if the class were to be taught again (I hope it is!): swap out The Devils for another piece on Loudon; give Dayan and Mbembe their own weeks; cut Rochat, one or the other of the Butler\/Athanasiou pieces, and one of the three mimesis pieces; and make the last class a synthesis discussion rather than doing recitations.",
    "strengths: interesting, thought-provoking, unconventional assignments and incredible flexibility in writing the final paper; similarly interesting and thought-provoking readings -- syllabus is organized well and all the readings connect to each other; topic is relevant to contemporary politics and students' personal lives. weaknesses: class time is often too short to cover everything on the agenda; sometimes the discussions or readings are too challenging or confusing to follow -- office hours are great though, prof noreen is willing to explain things patiently to you",
    "The great strength and weakness of this class is the nebulousness of the structure of its discussion. It can sometimes lead to tangents or frustration, but it is far and away the great gift of this course for what discoveries and experimentations of thought that this nebulousness leaves space for.",
    "Strengths: wonderful discussions, very interesting readings, fun and thoughtful assignments, my peers were truly thoughtful and inspiring (I think this was partly because you had to apply to the class\/write about why you wanted to take it and Professor Khawaja chose the students) Weaknesses: feedback is slow, didn't receive feedback on final assignment",
    "The discussions in this course were really, really fast paced. As I mentioned earlier, there was a learning curve for this course, and though I loved all the readings (I learned a lot even from the ones I didn't particularly enjoy) possibly some of the \"easier\" readings could start off the first weeks of the course to lessen that curve.",
    "Strengths: So many!! The texts, well-crafted syllabus, really builds on each other, constant engagement of texts from previous weeks to the next (even from the very first class to the last class, creative and thought-provoking assignments, student-led discussions, professor was an amazing amazing facilitator, free space to throw out ideas and questions, fascinating units on voudou, demonic\/spirit possession, mimesis, etc. Weaknesses: None, sometimes discussions can get a little off focus, but Prof. Khawaja always did a wonderful job bringing us back in",
    "Strengths: rich topic, great professor, highly engaged and intellectually diverse class, exciting and unexpected reading list, creative assignments. Weaknesses: sometimes the readings for a particular week felt disconnected or out of order. The reading load was high, and sometimes I didn't feel like we could really dig into the fascinating questions raised.",
    "The best part of this course was the dedication of the teacher and the engagement of the students. Everyone showed up to class week in and week out having done the readings, ready and eager to discuss and collaborate. Prof. Khawaja is brilliant and sensitive as a discussion leader, and the class atmosphere was serious but also casual. Lots of laughing. I would say the weakness of the course was that there was too much on the table in terms of readings and topics, and it was very difficult to chart a consistent trajectory through the semester. We could've benefited from more of chronological or thematic linearity, or at least more time in class to review what we had already covered and situate ourselves."

    "This is a good, but very challenging course. The assignments aren't especially hard, but the discussions and readings are heady stuff. If you're ready to do some hardcore thinking, this is the class for you.",
    "If you'd like to examine the previously unexamined, I'd say take this course. You will be surprised at how differently you think about certain things after it (or are at least are thinking more \"carefully\"). However, if you like classes with direct applications or concrete \"checkpoints\" this is not the course for you.",
    "YES!! Professor Khawaja is a fantastic teacher, and you will engage with really central philosophical questions in this class.",
    "Take this class!!! It's deeply intellectually rigorous (and fun if you like critical theory!) without being stressful with regard to grading. It engages a different kind of thinking than most Humanities classes because it's structured around a big concept rather than a time and place, a thesis, or a canon. I wanted every class to go on twice as long. It's the kind of class where students hang around after to keep talking. It's hard; the readings are dense and occasionally very dry, but the conversations make it worth it. Just a gem of a class.",
    "yes! truly enjoyed the readings, assignments, and discussions. prof noreen is a joy to talk with and I can't think of a more relevant topic.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It is the purest and best form of what the structure of a seminar can offer to a student. It is unlike any class I have taken at my four years at Yale, and I daresay my favorite.",
    "Definitely! Super interesting and thought-provoking! The discussions always left me thinking, both because Professor Khawaja is a superb discussion leader and because my classmates were very insightful. The curriculum is well-thought out and while approaching the idea of possession from many different angles, it also puts different threads in conversation with each other. A lot of reading, but really pays off. Assignments were low stress and genuinely interesting and fun to work on.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who wants a challenge. I think this course also requires some patience, with yourself and the material, so if a student is committed I think this is a great course.",
    "Yes yes!! Take any class with Prof. Khawaja! She is amazing and you will be engrossed in the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! The reading is on the heavy side, but the payoff is incredible. It's a great introduction to multiple humanities disciplines, but when I say \"introduction\" I don't mean that anything about it was easy or simplistic--the diversity of the texts led to greater intellectual inquiry. Our discussions were fascinating and made me question aspects of the way I think.",
    "Definitely! I would take absolutely anything Noreen Khawaja is teaching, and this course in particular has nowhere to go but up. Possession at first seems somewhat arbitrary but quickly emerges as a rich site to think about the problem of relating to other people and things. I really appreciated the incredibly diverse set of authors we read, who spanned a huge range of disciplines, time periods, ethnicities, cultures, and perspectives. I think Prof. Khawaja probably learned a lot from the experience of teaching this class for the first time, and she will make adjustments for the better the next time she teaches it. There is no way to go through this class and not have most of your assumptions about the world challenged."
