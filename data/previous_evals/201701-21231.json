    "The course should eliminate the materials fee. The value of the items received for \"free\" certainly did not amount to $75 and it's honestly a deterrent for many students interested in the course.",
    "I think we could do more independent work, or we could paint each other as an assignment!",
    "The course is largely unstructured, which is both a good and a bad thing.",
    "Maybe some more specific technique instruction. It's very \"learn by doing\", just really going at it with making paintings, which is good but maybe could be just a little more technical."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The class time is longer than most 1-credit courses but I feel I learned a lot over the progression of the year both about acrylic and myself as an admirer of art.",
    "If Mark was teaching it, no. If another teacher, yes.",
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely take it if you can!!!! you do need to have some rudimentary skills to get in bc it is popular. materials can also be pricey. I'm so so glad I got to take an art class here. I hope they offer more sections of painting basics in future. as opposed to intro painting, it is truly geared towards beginners. I found it really engaging and learned a lot about the way my brain sees things in space. it was a great outlet to be able to really focus in on something for a few hours every week.",
    "Definitely take the class if you get in! The workload was super nice - you're just painting in class and you don't even have homework. You finish off the semester with a batch of awesome work! The only thing was that Mark didn't really give us as much feedback as I expected, but at the same time it let us really just do our own thing, which was nice.",
    "No, not unless you are confident that you are already good at painting. Cause you won't learn.",
    "Yes"
