    "Great lecturing & great reading materials I wish there were more discussions of current events and how these relate to the course materials. More carefully designed in-class discussions and group work will help, too.",
    "Pogge is a world renowned professor who is very intelligent and gives very good lectures.",
    "Pogge was an enthusiastic teacher who was willing to help the students improve, but the class didn't really encourage participation from the students despite the fact that it was such a small lecture (5 undergrads) that had a lot of potential for engaging discussions. So I wish that the class was more engaging."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is an underrated class. You get to learn the philosophical foundations of many political debates. Those foundations are very important yet rarely discussed in my other history and political science classes. Prof. Pogge is a world expert and solid lecturer in the topic. He cares about students and always gives helpful feedback. The workload is slightly heavy but totally manageable and not unreasonable. The exams may be a little difficult. But overall, given the contents of the class and the strength of the teaching, I would highly recommend at least shopping the class if you are interested in philosophy and its relationship to our current debates in international affairs and social justice.",
    "Any student interested in serious philosophy or political science would probably benefit from this class.",
    "This is a good class if you want to know about the basics of moral theories and how they apply to important global issues such as global poverty, inequality, health, and just war. Pogge is a good teacher who cares about his students. However, student participation in the class was very minimal and there was very little discussion during class even though it had the potential to be a very engaging class given its small size, and this was a very big disappointment."
