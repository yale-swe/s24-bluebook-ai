   "comments": [
    "We discussed the poetry of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne in the context of their lives and time periods, often comparing the techniques, styles, and tropes of one author to another.",
    "As long as you have at least a moderate interest in English, then yes, take this class! I came into it with the mindset that I would struggle through Chaucer and co. (having not enjoyed them in high school), but being in Professor Minnis's class really changed that. This was the course I was most excited about all semester!! It is a wonderfully opportunity to think critically, write creatively, and learn from both the classic texts and the many commentaries that are read\/discussed in class.",
    "If you're looking to take ENGL 125 because you don't already have a strong background in analyzing poetry, this might not be the section for you. Professor Minnis is absolutely wonderful, and I wish I had done a better job of taking advantage of his wealth of knowledge and insight over the course of the semester. That being said, his section spends very little time helping students gain mastery over techniques and elements of style that differentiate poetry from prose. Nonetheless, a good introductory course - especially given Professor Minnis's strong commitment to feminist theory!",
    "I really liked the course overall. I didn't think I was very interested in medieval literature or had any pre-existing interest in the poets on the syllabus, but I really ended up liking the course. I think my writing improved a lot, and I really liked discussing the themes of the course. I would definitely recommend taking it with Prof. Minnis if you can!! he's really funny and kind, willing to help you with your writing as much as you go in for help. One of my favorite courses here because of him.",
    "The course is really lovely and a lot of the syllabus is great, but I had hoped that it would be a bit more serious\u2026 more of a nuts-and-bolts introduction to verse, meter, and scansion and so on. We didn't really have that, although Professor Minnis is wonderfully charming in a happy and gregarious sort of way. You won't be stressed or bored if you take the class with him, but you may not come away fully knowing about Spenser's rhyme scheme and meter, etc.",
    "Obviously, this is a prerequisite to the English Major and therefore you are probably taking the class for this reason. A lot of the students were kind of intimidating because they are alumni of the Directed Studies program and therefore can relate every piece to Plato or Don Quixote or some random philosopher\/obscure piece from the western canon. However, the class was very interesting and challenges you. Don't be afraid to contribute to class discussion! Professor Minnis is very nice and make sure to go to office hours to discuss your ideas. I often felt like I couldn't handle what was going on historically to adequately support my ideas."
