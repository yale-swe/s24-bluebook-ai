    "ENGL 114 28 is a great introduction to academic writing, revolving around an interesting and pertinent topic. I would recommend the class to another student because it both improves writing skills and critical thinking.",
    "A great writing course that will very much improve your academic writing. The course load is heavy but manageable.",
    "This is a wonderful introductory English class.",
    "I think(know) most chose this course because they've read too many dystopian novels in high school ad are fascinated by the worlds described in them. But this time you are going to ave to your own claims and not just summarize another's work.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 114 to another student because it helps adapt to college level writing. I personally believe the course description for section 28 was a little misleading because not all of the course revolved around utopias, instead in it revolved around how people think about utopias or defining utopias."
