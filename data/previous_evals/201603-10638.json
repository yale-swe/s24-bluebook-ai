    "This course is advertised as having a greater emphasis on math, for people who have little or no experience with calculus - however there really isn't that much of a greater emphasis or explanation of the math involved. Though this didn't turn out to be a great issue, it still would have been beneficial to focus a little closer on the math behind the concepts.",
    "Strengths: as a seminar it is a good atmosphere to ask questions. Weaknesses: we should dobmore practice problems in class.",
    "Professor Simons is very difficult to deal with and makes everything more complicated than it has to be. She has an undefined grading system that she determines depending on how she feels that day. The class started with 12 kids, ended with 6 - 6 people dropped it.",
    "I understood the conceptual aspect of microeconomics. However, I had trouble when expected to use math to come to conclusions."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who felt that they wouldn't do well in a big lecture, because the small seminar format enables you to make sure that you understand each concept before moving on. However, the content is a little dry at times and the very small size of the seminar may not be for everyone.",
    "I chose this course because I had not taken calculus in high school and was told that this would be the class that would help me with the math behind microeconomics. While this class did focus a lot on math, I feel as though the concepts behind the math (you find a tangent line, you use basic algebra, you compute derivatives a couple of times) wasn't something that I needed a lot of help on. Because of the time we spent on the math, I don't think I learned as much behind the concepts. Simons is a fine professor, though her reliance on graphs to explain concepts really left me lacking in an understanding. She obviously is very bright and knows the material, but I think at times she has trouble breaking it down on such a simple level.",
    "Don't take this course with Professor Simons - She is very difficult to deal with and your grade will never be concrete!",
    "Yes. I course gives great insight into why certain decisions are made. This includes the decisions of people as well as firms."
