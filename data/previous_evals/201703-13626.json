    "I learned a lot about the methods of research and investigation used by historians in fields outside of the early modern period. Not all of them can be applied to my work, but I have definitely found some that will prove beneficial. I also learned about some of the major works and ideas in history that I had previously been unaware of.",
    "Introduced to a wide variety of historians, methods, and key questions regarding the discipline of history.",
    "A broad grounding in historiography outside my subfield. Working with a wide spectrum of secondary literature was very thought provoking and offered me critical distance to reflect on the purpose of our discipline."

    "I'd like to see some more works of pre-modern and early modern history on the reading list.",
    "Strengths were getting to know others in the cohort and having space to explore methods\/thinkers I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise. Cons were not getting to know everyone, but I found the smaller class better in terms of overall conversation.",
    "A core strength was the \"introduction assignment\" in which each participant chose a book of central importance to their respective subfield. I felt that this was a very effective means for each of us to get to know one another's work. In the future maybe this assignment could be expanded so participants could present on a secondary source and a primary source of central importance to their own research."
