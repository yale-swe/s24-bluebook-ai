    "YES! This is such an amazing course and it is one of those courses that are \"Yale\" courses: where the education you get here is unparalleled and completely unique to this university. You learn from multiple different lecturers about their research and experience with autism and the practicum placements (observing children with autism) are where all your classroom learning is complemented. Furthermore, since autism is quite a prevalent disorder and often clouded by bad media coverage and improper facts, its so useful to take this course and learn more about the disorder in general (especially if you are a non-psych major), a good life lesson from a Yale course. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this course!",
    "Wonderful class. There is a good mix of students with\/without a psych background, with\/without a specific reason for wanting to study autism. As someone with a background in bio, I was a little surprised by only one class really exploring the biology of autism (the genetics lecture), but it was also good to hear a lot from the psychological\/neuroanatomy perspective. The workload of this class is very much manageable - the only big assignment is a paper (free choice of topic) at the end. The mandatory practicum component is a weekly 3-hr commitment, but it's a pleasure to go to, and you barely remember it's for a class.",
    "Half the class covers many different aspects of autism. The other half allows you to experience being in an environment with autistic students. It's such a valuable class for people who are genuinely interested in the topic.",
    "A good class, though only if your'e genuinely interested in autism. The professors are great, but they only give a couple lectures--the rest are visiting lecturers.",
    "Amazing course that brings in leading researchers and leaders working in the field of autism to provide a comprehensive look at the various issues involved in the disorder. You hear about recent genetic, computer science, neuroscience imaging, and treatment findings as well as hearing about plans from leaders on the social policy and education fronts--and some of these findings and plans are barely released into public knowledge before you learn about them. You leave the class with an unmatched grasp of autism as it is understood by experts at the moment and feel confident that you can address misconceptions about the disorder still heard in everyday news. I was at Benhaven Residential and my practicum placement was amazing, mostly because of the amazing staff that trusted me enough to teach my student with my own project. Although the lectures are extremely challenging because you learn about leading researchers in the words of the researchers themselves, your only major assignment is a long research paper on a topic related to autism. This makes the workload light, but also puts a lot of pressure on your to write a good paper.",
    "This course is great! Not too much work, but excellent professors and material.",
    "This class was okay. The lectures were alright, but the practicum portion was excellent.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have the opportunity. Every week there is a lecture about autism from a different perspective: language and communication, imaging, EEG, eye-tracking, evenpersonal accounts. You also have a practicum placement in a school or home for individuals with ASDs, probably the best part of the class. The class is a great way to develop a comprehensive understanding of a very complex disorder."
