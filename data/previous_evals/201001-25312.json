   "comments": [
    "Yes. Even if you are not too comfortable with Spanish, I would take this class. Prof. Gonzalez-Echevarria was always making sure everyone was on the same page. The material itself was very interesting, and it didn't involve too much work. You have to keep up with the reading, which is not too difficult, and there were only three 2-page assignments, one midterm, and a 4-page final paper on short novel.",
    "No -- unless you can stand the professor's huge ego and repulsing conservative politics (which, of course, completely shape how he teaches Latin American history, politics, and literature).",
    "It was interesting, but don't expect to learn about culture like religions, daily life, holidays, food, sports, and music.You cover a little of music and sports when you talk about Cuba, and there's some art when you discuss Mexican muralism, but mostly it's just a bunch of famous latin american readings.",
    "This was the first semester the class was taught so it was slightly less structured than it probably will be in the future, but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a way to work on compositional Spanish. The grading is kind, but I still felt that my writing improved significantly.",
    "It's an interesting class, but not one in which you can keep up your speaking skills.",
    "When taught by Professor Echevarr\u00eda this course is a light and interesting course on literature, NOT culture. You are assigned important and interesting literary excerpts and he lectures about the history of the literary pieces. Down side: Not much room for discussion throughout the course."
