   "comments": [
    "Would recommend to EE majors or CS majors who wanted to understand signals\/systems",
    "Yes, take this course if you seriously want to learn about Electrical Engineering. It's well taught and you'll learn a lot, both in the lab and through the homework.",
    "Its a good continuation of 200 and it teaches you, with practical labs, the basics behind these circuits and systems.",
    "Touches on the major points of circuit analysis. Good refresher from 200.",
    "Good overview of basic principles invovled in circuit design",
    "This is the quintessential intro electrical engineering class. It combines elements from 200, 201, and 202 and presents them in a way that's clear and easy to understand. I now feel ready for more advanced courses thanks to this class.",
    "EENG 203 teaches students how to analyze circuits using differential equations, fourier series and transforms. Take it if you have to, but you won't get a whole lot out of it.",
    "This is a great class that covers a lot and is very interesting. Prof. Tang occasionally will get bogged down in the math or proof of a concept and will forget to explain it on a high-level. I wouldn't recommend it for non-majors.",
    "EENG 203 is a circuits analysis course -- you'll do tons of math to analyze \/ solve circuit questions analytically. The labs are actually fairly fun, too -- and relevant to the material! This is one of the more fun circuits courses."
