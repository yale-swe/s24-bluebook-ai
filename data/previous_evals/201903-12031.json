   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about two theorists who repeatedly show up throughout art history and whose theories and aesthetic agendas it felt necessary to better understand as I move forward in the discipline.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of labor and capitalism in Victorian Britain, expanded\/rethought my knowledge of Ruskin and Marx, and had ample time to think about the connection between art\/capitalism\/labor\/industrialism on both metaphorical and literal registers.",
    "I developed a strong understanding of both Ruskin and Marx's writings and a richer knowledge of 19th-century art and political history.",
    "I had little exposure to 19th century art history and criticism before this course - I took in namely because I wanted to learn about the main topics (as articulated in the course title) and also better understand the era, despite it being outside of my research area.",
    "This course tracked the parallel lives and overlapping thought of John Ruskin and Karl Marx. I gained insight into how similar some of their thinking is, as well as how art may have influenced their aesthetic and political ideas."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "At times it felt the discussion could have focused more on the connections between Marx and Ruskin, which sometimes felt like an afterthought. But at the same time, uniting the two theorists was a great strength of the class which allowed us to evaluate the relative progressiveness of each theorist through the other.",
    "I really appreciated the emphasis on primary texts and close looking at objects, both of which felt much more productive and insight-provoking than reading through the eyes of other scholars. That being said, I would have liked to read a couple more secondary texts to add a bit to the already lively discussion.",
    "I appreciated the entwinement of German and British material and the interplay of texts from Marx and Ruskin. I sometimes wished for more secondary literature that might have deepened my engagement with Marx in particular.",
    "I thought this was a great course. I had hoped wed talk a bit more about Marx in context (or perhaps theoretically bridge Marx and Ruskin more frequently) but I felt as though Prof Barringer did. a good job of selecting readings and leading discussions.",
    "The syllabus for this course is well organized and clearly illuminates similarities and differences between Ruskin and Marx. I found weekly discussions to be fascinating; Professor Barringer is great at emphasizing the historical and cultural contexts through which we should understand the readings. I think that future iterations of the course might put more pressure on the contradictions present in Ruskin's writings. How can we track what in Ruskin's thought remained constant, and what may have changed?"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! It was an excellent primer on both theorists.",
    "Absolutely - this was my favorite course this semester. I found it enriching from historical, social, aesthetic, and moral perspectives. The class encouraged me to think across geographies - from Germany to England - to understand just how entangled major ideas, writers, and movements actually are. The readings are great, as was the field trip to Boston!",
    "Yes, for any student interested in the period or the material it is an excellent and engaging course.",
    "Yes, I would. Particularly to a student who similarly had different research interests, but was interested in the material and Th contextual backing it could provide.",
    "Yes. It was fascinating to think about how two incredibly important figures dealt with similar subject matter in totally different, but oddly resonant, ways."
