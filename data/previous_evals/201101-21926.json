    "This is a fun, non-stressful class about London.",
    "Definitely recommended. I didn't know anything about London\/wasn't really interested in it, but he's a very nice person that will guide you through the material. However, some familiarity with London, especially with streets and some overall English history, would be infinitely helpful.",
    "HIST 229J is a solid overview of the social history of London from 1560-1760. There is a great emphasis on primary sources, which is key practice for senior essay writers in the major. For the most part, readings were pretty interesting (although sometimes repetitive). Discussion sometimes lagged, but Professor Wrightson does ask great prodding questions to stimulate discussion...so don't be afraid to be the first one to speak up! Professor Wrightson is also a leading scholar in the field so definitely take advantage of that as you work through paper topic ideas. Workload is not too heavy and you have a lot of leeway in terms of what you want to discuss for each assignment. Definitely recommended if you enjoy this time period of England\/London.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in the city of London. The first few weeks are a bit dry, talking mostly about birth\/death\/immigration rates of the city, but then it gets a lot more interesting. Not too much work, one 5 page and one 10 page paper, and then a short presentation in class.",
    "This course is a great introduction to demographic\/social history of the early modern era in London, taught by one of the most well-known social historians of this topic. The student will delve into some incredibly exciting primary sources-- like the racy diary of an upper-middle-class naval administrator from the 1660s-- as well as important and clever secondary sources. This course feels like excellent preparation for further study, a thesis, or graduate work. While I am excited about the subject matter-- as were most of my classmates-- social history in the early modern era struck many of my friends as incredibly dull; although in this class you'll learn great skills as a historian from a leader of the field, it will be easier if you're passionate about the topic.",
    "I personally didn't enjoy it that much, but I think thats because I only took it to fulfill a major requirement. For someone really interested in London, it could be very edifying.",
    "I would absolutely recommend early modern London. Keith Wrightson is a delight -- his colorful anecdotes on London really took discussion to a higher level. He is also simply one of the most approaching professors at Yale, with some of the best advice when it comes to research, a senior thesis, or general life plans. The workload for this course is very reasonable -- a five page paper, presentation, and final term paper rooted in wider historiography. Although this is not the standard fare for a junior seminar, I walked away with a much better grasp of how to perform social history, a skill that will benefit me next year as I set about work on my senior thesis. I also really enjoyed our class sessions in the Beinecke and Yale Center for British Art, which gave our class some hands-on time with primary resources from the period.If you are looking for a rich experience in social history, and are even slightly intrigued by London as a lens through which to view wider trends in the early modern period both in England and wider Europe, I could not recommend this class more. It may not have the glamor of some other seminars, but it is definitely not one to miss.",
    "Not my favorite class, and discussions could get slow, but if you're really interested in the material you'll like it. A fantastic pre-industrial option for history majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this junior seminar to my fellow history majors, and this is one of the history seminars that would also be great for non-history majors. It is not the most demanding junior seminar, so it is possible to take this as one of two junior seminars in the same term. Some topics are more interesting than others, though that really depends on the student. Paper guidelines are loose and flexible, though sometimes more structure would clear up some of the ambiguity. Prof Wrightson is excellent, and his British sense of humor makes the discussion.",
    "My favorite part of this class was learning how to work with challenging source material--how to reconstruct the demography of early modern London using parish registers, bills of mortality, and other documents.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The work load is manageable and you learn so much about a very interesting city."
