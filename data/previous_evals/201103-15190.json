   "comments": [
    "It is a class that requires putting in hard work but it will be fairly considered and appreciated. If you are not going to do the reading. don't bother, but if you are willing I highly recommend this class to anyone from any subject area.",
    "really great class. interesting and unusual discussion, i always learned something interesting from the reading and it expanded my perspective on identity and the political sphere. Professor Onoma was great at leading dicussion,and his personal stories were both entertaining and illuminating. the workload is pretty light, some weeks you just have one short article to read, although you do have some weeks where you have to read a 250+ page book. don't let that deter you though. the only written assignments were 5 short papers (reading responses) which were often helpful to stimulated discussion. When reading week comes around you will thank yourself for picking a class that doesn't have a final or a final paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who is interested in the issues of identity politics, ethnic\/racial conflicts, individual identity formation, and socio-political group identities in the era of globalization",
    "The best seminar I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, great class if you like discussing what labels mean to people and others.",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic course taught by a brilliant and engaging professor. Prof. Onoma knows how to stir up classroom discussion while offering direction when necessary and where relevant. We were also fortunate to have an incredibly intelligent cohort. The students were eager to engage with the material, and there were quite a few graduate students whose considerable backgrounds in African Studies provided additional academic weight. If Prof. Onoma comes back to Yale after his sabbatical, I recommend this course for anyone interested in assessing identity formation, postcolonial studies, or ethnographic and intellectual engagement with the complex African cultural landscape.",
    "Great course. Amazing professor. If you're interested in Africa or identities or just want really interesting and intellectual class discussion in a laid back seminar atmosphere, take. Take take take.",
    "The class provides a critical analysis of human identity. It explores African identity, Caribbean identity, anarchist identity, genocide and conflict studies, and modes of conflict resolution. I recommend this class to anyone and everyone.",
    "Lots of different reading about identity formation in Africa - which include topics of miscegenation, race purity, hybridity, etc.",
    "Definitely a class worth taking."
