Has an incredible depth of subject area knowledge (theories). Is a pleasant person to chat with. Improvements: Mostly related to delays in getting feedback back for weekly assignments, not sure this is specific to Myles, but its tough to expect us to submit responses on-time without being provided feedback in a timely manner as well.",
    "Instructor: Myles Benjamin Lennon \u00a0Myles was a great addition to the lectures. He asked poignant questions, and often clarified difficult theoretical concepts in class. I was grateful that he was there to assist me with my paper and other questions I had during the course. Thanks so much Myles!",
    "Instructor: Myles Benjamin Lennon \u00a0Myles often helped to facilitate conversation and discussion in the class, sparked discussion when necessary by asking questions or asking for clarification about students' comments, and gave a great talk in the session he taught which led to an animated engagement."

   "comments": [
    "The weekly readings are incredible, and thought-provoking. The lectures and discussion as well.",
    "I found the readings well-suited for my summer research project, and they changed the way I think about development and the nature-culture dichotomy present in environmental discourse. I also thought Professor Dove's lectures are brilliant and allow you to step outside your linguistic and thought frameworks to view issues from a deeper, historical perspective. Thank you Professor Dove for a thought-provoking class.",
    "The best aspect of this course is its invitation to engage with facets or dimensions of how environmental concepts of which 'natural disaster' is just one are framed, inform policy and practice, and are used and interacted with by different agents. It allows for a deeper and more critical exploration of what environmental management means and the social and political relations within which people take action upon and within the environment. Classes like this one a crucial for those students who are at FES to think about the environment, development and environmental relations in a way that is historically informed and interested in what previous thinkers and scholars have had to say on these subjects."

   "comments": [
    "The amount of reading varies tremendously from week-to-week, it would be helpful to flag the weeks that have a heavier reading load early in the semester (I know I can do this on my own, but it would be less time to have one or two flagged). There are many folks at FES who could benefit from this class - there are entire classes on resilience, and most students have never heard that this class is offered, or don't think to look for it. I've emailed readings from this class to many different students for various projects. It's nice to have a 10-12 person class for discussion, but think it could benefit from being closer to a 20 person class with people who don't spend their whole time thinking about anthropological perspectives.",
    "The coursework is intense. I loved the readings, but often found myself wishing for more time to dedicate to the readings and literature we were engaging with. It was a bit intimidating to speak up in class when other students were discussing topics in anthropology that they are more familiar with. I hope that this can be improved in the future; we all come from different backgrounds and not everyone has a background in anthropology. It would be good to create an atmosphere where there isn't a level of intimidation in the course.",
    "The readings could include more material from different sources and be more inclusive and 'up to date' in terms of including pieces by scholars and people of color on these same subjects. The 3 guest speakers too could have represented more diverse viewpoints, perspectives, and backgrounds."

   "comments": [
    "The discussions were mostly good, although they are still a little abrupt. Perhaps a recommendation would be to offer discussion leader guidelines. One discussion class I had asked students to say 'this comment relates to your previous comment,' or something to that effect to create a conversation instead of a collection of thoughts. The tough part is that most of us spend the whole time processing and thinking that it's hard, or there's an unwillingness to think through discussion. Instead, the discussions tend to be people advocating points instead of asking questions for clarification or understanding. Not unique to this class in any way."
