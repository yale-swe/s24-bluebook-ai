    "This course is very important to someone planning to specialize in condensed matter physics. For anyone pursuing other paths, I would not recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to others because it is really useful.",
    "Yes I will recommend the course.",
    "If you have to take this class, then hopefully there is a different instructor. If not, I suggest skipping class and just reading the text; it's a far better use of your time.",
    "The course is overall worthwhile in that the material presented is very useful. I believe that it is imperative that to learn enough from this class though, lots of supplemental and independent reading are necessary.",
    "I would say this is a helpful class if you will do research in the applied physics area. But you should pay a lot of efforts yourself. Sometimes you cannot understand in the class, so you should read the book carefully after class.",
    "I would recommend it; however, the student has to be able to be extremely self-motivated and keep up with the reading very well or else you will instantly be lost."

   "comments": [
    "I took this course hoping to learn more about semiconductors and how they apply to detectors. I certainly learned a bit about this, though I don't know if it was worth an entire course.",
    "I thought it was a good overview of solid state, but I don't feel like I developed a depth of knowledge in any of the topics covered.",
    "This course greatly deepens my knowledge of my discipline, and it helps a lot in my research.",
    "The part on optical properties and plasmonics will help me with my PhD research.",
    "In order to pass the final, I taught myself the entire course by reading textbooks. In that sense, it enhanced my knowledge.",
    "It gave me excellent theoretical understanding of solid state physics, which is what my research will be focused on. It covers the basic background and tools that all solid state researchers use well.",
    "This course does not have direct relation to my future research. But I think the knowledge this course covered is very basic and important that each of the physist should know a little bit. From this point of view, I would say through taking this course i got my purpose.",
    "I am sure that a good solid state background is essential for understanding materials and any physicist should be exposed to it. I feel that I have a good start on this, but I think that most of it can be attributed to reading I did on my own during the class."
