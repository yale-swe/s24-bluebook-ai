    "Evolutionary biology indeed teaches you about evolution, but it's so much more than that. You learn so much about the mechanisms for evolution, all the factors affecting life on earth that we know of so far, methods for speciation on phenotypic and genotypic levels, and so much more--and yet you realize you're only scraping the surface of a giant biological iceberg. And if you're not an E&EB major, it's really important to learn this stuff because the implications of evolutionary theory can be applied to so many important things like medicine and cellular biology and all that stuff. I guess the only piece of advice is if you're not well-versed in basic evobio already, then you should probably read the textbook sometimes. In any case, if you want to call yourself even a little bit educated about biology, this is the course you wanna take.",
    "The lectures can be interesting and the topics are very engaging. The tests are deceptively hard though.",
    "Evolutionary biology is a wonderful course that will make you so much more passionate about life on this planet.",
    "If you're looking for a good evo class, look elsewhere to any of the upper E&EB level classes. Many are less difficult, more interesting, and way more enjoyable than this torture of a class.",
    "Only take this class if you're REALLY interested in evolution, or have to take it for your major. It is best taken Freshman or Sophomore year, as the class is taught more towards that demographic, and taking it as a senior EEB major, I felt I wasn't learning much that I hadn't already studied in another class. Light workload (just 2 midterms and a final paper), but you have to know a LOT of specific nitty-gritty details for the midterms.",
    "This topic is the reason I chose E&EB, and the class definitely lived up to my expectations. I learned a lot, and felt the class was very well organized and the expectations were fair. I came away with a big sense of accomplishment upon completing the course and feel it will improve my understanding of all future E&EB classes. That being said, don't take this until you've done the intro Bio sequence (i.e. not concurrently) as a lot of the material is covered quickly and they expect that you know it already.",
    "If you are interested in understanding the field of evolutionary biology I would recommend this course. It is a good overview and the workload is reasonable for an E and EB class.",
    "All biology students should take this class! It's fascinating stuff, the class isn't too much of a burden, and the professors are both good lecturers. Plus, like Dobzhansky said, nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution. It's really important stuff regardless of whether you want to be a doctor, and ecologist, or a molecular biologists. And don't just take it from me - Stearns will convince you of that fact! My only warnings are that it is an easy class to slack off in, but it will come back to haunt you. No one will hold your hand, and suddenly you'll be faced with a midterm that seems very hard. But if you are engaged and keep up with reading, you'll have no regrets.",
    "Yes, it very interesting but the tests are fairly difficult",
    "I don't think I would recommend EEB 225 as a class for fun, but it's a pretty good requirement course. It's not grueling work wise but beware, the exams are tough!!",
    "I would recommend Evolutionary Biology to any student, really, whether you think you are interested in biology or not. This course will teach you a lot about ways to view the world, humanity, healthcare, and more. Prof. Powell and Prof. Stearns are both good lecturers, and Prof. Stearns in particular is very committed to (and rather effective at) actively engaging students.",
    "Take it if you're interested. It probably won't enthuse you about the topic if you don't already like it at least a bit, but Prof. Stearns's lectures will definitely be awesome and you might discover which aspects you really like.",
    "This class was one that introduced and expanded on many topics of Evolutionary Biology including population genetics, speciation, evolutionary medicine, human evolution, and genetics. Coming in with a strong biological background I felt bored by the class and like the workload was minimal. I also felt like the lectures followed too closely the textbook which kept me from doing the readings feeling like I could either go to lecture or do the readings. Hope this will change in the coming years. The team teaching aspect of the course takes a bit to get used to and Professor Powell and Professor Stearns use very different techniques and styles which is hard to get used to. Professor Stearns really makes you work and think hard about the material, allowing time for questions and discussion. Professor Powell just lectures along with the textbook and it can be quite dry.",
    "E&EB 225 is an interesting course, and I think it's very valuable to learn. However, it is very challenging - don't take it if you haven't taken BIOL 104 first!! Stearns is a great professor, so if he's teaching it, I would highly recommend it.",
    "Hope that Dr. Stearns co-teaches this class again; his lectures on evolutionary medicine and human evolution are great because he is the foremost scientist working on them. Be prepared for a lot of genetics in the other material. If you're not an EEB major but interested in ecology\/evolution or looking for a science credit, I would recommend one of the organismal EEB classes, e.g. terrestrial arthropods, ornithology, ichthyology, etc. Those cover many of the big themes in ecology and evolution with less of the straight-up math and theory. If you do need to take Evo Bio as an EEB major, though, look forward to it!",
    "Evo Bio teaches you a wealth of relevant and fascinating information in the two very different styles of Professors Powell and Stearns. It can be a lot of material to keep up with, but if you prioritize it as one of your two most important classes and actually read the book, you will enjoy your experience!",
    "Evolution is a very pertinent topic for science in today's world and it is also extremely interesting to me. That being said, this class isn't always extremely engaging and lectures are posted online, so by the end of the semester I was often tempted to sleep in or work on other assignments. But I personally found the material (not lectures, exactly) very interesting and it tied into my future career. Not sure what you'll think...",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably for your major. I wouldn't really recommend it if you don't have a strong science background or are looking for an easy science credit. However, if you're doing it because you have to (elective or required course), fear not. It's actually pretty good (I know that doesn't sound like a glowing review, but lecture courses like this can be hit-or-miss). You get an overview of a lot of different elements of evolution, its applications, and current areas of research. There are two exams (they tend to be pretty long, though), no final exam, and a ~10pg paper. Doing the reading isn't essential, but definitely does help a lot. Prof. Powell is really nice, though can be a little disorganized in his lecturing style sometimes (goes off on tangents, but interesting ones). Prof. Stearns is a bit intimidating, but really smart and great at breaking down hard concepts. Overall, you'll get a fair bit out of this course, and learn some pretty cool stuff.",
    "As someone who was not particularly excited about this subject initally, this class was a welcome surprise. The professors and TAs were great, and the course content was organized very well. Additionally, these were some of the fairest exams that I have seen at Yale so far.",
    "I would recommend. I thought that the tests were not great representations of knowledge and the paper was a bit of a challenge, but it was an interesting class overall."
