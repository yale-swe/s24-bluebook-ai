    "I took Italian because it fit into my schedule. I started this class with little to no interest in the language, and after one semester I am determined to become fluent. This was a phenomenal and fun class, and I learned so, so much. Everyday I left the class feeling like I had made tons of progress. If Papallo teaches this class in the future, don't hesitate to at least shop it - it was a great experience.",
    "I don't think you can go wrong when it comes to Italian 110 professors, but take it with Papallo--he's great! Clearly knew what he was doing as a professor but perhaps more importantly was extremely enthusiastic about wanting you to learn the language too. Honestly the class went by more quickly despite meeting every day than a lot of my other courses. As you'd expect with an L1 language, there are regular evaluations in class of your writing and speaking abilities, and all were very fair, I thought. Overall, it was great fun--grazie Professor Papallo!",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian to another student. I don't really like language but this is a pretty nice language that is relatively easy to learn. Especially coming with a Spanish background in high school.",
    "Italian 110 is an awesome elementary class. It gives you a strong foundation for the language, while not overwhelming you with small details and a lot of work.",
    "Yes. It is quite a bit of work to keep on top of all the vocabulary and grammar; however, it is very fun and worth the time you put in.",
    "If you find Italian interesting and have an ambition to visit Italy, take this course; you will be speaking Italian in no time!",
    "It's more work than I think 1.5 credits deserves, but I like knowing that I can speak and read and write basic Italian sentences. Learning the language is definitely easier if you have a background in other Romance languages (especially Spanish!!) or Latin. If you don't have any particular reason to take another language, choose Italian!"
