    "Psych 627 is a great introduction to infants research. Dr. Wynn does a good job covering all of the \"interesting\" topics like altruism and discrimination in children, while at the same time opening your eyes to other aspects of infant cognition that you might not have otherwise thought of, like minimal groups in children and bullying behavior."

    "This course was my first (and only) course in developmental psychology and it was extremely useful in opening my eyes to an area of psychology that I had previously understudied. In addition to the content knowledge I gained from this course, it also taught me new methodologies one can use in psychological research and helped me understand new techniques that I may be able to use to answer some of my own research questions."
