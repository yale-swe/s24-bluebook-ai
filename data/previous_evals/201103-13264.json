   "comments": [
    "Ach works to provide creative assignments and learning tools for the class with a good mix of group work and individual work. The class was fun. Additionally, I learned a lot in the class about a number of health issues in the developing world. The set up the class is excellent in terms of readings and it is apparent a lot of thought went into organizing the class. The class could be improved by allowing discussion on the topics. This was my favorite course this semester.",
    "The course had very interesting and stimulating material. The case studies involved in the course, although sometimes frustrating, were very effective in helping us reflect on lecture topics and concepts. The grading seemed fair and as objective as it could be.My only suggestion for improvement would be to include just a small amount of mathematics and\/or modeling to provide a slightly more quantitative aspect of the material.",
    "The course was a good overview of global health financing and economics. The readings were really enjoyable and I particularly enjoyed the case studies. Sometimes lectures seemed to be a review of the readings, which became boring and repetitive.",
    "Our evaluation of current literature on major global health issues was not only fundamental but proved to be an extremely helpful tool. However, we could have chosen to analyze some papers in greater detail in class aside from doing the referee reports. More guidance could also have been provided for the policy paper including clear indication of expectations.The case studies were interesting and effective in eliciting critical thinking to address enhanced uptake of interventions.",
    "The course was a good overview of global health. A lot of topics were covered and a lot of new knowledge was gained. The required 5 case studies became a little daunting and the group presentation seemed unnecessary and did not add much to the course.",
    "To be honest, I feel the course's name is confusing, at least it confused me. I though I will be exposed to a lot of economic concepts in the course, but in fact the course is more like a seminar discussing the delivery of health intervention in developing countries.",
    "Strengths- The breadth and variety of the topics covered-The reports we had to write-The pressure free environment of the classroom teaching-The ample opportunities for team workWeakness-The TA was slow at grading the refree reports- and thus i did not get timely feedback for the referee report.",
    "The course was very interesting and had a great syllabus. However, I don't believe it was structured very well. The readings were very interesting but instead of really discussing them and going into greater death the lectures usually simply summarized them and the major findings. More could have been done to add to the readings rather than just reiterate them.",
    "The course was good and covered a wide range of topics.A few thoughts for suggestion, mainly on how to deliver the course:1. Structuring class on a weekly basis around 3-4 papers creates an atmosphere of a literature club rather than a global health economics course. Instead, separating the delivery into teaching rigorous theoretical concepts illustrated by journal articles and practical examples might make the learning experience richer2. Assessment through mainly literature review activities further adds to the feeling of this course being a \"literature club\". Picking up howto review a given article is certainly valuable, applying this as the one learning throughout all assignments feels a bit monotonous.",
    "This course was amazing in its approach of thinking of economic\/social solutions to public health problems around the world. The style of the course was wonderful: hands-on problem based learning really helped me to think through problems and figure out how to address individuals' needs in a practical manner.I feel the course could be improved by having less group based assignments. While they were enjoyable, it took a little bit more extra time to complete just because you were working with others.",
    "Though the class was a little slow, I learned a lot about global health economics that I hadn't previously known. It provided a good knowledge base for how international health functions.",
    "This course was pretty interesting. I enjoyed learning the economics of global health issues, and some of the topics discussed in the class were very interesting. However, the class could have been structured in a better way, and the assignments could have been more spread out over the semester. But overall, I liked the class.",
    "I think it was an excellent course. Each topic is not covered in that much detail, but that is necessary in order to get a broad introduction to issues in global health. I feel that I am coming away with a sense of the global health scene that I definitely didn't have beforehand.",
    "strength: good class interaction with fellow studentsweakness: lectures not very interesting, no real-time feedback of our assignments",
    "This course provides a good background in issues regarding public health issues in the developing world, interventions which have been implemented to address them and the economic realities which must be taken into consideration.The weaknesses of the course are that it could be more discussion based and that feedback could be provided in a more timely matter.",
    "Very good course. Provides strong knowledge for those interested in working in global health."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Strengths: Ach is very approachable and clearly wants to keep the class interesting. He is also very supportive.Weaknesses: Upon asking questions, Ach sometimes seems hesitant to have a dialogue on the topics which is unfortunate because he is really smart and I don't feel like we were able to take enough of his knowledge and mix it with ours. I think that is just something that professors develop in time though.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Prof. Adhvaryu was very helpful and made the class very enjoyable. He seemed very nervous at the beginning of the course, but as the semester progressed, he really enhanced his teaching style and became more personable.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Professor Ach was quite chill. He gave us good feedback on our work and made sure the class was fun. But as I mentioned before, sometimes the lectures seemed to be a summary of the readings and I wish that we could have talked more about the overall concepts instead in class.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Professor Adhvaryu is very knowledgable about global health issues particularly malaria. Overall, he has the ability of garnering students' attention. He could try using other teaching methodologies besides powerpoint lectures to make the class more interactive.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He was a great instructor with a lot of knowledge and ability to make topics interesting. Perhaps it would have been helpful to think of other innovative ways to teach the material.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Dr. Adhvaryu is well-prepared for the lectures and I can tell he made a great effort to make the course more enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0strengths- See qeustion 6-Also he was really cool and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Professor Adhvaryu was very knowledgeable and engaging but could have structured lectures differently. By simply going through the readings and main themes, it made doing the readings before class irrelevant. It would have been a much richer class, though it was still very educational, had lecture been used to supplement the readings rather than simply summarize them.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach was a good instructor. One senses he is committed to getting the concepts across, covered a wide range of topics and put an effort in to engaging the class on a weekly basis.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach is an amazing instructor! He challenged my ideas about how to address certain public health problems and exposed me to new ideas.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I really enjoyed Ach as a Professor. Once he got more comfortable with us as a class, it was an enjoyable class to sit through. He presents the material in a friendly, understanding way.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The instructor was knowledgeable in the field, and selected interesting topics to focus on in class.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He is so lovely. Friendly, approachable, and clear in his explanations. I really liked him. No weaknesses to speak of.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I wish he could make the lecture less dry.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The instructor provided great information on the subject. However, lectures could be a bit standardized. It was much more interesting when he went spoke of personal experiences.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He is very nice and seems very open to meeeting with students."

    "I would suggest this course if you are interested in learning about a wide range of challenges, diseases and factors affecting health in developing countries. I would recommend it to anyone interested in global health.",
    "This course contains a great introduction to significant topics in global health economics. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in learning more about global health issues and potential economic improvements that can be made.I would not recommend this course to someone who wants a highly quantitative\/analytic approach to solving global health economic issues because the course material is much more focused on concepts\/broad guidelines than it is on solving math problems.",
    "Good overview of basic global health concepts. Not so econ based as the title suggests and the only econ you have to know is when you do the readings. Take it if you want to know more about global health in East Africa and South Asia.",
    "The course overall is incredible and a wonderful choice for global health concentration.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course. It is informative and interesting.",
    "If you like to know some health delivery facts, choose this course.",
    "A great, informative and interactive course that provides a glimpse of ways to study, analyze and measure health outcomes on a systems level.",
    "Okay, although a good elective to take with other core courses.",
    "Interesting material, however, I personally feel not having been able to extract as much out of that course as the title \"global health economics\" suggests. The learning is quite one-dimensional focused on reviewing journal articles associated with a global health topic. I would have appreciated more theoretical grounding and some more practical examples of how to translate interventions - not just for publishing - but also for real impact.In summary, this course is not necessarily one I would recommend.",
    "Global Health Economics is a course for students with interests in global health irrespective of their background. It draws upon current research occurring throughout the world to evaluate the economic underpinnings behind various public health interventions.",
    "Not recommended",
    "If economics of global health interests a student, then they should definitely take the class. The class covers a variety of topics and issues in the field of global health, with some interesting assignments like in class presentations on latest research papers published in the field.",
    "A introduction to global health that doesn't go too deeply into any one issue, but does give a good overall sense of the state of the discipline the challenges it faces, and concepts that reappear in different areas. I would definitely recommendit.",
    "I would not recommend to fellow students since I feel like I did not learn much from this class. The structure seems messy and there is nothing new was touched. Contents were almost all common sense.",
    "One of my favorite courses, very interesting for those interested in working in global health."
