    "This history of France class covers important topics- the French Revolution, Napoleon, and much of the 19th century in France. Merriman gives interesting lectures and section is helpful and not painful. You can probably get as much out of this class as you put in, and if you are willing to study for exams a little and write a decent paper, you can easily do well in the class.",
    "Professor Merriman is a wonderful lecturer and more importantly, he cares deeply about his students. If you are considering this class, take it; you will not regret it. The exams are really straightforward and the paper is completely open-ended.",
    "This is John Merriman's French history, how could you not take it?",
    "If you're interested in the 19th century, take it. Expect a lot of social history, the lectures are fun, and not a lot of work. If you're not interested at all in France or this time period, avoid it, because it will probably get boring and repetitive for you.",
    "yes. a good class to learn about a very important and interesting time in history",
    "Recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student if you have any interest in revolutionary France. The French revolution is a critical tool for analyzing all other revolutions that came after it. It might seem like Prof Merriman's lectures are scattered and uninformative at times, but you will actually walk away from the class realizing that you know so much about the topic.",
    "Amazing.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is simply soul enriching. Although at first sight this class may seem to cover a long period of time, it is nevertheless in-depth and considers events from multiple different social and cultural perspectives. This allows students to obtain very detailed knowledge of why events transpired and a very intuitive feel for the times. Professor Merriman teaches this class passionately and his enthusiasm is infectious. I always looked forward to attending this class and hearing him speak. The TA (Mattie Fitch) and professor are also both very accessible on email and outside of class so students can get feedback and help quickly. The sections for this class integrated seamlessly with the class itself, both challenging students to consider events from different perspectives and reinforcing knowledge. I left this class with a very deep understanding of French revolutions and my perspective of history changed."
