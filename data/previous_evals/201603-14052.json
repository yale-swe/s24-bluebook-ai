    "We learned about network formation models and estimation techniques.",
    "This was my first proper introductory course on networks. I was exposed to a vast amount of network literature in a systematic manner. The class discussions were extremely fruitful. I also learnt a lot doing the independent class project. The assignments were not too time consuming yet required us to do lot of useful background reading.Overall, I think this course was extremely useful."

    "We received a broad overview of networks-related research, so we have a good jumping off point for future research in the area. Some of the ideas were lost on me, however, because the concepts were far beyond my current general understanding of marketing models and techniques (e.g., I have not yet learned about structural estimation for example).",
    "It is too condensed. I think this course can be extended to full semester.",
    "Strengths- Comprehensive syllabus well-compiled for an introductory course in networks.Faculty was highly involved and well-prepared for all sessions. Areas of improvement- We had less time overall, probably it could be a full semester course. There was less time to receive much feedback on our submissions."
