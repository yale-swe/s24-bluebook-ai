   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY.",
    "TAKE THIS. So much fun, super interesting. Its comedy very far from the verbal wit so you needn't be some great stand up comedian for this class. Its all about your ability to adapt and figure out how to make something work.",
    "Yes!!! Take this class. The most fun I've had at Yale.",
    "Cool class with lots of opportunity to fail and learn from failure. Comedy is hard, and this kind of safe environment is very important. It's a very physically based class. The clown work was fantastically fun and very fruitful for me.",
    "Comedy in Performance is an exploration of the theory and practice of comedic performance. Readings in Henri Bergson, Simon Critchley, Jacques Lecoq and others inform class work. It's also a master class in taking outrageous risks and accepting failure with grace.",
    "An intensely physical look at the mechanics of comic technique. In a rather untraditional way, this course is quite demanding.",
    "TAKE IT! YOU WILL HAVE SO MUCH FUN!",
    "I really enjoyed this class! Daniel Larlham is hilarious and warm. The class is both theory based and practical. We explore why things are funny and then work on various projects, including a cascade, analysis of a \"funny moment\" (usually a youtube video), and a clown project. This is less about traditional actingDaniel is great and really funny. He clearly cares about his students and has a playful mood that is infectious.",
    "Take this class. Absolutely. Hands down. It is the most fun I've had at Yale, but you will also actually learn things about how comedy works and what we find funny. The highlight is, of course, the clowning section, but the entire semester is just a great experience.",
    "This is a very fun class. Daniel is lovely. He is great at provoking students to do exciting and daring things. You will play a lot of games, discuss some theory of comedy, do some comedia, and a fair amount of clowning."
