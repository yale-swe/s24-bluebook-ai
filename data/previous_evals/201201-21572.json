    "If you're interested in short fiction, this class is definitely worth taking! You read an amazing number of stories, and learn a lot about Latin American culture in general. There was also a really diverse range of experience with Spanish\/Portuguese in the class (so if you haven't taken these languages, don't be turned off by this!) Professor Moreira is also a cool lecturer.",
    "The class consists of regular readings, reading responses, and two essays. The material is really engaging for anyone who appreciates fiction, and Professor Moreira's lecture are quite informative. I would definitely recommend this class to any incoming freshmen.",
    "Absolutely. I thoroughly enjoyed the class, and even though it was at 9 in the morning, I always looked forward to it.",
    "Take this if you're interested in Latin American fiction, or even fiction in general. The stories are all really good, and I enjoyed reading them. Be prepared, though, to have a lot of reading--you'll either need to spend a lot of time doing it, or let some stories fall through the cracks in order to get the work done. There are three papers--they're not that bad, and the topics are completely open, which is exciting, but challenging. Paulo is great--he's really helpful and engaging. Sometimes the seminar was a little lecture-y, and sometimes it was disorganized, but we often had really great discussions. I recommend this!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in short fiction\/literature. Especially to any latin americans wishing to expand on their knowledge of Latin American literature (especially because of the Brazilian side to the class).",
    "The readings are a lot of fun, and I would definitely recommend the class if you like short fiction. I thought we'd be reading a lot of Cortazar and Borges, but there was a surprising amount of Brazilian fiction as well, which was really, really good.I would definitely recommend this class, but it's not really led as a seminar. Professor Moreira mostly lectures, with occasional pauses where he asks the class questions with (relatively obvious) answers. He is very accessible, though, and is happy to get to know his students outside of class! If there's anything that catches your interest, definitely go talk to him."
