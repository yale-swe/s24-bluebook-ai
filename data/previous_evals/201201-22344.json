   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the class. I think the main weakness of the course was that there were too many students enrolled. Anything above 20 is too many students for this type of seminar and I think it detracted from the depth of discussion, especially at the beginning of the course. Other than this issue, everything was good. The book was very good at providing a background, the additional readings were decent. I sometimes was at a loss for what to write on the paper topics but the comments were extremely thorough and very helpful (though never very positive). Shelly is great. His understanding of the issues is flawless and he is amazing at explaining complex issues and restating students' arguments concisely and clearly. He was always available to speak after class and to meet for office hours.",
    "Be prepared to work very very hard but at the end of the day, you will be intellectually rewarded.",
    "Yes. Take the course. Don't be afraid of the grading. Honestly, if you put any effort into the papers at all, you'll receive about the same grades that you would in any other class. If you put no effort into the papers, you'll receive far lower grades. So, put some effort in, and you'll have no trouble. And don't let Shelly's reputation as a harsh grader keep you from taking the class because, after you're done with it, you'll feel like you learned more than in any other Philosophy class at Yale.",
    "Take it if you're interested in philosophy. Please refrain if you haven't taken any.",
    "Very enjoyable and engaging philosophy course. Shelly does a great job leading discussion and bringing out some interesting topics of debate. Sadly, the limited time frame meant that a lot of material was only covered in a superficial manner. I certainly was able to refine my own thoughts on the subjects at hand and identify topics for further examination, but Normative Ethics is really only a starting point for philosophical exploration.And again, you should seriously consider taking this course just for the chance to toss ideas back and forth with such a sharp professor. You'll be so much the better for it.",
    "Shelly's intellect is incisive and brilliant and knows the field like the back of his hand. The course provides a framework for thinking about normative ethics, which is awesome. Scary grading is real - Shelly's expectations are much higher than anyone else you've ever had, probably, and hard work is insufficient to meet them - only combined creativity, clarity, and coherence will do. Take it anyway, and meet with him as much as you can - he's very willing and it's worth it. Be humble going in, for you'll leave humble either way.",
    "Take it Credit\/D and only if you won't stress out too much about the odds of getting a D or an F on your first paper.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you're afraid for your grade (which you shouldn't be, you can start it Credit\/D!), this class is totally worth it. My thinking and my writing improved SO MUCH as a result of this class, and Shelly Kagan is the best philosophy professor I have had at Yale. He asks you to explain your own ideas, not just comment on the ideas of other philosophers, and the experience is incredibly valuable.",
    "This is a seminar in Ethics which has a moderate reading load (usually part or full chapter from Shelly's Normative Ethics textbook) plus one or two famous papers in ethics to complement. One can probably get by in the course just reading the chapters from Shelly's book but this is stupid because the papers aren't incredibly hard, are very thought provoking and interesting, aren't usually terribly long, and the point of the seminar is to DO ethics not to sit at a table together once a week and contribute nothing, or less-than-insightful comments. Nevertheless, it is probably possible to get by if you already have a knack for philosophy writing.For something where you get more from Shelly than an intro ethics class, but perhaps not a back-breaking experience of a more graduate-student-heavy seminar, Normative Ethics is a great class, which will make you a better thinker and writer no matter what you do. Highly recommended.The workload is not that great but DO NOT leave papers of the the last minute. For a 5-page Shelly paper, allot yourself the time you would give for at least a 10-15 page paper for most other classes.",
    "I would recommend that everyone at Yale takes this course. It teaches you how to reason ethically, and since this is important whenever we think about life's big problems, I think knowing Normative Ethics and its model of approaching problems is an invaluable skill for life. The course will also teach you how to write ethics philosophy papers - which are their own beast.Shelly is a great professor. Though you might feel intimidated to speak as Shelly is able to pick apart any argument, Shelly really wants all of his students to engage with the ideas. So speak up! - as long as you think beforehand, read before class, and don't bs, you will be fine. ... Indeed, participation is worth 1\/4 of the grade.I would be wary of the grading. I would take this credit\/d if you can. If you do really bad on the first paper, Shelly will take that into consideration though.",
    "Kagan is a brilliant professor, and normative ethics is his cup of tea. This class is definitely worth taking. However, Kagan is a notoriously difficult grader, and as he says, he does grade with the FULL RANGE of possible grades - meaning he will shell out Ds and Fs if he sees fit. He asks for a very particular type of essay from you as well - he expects you to straight up philosophize without referring to any external sources, and will often rip you apart. Definitely not for the faint of heart, take this class credit D and you won't regret it.",
    "A good course, that gets right into the heart of normative ethics, stripped of any dependence on the work of single philosophers, however prominent they may be. This is important: your essays cannot be replies to others, but must be original though from first principles."
