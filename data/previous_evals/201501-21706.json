    "I would recommend this class to a student who is willing to put in the effort: that means attending the lecture, reading the chapter, and putting in the effort on psets, even if the answers are available to you via the answer book. This class is demanding, but it is interesting, which I found made it worth the effort.",
    "lots of reactions and mechanisms to memorize, especially near the end.",
    "Only take it if you are required to",
    "I would recommend this class to someone again, but with serious reservations about Professor Miller unless he actually listened to student recommendations. He has the potential for greatness, but he could really use the student evaluations to make this class something great.",
    "CHEM221 is a good followup course to CHEM220 - a bit more challenging, but still doable if you put in the time and effort. Professor Miller is great, and you'll learn a lot about organic chem.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you had to take it since it is very difficult.",
    "As I'm sure you've seen from reading comments on this class, there's a pretty big split between the people that think Orgo 2 is the best thing since sliced bread and the people who think that it was a soul-crushing ordeal of obscurity that was only useful so that they could pass their MCAT. I tend more toward the sliced bread camp, but not without good reason. First and foremost, Scott Miller is a fantastic professor. When he is lecturing, you can really see that he is in his element. He seamlessly integrates interesting tangents into his lectures and only casually lets on that he is one of the top names in his field, graciously presenting his work and other relevant current papers to a class of undergraduates who don't realize how lucky they are. Even beyond Professor Miller, the course material was generally interesting. I really enjoyed all of the reactions, as this was a huge step up from Orgo 1, which mostly taught skills of how to think about reactions, mechanisms, along with some fairly basic reactions. By the end of 221, I felt like I really had a grasp on the material well enough that I could apply learned concepts more generally to figure out reactions that I had never even seen. Don't get me wrong, it's still a memorization-heavy class that requires a lot of work, but I felt that it was super-rewarding and a must for anyone who is seriously looking into doing any sort of biology, chemistry, or medicine. I doubt many people take this class without being pressured by either premed or major requirements, but I really do think that it was a worthwhile experience and I feel that given enough time for you to understand the material, you will too.",
    "Orgo is orgo; you'll have to put in a lot of work for this class. If you are deciding between freshman and sophomore orgo, be sure to shop both classes before deciding -- especially take a look at each professor's teaching styles. Scott Miller is a great lecturer and engaging professor. Tests will be hard; Miller's tests are also more theoretical and cover more than just synthesis problems. Overall though, it is a great course, and you'll learn an incredible amount from it!",
    "Continuation of CHEM 220 - nothing like CHEM 230. Three midterms, four quizzes (one is dropped) and a final. Overall, just your typical orgo class. Expect the curve to be generous and push through when you're wondering why you're pre-med. Also, Dr. Miller is great!!!",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise avoid taking it with Professor Miller.",
    "Difficult but fair. The exams force you to really understand the concepts behind what you learn instead of just memorizing reactions. Professor Miller is great, so definitely take it with him if you have the chance.",
    "A hard but rewarding course",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Difficult class but mandatory for pre-med track",
    "If you have to take it, then this class is manageable. Pay attention and take good notes.",
    "You probably are taking Chem 221 because you have to. I think the course highly depends on who's teaching it. If you have a professor who is organized and presents the material in a coherent way, I think organic chemistry, contrary to popular belief, can be definitely challenging, but also legitimately engaging and interesting. If the information is presented in the way it was this year with Prof. Miller, with just tons of reactions and names of reactions being thrown at you and homework that does not reinforce what you learned in class, then expect to have a bad time.",
    "They don't lie when they say CHEM 221 is much more focused on reactions than mechanisms, as in CHEM 220. Doing well in the class (with Professor Miller) means reading the text (Chapters 13 through 23 of Loudon were covered, although the initial syllabus planned to cover the rest of Loudon on biochemistry) and paying careful attention to what Professor Miller deems important during lecture. The exams rarely tested mechanisms in any detail, and often covered a few concepts that weren't fully explored in the book or lecture (i.e. one or two questions out of five). Since the course goes through so many reactions, it's important not to get lost in the details of mechanisms (especially in the book) and to focus more on organizing all of the reactions learned (such as a table) as you go along in the class. As a fundamental science, I would recommend the course, although most students taking the class are obviously STEM majors and\/or premed.",
    "You should know what you're getting into with this course. It's very interesting and practical, but also challenging",
    "Absolutely not, I would not recommend orgo 2 to another student. But if you're reading this you probably don't have any other choice, and also why are you reading reviews for orgo anyway? Something I can recommend is to try as much as possible not to take orgo 2 with Professor Miller. His lectures were confusing and disorganized and went way too fast for our TA's or us to keep up with. He assigned problem sets with problems we already had the answers too, which was a) not helpful and b) useless because our tests problems were almost never like the book. He also inevitably got behind so we were doing problem sets about concepts we hadn't learned yet. He did not communicate with students well (ask anyone about the \"dropped exam\" debacle) and frankly just didn't seem to make our class a priority. It was a really stressful and unpleasant experience for me and other orgo students.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who does not need it for a major requirement or who is not pre-med. It is a difficult course that requires a lot of work and focus.",
    "CHEM 221 is challenging but will give you a much better understanding of how chemistry works, and its implications for biology and pharmaceuticals, which I found very interesting. Be prepared to work towards the end of the semester, because the chapters are loaded with information.",
    "It's a very hard class and you should only take it if you have to. Also make sure you're taking it with a good professor (Miller was good). This is NOT a class you can take with a bad professor",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys chemistry or wants to be a doctor. I would do so because the material is relevant and interesting and because it is taught well.",
    "Much struggle, much learning, much reward. It's much.",
    "Obviously you're only taking this class because you have to for premed or your major. It's very hard and not particularly interesting, but it's survivable. Good luck!",
    "Obviously, only take this class if you have to. The problem sets are based on completion which is nice, but it makes it easy to fall behind. Three midterms, four quizzes and you can drop only one quiz. The final was surprisingly not as brutal as some of the midterms.",
    "Second semester orgo is more difficult just due to the fact that one has to memorize more reactions than ever before (especially towards the end of the class, with ~50 reactions in 3 chapters). As long as you keep up with the material and do many practice problems, and understand the basis of WHY these reactions occur (rather than just rote memorization of them), you will succeed in this class.",
    "Harder than 1st semester orgo",
    "This was a pretty stressful and difficult course. I am not intending on being a chem major, so I battled through it with little interest toward the material. Professor Miller was a great instructor, but the actual course material just made me zone out of lecture. You probably have to take it anyway so I wish you the best of luck. Its just a big roadblock to your future, but one that can definitely be overcome.",
    "It was a good Orgo II course. It was a pretty good balance among molecular orbital theory, acid-base theory, reactions, mechanisms, and biochemistry connections, although we weren't tested on the biochemistry; it was just out of interest. It moves quite quickly in classic orgo style. Professor Miller is a good professor. He is clear and approachable - go to his office hours! He's a really nice guy. And as much as it sucks, go over your reactions and mechanisms the day you learn them, and preferably a few times a week. It will make your life infinitely happier when it comes to the quizzes and exams.",
    "CHEM 221 is a difficult course. It is the continuation of the first semester of organic chemistry. It is definitely challenging but surely rewarding. I learned a great deal about chemistry and organic chemistry while taking this class!",
    "Put in the time to get the results. Harder than first semester, but interesting material. Assuming you have to take it, stay on top of it and you will be fine.",
    "CHEM 221 is hard. I wouldn't take it unless you have to or really really want to. You should be able to teach yourself a lot of the material from a textbook and should know how to reach out to the TAs for help.",
    "Chem 221 covers a lot of information about a lot of different reactions, but with a good problem solving background from Chem 220, it actually feels sort of manageable. If you attend lecture and do the readings, it ends up being pretty fun and, although the tests are difficult, it is not a lot of work other than studying.",
    "I like chemistry so I guess I'm biased, but most definitely take this course. I loved it. It's a great feeling, knowing how and why and in what exact way non-useful things can be turned into synthetically useful products. It actually does give you a greater appreciation of all things chemical.",
    "Good class, pretty much what's to be expected after the first semester. Extremely time-consuming. Don't take it unless you have to or you have a passion for organic chemistry. If you do have to take, Scott Miller was a great teacher and you should try to take it with him!",
    "A general organic chemistry course. I would only take it if you really had to, or if organic chemistry is interesting to you.",
    "It is like Orgo I, but more about reactions.",
    "Yes, yes, you'll hear that second semester Orgo is dreadful and that it will kill you, but if you have an incredible Professor (Scott Miller), a great TA, and stay on top of the material, you'll end up loving it! I'm not a science major, but this was my favorite class this semester. Scott Miller knows how to teach. He is organized, throws in comedic digressions into lecture, explains the material is a clean, simplified and easy-to-follow way and makes those 50 minutes in the morning fly by. Also, he is casually an Orgo God who helps Merck Pharmaceutical make anti-cancer drugs, but still manages to be really down-to-earth and friendly during office hours, even when you asking him stupid questions. (Also, he gets brownie points for also casually being a varsity cross-country runner in college - literally he's good at life.) If you take Professor Miller's advice and copy your notes from lecture each day, read the book, do practice problems on Sapling, and make a sincere effort to understand reactions, mechanisms, and important trends (i.e. acidity), you'll surprise yourself! And at the end of it all, you will be sitting at the final exam and you'll know how to synthesize ibuprofen (how cool is that?!). Literally this class is actually pretty great! IF you need to take it, don't worry, it's going to be more than fine! You might end up actually enjoying it.",
    "I would recommend this class, and I'd recommend taking it with Miller. You won't regret taking 221 in the semester that he teaches it. Keep on top of reactions (they'll come at you fast), do problem sets with a friend, and you'll do fine with it. If you like patterns or reactions or aromatic rings doing cool things, you might even enjoy it! A word of advice: I found the textbook for this class really helpful, and if you're a person who likes to see mechanisms for reactions or likes to have reasons behind reactions explained, you probably will too. There are a lot of new reactions in 221 and they can go by very quickly in lecture.",
    "Most students take Chem 221 because they have to. That being said, Chem 221 is not a bad course! It is definitely challenging and requires a LOT of work outside of class to keep up with the material but is doable.",
    "If you're looking at reviews, you probably have to take orgo anyway, but I did like the class, especially with Scott Miller. Do not cram for tests - study for a long time in advance and you'll do well.",
    "Great course - Prof Miller is an engaging lecturer, and the material is a lot more interesting than Orgo I. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Hard but you have to just try not to get behind"
