   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a great course. I strongly recommend it to students who are interested in cell biology.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student. It gives a general and systematic introduction of almost all the major field within biological sciences. very helpful",
    "This course is a solid overview of the field of cell biology. I would highly recommend it if you are looking to brush up on your cell bio knowledge or are looking for the opportunity to think critically about how you would answer biological questions in the lab.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking CBio 602.",
    "I would summarize it as a challenging introductory cell biology course for graduate students that gives a good overview of historic and current advances in a diversity of fields. I would recommend it to a fellow student, but only if they had previously taken a cell biology course in undergrad or had extensive cell biology research experience.",
    "Required and boring",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great overview of cell biology.",
    "This course goes beyond simply memorizing signaling pathways in the cell. Each lecture focuses on a single pathway and, in addition to describing its mechanism, highlights the experimental and logical steps that were taken accrue our current understanding of that pathway. The class doesn't necessarily broadly cover every cell biology topic, but instead focuses deeply on a distinct set of topics, usually directly related to the lecturer's field of research. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. I would describe 602 as a review\/introduction to the main topics in cell biology. Sometimes the level of detail was a little overwhelming, since there were topics I had not studied in depth before, but the course was very useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student since the course provided a great overview of the molecular and mechanistic aspects of cell biology that would serve as useful foundations for graduate students.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend CBIO602 because we covered a broad array of topics. However, I think small assessments such as quizzes would have helped me retain information better.",
    "Straightforward class, informative on subjects, but since so broad have to look up interesting subjects on own. Sure, best when coupled with 603 seminar course. I found that taking both really helped understand 602 topics. Strangely, the 602 discussions themselves were not as helpful as the 603 ones.",
    "This is really a good course in which we can learn a lot about Cell biology. I would recommend CBIO 602 01 to another student.",
    "Wonderful introductory course to cell biology with an awesome group of lecturers who are world leaders in their field. I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in learning basic cell biology.",
    "Nice class to touch up on cell biology. No exams but lots of homework."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course broaden my knowledge in the field of cell biology in general. It covers most of the important aspects in cell biology and helps deepen my knowledge both in the theories, but also in experimental design and practice. It is very helpful for my future research.",
    "As a biomedical engineering student with heavily bio-focused research, I was looking for a more rigorous biology course than I took as an undergraduate. This course proved extremely useful in filling the gaps in my knowledge and introduced me to new biology techniques as well. I feel better equipped to understand seminars given by my colleagues in the BBS department and have an improved understanding of the literature in my own field.",
    "It solidified concepts I had already learned, while simultaneously introducing me to new aspects of cell biology and prompting me to think through the concepts as a researcher, not merely a student. It provided me with new experimental avenues to consider pursuing in my own dissertation research by showing me specific ways to test a concept while eliminating other techniques with less specificity or clarity.",
    "The course contributed to my overall understanding of basic cell biology.",
    "I can see this course positively affecting my research, both in exposing me to important cell biology details, but also by focusing on methods.",
    "Wonderful course. this is my very first cell bio course...it is not easy but really really helpful.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge in all of the areas that were covered. I think the information in the course will be very useful as I continue my career. I knew that I did not have a strong background in cell biology, and I now feel more comfortable with basic aspects of cell biology.",
    "Course helped me identify and learn more about subjects I was less familiar with. I don't think it significantly contributed to my research.",
    "It helped deepen my background understanding by giving me basic info on cell biology. Good for building base of knowledge, but cannot teach specifics.",
    "Every professor is an expert in their fields and we can learn a lot from their lectures. Not only can we learn the basic concepts in cell biology but also get to know some novel biological technologies. That would definitely contribute to our research.",
    "As an immunobiologist, the techniques introduced in this course to study cell biology such as microscopy are definitely useful in the study of immunobiology. There are also very relevant topics such as cell adhesion molecules which are integral to leukocyte trafficking.",
    "Cell biology is pretty relevant to any biological field so I thought it was pretty useful."
