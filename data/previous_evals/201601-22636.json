    "Anyone interested in improving and expanding their research skills, particularly in Early Modern British history, should take this course.",
    "I would recommend it as a great way to learn a process of writing research papers and as an introduction to early modern British historiography. In recommending this class, I would emphasize that Professor Pincus has a very particular way of conducting research and does not encourage finding other ways to go about it. That being said, his method is absolutely worth learning, even if it is not a way that works for you or your larger research projects. For instance, I think his process is an excellent blueprint for my further research, though I may not follow it step by step."
