   "comments": [
    "I know of their practice and design work and my expectations going in were fairly well met. I maybe expected to develop the project with a bit more detail, but the semester seemed to pass very quickly and it was not only a building project, but an urban one.",
    "I had expected a lot of hands-on work through constructed models, and that is exactly what the studio was about. There was less a focus on theoretical aspects of architecture but more an immediacy to the way buildings were conceived of, which while on one hand was refreshing, led me to feel like the theoretical and conceptual aspects of building were somewhat under represented.",
    "Although it is not fault of instructors but maybe of myself, I was disappointed that I could not really go deep to touch materiality and tectonic of the project.",
    "In this studio I expected to develop a building in more detail than I actually did. I think the beginning of the semester was perhaps too scattered with site-based exercises that could be condensed. Overall I was very happy with the studio and the experience was great."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, resources were readily available. It may have been helpful if the instructors had suggested more precedents to look at.",
    "We ran out of desk space since we made so many large models throughout the semester \u0096 this was incredibly frustrating."

   "comments": [
    "Desk Crits and Pin ups were all very helpful",
    "I really liked the tone of pin-ups and juries. Tod and Billie invited helpful critics and they were always fairly productive discussions.Desk-crits always seemed rather short and to focus on one aspect of the project.",
    "The numerous pin-ups and mini-reviews with the 3 critics kept the students constantly on our toes, and proved to be productive as our studio produced amazing work.The studio trip to Callan and Dublin were especially valuable in that it enabled the students to really get a first hand experience of what goes on within a theatre company in Ireland. The invaluable 3 days which we spent with Patrick Lydon and his staff at KCAT in Callan were immensely important to how each student approached their project, and personally this allowed us to develop the empathy which was required for our projects to succeed, even if in an academic setting.The inclusion of Andrew Benner as critic was definitely one of the most valuable aspects of the studio, as he was able to effectively synthesize all of the comments which were laid upon the students so that each individual always had a clear sense of whatever critique was due. He is amazing personable and intelligent as a studio leader and deserves a lot of credit for running a wonderful studio with Tod Williams and Billie Tsien.",
    "Desk-crits were most valuable - but it was easy for the critics to become side-tracked or focus on random details. It maybe would have been useful to have one or two more pinups with guests throughout the semester so that we could more quickly settle on our larger concepts ."
