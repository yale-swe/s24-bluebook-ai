    "I can't say enough good things about this course. I had taken two classes on Egyptology last year and was aiming to deepen my understanding through learning the language, and Classical Hieroglyphic Egyptian was everything I'd hoped for. And when\/where else will you have the opportunity to learn Middle Egyptian?",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in ancient Egypt. However, don't take this class if you're looking for an easy language credit - it certainly is not that.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class even if you don't need a language credit it is a very enjoyable class and the workload is manageable.",
    "I would, although only to anyone interested in Egyptology\/NELC, just given the specialized nature of the class.",
    "I highly recommend this class especially as way to fulfill your language requirement. The workload is very fair and the final is optional. Prof. Allon is a great teacher and the material is genuinely interesting.",
    "While this class is easy because it is only 2 days a week and there are no oral exams or anything like that, this class can still be difficult and time consuming at times. I still had a lot of fun in this class though.",
    "Egyptology is an unconventional but excellent course for anyone with an affinity for languages, an interest in ancient history, or a penchant for trying new things.",
    "Difficult, but rewarding. When you decipher your first text, it's awesome.",
    "It's a standard language introduction course. Although the class is taught in english, there is a transliteration that sometimes you are forced to speak in class. The teacher keeps you on your toes with participation and calls on people randomly. But it's not overly difficult, and although there are daily assignments, the workload isn't overwhelming.",
    "It's L1 Hieroglyphs. You mostly work on translations, and you learn vocabulary and basic grammatical structures. By the end of the semester, you begin to translate segments of actual Middle Egyptian texts.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students. Anyone who has ever had an interest in ancient Egypt will enjoy the course."
