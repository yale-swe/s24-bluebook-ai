    "Take it!",
    "It is a very relaxed class in which you learn a lot and develop basic communication skills in a nice environment. Maria is great, only a few people take the class so it is calm, the topics are not boring, and the evaluations are not hard. I totally recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning or improving their Modern Greek.",
    "I would definitely recommend Greek to another student. I think it's a great course and a beautiful language and Maria is wonderful",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Maria Kaliambou is an amazing teacher who truly cares about her students. She teaches Greek in a great manner, making sure every step is in order and reasonable for learning a new language.",
    "MGRK 110 01 is an intro level modern Greek course that is fast paced, but also very fun and enjoyable. The instructor is very nice, and very good at teaching. I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students because it is definitely worth the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend L1 Greek to other students. It's a really fun language credit."
