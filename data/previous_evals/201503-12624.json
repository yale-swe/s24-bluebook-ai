    "Portuguese is a great class! Not too much work, but I still felt like I had a decent grasp on the language by the end of the semester.",
    "PORT 110 is a fabulous intro to a beautiful language. If you know Spanish or French, you will have a leg up for sure. The class will move quicker as a whole if everyone has had a second language already. I took it after already having fulfilled the language requirement and had a lot of fun! It will be what you make of it, with class every day, but don't miss out on learning about Brazilian culture on your own time too!"
