    "A course that bridges the difficult terrain between thinking of general \"issues in program music analysis at large\" and the specifics of particular \"case study\" pieces of music. In that sense, a very helpful course. In terms of recommending it, I'd say: theory students, just know that this is not a music theory course; prepare to think outside the box. And to music history students, be prepared to look at the music and not be afraid of the score. As long as you keep the above in mind, this course will be great!",
    "Recommended for those who wish to confront issues of formal analysis in challenging settings; think of this as Sonata Theory applied to truly recalcitrant examples."
