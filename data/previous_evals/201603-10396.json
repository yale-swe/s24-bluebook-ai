   "comments": [
    "i learned a lot about basic drawing, and how to draw from the figure.",
    "I learned some basic drawing techniques that strengthened my foundation in art. I learned how to compose pieces and work with different media.",
    "My ability to draw and think about drawing greatly improved. I became much more careful about the craft of drawing, and about the quality of line.",
    "I grew as an artist tremendously in this course! I learned about basic drawing concepts such as perspective and composition, refined basic skills like drawing straight lines and ellipses, which, though basic and foundational, are incredibly useful - necessary, in fact - in creating more complex drawings. I also learned how to think creatively and find unique approaches to assignments of all forms.",
    "This course really helped me further develop my observtional skills while equipping me with a variety of techniques to incorporate into drawing and creating.",
    "What \"formal\" drawing looks and more importantly feels like. You learn about the kinds of exercises and skills are necessary to draw well. That being said, this takes much longer than one semester, so think of i as a starting point with a toolbox rather than a transformative start-to-end thing.",
    "I developed a better knowledge of how to draw utilizing ellipses, perspective and straight, confident lines."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe it spends too much time on the basics (ie. drawing ellipses, perspective, etc.) and working with more basic media, and only gives a short amount at the end of the course to really do individual exploration. That being said, it really helps solidify the fundamentals of drawing and making even the more experienced drawers conscious.",
    "This course flowed very well, every one of the students were able to improve their drawing skills greatly.",
    "Overall, the course is well organized. It sticks to the syllabus and has assignments that take roughly the same amount of time and effort, and they are pretty reasonable. The course is fun and sometimes relaxing. At the same time, I'm pretty grades-conscious, and it was difficult to know how I was doing in the class until emailing Natalie directly. It would be nice to know how we were doing in assignments, and perhaps get some better feedback. While critiques were helpful, they are only specific to one piece, and it would have been nice to know how to improve overall.",
    "Strengths: My drawing improved tremendously. Weaknesses: The class size was rather large, meaning we spent a great deal of time on in-class critiques, which I enjoyed, but wish we had a bit more in-class drawing time.",
    "it was nice to gain exposure to a range of different drawing tools and techniques, though it did feel a bit rushed at times.",
    "There is a lot of trial by error and a great degree of independence.",
    "A strength of the course is the rigorous way it throws students into artmaking. I thought that a weakness was that the first couple weeks were too completely focused on technique, and it sucked a lot of the creativity and enjoyment I usually gain from drawing."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend for anyone with any interest in drawing.",
    "Would recommend if you re an art major, or would like to improve your drawing skills",
    "It's fun, and you get better at drawing. The assignments do take some time (3-6 hours, depending on how much effort you put into it). I would recommend it only if you are okay with not know what grade you're getting in this class. The grading is kind of arbitrary and seems to be somewhat based on favoritism.",
    "I would recommend Natalie's class to anyone who has not drawn much before. The course gives a very solid foundation for drawing and the people who came in having not drawn since elementary school left creating fantastic realistic portraits. That said, I think it would be a frustrating class to attend as someone who is experienced, and I think that someone who is relatively proficient should consider taking a different section.",
    "Absolutely yes, but only if you're willing to put in the work! Do not take this course as a \"fun\" thing to do - it is a great deal of work and if you waste it and don't put in the work, it will not be enjoyable at all! If you put in the work, it will be extremely rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in drawing.",
    "I absolutely recommend basic drawing, especially if you think you can't draw! I came into the class with less than zero drawing experience and left with a few drawings I'm proud of as well as much better hand eye coordination. Take it!"
