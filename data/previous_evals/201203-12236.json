   "comments": [
    "It's hard. But it's Russian. So you know what you're getting into.",
    "If you want to learn a slavic language, go for it.",
    "I would certainly recommend it to someone who is passionate about Eastern-European culture\/languages\/etc. The fact that you have class and homework every day makes you assess the material and you can feel progress each week. The workload is a little big I would say, 7-9 hours per week + the classes, but it's definitely worth it!",
    "Constant (you meet everyday and have homework every day) but usually not very demanding work (although there were times where the grammar became complicated very quickly, but you eventually 'get' it after a few days of exposure) on a profoundly interesting language and culture. Despite the work, the actual class itself was very fun most of the time! I would undoubtedly recommend this course.",
    "The material for this course is not too difficult, but it was very disorganized, which made it hard to follow the material being introduced. This semester, the lecturer and the TF traded off days, and the teaching format of constantly switching off was extremely distracting. It often felt like the two instructors were teaching two different courses and were not very coordinated.Overall, I've enjoyed learning Russian, and I know that I've made good progress in one semester, but I hope that in the future it will be less frustrating to navigate the style in which the class is taught.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. If you're even considering taking Russian, don't have second thoughts. Take it!!! It will be a wonderful experience.",
    "Awesome course. Fun and engaging.",
    "Introduction to Russian language, focus on basic grammar and vocabulary; I would recommend it, especially to students who are interested in understanding the structure of a language."
