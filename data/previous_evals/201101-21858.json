   "comments": [
    "Its a great course, not too much load, the weekly quizzes actually help in understanding stuff, if you keep up with the reading it shouldn't be a problem.",
    "I took this class partly because previous evaluations had said it was relaxing. Way to be deceptive, previous reviews. Yes, there is no final, and the exams are non-cumulative, but it's a surprising amount of work and material. I had somehow compiled 50+ single spaced pages of lecture notes for the third midterm. Personally, I spent way more time on this course than on genetics, biochem, cell bio, etc., etc. Be warned: only take this course if you really enjoy the material.",
    "You learn a lot and it's really fascinating material. Take it if the material interests you, otherwise you'll be bored by all the details.",
    "I would recommend this course to any pre-med student looking for an easy alternative to cell bio. As long as you stay reasonably on top of the reading (which is a minimal amount each week) and attend most classes you should be fine.",
    "I'm glad I took this instead of Cell Bio. Cell Bio seemed waaay too intimidating and just so much information tomemorize, especially since I was also taking Orgo + lab. I liked the Devbio material,and it was still a substantial amount of work with the weekly quizzes, but much more manageable. You learn to think logically, understand the reasoning behind the experiments, and learn some pretty useful stuff. The midterms were kind of annoying though, since sometimes they asked questions on topics they didn't emphasize. Sometimes the questions seemed random, and itwas just about memorization - not actually understanding concepts and\/or applying them.",
    "This is an interesting class although it is unclear how much of the information will be relevant in any way to future biology courses unless you are planning to specialize in Developmental Biology. However, it is an interesting Biology elective that isn't way too challenging if you're willing to attend lecture.",
    "This class is a lot of work. For the most part, it is all about memorization. I would study every week for the quizzes and do really well, so I made the mistake of assuming that I was prepared for the midterms. They are much more difficult than the weekly quizzes and require a lot of preparation. Also, the curve in this class was fairly high. I would recommend this class if you are interested in development. It is a good introduction.",
    "This was a very well done course. I felt that it provided a very thorough introduction to concepts related to developmental biology. Topics covered are diverse enough to keep the course interesting but not so diverse that the course loses focus. All three professors were fantastic and did a very good job, and, even though the course was co-taught, lectures were coherent. The weekly quiz systems works well at keeping students caught up with material.",
    "MCDB 210 is one of the best-taught science courses I've taken so far. Although it consists of three professors who take turns teaching, which can be hard to follow and can make exams difficult to study for, this was not the case for Dev Bio. Definitely take this course!! The weekly quizzes make sure you stay on top of the material so that once the exams come around, you're pretty well-prepared. The three exams&no final format makes it a stress-free course&the professors are really great! Prof. Holley&Prof. Irish were my favorites, especially because they had great powerpoints that made the information easy to understand, but Prof. Kankel was also pretty good. They're dynamic lecturers who keep the class engaged with occasional jokes and they seem to care about their students. If you're looking for a science class, I'd definitely recommend Dev Bio :)",
    "Developmental biology is a thorough treatment of the topic, covering important aspects of development in model organisms \u0096\u00a0both vertebrates and plants. It's pretty logically structured and taught well, with the exception of a few lectures that wandered. Workload is reasonable with weekly quizzes and 3 midterms, no final. It's critical to stay on top of the material, but if you do so you'll do just fine in the course.",
    "It's a decent bio course. I'd take it. Not too hard, not too much work, no final. If you can afford the weekly quizzes, it's definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to take a decent biology course that isn't incredibly time consuming. However, the tests are frustrating. There are five 20 point questions, so if you have trouble with one you'll get a low grade even if you studied a ton.",
    "Absolutely! I took it as an extra bio course, and because I had already had cell bio and genetics, this course was straightforward and enjoyable. It was not a lot of work, and the weekly quizzes were not too bad.",
    "Overall, Developmental Biology was a good course, and I really liked the set-up of weekly quizzes, which forced you to keep on top of the material, with 3 exams and no final. I would recommend it to other students- I took it instead of Cell Bio for the MCDB major and am really happy with my decision.",
    "No. Take another bio class that has fair grading. Although the information is fair and you do learn a lot, if you do care about your grade (as most people do), don't expect the grade to reflect how well you understand and know the information.",
    "Quizzes every week, take it if you're MCDB. Not completely horrible, but you have to be on top of the readings\/material otherwise it can get time consuming.",
    "Just don't take this class. Evaluations are essays on 5 obscure topics out of hundreds covered in lecture. In addition, the essays are graded so that huge numbers of points are taken off for failing to articulate what can only be described as frivolous details. For example, I was docked 6% on a test for forgetting to mention that retinoic acid (whose function I discussed in detail) happens to be a derivative of Vitamin A. If arbitrary grading bothers you, don't even think of taking this class. In addition, if you do take it, be prepared to have a huge discrepancy between how you think you preform on a quiz or test, and your actual grade.",
    "Good introductory course- real focus on principles with some beautiful examples.The quizzes, exams, and readings are all reasonable.",
    "A great, fun class if you're interested in the material. Developmental biology was my favorite part of intro bio and it still is. The class is divided into a study of vertebrate development, fly development, and plant development. The three teachers are great and the tests are very fair. Still, not a class to take if you don't like work. A weekly quiz really keeps you on your feet. I loved this class!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. A fair amount of info, but not too much.The professors organize this course such that you have a good grasp of important concepts by the end of the course, as well as the knowledge of some important smaller details. They don't, however, present you with so much info that you'll have to run a memorizing marathon to keep up with the class and then just forget everything later.",
    "Developmental biology is a very basic, general review of the development of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. The material is at times interesting, but at other times overly esoteric and confusing. You will learn more about drosophila development (and memorize it) than you ever wanted to know. It's team taught and large, with weekly quizes (that count for very little) and three big midterms, but no final. The tests involve a lot of essay questions and at times the grading can seem very arbitrary. Overall, I would not recommend this class. If you need it for your major, take it - it has a relatively light work load and isn't all that bad. At the same time, I did not feel like I learned a whole lot of useful material, and your time would likely be better spent in another course.",
    "If you are interested in sort of system-level biology with molecularaspects, this is definitely a great course. At the end, you have a big picture of how developmental processes work and how you get from genes to an organism. This course is not that hard if you just stay on top of the notes and go to class, though I recommend having taken genetics just because it will make a lot of the concepts easier.",
    "Good exposure to main concepts of developmental biology. Lecturers and lectures are interesting and great and focus on experimental basis for our knowledge of development.",
    "The class does not offer support. This is one class that definitely needs a section, yet is has none. The TAs were not helpful. Preparing for the tests is hit or miss since you are randomly asked a few utterly specific essay type questions when each test is based on a lot of material. I would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "It really is a boring class - take it only if you need the credit or if you particularly like flies and germ plants.",
    "Developmental Biology is an awesome class! Definitely take it. I took both Cell Bio and Dev Bio and I have to say that Dev Bio was less stressful--not because the material was any easier, but because it was better taught and much more organized. Some people avoid taking developmental bio because they think it's all about Hox genes. It's not. I found the material to be fascinating, even the lectures on plants. Dev Bio provides a larger picture into which molecular bio, cell bio, and genetics fit; it all comes together when you recall what you've learned in the other courses, which is pretty cool. It is one of the best MCDB courses I've taken. All three professors are great lecturers. There is some overlap with genetics, for example. But the overlapping material is much better explained by the Dev Bio professors. The 10 weekly quizzes (like in Cell Bio and Genetics) really help in keeping up w\/ the material&preparing for the hourly exams (you get to drop 1 quiz). The questions are all reasonable&fair. Each of the 3 exams has questions in the same format as quiz questions. The course seems to fly by, since it'sdivided into 3 sections, each culminating in an hourly exam. Plus, there's no final!"
