    "The last round of evaluations for this course say it's just ii-V-I for 10 weeks; seems like Kane really switched it up well this semester because it wasn't like that at all. The course covered a bunch of different topics in jazz harmony, starting with basic alterations and extensions, moving onto advanced voicings,and eventually reharmonization techniques. The technical stuff is interspersed with close analyses of solo transcriptions, and occasionally by Kane's very passionate lectures about somewhat minute but really interesting points in jazz history.If you have just a little bit of exposure to jazz harmony, I think this course would be perfect. If you already play and know a decent amount of jazz theory, you certainly will learn new things, but don't expect the whole thing to be fresh and new. Still worth it if you're looking to round out your knowledge, and especially if you need a fourth\/fifth class.",
    "Yes, it's a great break from all the classical music-based courses in the music department. It's a fun, pretty laid back class.",
    "This class was disappointing. It began as a nice into to jazz harmony and song form, but devolved into freeform analysis of improvised solos from the repertoire. It did not feel like we were going anywhere or learning anything concrete. The first half of the course was relevant and useful, but the second half really fell flat.",
    "great crash course on jazz theory. i played jazz before taking the class fairly seriously and didn't know a good chunk of the stuff covered. very worthwhile.",
    "This class gives a pretty good overview of jazz harmony. If you know nothing about jazz, and want to familiarize yourself with the general rules (or lack of rules), take this class. Although, like any theory class, be ready for the bi-weekly assignments and random tests.",
    "I'd you want a basic understanding of jazz harmony then go ahead and take the class",
    "Speaking as a music major with only basic jazz experience, I loved this class. Kane is awesome, and you get to wake up to Miles Davis etc. every other day for a semester. Do it!",
    "I would say it's great for someone who knows about harmony in general, but not necessarily about jazz harmony. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in jazz. It was one of my favorite courses at Yale. Definitely worth the 9 am start time.",
    "Jazz Harmony was a fascinating and engaging course, mostly because of the incredible material we dealt with but also because Professor Kane delivered it in a lively and passionate manner. The assignments were also doable and seems strongly connected to what we were doing in class. I'd strongly recommend this course.",
    "For someone who is interested in learning more about how jazz harmony functions from a theoretical perspective as well as its historical context, this course is highly recommended."
