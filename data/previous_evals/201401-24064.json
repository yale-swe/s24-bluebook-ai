   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very structured and the lecture is the best ever!Weakness: it is an introductory course. it would be fun to have some group projects",
    "I don't think there was any incentive to go to lecture. Everything was in the powerpoint slides, which were much too cumbersome to print and take notes on.That being said, the powerpoint slides were very good. Also I feel that sometimes the homework assigned was more tedious than educational; that could just be the nature of the material.",
    "Strength:Lectures notes were detailed and organized.Weakness:Assignments and homework was overwhelming. Examples used in the lecture was too easy and did not help in doing the homework.",
    "Strengths: Amazing powerpoint slides, Maria was easy to follow and explained everything very thoroughly. She was enthusiastic about her subject and very accessible to students.Weaknesses: Homework did not always fully follow class content, and seemed a little more challenging than necessary, especially given the given the standard difficulty of the examinations.",
    "Strengths- the lecture and lab slides were great referencesWeaknesses- there was no reason to go to lecture since the slides were great and the professor just read from the slides- too many homework questions assigned. skipped the definition question and just ask the question where we practice DOING the statistics",
    "Lectures were pretty brutal; I felt bad when not a lot of people would show up. You technically could get away with not showing up to class and still do well in the class",
    "The lecture slides for this course were fantastic, and will definitely be an important resource in the future. I think the class could have been made more interactive, and tougher clicker questions!",
    "The notes are spectacular. Very detailed and beautifully organized. However, the clicker questions are so elementary they're no longer informative. The course also moved very slowly. For students also in Epi II a lot of the material overlapped and was redundant\/annoying to sit through.",
    "Strengths: Clear presentation, logical flow of materialNo real weaknesses.",
    "I really liked the format of the lecture notes and the clicker questions. One suggested improvement would be to offer optional practice problems, aside from homework problems.",
    "This course in and of itself is fine: the professor is knowledgeable, patient, and good at teaching, and her slides are meticulous. However, TAKING this course was completely unnecessary for everyone who is not intending to use biostats ever again in our lives. As a health care management student, not only am I unlikely to ever need to call upon this information, but insofar as I may need to do some computer-assisted statistical analyses I have not had any training in Excel or Stata -- which are what real people use outside of academic epidemiology. SAS is clumsy, counter-intuitive, and we knew from the beginning that we would never use it again. This made it difficult to feel invested in the course.Additionally, grading of assignments was erratic and in some instances borderline abusive. Points were taken off excessively and in many cases without explanation, both damaging our grades and denying us the opportunity to learn from our mistakes. There were also inconsistent expectations in the grading of our lab assignments, which cost many of us a great deal.Lastly, it is just not appropriate to have 3 class sessions per week devoted to a largely-superfluous subject that requires aninordinate amount of study time for clearly limited gain. Professor Ciarlegio is kind, and did a great job. However she did that good work in a context that was unnecessarily burdensome.",
    "This course is very helpful.",
    "Strengths: covers a lot of material, coordinates well when taken alongside Epidemiology II and Applied Analytic Methods in Epidemiology",
    "This was the best biostatistics course I ever had so far (including what I had in undergraduate, and the first semester in my MPH academic year).It became much more clear of the entire concepts, and I feel like I am much more prepared for the challenges in data analysis whether in the summer internship or the up coming thesis.",
    "One strength of this course is that the professor's slides are incredibly detailed and comprehensive. However, this is also a weakness as attending class becomes unnecessary and the professor is simply spending time going through each slide. This class is entirely different from the way that Professor Klaus taught it last semester. Professor Klaus used a projector and went through concepts and problems with us in class, which really helped us to learn the material very well.",
    "I absolutely loved this course!As an economics major as an undergraduate, I've taken my fair share of statistics and math courses but I have never learned about survival analysis, poisson regression, or even logistic regression in depth. This class helped me to better understand these statistical analyses.",
    "Good course overall",
    "The course is great. Well-paced for the material with relevant homework's and assignments to make the necessary points.",
    "Very strong slide presentations, course was well-designed, adhered to syllabus.Clicker questions were very simplistic, I would like to see clicker questions that more closely reflected exam-type questions.",
    "This was a great class - very clear and well taught. The lecture slides were unbelievably good and I'll use them as a reference for myself in the future. I actually feel like I understand biostatistics now!",
    "A bit theory\/information intensive. Appreciative skew toward concepts over busy-work\/calculations.",
    "Maria's slides were absolutely amazing. As a policy student though, I felt as though including survival analysis as part of the course was unnecessary and unfair for two reasons: epi students had an in-depth introduction to the concept and as a policy student it was not necessary. I enjoy research and statistics, but I will never do a survival analysis as a component of policy research.",
    "It's a good course that covers a lot of material. There's a big overlap with CDE534, and somewhat with Epi II. This definitely helped to reinforce some aspects of the material, but it was also mind-numbingly redundant at some points.The way that the homeworks are structured is horribly tedious. My 4 homeworks together totaled 97 pages. That's 97 pages for 30% of my grade. And since I lost points on all of my homeworks for various reasons, clearly my 97 pages were not adequate. A lot of it was just mindless repetition that did nothing except raise my blood pressure and get me frustrated with the knowledge that, despite my efforts and understanding of the material, I was going to lose points somewhere. I won't even go into homework #3, where we were all penalized despite answering the questions correctly as asked. Still, the homeworks prepared us well for the materials that we were going to encounter on the exams, right? Maybe?Don't roll the labs and the homework together. Make each lab due the following week. First, this will make things easier on the people who have to grade them. Second, this will give the TAs a constant assessment of how their students are doing.",
    "The slide deck is awesome, the professor is great at making complicated concepts accessible. The pacing of the course is also good. The slide decks for the labs were also really helpful and the TAs were great. It was a little difficult to predict what would be on the exams, though.",
    "As part of my curriculum (Health Policy& Management students) I do not believe this class should be required. Many of us do not plan on doing research. We have to take the methods course anyways and both of these classes together seemed redundant. Biostatistics went into much more detail than I ever plan on using in statistics. I believe the first semester is enough and provides a good, basic understanding of biostatistics.",
    "Slides are very thorough but maybe too thorough -- very hard to distinguish what's important and what's not from the slides.Really wished there was more synchronization with Applied Analytic Methods in Epi course. Order of lectures didn't sync and was confusing since the same material was essentially covered in two different aspects in both classes but in one class we learned logistic regression first while in the other we learned Poisson first",
    "The course could use more examples. More practice problems similar to exam questions.",
    "good class, powerpoints are perfect.",
    "As far as statistics courses go, this one was pretty great. Although there was a lot of work involved, Maria and all of the TA's were fantastic instructors, and taught the course in a way that was easy to understand. I also liked the clicker questions, and the midterm and final were both very fair.",
    "The lectures and lecture slides were amazing. It was very easy to use the slides to complete the homework and study. The labs were useful and helpful, and the homework assignments were very good practice for applying the course concepts. There were some inconsistencies in how the homeworks were graded, however",
    "I think that I learned a lot during the course. The homework and labs were tedious, but I think that the tests were fair and expectations were clear.",
    "This course doesn't waste time having you crunch numbers on your calculator, but instead does a great job of making sure you understand the concepts behind different regressions and being able to interpret SAS outputs. Homeworks and labs are good reinforcers of the concepts.",
    "The PowerPoint slides were amazing. More clarity in the grading or expectations on what you are looking for in the homework. Often times I got marked off for not including something that was never explicitly asked for.Lecture power points were AMAZING!! I have never seen PowerPoint presentations that beautiful before. I will be keeping them as reference for quite some time to come.Lectures were adequate. Not bad, not amazing.",
    "helpful, overall introduction of biostatistics",
    "If this class weren't at 8:30 am, it would be fantastic. Also I think labs\/homework would be more manageable for both TAs grading and the students if they were shorter and due more frequently (like the labs in Dr. Desai's class). The TAs frequently complained about having to stay up late to grade and being exhausted. Moreover, I found it kind of annoying to go back to lab I had completed 3 weeks prior to the deadline to make sure everything was perfect.",
    "Strengths: great professor with great notesweaknesses: having this course at 8:30 am is absurd; ridiculous workload",
    "Great lecture slides!",
    "Strengths: -comprehensive slides that were easy to follow and navigate-homework mirrors course content-fair assessmentsWeaknesses:-inconsistent grading-lack of attendance (maybe this isn't necessarily a weakness because it led to a smaller class day to day)",
    "The structure and organization of the course was great, as it allowed students to understand the overall concepts behind various analytical methods before learning the nitty-gritty of the methodology. The course notes were outstanding, and truly helpful with homework assignments, labs, and exams.",
    "Only recommendation is to provide practice exams for students to gauge whether they have integrated all the information and focused on the appropriate topics.",
    "The powerpoints were excellent, some of the best I've ever seen for class. They are a great study aid and very worth keeping. I appreciated having such detailed slides and that really helped me learn the material and study for the tests.",
    "This class gave very detailed, but easy-to-understand coverage of basic stats topics and SAS, which should be useful in the future. The first month overlapped heavily with first semester stats, which seems unnecessary.",
    "The slides are extremely clear and Maria is an enthusiastic professor. I thought the TA's were helpful. The homework can be burdensome, but it prepares you well for the exams and is a fair amount of work.",
    "Organized, engaging, flowed well.",
    "Maria did a great job with this class! The slides were fantastic and really well done. I also appreciated the clicker questions (although they definitely could be a little more difficult) because they kept us engaged and helped make sure we understood the concepts being presented.I loved that we could keep our textbooks from the previous semester, although it seemed as if Maria didn't like the book's explanations. Her supplemental questions were a better preview for the test than any of the book's questions (which was fine). I would suggest eliminating the review lectures -- actual practice problems would have been much more helpful!The strongest suggestion is that the expectations for the homework grading varied from TA to TA. We were told by the TA who graded Assignment 3 that she was frustrated with us (along with some inappropriate comments, such as telling us we were lazy), but it was equally frustrating to be penalized for things that had previously been fine.",
    "material was useful for understanding other courses since some of the material overlapped",
    "well organized lecture but hard to take in because we were just reading the slides.",
    "Excellent course!",
    "Strength: Covers many important statistical procedures we must knowWeakness: Spent too much time at the beginning on reviewing the first semester and did not delve much into the theory of how some of these models are fitted (maximum likelihood estimates)",
    "Strengths: the lesson structure, examples and materials are useful and a fantastic aid to the book examples.Weaknesses: review lessons for the exam could have utilized more practical problems to review class concepts.",
    "Strengths:- very detailed lectures...concepts were thoroughly laid out and meticulousweaknesses:- a large amount of workload. lab assignments were so detailed and involved so much additional questions that it was hard to balance other classes.- no practice questions\/review questions made it hard to know what the overall important concepts were. we were made to understand everything in important detail--most of us are not in biostat concentration and felt that I learned much more from Mayur's AAMIE course.",
    "great slides, great professor, homeworks were so long",
    "lecture slides were very thorough and clearhomework was a bit tedious, especially SAS related problems",
    "Great course.",
    "lecture slides were very organized and great references however, i felt any math course is difficult to teach using lecture slides. maybe it is a personal preference, but stats requires walking through the steps, understanding how you derive at certain calculations - watching the process in class makes it easier for students to understand and retain information rather than just highlighting lecture slides",
    "- difficult- wish there were practice exams- open book\/notes exam would be helpful",
    "Great intro to biostats",
    "A very well taught course with great slides, useful labs, and great TA's",
    "Too many slides per lecture.",
    "This course really, really strengthened my stats and SAS skills. The professor is so great and so are the TAs.",
    "I learned a lot! great course! really good, detailed slidesI LOVED THE CLICKER QUESTIONS!!! An instant way to see if you understand the concepts, and it was in an anonymous way, which is a plus",
    "Homework assignments were really long but I appreciated having more conceptual problems than multiple extensive calculations problems like we did last semester. Definitely keep the feature of allowing a cheat sheet during exams for formulas. I recommend having more exams throughout the semester so that our entire grade isn't based on just a midterm and a final which is daunting.",
    "Strengths: every definition and statistic model were clearly explained, great interaction with students via clickersWeaknesses: a little be boring, but it's reasonable because Maths is boring",
    "Better course than Biostat 1. Very organized and helpful PPTS.",
    "I really appreciated all the time and effort that went into the class slides.The class material was taught very well and labs were interactive, making it easy to learn the SAS code.Overall, both the homework assignments and midterm exam adequately tested our knowledge and understanding of bio-statistics. Given the instructor's style, I was disappointed in the final exam in that it wasn't particularly challenging conceptually and did not adequately cover material from the second half of the semester.",
    "I would've like more opportunity to work book questions and get feedback on how I was doing",
    "Nothing really - powerpoints were incredible, lab and homework assignments seemed very relevant."

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Fails to realize that the majority of people taking this class are required to take it -- overestimates the relevance of SAS in any of our lives. Assigns too many homework problems that end up not even being relevant to our exams. Busy work.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was approachable and friendly. However, she talked too fast during lecture and despite informing her about it, her teaching pace did not slow down. Students who were taking notes often struggled to keep up with her.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0As mentioned, she was very enthusiastic and accessible to students. She moved at a slow pace so that everyone could really absorb all the logistic information.A weakness would be that she sometimes seemed to take the class a little too seriously. Understandably you want to be enthusiastic about the subject, but people who are taking it solely for necessity just won't be lured into the class content.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very nice, good attitude and nice sense of humor, again I felt bad when people wouldn't come to class",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Did a really great job of providing a theoretical background of statistics in a way that was clear for us to understand. I look forward to taking more of her classes in the future!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was very helpful and approachable. She really wanted the students to learn and got very excited when students seemed to understand the material. However, she sometimes moved very slowly and would get hung up on seemingly insignificant concepts.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was very engaging, responsive, and clear in her presentation. I appreciated that she started with the basics and built upon them instead of assuming a base knowledge of complicated topics. Her slides were easy to follow and her demeanor pleasant. I really enjoyed having Maria as my stats instructor and would advise her not to change her lectures of the pace of the material. Lower attendance throughout the semester was due to students not wanting to get out of bed, not due to a lack of great teaching.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor Cialeglio is a good lecturer and makes all concepts clear and understandable. Her slides are informative, but there is often so much information in a lecture that it is difficult to extract the essential information. All in all she was supportive and helpful, and clearly wants her students to do well.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio is very responsible. But I think she should give us more information about key point in each class rather than go over every details which makes us confused and lost in the class.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Strengths: Clear explanations, very organized, great powerpoints",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was a great instructor! Her slides are very well-organized, and you can tell she spends a lot of time preparing her course materials. I know not many people attended class because of this.My only criticism is of the homework--we often had to do 2-3 problems reinforcing the same concept.Unlike Dr. Claus's class, we were only allowed to use one sheet of notes on the exams. I wish Maria would also let us bring our homework to the exams.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor Ciarleglio, while a very nice and approachable professor, teaches biostatistics with slides, which I think is a very bad method to teaching a statistics course. We are all used to Professor Klaus' style of teaching and really liked it because she went through all concepts and problems with us on the projector. Nevertheless, Professor Ciarleglio's were very useful for SAS portions of the lessons and the main points came through on her slides.",

Her slides are beautiful, and are perfect study tools. Her tests are fair and really get down to whether you can get to the answer, not just whether you have the right answer. No crazy surprises. I do think she could make the clicker questions more of a challenge. Also, if we went over example problems from start to finish in the lectures, that might be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is a very enthusiastic lecturer who clearly brings a lot of passion and commitment to this class. As a lecturer I found that she did a fine job. My only critique was that often she went over the SAS code so quickly it was difficult to take any notes on it or what special things she had added.Occasionally clarifying questions were asked that she chose not to answer and instead directed us to see her in office hours. I for one would have wished for more of the theory behind the tools we wereusing rather than a straight presentation of the models in lecture. I was particularly irritated when one student asked why the correction for non-normality in one model was \"-1\" as it appeared to the one asking the question, and myself also, to be a fairly random choice and we wished to understand how the model had been chosen. However she didn't answer this question. But overall she was capable of explaining topics that she presented.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Really detail-oriented. Tech savvy.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is great. She clearly spends a lot of time preparing, is very sweet, is very enthusiastic about statistics, and really explains the process of statistics in a way that is easy to understand, but also gives deeper meaning to simple formulas and procedures.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was great and so adorable! Really responsive to students, really passionate about wanting us to understand the subject matter, but I felt that she could have been a little more strict at times. For instance, as more and more people stopped coming to class, she never really mentioned anything in class to encourage people to continue attending class.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very approachable, knowledgeable, provided excellent and very clear slides with good examples, clearly very concerned with teaching students as best as she could",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was very receptive to feedback and overall a good teacher.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor Ciarleglio was very accessible to students and gave great lectures and notes for the class. She keeps stats interesting and makes it very easy to learn.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very enthusiastic and clear",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is so great! She made difficult concepts easier to understand, which is more than I can say about with any other statistics professor. Great professor!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0I really liked Maria! She was reallynice and did a great, thorough job of explaining complex topics. You can tell she puts a lot into the classes.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0very clear lectures and clear slides, but sometimes felt like we were just reading off the slides for lecture",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Instructor was very organized and willing to help students outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent! Very organized and meticulous!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was awesome. She is high energy and appears to enjoy herself. She has much to improve however.1)The iClicker questions are WAY too easy. They are not very helpful and frankly it feels a bit degrading to answer some of them as a grad student. Challenge us more with this. I know this is the first time these are being used so its a work in progress2) The level of detail in the slides is almost at a textbook level. This is great for reviewing the slides afterwards, but it makes taking notes or coming to class sometimes pointless.3) Entertain and engage us! Throw a few jokes in there! Ask questions from the audience rather than only iClicker. I know it's tough to get people enthusiastic this early in morning, but I'm not surprised in the lecture attendance when the notes are so thorough and there is no class participation.Overall, I would still give Maria a 6.5\/10. It's her first time lecturing the class and considering that, she did fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio was clear and thorough on her presentation of the material. Her use of real life examples throughout the lesson were helpful in the dissection and understanding of complex problems. She was also available to any questions and\/or concerns.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Strengths:- detailed- available for questions- very sweet, niceWeaknesses:- as wonderful as it is that she is so passionate about biostats, it was a hard course for us who were not in the biostat dept.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0fantastic! i think she should teach stats in the fall for incoming students.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Taught material at a good pace. Always made sure everyone knew why an answer was correct\/incorrect. Weaknesses: did not provide practice problems for exams. It was hard to know what to expect for the midterm. Very particular about homework assignments and labs.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very sweet, approachable, and considerate.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0very prepared, lecture notes are organized and good references in the future. however, because the lecture slides were so good and she didn't do much else above referencing the slides, class attendance was very low",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0- very sweet- clicker questions were helpful",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Phenomenal teacher for providing students with the knowledge they need to understand biostatistics. However, she was not approachable and very strict with deadlines.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is a wonderful instructor. She really cares about making the material very straight forward and having the students understand the statistical procedures inside and out. I feel as though I have learned so much because of her thorough teaching. She should definitely teach this course again.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is good at explaining every last detail, allowing you to fully understand the concepts. Her 100-120 slides lectures can be intimidating, but she does a good job at covering everything. We have also wondered what happened to the reports of cheating that were made earlier in the semester. Punishing these individuals in any sort of way would show us that she takes cheating as a serious offense, which discourages others from cheating in the future.Also, nobody talks in class ever. Participation is rare in class, but I like it that way. It worked out well for this class.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Homework 3 was graded too harshly.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0I loved her teaching style. Very kind, smart, and approachable",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is amazing at explaining things. Her slides are out of this world and the only thing she should improve on is teaching more courses, like 505a.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Nice and great instructor",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very organized but speaks too fast at times.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Really appreciated the work that went into the class slides. The instructor was very careful in explaining and connecting concepts in class, and very approachable during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0I really liked the powerpoints and they were perfect to study from",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Great power points, but tried to cover more material than was necessary.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She was really fantastic - you could tell how much she cared about the course, and the lectures for both statistical theory and SAS were really informative."

She was also willing to stay beyond her office hours when students needed the extra help.I do want to talk about Yasmmyn and her weaknesses. While she may be knowledgeable, many students dislike approaching her because she is unfriendly and very condescending towards those students who are weak in biostats. She is inpatient and rude to some targetted students that she does not like. She exhibits passive aggressive behaviors and is a very biased person. Its obvious who her favorite students are and she treats them differently. A few of us have personally seen her being rude to a particular international student who could not speak english well. Also, Yasmmyn is known to leave her office hours abruptly as soon as it ends, she has little empathy for weak students. I hope that future biostats professors do not employ yasmmyn for future TA opportunities.",

Satin on one of her labs (after she graded the hw) and I'm not sure whether it was because a few people had messy HW, but it seemed like she took out her frustration on everyone.

    "A very good course to pick up stats modeling skills and SAS programming. Definitely a good class to start with your stats journey!",
    "I loved the first semester of biostats; I can't say this course was as useful to my future career goals.",
    "Yes. However, I think that Healthcare management students do not eventually make sure of this skill in the type of job that we are typically employed in the future.",
    "I would not recommend this course...but mostly because I am not a big fan of math or statistics and I felt that it wasn't particularly relevant to my area of study.For people interested in or just entering the subject, I think this course is helpful and easy to follow overall, even if the workload is a little more intense than I would have anticipated.",
    "Easy to do well without attending lecture (just go to lab)",
    "It was good- I think it's a little unnecessary for a lot of people and the 8:30 time slot is BRUTAL.",
    "Would recommend, especially for the fantastic lecture slides!",
    "The notes beautifully explain statistics, there aren't that many in class examples, and the class is mostly theoretical. That is important but after Biostats 1 it was very different and didn't really seem like a stats class. I would recommend it, Maria is a very nice instructor who really cares about the students.",
    "I learned a lot through this course and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about basic statistics.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a good introductory course. The content covered is broad but not deep.",
    "Useful if you ever plan to do work that requires a sophisticated working knowledge of biostatistics.For everyone else, presumably you did something wrong in a past life and are now being punished. Test out if at all possible.",
    "Yes! Strong recommendation.",
    "Required class--lectures are not necessary to attend in order to do well in the class. Class concepts reinforce AAMIE and epi II well.",
    "People should definitely take Maria's biostatistics in the spring semester!",
    "This class is incredibly different from Professor Klaus' course in the sense that it is much more difficult to follow Professor Ciarlegio's lectures. Each slide is filled with detailed information and it is hard to follow her sometimes. The lab assignments, as long as they are, help us to apply the concepts we learn during lectures. However, this course does give us a great understanding of biostatistical concepts.",
    "I enjoyed the course",
    "The course is required but Dr. Ciarleglio makes it as painless as Biostats II can possibly be!",
    "Outstanding introductory course to biostatistics. Recommended even if not a core requirement.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student. This course builds on the first semester of the biostats course to teach you how to choose which model to use and how to assess the fitness of models.",
    "A good follow-up to BIS 505a. But also stands on it's own. Clickers a great addition; truly helped the build to be interactive. Homework and labs can be a bit much but with proper time management are in good service of learning the material.",
    "It's a required course, but Maria is great!",
    "Well, it's a required course for most of us!It's a continuation on BIS505a, in which you learn additional hypothesis tests and use those that you know to develop models for the data.",
    "If you will do research, the course offers a good foundation in the math behind the analyses you'll conduct. It's also good to have SAS knowledge if you're going to look for an internship. Mostly, this class is about basic biostat principles (is the finding significant or not?) and how to apply them in SAS.",
    "I would not recommend it for HPM and HCM students. Many of us do not plan on doing research. We have to take the Methods course anyways and both of these classes together seemed redundant. Biostatistics went into much more detail than I ever plan on using in statistics. I believe the first semester is enough and provides a good, basic understanding of biostatistics.",
    "Good wrap up to a year of biostatistics",
    "Good class. You'll learn a lot. You have to take it anyways so I guess I recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. You learn so much about statistics and SAS.",
    "Important for anybody in public health.",
    "Although I am not interested in Biostats, this was a good course. We learned a lot of useful information that I used in other courses. The SAS lab component was challenging, but got easier with time.",
    "This is a great course to understand all the regression analysis methods that you'll be seeing in papers and in research. You might see this material in other courses, and yes it's early. But I learned the foundation and background concepts for the material in this class in a way I would not have learned in any other class. Recommend it.",
    "A necessary follow-up to Biostats 505a. The class was good but not great, but I certainly learned a lot of useful concepts for the future and the professor is certainly capable of explaining and eager to do a good job.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student. It provides basic knowledge of biostatistics for the future work.",
    "I will strongly recommend it.",
    "A great class for those who need basic introduction to regression models.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because I think learning the basics of SAS and biostats are important for every concentration.",
    "I personally learned a lot during this course, especially since the analytical methods we learned about paralleled nicely with other classes I took during the same time (Applied Analytical Methods in Epi and Epi II). The course notes were outstanding, and were truly helpful in understanding the material. Even though it's a requirement, I would still recommend this course to other students, especially if you plan to use SAS or other applied biostatistical methods in the future.",
    "Definitely recommend- very well taught and enjoyable. I learned a great deal and feel much more confident with my biostatistics knowledge now.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who want a solid introduction in how to do regression modeling. It is a core course, so it is required for most students.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend it because it is useful for real-world jobs.",
    "Very good course.",
    "It's a required class but if you put the time and effort into it, you'll be rewarded. If you can, choose Michelle as your TA! She's the best!",
    "material was really useful in terms of understanding epidemiological studies and statistical analyses that is used in public health research",
    "I would recommend it but mention that students need to keep up with the slides because the material goes fast.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "It's a required course that will give the bare bones of biostats. It's taught pretty well compared to what I have heard in the past. You will learn a ton, but if you want to specialize quantitatively, you will need more.",
    "OK. I would rather recommend Claus as a professor for Biostats or Desai's class.",
    "useful course",
    "It is required. The material is good to know, but it is SAS heavy.",
    "Great course for teaching fundamental biostatistics",
    "there is much overlap between this course and research methods - personally, i learned more application in research methods but found this class helpful in theory. fusion of the two course would be appropriate and allows room for students to take another course they prefer (especially with limited time of this program)",
    "- recommend this lab for learning sas",
    "I'd recommend this course to any student because it really provides you with useful theory behind the analytical methods used in epidemiology.",
    "I highly recommend it! The slides are a great resource and you will be fully prepared, even if the workload is intense.",
    "Absolutely essential for all public health students",
    "Very helpful course for summer internship and thesis writing",
    "I didn't take the first semester of biostats, and I'm glad I took this one. It's a great intro to statistics and will greatly help you learn SAS. Very friendly and helpful professor and TAs.",
    "YES! You will learn everything in a comprehensive way with a lot of help if you need it.",
    "Is Maria is teaching it, then YES I would definitely recommend it. I am way more comfortable with stats and what goes on behind the scenes in SAS and this course was a good jumping off point for my summer internship.",
    "It's a useful course",
    "A continuation of Bistat 1 but is more organized and straight forward. Much better at explaining how to use SAS than the fall biostat course.",
    "This course is well taught by the professor. Given the excellent (but long) slides, I would recommend NOT skipping lecture because the instructor does an excellent job explaining concepts in different ways, which makes it easier to learn the material.",
    "The course was very helpful for understanding biostats but the course format is boring and there are not a lot of opportunities to practice the skills",
    "As this course is required you must take it. However I would say it is not as user-friendly as one may think, but you do learn a great deal.",
    "I would recommend it - it was one of the most understandable and thorough statistics\/math courses I've ever taken."
