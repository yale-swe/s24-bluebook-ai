   "comments": [
    "if you consider high rates of production (of half-baked models and drawings) a skill, then that. there was an emphasis on quantity of work, so quick representation of ideas was a skill that we were forced to develop.",
    "I feel kind of conflicted about this class because I did feel like I learned and grew as a designer, but also felt pretty discouraged along the way. A lot of times their feedback and expectations are just completely unrealistic and it was confusing trying to even take some of the feedback because it just never felt like enough. I think maybe this class was just one big lesson on not relying on external validation to feel good about your work, because in the end, I felt happy with some of the stuff I did. But only after the class was over and I was able to appreciate my own work my own behalf.",
    "Learned a lot about how to think on my feet and thoroughly develop ideas over short periods of time.",
    "This studio is much more drawing-based than the previous and it was very helpful for me in improving digital drawing skills. Though a lot emphasis in creation was on drawing and collage, model-making was a large aspect as well, and the teaching staff was good about offering critical but helpful guidance with each coming step of the project.",
    "I learned that iteration is important (I knew that going into the course, but now it was applicably important) and that style-based critique can largely be disregarded.",
    "I developed technical design skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The overall structure of the course didn't really work. The firehouse project was a great project for our level, but by the end I just didn't feel like I had developed work because we didn't gain from each individual piece of the project. It's frustrating to not feel like you have developed work, so the whole class starts to feel like an exercise in futility.",
    "it is still too much work. while the teaching staff was generally fine in dealing with mental health issues, most of them lacked a serious awareness of our humanity as students and our multiple commitments outside of the class. the way they structured feedback time was soooo inefficient. desk crits are almost always the most helpful, but often they asked the group of half-prepared students to sit in on individual feedback. no one was engaged, and everyone's time was wasted.",
    "We spent the first month of the course working on a multi-step phase that, in the end, had nothing to do with my project. It could have been interesting, but I felt that we were not given enough time to put as much thought into it as was necessary for it to be worthwhile. I wish we could have used that time for our larger projects, as I think we all would have benefited from a few more weeks but instead it was kind of a waste in the long run.",
    "For a large portion of this semester it felt as though our professor were not aware of the workload of this class in conjunction with the other courses we take. There were at times discrepancies between what was expected of us and what we thought was expected to be delivered. All of the students in the class worked extremely hard at all times and sometimes it felt like that was a bit overlooked. Otherwise, the teaching staff as a whole was always very accommodating and willing to offer helpful advice. Each of them always took the time to talk to the students and make sure we were in the right direction for production in our projects.",
    "Weaknesses: 1. The site for the project was assigned after the prototype of the firehouse had been made. Honestly, you leave students with two options: 1. create a different design to not have any time for details and polishing and 2. keep the house; it was not designed with the neighborhood in mind at all, but it's pretty fleshed out and it will do. You can make some things up on the spot about how it conveniently speaks to the site somehow. 2. No good feedback. Ever. You criticize, you criticize, you criticize, just because you can. It's your job. You have different aesthetic preferences. I get it. You believe the student didn't think about a million different options just because all of them were not pinned up. Fine. You criticize the quality of the work when all of the options ARE pinned up, and the one you went with is both the wrong option in your opinion and not sufficiently polished. Okay. But the result is that most of us, even the most dedicated and enthusiastic die-hard studio hermits, have been disheartened. I have never seen my class so demotivated. Not a word of encouragement when we pour our hearts out into a design methodology. Everything needs to be done a different way. How many times have all of us started over? Those who didn't just had simple verticals because they didn't want to put in the time into a complex design just to scrap it all again. By mid-semester, we were just done. A lot of people decided never to take studio again and switch to urban studies. Strengths: I did stuff and if I work on it on my own after the end of the course, it might even represent my desires well enough to be included in my portfolio.",
    "I am appalled that Yale College allows this course to have such a heavy workload. Our professors and teaching assistants, while very interesting, pleasant, and at times considerate people, demanded far far too much work of us. While they claimed to advocate prioritizing our health and sleep over our work, the amount of work they constantly demanded, and the high degree of disappointment they showed when we failed to produce that work, spoke far more loudly than their words. Yale College must evaluate this course and this major with a high level of scrutiny, because currently this course along with ARCH250 and ARCH249 demand so much of all of us that we have had to sacrifice investment in our other academic pursuits, extracurricular activities, sleep, mental health, physical health, finances, and friendships. This course and this major are currently incompatible with the liberal arts pedagogy of Yale College. However, architecture has the potential to be a very interesting and interdisciplinary field, and I have hope that with coordination between the department and the college this major could be made into one of the best on campus.",
    "This class was incredibly frustrating, discouraging, overwhelming, anxiety-inducing, and disorganized. It made me really hate design and question whether this major was even for me. The prompts to each assignment were unnecessary long and confusing, and after about 20 minutes of questions back and forth, were actually able to be summarized in 2-3 sentences. Hours after assignments were given out, we would still be discussing amongst ourselves to figure out what the professors were actually asking for (and would often come to the next class session with assignments completed incorrectly). Additionally, there was little time to correct our mistakes or build upon what we had done previously, as we would get feedback but then immediately be expected to begin and complete a new (and often unrelated assignment). This caused most of us to have to scramble like crazy at the end of units or the semester to finish all of the work (I understand this is a part of all architecture studios, but this semester seemed unnecessarily stressful in this regard). I could write a novel about this course and the amount of tears that were spilled (not just mine! I think I saw more than half of us cry after\/during\/before a meeting or desk crit, out of frustration or discouragement or a combination of everything). I LOVE a challenge and found our fall studio engaging and exciting, but I think the hardest part about this course for me was that I ended feeling like I had learned nothing. I do not feel that I'm any better at design, maybe a little better at computer drawing (but even that -- didn't get a tutorial or any guidance about how to draw until the final class of the semester), and feel that the work we produced as a studio was far below what we have the potential to do, solely because of the unnecessary logistic challenges and confusion.",
    "I guess both strengths and weaknesses mainly come from the continuous problematization of our projects (for the prototype and the city). Also I feel that the requirements for the second assignment could have been slightly clearer.",
    "The course was more sensitive than previous studios to student budgets. It achieved this sensitivity through a focus on drawings, which was helpful in expanding the corresponding skill-set for many of us. It would be nice if this or another studio could find a way to work on modeling skills in a similar way without becoming exorbitantly expensive."

   "comments": [
    "Architecture juniors are going to take this no matter what, so my recommendation or lack thereof doesn't matter.",
    "only if you have to take it. at first it was exciting to have agency in working on a program\/design from scratch, but quickly i realized how much tedious work was being given that was tangential to the final product. we spent weeks on things that we never showed in review.",
    "Obviously only take this if you have to, but if you have to: it's not as bad as people say. Really. Just maintain a positive attitude and perhaps you will even ENJOY it, as I did. Well, parts of it. Just make sure that you ASK QUESTIONS when you don't understand the assignment, which will happen frequently. Sometimes you will need to ask a million questions, or the same question in a million different ways, and sometimes, different members of the teaching team will even have different ideas about what you should be doing. But I promise it is better to ask and understand what they want from you than to stress about doing it wrong. Good luck, and don't panic.",
    "If you're an architecture major you're gonna take the course so does this even matter. It was net good.",
    "Even after all the criticism and difficulty thinking of strengths of the course, the course in itself was strong. Why? Because even when the faculty is an obstacle instead of an assistance, you still self-teach. Studio is the chance to do what you want to do, grades be damned.",
    "I would only recommend this course in its current incarnation to the most dedicated of students who are willing to sacrifice their sleep, physical health, mental health, academics, social life, and extracurriculars.",
    "No, but it's required, so good luck and keep everything in perspective!",
    "Apart from the fact that you have to take it, just one thing -- don't be afraid of reaching out to the entire teaching team for clarifications, feedback and help. Given that the course is structured to continuously problematize your projects, effective communication within the studio is absolutely crucial.",
    "Studio gets better with the experience of the student, in my opinion. Each time you are a little more facile with your representational tools, leaving more room for developing your own ideas."
