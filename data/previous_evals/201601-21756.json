    "Take the class!",
    "It's the best book club experience you'll ever have. I think I became a better writer through reading other writers more than from writing a lot in the class.",
    "For the most part, this was a very interesting class. As many students have noted, a more apt title would probably be \"Mark's Reading Club.\" All of the works are about a core idea, but most of the class discussion is determined by whatever's on Mark's mind that week. It's a fun, but unguided class. Could benefit from a stricter syllabus. It seems like much of the class is designed to make it as low a work load as possible for Mark. Students don't get a chance to read one another's writing or give feedback to one another, which means that the seminar environment isn't as close-knit as it could be, nor is it much of a writing class outside of the final project. Would be great for people who don't want to do much other than their final project, and who are good at pacing themselves as they work slowly on it over the course of the semester. Mark is a great professor who makes himself very available to his students, if they reach out."
