   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed everything I learned in this course. Writing a systematic review as part of the whole course provided much skill and knowledge about conducting literature reviews and putting together a publishable paper. I definitely enjoyed the experience in this course.",
    "I absolutely loved this course: the material, the professor, and the assignments. Strengths include the way the material was presented (clearly, concisely, and in an interesting manner), the way the students were all interested in the topic of obesity, and the way it incorporated different viewpoints of obesity prevention (from surgery to exercise).I honestly can't think of any weaknesses to this course.",
    "Great course! I learned quite a bit and enjoyed the structure of the course - it was so helpful to do my first systematic review in such a supported way. Each part of the paper was due at one point along the semester, which really allowed us to work on each section in detail and get great feedback as the paper went on. By the time the end of the semester came, I didn't feel stressed or overwhelmed by the final paper - I felt confident about the work I put into it over the course of the semester. I wish more courses were like this! And we had GREAT guest speakers, who were really interesting but they also didn't dominate the class schedule, which was a good balance.",
    "I enjoyed the use of guest speakers and thought it was an appropriate amount in combination with regular lecture and class discussion. I wish there was time to cover topics more in depth. Perhaps a twice a week schedule instead of once a week schedule would help to accomplish this.",
    "Strengths: the opportunity to learn how to write a full systematic review and be able to publish on a topic the students are particularly interested in; the few guest lectures were very interesting, so perhaps more throughout the semesterWeaknesses: the workload from week to week is not consistent, as some weeks you tend to spend much more time on the assignment than other weeks",
    "Strengths- great instructor, interesting course materials , engaged studentsWeaknesses- insufficient communications about upcoming assignments. Also, doing an actual meta-analysis and teaching some statistical how-to's on meta-analysis would have been extremely helpful( instead of just doing a systematic review).",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, great and knowledgeable instructor",
    "Strengths-professor is always accessible to students, course covers all the relevant issues regarding obesity, great class speakers, the workload for the review is adequately distributed throughout the semester, professor provides detailed feedback on assignments.Weaknesses-although the course was really interesting, a different class time would have been great! Friday afternoons can sometimes be rough.",
    "Great! I learned how to write a lit review. I think a lot of the material isn't that new if you take a lot of other CDE\/SBS classes, but the process of writing the paper is helpful. I did enjoy learning about bariatric surgery.I liked how the paper was due incrementally over the semester. It also made finals super easy!!"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0The instructor was great at explaining concepts and providing feedback with respect to assignments. I did, however, feel the instructions for assignments weren't always clear.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Professor Irwin is amazing in teaching this course. She clearly knew the field in and out, was passionate about teaching the material to us (so lectures were never boring even though each one lasted just under two hours), and helped the class engage in spirited discussions.Additionally, I really appreciated how the assignments were always handed back with helpful comments the next week. The guest lecturers she brought in were great as well and I always left class feeling like I had learned a lot of new material about a field I'm personally interested in.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda is so great. She's so animated and passionate, which really helps keep student engaged during lectures. I'm so grateful for how responsive she was with emails, how late she'd respond in the evenings, and how encouraging she was. I hope I get to study with her again!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0A charismatic and passionate person, Dr. Iriwn is very capable of engaging the class in discussion and getting the students excited about the subject material. She is very outgoing, understanding of her students' situations and experiences, and is always willing to provide extra help with our systematic reviews.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda is a great role model, very engaged and friendly, and I enjoyed the course immensely",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Strengths: Great feedback and research experience, very approachable",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Great!! Enthusiastic about topic, highly knowledgeable, receptive to students' comments and feedback, always available to meet, always in a good mood, fair.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin was an excellent instructor. She was very knowledgable on the subject and had great enthusiasm for the material that made her lectures very engaging. She gave detailed, constructive feedback on our assignments and was very approachable for students who wanted to ask questions.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0She's very engaging and personable."

   "comments": [
    "I do recommend students to take this course if they are interested in learning more about obesity prevention interventions and conducting a systematic review.",
    "This course is about the different methods of obesity prevention and the direction the field has taken in the past decade or so. The material is relevant to modern-day America and is taught in such an engaging manner. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Great course, wonderful addition to behavioral studies and the current public health crisis of obesity. Melinda is wonderful!",
    "A great course about obesity and lifestyle interventions. It can be a lot of work sometimes, since the whole course is geared towards writing a full systematic review, but as long as you remain caught up with assignments, you will be fine. I believe this is one of the few courses where you learn how to write an entire systematic review in just one semester, so that in itself is amazing. And being able to publish your paper is an incredible opportunity.",
    "Anybody interested in Obesity should take the course: review current epidemiological data, and learn how to do systematic reviews.",
    "Yes, if interested in obesity research.",
    "Definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend it! Don't expect to learn a lot of content, but if you want to learn to write a solid lit review, and have a prof that will help you get it published, then it's a good course to take."
