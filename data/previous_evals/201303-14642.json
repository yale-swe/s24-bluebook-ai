   "comments": [
    "778 gave a detailed look at many different types of mechanisms. Although we couldn't get into incredible detail on each type, it was enough of a head start that I would feel much more confident designing a device using one of these mechanisms in the future, and I am more aware of the broad range of mechanisms available to enhance my design creativity. I would recommend the course to a student who is interested in learning some details about mechanisms which are relevant to advanced robotics applications. They should probably be familiar with basic linear algebra and differential equations before taking the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me to pick up many advanced robotics and mechanisms concepts which I had previously been interested in and exposed to, but had not had the time to learn in depth. Not all concepts will connect directly to my dissertation research, but some of them do, and I anticipate making use of almost all of them at some point in my future career."
