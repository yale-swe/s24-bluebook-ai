   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Great course. The course was well taught and organised. The course material were helpful in building my understanding. The weekly assignments helped to reinforce my leanings. The TA and Professor were always happy to respond to my questions. Weakness: Course is taught too late in the evening",
    "Strengths of the course: touches upon basics of finance and accounting; learning to financially evaluate a company Weaknesses: too short for students to fully grasp financial concepts; needs to be a full semester (as there are no basic finance courses offered for FES Students, aside from Accounting)",
    "Strengths: I really didn't know anything about finance before so I was able to learn a ton of new information that I know will be useful going forward. Weaknesses: I lacked genuine interest & stake in a lot of the lecture concepts, especially toward the end of the class. I mainly cared about finance basics (some of the stuff listed in question 1) and how it can be used as a tool for advocacy. Also, I do not expect I will be using any of the equations\/mathematics that we learned, and yet we spent an extremely long time calculating stuff. I think a more thorough understanding of the concepts behind the math is more important and wish we could have focused on this instead.",
    "The strength of course is depth of the material you can cover in such a short period of time. Professor Burke was very good at managing the timing of the course and offered a chance to do practice problems that were similar to the homework. The weakness of the course was that it was a bit overwhelming at times and to understand some of the tricks on the homework, I found it necessary to go to weekly office hours.",
    "Strengths: very knowledgable teacher Weakness: Move too fast through too many concepts",
    "Strengths: Materials are extremely clear and thorough, and all assigned exercises have practical value. In-class exercises are helpful in preparing one to do the homework. Weaknesses: Lectures are quite dull and sometimes difficult to follow. I learned more from reading the material on my own and engaging with the homework.",
    "Very exercise based, which helped a lot",
    "The weakness was really that it was so late at night. I was exhausted by 8pm when the class ended. The strengths were that the class taught a lot but not in a way that felt like it was asking too much. It felt just right.",
    "I thought this was a good class to get an introduction to finance\/accounting",
    "It may be more beneficial if this was a full term 3 credit course",
    "Problem sets and in class exercises very useful",
    "Very fast paced and lecture\/powerpoint notes are hard to follow when reviewing for homework.",
    "Strengths: Pace sufficiently fast, material covered sufficiently challenging Weaknesses: Instructor could provide more examples and clearer slides and notes that can be reviewed outside of class",
    "I really appreciated that we received grades on our weekly assignments and went over the homework in class. However, the course could be improved by reducing the content, slowing down the pace, and giving us more time to complete in class assignments so that we can more fully grasp the material. Alternatively, it would be useful if we watched videos of the lecture and slides before class so that we could slow down or rewind if we didn't understand and so we could spend more time on the in class assignments.",
    "The course often felt like a firehose of information. I would love to make this a full-semester class if at all possible. It was impossible to complete the problem sets without group work or attending office hours. I would also really appreciate if exact excel formulas would be given for the exercises- though I grasped the abstract concepts translating them into perfect excel work was another thing entirely. Strengths of the course include the well thought out problem sets that addressed renewable energy subsides etc. A ton of material was covered as well!",
    "strengths: basic concepts covered very well weakness: No video recording, Please record them so that students cam refer to them if they miss class (e.g. due to COP, illness) or want to clarify so e concepts later",
    "The lecture notes are very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Take it! Its a really easy course that teaches the basics of finance. Do the weekly assignments early, while the concepts are still fresh on your mind and you'll be fine.",
    "If you are trying to understand very basic financial concepts, this is the course for you. Otherwise, you should be taking Accounting or Renewable Energy Project Finance to get a better grasp of concepts and financial modeling that will help you further down the road personally and professionally.",
    "Go to the office hours. A LOT of information is covered in a little amount time, so office hours is the only way to complete the homework correctly and learn how to do the work.",
    "This is a decent amount of work in the end of the semester, so only commit if you absolutely have the time. Looking back, I wish I would have audited the class instead. I certainly learned a lot in lectures and appreciated the way the lecture was organized, but I did not find the homework to be particularly useful for what I'll be doing in the future.",
    "Definitely go to office hours and feel free to reach out to the professor with questions.",
    "Only take this if you know for sure that you would like to pursue financial tasks in the future",
    "Don't expect this course to be easy! There is a LOT of work for a 1-credit course. However, the course has real practical value and I'm glad that I decided to take it.",
    "Very useful for professional life",
    "If you want a deep dive into financial concepts this is the right class. It is all about spreadsheets and calculations",
    "Its a fairly heavy workload for one credit, but if you want a general intro to some financial ideas its a good strategy. For a real deep dive, take REPF.",
    "Allocate a fair amount of time for the home work assignments. This is one course for which sessions with the TA are useful.",
    "Attend each class to practice exercises",
    "The homework will take longer than anticipated. Take very detailed notes to review each week to help make following along with the powerpoint easier.",
    "Do not fall behind on the lectures and homework.",
    "This course an intensive workload for a one credit course so get ready to work hard, especially if you are completely new to this topic.",
    "Attend all office hours and work in groups!",
    "Group study and in-class exercise are very helpful."
