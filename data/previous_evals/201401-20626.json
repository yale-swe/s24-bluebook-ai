    "I would encourage anyone to take this class. If only to balance out the insanity of your other coursework. I really enjoyed being stretched in new ways through engaging with the musical concepts. I also came away with a new skill having been tasked with writing out a piece of music for our final project. Now I'll be able to write out little compositions. I am very happy I took tis class!",
    "It's a great class. Really relaxed and enjoyable and a great way to learn some music theory. It was fun nearly every time. The work doesn't take too long either.",
    "Take it if you want an introduction to music\/music theory; it's pretty straightforward.",
    "A basic introduction to music theory. Would recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for those wishing to receive a thorough introduction to music theory. There can be a lot of homework at times, which is very necessary to understand unfamiliar concepts, but it's not difficult. Musicians and non-musicians can appreciate this course."
