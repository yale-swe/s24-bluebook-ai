   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would, particularly if they're interested the material. I would summarize it as: a history of the development of the relationship between philosophy and religion during the Enlightenment.",
    "My summary of the class would likely depend on what the fellow student hoped to get out of her coursework. But I would emphasize that many students, across field and level of experience and intellectual orientation, can benefit from this class. This is a class that plumbs the foundations of western philosophical history and thinks critically about modes of discourse that have built contemporary politics, law, philosophy, and critique. Even (especially) for a student who has a steep learning curve in the course (as I did), the intellectual payoff is huge if you put in the work. Ive come away from this class with increased capacity for critical agency over the texts I study (which are fairly far removed from the ones we read, at least in my mind at the beginning of the semester). I also have become a better reader. So, yes, I would recommend this classor really, any class that Prof. Khawaja teachesto any other student, without reservation."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely feel as though I understand Hume, Kant, and Hegel on religion better than I did before taking the course.",
    "This course made a superlative contribution to both my research and knowledge of my discipline. It did so by probing the historical and philosophical interplay between concepts of Christianity, history, and human differenceall terms and concepts that are at the fore of my research, but are rarely interrogated in such a foundational and illuminating way, especially in tandem with each other. In some ways, this class was like the experience of taking a weeklong trip to the Grand Canyon, after spending weeks being impressed by pictures of it on Google Images. You realize just how big and complex it is, and you feel kind of dumb for being impressed by the JPEGs on your computer screen, which can't possibly do justice to the experience itself. But neither can a visit of just one weekso now you want to go back again and again to figure out what you were missing before. At the beginning of the semester, this is not a class that I really expected to be so important to my workwhich is my own flawso Im really grateful for having had the chance to be in it. I do think that coming out of it, many things will look different."
