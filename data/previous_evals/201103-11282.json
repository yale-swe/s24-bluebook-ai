    "This course covers a mix of negotiation and meeting facilitation.",
    "I thought that the instructor did a very good job with this course. Class time was used efficiently, materials in and out of class were valuable and informative, and the out of class exercises and assignments were useful and enlightening.",
    "I believe the strengths of this class rely on having better case studies and letting students get more involved in an actual environmental negotiation or conflict. Although the professor's effort was good, there was a bit of disconnection with students.",
    "In general, the course was very valuable, but the pace felt a bit slow at times.",
    "More negotiations exercises outside of class to be reported on and discussed during class would be good additions.",
    "This Course is valuable, but mabe he name confounds people. It is a course to help you become a coach on conflict resolution, but I was expecting a course focused on negotiation.",
    "Course was able to provide only a very rudimentary and introductory appreciation of negotiation and conflict resolution. There was no specific emphasis on environmental issues and negotiations related to them."

    "The breakout exercise on Kroon sustainability was weak. Would have been good for us to know we were going to do this in advance, so that we could think beforehand some helpful recommendations.",
    "perhaps too many assignments for a 1 unit course.",
    "The only complaint I have is that the supplemental materials (especially the readings and case studies) available to students should have been explained just so we knew what was available to use to help with the assignments or potentially of use to us in the future or if we were curious.",
    "More time devoted to practical exercises and techniques would be beneficial.",
    "Pace of the course--a bit rushed.",
    "Attractive study cases",
    "more engagement during class time",
    "More content related to negotiation rather than facilitation.",
    "This course would be worth developing into a three credit semester long course.",
    "1. More practical sessions2. More emphasis on negotiation and conflict resolution in the context on environmental issues3. More role playing4. Address advanced needs of students who already have some exposure to negotiation and conflict resolution",
    "The course should start at the beginning of the semester rather than during midterms season."

    "The simulations were great exercises. I did miss out on a group simulation due to my own oversight, and because the groups were self organized and there was no formal sign-up, there was no feedback loop to help me catch my mistake.",
