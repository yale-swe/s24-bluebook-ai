    "This course brought me through intense and challenging scholarship in metaethics. It was a high level philosophy course and developed the skills to analyse difficult and rigorous philosophy texts.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor knows material very well, really great explanations Weaknesses: Discussions get off track, all the assigned material was rarely covered in one class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Darwall is an expert in the field; to be taught by someone so eminent in his area of expertise is a huge privilege and pleasure. The course is a little challenging especially for undergraduates, given there are so many graduate students in the seminar. It could benefit from being a little more accessible to undergraduates, perhaps by walking through the texts more slowly during seminar, instead of heading straight for analysis.",
    "Strengths: very interesting material - if you keep up with the readings and discussion you will learn a lot. Weaknesses: the class attracts a lot of men, mostly grad students. The environment was more scary than welcoming for undergraduate women. Also, the grad students seemed to have a discussion group in addition to the class. Why didn't the undergrads? Since the material is more challenging to undergrads, why not have an extra session for them as well?",
    "The course readings were consistently fantastic. I wish that more people had been encouraged to speak in seminar. Often the same voices dominated discussion.",
    "Strengths only, except that the class was too large. But this the college's problem, not the class's.",
    "Quite dense, and can get pretty into the weeds. But very informative.",
    "The seminar was too big. Too many people made discussion feel disconnected at times, and needing to go over many peoples response papers in a single class made the discussion rushed at times. Other than that, an enjoyable course."

   "comments": [
    "Metaethics is very abstract, so I would only take if you feel like you can stay engaged despite that. I definitely enjoyed learning about more contemporary philosophy (as compared to many other philosophy classes).",
    "Metaethics is an interesting subject, although some of the views we covered are quite technical. We often got sidetracked by ~*certain people*~ during discussion, which was not ideal.",
    "The subject material of the class is extremely narrow, and requires a deep investment in this very specific corner of contemporary philosophy to really get the most out of the class.",
    "If you are a philosophy student and keen on learning about metaethics, take it with Professor Darwall!",
    "Yes, take the course. But please try to speak in class, do the readings, and think earnestly about the material. It is not small potatoes.",
    "If you are a philosophy major looking to fulfil the ethics and value theory requirement, absolutely take this class. If you have ever wondered about what morality is or could be, this course will serve as a wonderful introduction to the various philosophical views that exist. There are some downsides to the course. Seminar is often dominated by a few voices expressing the same view every week, and I felt Professor Darwall could have done a better job of encouraging new voices to speak. Besides this, the course was excellent. The professor also does not give grades on the written assignments. As of the time of writing, I have no idea as to my standing in the course. As much as I appreciate the emphasis on learning rather than grades as this gesture implies, I feel that most students would appreciate knowing how their work holds up. Keep this in mind when considering taking the course.",
    "I would indeed. It approaches the right idiom for thinking about the ethical. Professor Darwall is terrific (see below).",
    "If you have background, or are ready to put the work into it, I would recommend. But if you are a bit unprepared, it can be very hard to catch up."
