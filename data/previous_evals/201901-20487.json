    "The course offers an intriguing overview of many of the technologies that define our world today: Why do florescent light flicker when they turn on? How is information encrypted? What is the current state and future of solar power?",
    "I learned primarily about EM waves.",
    "Physics skills",
    "Tons about how physics is applied in techonology used today",
    "A background in the workings of various modern technologies. Information that I would have never otherwise happened upon that's helped me to appreciate how complex and taken-for-granted these technologies are!",
    "A lot of cool stuff. For example, how information theory and bitcoin work.",
    "I learned the physics concepts in place behind a large amount of modern technology, including the history of the technology and how our understanding of physics has impacted the modern world.",
    "Truly interesting tidbits about current technology, everything from the basic physics principles that govern them to possible future applications",
    "In this class I learned about a lot of the technology that I use everyday and the properties of physics that go into making those things work. I developed my logic skills and learned how to think about topics theoretically.",
    "a basic understanding of the physics behind a variety of technologies",
    "As a non-stem major, I managed to learn a lot of physics, but I also learned how to take a lecture science class. I learned how to prepare for tests and fit weekly problem sets into my study schedule, which was a personal change of pace.",
    "I learned some new physics concepts and a lot of applications in modern technology like cell phones, displays, VR headsets, etc.",
    "Developed a basic understanding of how a variety of different technologies work."

   "comments": [
    "the organization of the course was good. the exams were surprisingly difficult",
    "The course is very well structured; exams are highly relevant to what is taught in class. Teaching style, homework, everything was perfect for me.",
    "Easy",
    "Overall a good class. Parts are easy and class is well taught",
    "strengths: professor available to provide ample support and answer questions, really fascinating examples\/explanations given during lecture weaknesses: questions on psets\/exams often unclearly phrased, not enough info in lecture with regards to approaching pset problems, emphasis on math when most of what we learn in lecture is conceptual",
    "IT IS AN AMAZING CLASS. TAKE IT.",
    "The weekly psets are a great aspect of the course because they require weekly engagement with the material and were often quite interesting. The only improvement to this class would be more office hours with a TF, which has nothing to do the course material.",
    "I think this course is incredibly well-built for non-stem students looking to be deeply engaged in basic material. In that sense, the wealth of resources provided (lecture slides, problem sets, practice exam problems, office hours, book page numbers, etc) helped to guide me through the semester.",
    "I loved the setup of the class with learning physics concepts first and then their various applications. However, the lecture notes weren't posted online so a lot of the time I was focused on writing everything down and not spending as much time listening and understanding the concepts.",
    "The material is very interesting. Professor Miller is a great professor and all-around good guy."

   "comments": [
    "ehh, probably not. it was kind of boring and somewhat challenging for not really being a requirement for anything.",
    "This would be a good science credit for those non-science majors. You do not need a very strong math background to handle the materials.",
    "Yes! It's a great SC\/QR credit, with interesting material, a wonderful professor, and a very reasonable amount of work. In many ways, this course embodies what distributional requirements are meant to fulfill -- a chance to explore a subject far from one's own focus without a ton of pressure.",
    "I would recommend this course to any humanities student. It was the only physics course I took that made me feel like I had developed an intuitive sense of the science. I fee much better prepared to talk about the science behind certain questions and technological applications that are important to humanities.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The Technological World is the ideal SC\/QR credit for humanities majors. It is fast-paced and full of content so you won't feel like you're wasting your time like you would with a gut (this is NOT a gut). Additionally, the grounding of the class in actual technology makes the low-level physics easy to understand. Professor Miller is an engaging lecturer who tries to make class interesting and accessible.",
    "Yes good class",
    "Yes great for a science or QR credit and you learn a bunch of interesting things about how the world works",
    "yes, but only if you're willing to do a lot of work to keep up.",
    "Absolutely. If you are a CS student how is looking for a science student like me, this is a perfect class. You can use your reasoning skill well enough to this class. If you are a non STEM major, this course is also good for you because there is no heavy math involved.",
    "Absolutely! I thought this course was incredibly engaging, well-taught, and perfectly proportioned. The knowledge and skills that I gained in this class I will never forget.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to any non QR students that are looking to fill in the requirement.",
    "great class for a humanities student with a basic understanding of math\/physics (nothing past high school level necessary)! would recommend!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's pretty straightforward and if you put in the work, you will definitely see outcomes.",
    "Yes, it was really fascinating to learn about the physics behind a lot of things we use in day to day life that to me seemed to work like magic. Now, I'm able to reason about the different concepts behind a certain technology.",
    "I would recommend this to someone looking for a manageable science credit that is NOT necessary a gut."
