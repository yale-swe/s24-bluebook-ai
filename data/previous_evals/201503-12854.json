   "comments": [
    "YES! Take this course if you take the lecture. It was the highlight of every week. You eat delicious food, get to know a great group of classmates and instructors, go on interesting field trips, and leave the class with practical skills.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This was the highlight of my semester, and if you get the chance I would highly recommend. Very low workload, and a great way to spend your Tuesday afternoons.",
    "If you can get in, YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO TAKE IT. I had a really rough semester with my other classes but this was the one shining moment in every week when I could go in and forget about all the other work I had to do and just look at plants and draw them for 3 hours and eat tons of food. THEY GIVE YOU TONS OF FOOD. And it's the coolest food that you won't be able to get easily anywhere else. FOOD. You get half a credit for eating food and drawing and they don't even grade you on your drawing abilities.",
    "Amazing! A great complement to the lecture, and lots of fun.",
    "Take this class! You get to eat delicious food, draw plants in a cozy greenhouse, and gain a lot of knowledge about plants and their evolution. You will learn a lot, go on awesome field trips, and have fun!",
    "Plants, snacks, evolutionary history, and one of the best professors at Yale. What more could you ask for? Take this class if at all possible (although try to do so concurrently with the lecture for the full experience).",
    "If you're taking the lecture, definitely take the lab. You hang out in the green house for a few hours a week, just looking and plants and drawing them. Every week there is food from whatever plant group you're studying, so you get a feast while you draw. It's the most chill lab. Professor Donoghue and the TAs love plants so much that it's infectious, and are always there to tell you the cool features of whatever plant you're drawing. (That being said, the lecture is harder than the lab - lots of memorization, but fairly standard for E&EB organismal diversity classes in my experience.)",
    "I loved Plant Diversity and Evolution. Professor Donoghue is the best and really makes you appreciate the many nuances of the plant world. It's best to take the class with the lab because the two really build off of one another. Additionally, the field trips were fantastic.",
    "Take it. Take it if you have any interest at all. Wonderful course, very light workload (there's literally no out-of-class work, and in-class your work is \"to study and draw plants\"), really complements the lecture. Seriously, it's way easier to remember random plant groups when you were drawing (and possibly eating) them the week before. It's a fantastic break from other schoolwork and a great excuse to spend a lot of time in the greenhouses.",
    "Plants lab on Tuesday afternoon was almost always the highlight of my week, almost always. Take the lecture, and take this lab with it, whether or not you are an EEB or even science major. You will take a couple fantastic field trips, eat exotic fruits, and learn a ton with enthusiastic instructors.",
    "I would recommend this course as a fun lab credit.",
    "Going up to Marsh Botanical Gardens for this lab every Tuesday was literally the highlight of each week this semester. It was so wonderful to be able to touch, draw, and dissect plants from all the families we were learning about (definitely take the lab if you are taking the lecture). It was also such a warm, relaxed, supportive atmosphere - I loved every moment of this lab.",
    "A good class if you need an lab for the major, or if you just want to learn more about plants and hang out in a great place with good people.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking E&EB 247L to anyone who is taking the concurrent lecture and who is looking for half a credit. It's an absolute blast. You'll learn a ton about plant anatomy, and Prof. Donoghue and the TAs are very, very good. The greenhouses have a ton of really interesting plants, and the field trips (to Guilford and the New York Botanical Garden) are super-interesting too. It mostly amounts to drawing plants for 3 hours each week, with no work from lab to lab; even if you're bad at drawing, like me, it doesn't matter, so don't let that scare you. You'll come away from the course knowing so much more about the world around you; it'll really change the way you look at things. Also, each week they bring in a huge variety of different food related to the plants under study for that week, so you'll get to eat a huge range of weird and awesome things, from dragonfruit to durian. It's a great half-credit and a great way to fulfill your organismal biology lab credit in E&EB.",
    "If you are taking E&EB 246 anyway (which I highly suggest you do), definitely put in the extra 3 hours a week to take this lab. It's low stress, basically sitting around drawing\/eating\/dissecting plants for an afternoon and proved to be one of the most relaxing activities in my schedule all semester, strange as that may sound. Make note of the fact that this takes place in the Marsh Greenhouse, not in Marsh Hall, and is on Mansfield St past the old Winchester rifle factory. Again, I cannot recommend this class more highly, for non-scientists, senior E&EBers, general evolution fans and everything in between."
