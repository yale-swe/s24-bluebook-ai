   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course needs to be taught 5 days a week. It is too hard to learn a language with only two days of practice with a native speaker each week. As well, 75 minutes is too long of a time to spend learning new things about a language. The course could stay at 75 minutes, but at least 30 of that would need to be dedicated to time where we could just practice speaking.",
    "Strength: I learned a lot of grammar and structure. I had lots of opportunities to practice conversing in Hebrew. It was a fun class and a good community. It was a manageable workload.",
    "Sometimes it felt like time was weirdly spread. We'd spend a lot of time learning to conjugate words we had already learned but not a lot of time on tenses that felt newer. Overall, still pretty good and helpful",
    "I think a little bit more review of previous material expected to be known from previous courses would be helpful especially for new students who place into L3.",
    "The course moved somewhat slowly and the semester project did not feel relevant to the rest of the course or useful for improving our Hebrew skills. Conversation sessions with our TA, Naama, were very enjoyable and good speaking practice. I did feel that my Hebrew improved over the course of the semester, although I wish we had learned more grammar. A lot of what we studied also felt repetitive.",
    "I like the conversations",
    "Strengths: Very comprehensive, taught in an interesting, engaging manner. Material well communicated. Professor was awesome, cared about the students, and taught the material well Weaknesses: A lot of the homework seemed unnecessary and like busy work"

    "Yes! Hebrew is one of my favorite classes. The whole department is like a little family. The professors (especially Orit) all take care of you and are very receptive to your needs and are always willing to help. This is a relaxing class that will get you to meet other people in a fun, engaging way in addition to learning Hebrew.",
    "Yes! It was a fun class, I learned a lot, and it wasn't overly stressful.",
    "Yes, it is helpful and the workload is very reasonable.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn hebrew, this course is a great stepping stone to do so.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in improving their Hebrew. Hebrew at Yale is manageable and Orit is incredibly nice.",
    "Yes, I liked the class",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who would like to better their Hebrew and gain a solid understanding of the mechanics of Hebrew."
