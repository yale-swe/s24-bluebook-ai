   "comments": [
    "Introductory graduate level macroeconomic models",
    "I learned how to use mathematical tools such as excel spreadsheet and implicit differentiation to analyze macroeconomic models. Beyond the technical skills, I gained insight into not only how the macroeconomy works, but what assumptions and belief underlie the system. I also learned a new method for looking at dynamics in a general sense.",
    "Good course to study the higher levels of macro models. Not a lot of memorization and instead focuses on understanding the models, which I thought was a big plus compared to the intro macro course.",
    "This course is a very intellectual and mathematical approach to macroeconomics. I think that the approach of the course allows you to more fundamentally grasp macroeconomics compared to a less mathematical approach.",
    "I learned about the economy and its dynamics.",
    "I learned how to evaluate mathematical macroeconomic models.",
    "I found this class to have a nice overlap between the mathematical theory and tools behind macroeconomics and the real world situations they can be applied towards.",
    "I learned several quantitative economics reasoning skills. Also understood the inner workings of a specific model."

   "comments": [
    "The course is amazing in terms of the contents it teach. Give you a brief overview of lots of modern economic models. However, there is no good textbook matching the level of the material and the professor only provides a few notes for particular topic. Therefore, sometimes I am very confused.",
    "Some of the weaknesses related to the course was how little materials and resources were made available. This was in part due to a lack of lecture notes, but more importantly the material had changed since last year and because the constantly changing nature of Macroeconomics, everything we learned from the course seemed to have been investigated fairly recently. In the same vein, this makes the course great in that we are looking at the most recent developments and changes in Macroeconomics, however this takes away from the structure of the course, which I think this course needs.",
    "Course was well organized but occasionally Professor Smith would get a bit lost trying to explain the material. Overall though he was great and I liked the course a lot.",
    "The class is great. I think the only portion that could be improved would be the problem sets which tend to sometimes have no clear answer. Some sort of hint or assumptions that would allow one to more clearly answer the questions would be useful. Otherwise the class was fantastic - no complaints.",
    "The course was very topical and covered many materials that have been updated in recent years.",
    "This course did well to educate students regarding the manipulation of macroeconomic models. However, the course could have done better in teaching students the assumptions behind these models, and the evidence for these assumptions.",
    "Very well done class! I do think that we should be using a different textbook. There were times when lecture went more in depth and there were no posted lecture notes which made it difficult to study\/review.",
    "Can be improved by uploading notes or having a textbook for the second half of the course. Without such material, it is difficult to attain a rigorous understanding."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes if you are interested in economic model and want to do a PhD.",
    "If you find mathematics and economics both enjoyable, with more of an emphasis on the economics over the math, this course is a very good combination for you to take. The math in this course was not very difficult once you got the hang of it after a week. I took this course over 122 because I thought it would be more math and less memorization of economic concepts which it was, but also forced me to think about economic concepts in terms of mathematics which was very insightful. Definitely take it if you have to or have any interest in macro.",
    "This course is great for understanding the fundamentals that underly higher level macro models. You get exposed to a bunch of models and weekly problem sets test your knowledge of those. The two exams are basically slightly modified version of the problem sets, so as long as you keep up with those and understand the models, the course shouldn't be too difficult.",
    "If you have a bent towards math and\/or mathematical economics, you really should take this course. If you're considering a combined Math and Econ major or the Applied Math major with a concentration in Econ, you really should be in this class. At the very worst, you realize you don't like mathematical economics. But I think that the class material is fairly stimulating and gives you a firm grasp on the topic.",
    "It was a great course to gain a slightly more in depth understanding of macroeconomics, with some mathematical analysis.",
    "I think this is a fine class to take at Yale. I expected it to be even more rigorous, given that it is the theoretical version of the course, but it is an engaging class. It is far less mathematical than microeconomic theory.",
    "Yes, definitely (if you're a little more math-y than the average Econ student). This class is far better taught and organized than Micro Theory so if you didn't enjoy that class don't let it scare you into taking the standard Intermediate Macro.",
    "Much better than the standard non theory intermediate macro class. Goes much deeper into the map and get to understand the models better."
