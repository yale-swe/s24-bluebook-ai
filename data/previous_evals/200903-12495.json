   "comments": [
    "Absolutely do not take this class. It was excruciating to sit through for two hours each week. This is probably the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Powell has a gift for facilitating diverse discussions on Congressional politics and organized the material in an extremely satisfying manner. I really enjoyed coming to seminar each week and found the readings very well selected.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. I would warn them, however, that it focuses more on political parties and Congressional theory than it does on specific Congressional leaders.",
    "This was Professor Powell's first year, and I think the class will be better once it's been tweaked more. This year, there were only seven of us and Professor Powell didn't have alot of specific avenues for discussion, so there would often be awkward silences once the people who wanted to answer a question made their comments and there wasn't a natural flow. Hopefully this is something that will be worked on for future years. Also, there was much more political theory than I had thought there would be: a lot of the readings were about theories of why parties form in legislatures and how important parties are in Congress. The two best books we read were not of this nature--The Thumpin', a book about Rahm Emmanuel and the 2006 Democratic takeover of the House that was extremely interesting and a quick read, and Masters of the House, a more historical look at Speakers of the House. It would have been great to have more books like that in the class. As far as the workload, it was not bad at all; we just had one two-page reading response and a 15-page research paper, for which we had to write a rough draft about a month before the final paper was due. There was an average of a book a week, though, so if you do all of the reading it's 200-300 pages each week.",
    "I imagine the class formulation will change next time around, but this class involved more theory and fewer case studies than I had originally expected. However, Professor Powell is very knowledgeable and eager to help students, so if you're at all interested in the subject matter, certainly at least shop it."
