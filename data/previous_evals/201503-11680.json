    "Overall, the class is good. The workload is reasonable and the material is interesting. Professor Silberschatz is very dedicated to the class, though lectures can be a bit dry at times. There were only a few problem sets and all were pretty straightforward. The course project was the most substantial assignment but it was enjoyable to work on. The midterm and final exam were a little challenging but very fair.",
    "It's fine.",
    "Good introduction to databases, teaches you SQL and fundamental concepts of databases. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's pretty straightforward and the lecture slides are online. There were 3 HW's that took a few hours. The midterm and final were a lot of memorization but fair and straightforward. The project was enjoyable and wasn't a huge commitment.",
    "By the end of this class, you will know the basics of SQL and how DBMSes work, and enough knowledge to \"know how to look stuff up when you need to know it.\" You can totally learn everything the night before the exam, and there are only three easy assignments and a small project. That being said... since we have an *actual* databases class (that isn't *too* much work according to reviews) you should probably take that one and actually get some coding experience out of it. This class definitely won't help you get a job. Personally, I think Yale should seriously reconsider offering classes like CPSC 437. Since we have a finite amount of resources for CS classes, if we nixed 437 and replaced it with a machine-learning or programming-oriented elective, we would all be 10x better off, right?",
    "437 is a solid CS elective - not the best, but far from the worst. The homeworks were straightforward and helpful, and the final project was fun. The exams can come out of left field, but Debayan was working to improve that.",
    "Recommended if you have a heavy schedule. It was good to learn SQL and the very basic level system side of database without any stressful assignments. The final project was fun to do. You could do some cool machine learning project that incorporates database.",
    "I really liked this course. I was hesitant to take it because previous reviews were not that great, but there was a lot of useful material covered in the course, and I feel like I left it with a strong handle on databases and how to use them. Avi explained things well, and while he sticks to the dry \"lecture from powerpoint\" format, he goes through the material as well as can be done in this way. He is also very nice and welcoming. You don't ONLY learn how to use SQL. You learn about how to design a database, how databases are structures, how to make complex queries, how queries are optimized, transactions, concurrency, recovery during transaction failure, indexing, and storage. Some of the topics overlap a little with 323 (though in less detail), which is nice if you're taking them concurrently. Debayan is literally the best TA ever - he really makes the course a good one. The work is very minimal. They said we would have 5 homeworks, but we ended up having only three. Each took 2-5 hours. There was also a project. This project can be whatever amount of work you want. They don't expect you to build something amazing, just something that works and uses databases. It's a good opportunity to build something of your own, especially since most Yale CS courses don't have such a big a project component. Debayan is also very helpful throughout the process. The exams were straightforward - study and you will do well. Overll, very chill but very useful course. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Good class, especially with Debayan as TA.",
    "This is basically a survey level course. Material is kind of dull and not made more interesting by teaching, slides are read verbatim, and there is more rote memorization than focus on interesting theory. That said, it is not that difficult, and you might find yourself learning some interesting\/useful things about databases, which are admittedly quite important. If you go to class and pay attention it will be easy, but thats much easier said than done (welcome to Yale CS). Beware, though, work is heavily backloaded."
