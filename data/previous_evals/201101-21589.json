   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Overall, assigned readings are very interesting (some are more dry than other) and lectures are amazing.",
    "The professor's take on the material is disagreeable even though the material is interesting. The section is often dominated by an illegitimate coalition.But the lectures are very good and take it with writing credit.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in philosophy.",
    "not unless your actually interested in philosophy. im interested in politics but this class was much more philosophy-based which didnt appeal to me. although it was worth it because it's a great writing credit",
    "This class is great for people who want a broad introduction to political science, because you read a lot of important texts and don't get too bogged down in any of them.",
    "Good course for political science majors looking for a writing credit",
    "Moral Foundations of Politics is exactly would it says it is. It looks at different political theorists and there take on how politics should be done. I think it is a great class for anyone to take.",
    "Take it writing intensive. The only work you have to do the entire semester is two 2500-3000 word essays. There are a lot of readings, but they are largely unnecessary. If you take this writing intensive, the class will literally only be part of your life for two weeks out of the semester.",
    "If you are remotely interested in being a Poly-Sci major take this class. It gives students a thorough understanding of the underlying moral arguments in political philosophy over the last 300 years. The workload is very manageable, it is an easy writing credit (if that's what you are looking for), and the material is very useful and relevant to modern politics.",
    "I would recommend the course. This course goes over some of the main philosophers that shape political thought such as Bentham, Marx, Rawls, etc. The lectures are interesting and Shapiro is a wonderful lecturer. The sections are really not good or fun and your TA influences what grade you get so shop around before you commit yourself to one. I took the course non-writing and the take home midterm (as opposed to 2 papers) was not a big deal (3 one thousand word mini-essays in three days). Overall I liked this course but I did not think it was easy.",
    "Absolutely take this course. I would also suggest to take it writing intensive if A) that's a possibility and B) if you need a writing credit. Great gut that teaches you useful political ideology.",
    "Lots of readings that are very boring, but you don't have to do them because the final is open book open notes.",
    "The class is ok, if you enjoy philosophy you might like this class.",
    "Yes, especially if you take it writing intensive.",
    "It's a fairly basic, foundational course in political philosophy. Papers are fair and the readings not uninteresting.",
    "This class is awful. The lectures are terrible, the section is full of so many people just clearly taking it as a gut that the conversations are just agony.I took this as a social science and just despised it despite the fact that the material initially sounded interesting.I don't know how you could fix this class. It sucks that much.",
    "YES for the WR. But pick a good TA -- the TA will determine your grade, so definitely do your research with TAs.",
    "Good wr but not that interesting",
    "Moral Foundations of Politics was one of the more enjoyable classes I have taken.",
    "Take it if you want to get a glimpse of political philosophy.",
    "Take Intro to Political if you want to read more interesting books.",
    "Good course, easy writing credit",
    "I did not go to one lecture and got an A in the class. Shapiro's book is all you need to read - he teaches right out of it.",
    "The course is good if you are interested in philosophy, but can get dull if you are not.",
    "If you want to be a poly sci major take it.",
    "If you need a Writing credit, MoFoPo with Writing is not a bad course to take, although having a final is a bit annoying compared to other writing classes. The material is probably a lot more interesting than an English class however, so I don't regret taking the course. It's a lot of reading if you actually keep up with the reading, which is very hard to do and not really necessary, so I wouldn't recommend killing yourself reading everything.",
    "This is a solid introduction to political philosophy. It is a great class for freshman and also a great way to get a WR credit.",
    "Interesting class if you like political philosophy, but if you don't, then you won't enjoy the class. Don't think that just because you like political science you'll like political philosophy. Also it's important to have a good TF.",
    "Take it writing intensive!",
    "Yes. It is a good class with a great teacher. It is interesting stuff. You really don't have to do the reading but you will get a lot more out of the course and section if you do",
    "It was better than intro to ethics, and if you have to take it, take it. I'm someone who finds philosophy a snooze, but I managed this class all right.",
    "dont take it. It is not a gut. the papers suck",
    "It's a good and easy class to take. If you take it Writing Intensive the final is only 30% of your grade rather than %50, but be aware that the deadlines sometimes creep up on inopportune times. The final exam is open book and open note so ATTEND THE LECTURES.",
    "Take it to learn about moral philosophy of government, and take it WR if you really want to engage with the material. The readings are good (mostly all classics) and Shapiro's lectures get to the heart of all of them.Don't take it f you just want a WR credit, cuz its actually quite a bit of work, at 2 long papers and a final.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Very interesting course for learning about the ins and outs of various political theories",
    "I would recommend this class to people interested in the readings. Prof. Shapiro is really important in his field and his ideas are actually very interesting. It's a great intro to a lot of theories and tensions in political thought. Its relative gut-ness depends on the section leader. Some are excellent and tough and foster really good discussion, and others are totally indifferent. They attract crowds of students accordingly, so choose wisely and you'll be pretty happy with the experience when you come out of it. The gut culture around this class is not really the fault of the professor so much as it is of the sections. You make what you will of it.",
    "Take it if you want to read some interesting political philosophers and you don't have much background in the subject.",
    "Interesting course. Definitely gets you to think about what is the true purpose of government. Prof. Shapiro is engaging and explains things clearly. Not a lot of work. Definitely take writing intensive!",
    "wide overview of some extremely important in western philosophy, one of those courses that you feel you should definitely take before leaving yale. ian shapiro is a leader in his field and actually isn't too bad at lecturing, plus the material is interesting. readings can get a bit long but there isn't much work and this worked great as a gut class for an engineering major. sections are also not bad, really just take the class. it's pretty great.",
    "Cool class, very famous political philosophers that I think people should know about. Very minimal work. I took the non-wiring class: not a lot of work at all. The writing credit though I have heard is very easy for this class. 2, 10 page papers.",
    "Take it.",
    "So Shapiro is a really dry and boring lecturer, but he has interesting ideas. He does an especially great job synthesizing a huge amount of material and placing it in context. I found the material interesting. Recommended, especially if you're looking for an easy WR credit.",
    "This class is a broad overview of multiple philosophers opinions on the foundations of a legitimate state. Don't take it... read Shapiro's book instead, its a lot less effort and you'll probably get more out of the reading than you would doing the really minimal coursework required.",
    "Take it.",
    "Weekly responses, section participation, two essays + a final exam. This course has a fair amount of work and learning, but is definitely manageable and the content is interesting enough.",
    "Mofopo deals with the fundamental issue of government legitimacy. The class starts with utilitarian thinking and moves to the anti-enlightenment and ends with democracy. It was very interesting and was my favorite class this past semester. Workload isn't awful and definitely do it for writing credit if possible.",
    "Solid intro to PLSC class.",
    "It's a good foundational course if you're considering a Political Science major. If you're looking for a basic political discussion course, Intro to Political Philosophy does a better job of exploring the material, but this is still an interesting course.",
    "This was a good class. Doing the reading wasn't really necessary, though it added to your understanding of the material. Lectures were interesting, Professor was approachable, all around solid choice.",
    "Take it!",
    "It's an easy WR credit: 2 papers and an open-note final exam. It's certainly not the most engaging introduction to political philosophy. Professor Shapiro gives the impression he's thought through all of these theories and made up his mind long ago. He shows how each theory is devastated by obvious and naive critiques, and doesn't seem to worry about how a serious and reasonable defender of any classic theory might try to respond to criticism. If you're looking for an interesting and challenging \"great books\" course, look elsewhere. If you need an easy 5th-class WR credit for which you don't actually need to attend lecture, look no further! (If you don't ever go to lecture, just read his book \"Moral Foundations of Politics\" on the syllabus; it traces lecture almost exactly.)",
    "I really enjoyed this class, but much of that has to do with my TF Uday, who is amazing, but is going to be in India next year. I know students with other TFs who didn't like the class as much. Still, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I took Intro to Political Philosophy last semester, and really didn't like it. Shapiro is a more engaging lecturer , the reading is a lot less, and the work is even less. Take it WR, it's so much easier and you are forced to get more out of it.",
    "Recommend. Above-average political science course.",
    "Lots of reading but a good course, especially for a writing requirement.",
    "Yes i would recommend it. Good way to satisfy a writing credit as well. two papers.",
    "Great introduction to political philosophy, much less state-centric than Steven Smith's.Prof. Shapiro provides a somewhat intriguing but compelling lens through which to view modern political philosophy. Teaching the major thinkers in the context of the Enlightenment brought a surprising but enjoyable amount of epistemology and history to the course.If you want a good introduction to many of the major modern thinkers (Locke, Marx, Rawls&Nozick, to name a few), this is a great way to get it.Buy his book, the Moral Foundations of Politics, since the lectures are based on it.",
    "This is a really good introductory course to the ideas and great thinkers that shaped much of the legal and political system of modernity. I would recommend this course to whoever wants a solid background in political philosophy before taking upper level courses.",
    "Indeed!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Take the writing intensive section if possible.",
    "It's good knowledge to have for a fundamental understanding of political morality.",
    "This is a great course. You will learn a lot without an overwhelming amount of coursework. Professor Shapiro is an excellent lecturer who started teaching this class after writing his book that the course follows: \"The Moral Foundations of Politics\". There is reading assigned each week, section meetings, a take-home midterm, and an in-class final (or the non-writing intensive option). Take this class.",
    "This is a good introduction to political philosophy. Lectures are engaging, and you read a lot of things you wouldn't otherwise. Work load is light.",
    "Definitely would recommend it if you are at all interested in the field of political philosophy, or you just want a fun writing credit.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class, mostly for underclassmen. If you are a senior, just read Shapiro's book, Moral Foundation of Politics and you will ace it without attending a single class. The class is basically applying different political theory to the world we are in now.",
    "This course covers modern political thought and governmental theory in an interesting, comprehensive manner.",
    "Take this class! Professor Shapiro is the best lecturer I've ever had at Yale! His lectures are so clear and interesting, you'll never want to miss one.The material in this course is absolutely riveting and provides you with a new way to look at politics and even economics. if you've never taken a political philosophy course, take this one. Don't take Steven Smith's course, it's boring. Make sure you take great notes in class because they'll help you on the midterm and final.",
    "MoFoPo is a great class that were subject you to the writings of some of the greatest political philosophers - lots of 'must read' material is required for the course. I would definitely recommend the class to a fellow student.",
    "Decent class to take for the WR credit - just depends on which TA you get!",
    "I liked it, but wish I was more attentive in lectures\/attended them more often. My saving grace was that the lectures can be found online on Yale Open courses and on iTunes U- this came in handy for studying for the final exam. It's a lot of work if you do all the readings, but one can definitely get away with not completing most of these. That said, the course would be rewarding if you are able to spend the time to do these. I think it's important for anyone to have at least a basic understanding of political philosophy, and this is a good introduction.",
    "i'd recommend it to those that are willing to do the readings and participate in section. if not, you wont get much out of this class",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. This class allows your interests to roam within a well-defined, approachable yet challenging region of philosophy. Thinking is the most important aspect: whether you attend every lecture and read little, or read all but skip lecture, the point is that you think. Both routes are viable, so long as you keep to a destination. This course offers the background and basic analytical skills to become a proficient student of philosophy--indeed, it has inspired me to delve more deeply into philosophy.",
    "Take it if you're a freshman interested in political science.",
    "An interesting exploration of Modern Philosophy. Shapiro's a very good lecturer, and the material is presented well, with examples relative to modern political debates. However, the readings are very long, and toward the middle and end of the semester, when papers and tests start coming in, I found it impossible to give the readings the extensive attention that they all require. You'll leave the course with at least a cursory knowledge of enlightenment and anti-enlightenment thought.",
    "Take it if you have time to do reading. If not, I would not recommend it for those who think it would be a breeze.",
    "Basic overview of political philosophy. More focused on philosophy\/ideas than the \"science\" part of political science.",
    "Very easy writing credit. Definitely take this class.",
    "If you need to take this as a req, then of course do it; otherwise, there are probably more interesting philosophy courses.",
    "This class is a bit philosophical.....so if you do not find Karl Marx and John Locke enthralling.....then I would not recommend this class.",
    "Yes, it is a great and important course to take which teaches one a lot about philosophy.",
    "There was an interesting (and surprising) tie-in of economic theory into political. I would recommend it, especially to students interested in how economics and political science intertwine.",
    "Compared political philosophers and is a good background for political science majors but everyone should take it!",
    "I would recommend this class to another because it is not too difficult but very interesting.",
    "This class is great.",
    "Yes. A nice writing credit and pretty interesting.",
    "Yes, the lectures are engaging and thought provoking. The readings are interesting. Definitely take it WR.",
    "Take it.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend this class, unless you really have to take it for your major. I took the class thinking I might be interested in political philosophy, but ultimately realized it wasn't for me. If you're only looking for a potential WR credit, I would suggest looking elsewhere. However, if philosophy is what really interests you, take the class."
