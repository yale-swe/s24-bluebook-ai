    "Japan's Modern Revolution is a GREAT class! Perhaps I'm biased, since I have always been interested in Japanese history. However, Prof Botsman is an AMAZING lecturer. His lectures were among the highlights of my week. I actually looked forward to going to every lecture. I was excited to go to every lecture. I normally fall asleep in all of my lecture classes. I never even got the feeling of sleepiness during any of Botsman's lectures, since my mind was so absorbed in listening to what he was saying about Japanese history. If you have any interest at all in Japanese history, you just HAVE to take this class. You learn a ton of stuff about Japan from like the early 1800s to 1910. These were amazing, exciting, formative years in Japanese history.You also read a lot of biographies that are extremely touching. You also watch one of the most outrageous movies ever (Eejanaika). Also, just fyi, the course load in the first half of the semester is surprisingly high, but there is hardly any work in the second half of the semester.",
    "Definitely take if you're a history major -- it is probably the best rest-of-the-world option around. While not quite a must-take class (a la Professor Blight's Civil War), it is definitely worth taking if you're a non-major with an interest in the period\/area or who just wants to sample the history department.",
    "Take this class! Especially if you need a 300 for history! Really worth it! Professor Botsman is fantastic (and so nice!), and the TA's were all amazing. Also the course is front-loaded so the paper is due in October (which is so nice during reading week), and the final and midterm are really straightforward and pretty simple. Excellent course!",
    "Great history course for everyone. Highly recommended. Reading is for the most part enjoyable, and there're only 2 papers, one 2-page historiography paper, and one 5-page analytical one.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you have an interest in Japan and East Asia, otherwise it is easy to feel like the material has actually no relevance or importance to anything. That being said, Professor Botsman is great and the readings are not too long and generally interesting.",
    "Ever wonder how Japan went from a feudal society of peasants and samurai to the modernized world power that fought against the US in World War II? It all happened during the 19th century, and this course is where you'll learn ALL about it. This is a really, really good course, and I'm so glad I took it. I knew nothing about Japan beforehand, and at first the names and terms were confusing, but I've learned so much. And Professor Botsman is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was really good. I feel like this period of Japan is not something people know much about, but it is so interesting and probably relevant to the world today. Botsman is a great lecturer. Section was helpful as well for reviewing the material learned in lecture. The grading was a bit tough, but this is a great course.",
    "Prof Botsoman was well-prepared, polished lecturer with an Australian accent that makes listening very pleasant. The class was efficiently planned and a lot of fun!Take it - you'll learn a lot. Also worth mentioning is that the class is a heavier load on the front half of the semester (there is a short assignment, 5 pg paper, and midterm) than the second half (only a cumulative final), which was great because other classes are more weighted towards the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - it's great material, lots of interesting lessons, and a really engaging professor.",
    "Really enjoyable course on mostly 19th century Japanese history. Covers an exciting, dynamic time that will make you want to study up on events both before and after the timeline of the course. Fantastic lectures and my section experience was great too. I'm not a history major, but if you have to do a rest of the world requirement I can't imagine anything better, especially b\/c of the topic's importance and the amount you'll learn.",
    "This is the best lecture I've ever taken at Yale. Botsman is incredible; he really cares about students and teaching. Also, his lectures seem to fly by; I consistently looked forward to this class. Additionally, I thought all but just a few of the readings were fascinating, very primary source focused. I came into this class purely looking for a Rest-of-the-world and came out of the course incredibly interested in Japanese history. The workloadwas never light, but it always a reasonable amount.",
    "Definitely a must-take. There aren't many Japanese history courses offered at Yale so take advantage of this opportunity. The Tokugawa and Meiji Periods are important time periods and show the transformation of Japanese society from a traditional one to the one we know today. Professor Botsman is one of the best professors I have had and his lectures are worth going to. Sections are pretty small and relaxed so they can be fun. Even if you're not a history major, you should consider shopping this course.",
    "An excellent overview of early modern Japan, with emphasis on political and socio-cultural themes. This class tangentially discusses a lot of themes that Prof. Botsman researches, like the role of punishment in society, that add a whole new layer to your understanding of the time. The work is notoverwhelming, and but just enough to complement the lecture. Prof. Botsman is a dynamic lecturer and so friendly. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Definitely take it. You probably don't know much on the topic (most people don't). I would recommend to anybody",
    "Highly recommended! I took this class basically on a whim and ended up loving it. Professor Botsman is a terrific lecturer, and I loved his dry wit. I'm embarrassed to say that I came into this class with little-to-no knowledge of Japanese history and emerged feeling well-versed in a crucial important time period that would have tremendous implications in shaping not only modern Japan, but the modern world as well - and a better understanding of what \"modern\" even means. Also, CJ (Jan-Ru Huang) is a great TF if you can get her next time this course is offered!",
    "Japan's Modern Revolution is a history of Japan from the start of the seventeenth century to the death of the Meiji Emperor in 1912. It pays particular attention to Japan's changing dynamic with the West. I would recommend it to another student. Professor Botsman is an excellent lecturer, and the course is very fun. Furthermore, Japanese history is extremely relevant.",
    "Take this class! Even if you have no background in Japanese or Asian history, this class will teach you a TON without making you feel overwhelmed. Botsman is an exciting, funny lecturer and these eras are understudied and actually really significant to Asian and world history. Did you know that the first real use of trench warfare was not in WWI but in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904? Prepare well for the exams (and the film is really strange, so be prepared for that). And take it.",
    "I would recommend this course for the great lectures and interesting topic, but the reading list could be better.",
    "Botsman is a good lecturer, and the syllabus is well laid out. A good history to take for non-history majors and history majors looking for a RoW credit.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. This course was absolutely amazing, one of the best that I've taken. I learned so much in such a short time and Professor Botsman structured it the way I would want to structure a course if I were a professor. His lectures are riveting and packed with information (honestly you could just go to the lecture and take really good notes without having to do much secondary reading) and the section was focused on primary sources (and he picked fascinating ones like a couple of samurai memoirs). Moreover, we all knew just how to study for the exams because the themes he found important were very clear (for potential essay questions) and he had a list of key terms with his outlines of every lecture. I took this class as it seemed interesting and I needed to fill the geographic requirement, but it ended up being my favorite class this semester and one of the very best at Yale all because of Professor Botsman. He's the best.",
    "Japan's Modern Revolution is an interesting class, and a good rest of the world credit, but be aware of all the details you'll have to learn.",
    "Professor Botsman is agreat, entertaining lecturer on an otherwise rather dull subject matter. If you're looking for a ROW and you enjoy lectures, I would definitely recommend it, but the grading in this course was no joke, and 18th and 19th c. Japanese history is not the most enthralling for those who don't have a vested interest in the material.",
    "It's a fascinating class about the modernization of Japan in the 19th century, treated from a political, social, and military perspective.",
    "This is a very well-structured history course, and one Iwould highly recommend. Prof. Botsman knows how to use his personality and wit to engage students, and it pays off big time in the lectures. My only complaint about the course is that it stops too soon, right around 1912, with the death of Emperor Meiji. When your main complaint is that you wish a class could keep going, you know you've found something good.",
    "Definitely take this class! I took it because I needed an other world credit, and it was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Botsman is AWESOME, and CJ was an excellent TA as well!",
    "The lectures are very interesting and the workload is average. Definitely worth taking if you have any interest in Japan.",
    "Yes!",
    "I very much enjoyed this course which spent the first half of the semester contextualizing - both culturally and politically - Japan's Meiji Revolution of 1868 and then analyzing its effects on a modernization-minded Japan.",
    "It is a good rest of the world credit for history majors.",
    "Absolutely, 100% take this class. I shopped it randomly and it became one of my favorite courses at Yale. Professor Botsman is incredible and so passionate about the subject matter, and the lectures are structured fantastically.",
    "I initially shopped it as a non-Western history course to satisfy the requirements of the major, and I would now take more courses on the subject matter, which seems like a success of the course and the instruction. Both the professor and the TAs were very willing to discuss the content further outside of class, and the course places Japan in a geopolitical context that makes the content useful to other 19th century history courses.",
    "Survey of Japanese history focused on 19th century. You get handouts in each lecture that has important names and events plus a lecture outline, which makes it easy to create a study guide. Good for ROW credit as a history major, professor botsman is a great lecturer.",
    "If you're at all interested in Japanese history or culture, this is a great course to take. This period is what set up Japan for what it is today so you learn a lot. The work isn't too hard. They assign readings but you can usually go through them quickly, and if anything, it's best to focus on going to lecture and paying attention (which isn't hard to do at all because Professor Botsman is extremely interesting). I would definitely recommend!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is very focused on a specific time period and on Japan, but Prof Botsman makes the themes universal and the information extremely pertinent. He's a great lecturer and always engaging. And if CJ is a TF take it with her!!",
    "This class is a survey overview of Japanese history from the 17th century (the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogunate)to the early 20th century. I would strongly recommend the class to anyone, but particularly to history majors looking for a good rest of the world credit. The material was really, really interesting, and Professor Botsman was absolutely great. You learn a ton about Japan, a sophisticated and fascinating civilization that is well worth studying, and Professor Botsman does a great job of explaining the nuances of Japan's historical development and how Japan evolved in relation to the West over the period that the course covers. As a warning, the tests were kind of hard, because it's difficult to remember Japanese names, but the class overall did not assign a ton of work. And Botsman honestly was just great. Really, you ought to take this class if your looking for ROW credit, or even if you just want to learn about Japanese history. I'd give it a solid A, no question.",
    "Boring. Do not take. Be careful about which TA you get!",
    "Premodern Japanese History 101, for those who wish to study it but find it too uninspiring to study it themselves: this course gives an overall picture with a good depth and breadth and has an awesome lecturer to top it all off.I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with any semblance of interest in Japan, even if you've never touched any history prior to this (like me), because it not only makes one more aware of all the key developments in Japanese history, but it also gives one a better understanding and insight into the way that history has shaped Japanese values, culture and society.",
    "Yes, this is a class that all students should take! The class may seem irrelevant at first glance, but it really isn't. Like I stated earlier, the course is a history class first, then a political philosophy class second. You will come away from this class with a greater understanding of Western political ideology (comparative learning!) and for Japan's unique position in history.Trust me, learning those Japanese names will be worth it!",
    "I LOVED this course, and took it as a treat. It is a fascinating look into a fascinating culture, taught by a fabulous professor (and we had great TA's as well). If you're at all interested in Japan, or you think you might be, take it!!"
