   "comments": [
    "Take it! It's basic philosophers that all Yale students should know, and Szelenyi presents them in a very accessible way. Szelenyi is also quite a character and really makes the class...",
    "Yeah. If you wanna learn the latter philosophies of DS but don't want to work too hard.",
    "Foundation of social theory; Hobbes, Rousseau, Marx, Freud, Weber, Durkheim, and Nietzsche being some of the major authors considered. I'd recommend it for Poli sci majors, since they'll use this (especially Hobbes and Rousseau) in other classes.",
    "Yes. Pretty easy, not a lot of work (if you dont do the reading). But very fair class and awesome material.",
    "Yes, you don't have to do the readings--all the info is in the lectures. All that is required is some thought.",
    "Go survey philosophy course. Yes I would recommend",
    "Yes to better understand the philosophy of politics.",
    "I'd take it just because Ivan is teaching it. He's the best.",
    "I really didn't like this class, mostly because I don't like social theory. I'm not very interested in theories of human nature or government, and I thought it only started to get interesting when we started discussing Weber. If you do like that stuff though, I guess the class isn't too bad - I'm a sociology major though, so I had to take it. The lecture slides are online and you don't really have to do much reading to understand what's going on. Section and the tests are a pain, but it's not too much work.",
    "Yes, take it. Szelenyi is a very entertaining lecturer and responsive to students. The course covers a lot of material, so pay attention to catch many brilliant passing comments. I really got a feel for these thinkers, and section was one of the best I've had.",
    "This course was great! I took it just because I glanced over the syllabus and realized that all of these works were things I hadn't read but SHOULD. I didn't need it for major or distribution requirements, but it's still an incredibly valuable course to take because you get a great introduction to modern philosophical\/sociological thought. The readings are heavy, but you don't really have to do *all* of them (becase there are a lot). Lectures are really good-- Szelenyi mutters a lot, but is very likeable and does a great job of reviewing the gist of all the writers so you don't have to read them quite as closely. All of the tests are in essay form, which I liked because it was a little more open-ended; you didn't need to know the nitpicky details, just the overall ideas\/themes.Overall: a very interesting and valuable course for anyone, no matter what your major!",
    "This is a great class of some of the fundamental social theorists. Ivan is very bright and a very good professor.",
    "Great class to take.",
    "Solid course. As a poli-sci major with little to no prior exposure to political philosophy, this course went a long way towards filling that gaping hole in my knowledge. The 3 short take-home midterms are a really good, relatively relaxing way to get 60% of your grade taken care of. Szelenyi's also a very good professor, he's got the material and presentation down cold and you learn a lot as long as you pay attention to lecture.",
    "Really interesting survey class on the development political thought from the sociologist standpoint of Professor Szelenyi. The email essay tests were an interesting way to go and it was great not having to purchase the expensive books from which the reading selections were taken.",
    "This class offers a solid overview of the major social theorists. A great way to learn some of the major themes discussed by people like Hobbes, Locke, Weber, Durkheim, Marx, etc. Prof. Szelenyi is very animated and makes the material interesting and accessible. Workload is light, tests are straightforward and you'll do great if you put in any work on them. Recommended.",
    "YES! Szelenyi is the cutest, most passionate, nicest professor you will ever have. And he really knows his stuff. I think the course was the perfect balance of breadth and depth. I had never taken a philosophy\/social theory class before, but it was extremely manageable and it has inspired me to take more in the future. Definitely worth your time. Tests take awhile to study for, but if you work hard, you will do well on them.",
    "Great overview of social theorists for someone outside the sociology major who is interested in the field.",
    "yes i would. but make sure you do the reading!",
    "If you're a soc major, you have to take it, and honestly, there is pretty good as far as mandatory classes go. I'd also recommend this class to freshmen. There isn't too much work. It's in a lecture setting but is smaller and more engaging than your usual lecture, and you learn so much without really having to work too hard. You don't really talk about any author in depth, but you learn just enough to understand cultural references and have a good foundation in social thought to build on later. This class wasn't amazing but it was fine for the amount of effort it asks you to put in.",
    "Good class. Readings are interesting, though no one ever finishes all of them, and the lectures are clear. Professor Szelenyi is great \u0096 he really cares about his students, and he goes out of the way to make the class fair and enjoyable.",
    "This class essentially surveys various modern thinkersfrom Hobbes and Locke to Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Max Weber. You don't spend much time on any particular one (except perhaps Marx and Weber), so you get more breadth than depth. The reading's rather heavy, but still manageable; if you keep up with it, it's worth it. Professor Szeleyni brings a certain amount of charm to his lectures. If you know what you're getting into, it's a worthwhile course - even for a non-humanities major.",
    "This is a decent class overall. Take it if you want an introduction to the major political and social theorists of the last 300 years. The material isn't anything spectacular and while Szelenyi may seem very enthusiastic and fun initially, he quickly becomes somewhat boring. It's not a bad course, just not that great.",
    "I took this class because it is required for the Sociology major. It's a good way to get a VERY broad exposure to major theorists, but I recommend more focused classes for any student wishing to actually engage with the material.",
    "If you want to independently put in the reading work- do it, if you want to just coast- get out.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student",
    "YES. Well, if you're a sociology nerd like me. Exactly what you want to learn if you're interested in classic sociological philosophers like Marx, Durkheim, Nietzsche, Freud, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke.Just, so fun. But really, only if that's what you're into.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is interested in getting an overview of major political thought. It's an easy course, with interesting (but long!) readings, and not toomuch work.",
    "Absolutely! It's a class with great material that is very useful, the tests are very manageable, and no one is better than Ivan Szelenyi. It's a must take!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Not very much work, interesting topics, and good general knowledge to have. If you can get into a good section you will really enjoy the class. Lecture was good by not mindblowing and all notes were online and basically followed during lecture. Not to be one of these intellectually elitistcourse reviewers but I would say that this course is more or a social philosophy course than a sociology course. Not a whole lot of empirical stuff.",
    "Definitely Yes. Easy, not a lot of work, great professor.",
    "Though I much prefer to take smaller, seminar-style classes, I think that Sociology 151 01 provided me with a basic understanding of many of the foundational thinkers of modern social analysis and, for this reason, I am glad that I took it. I think that I got, at the very least, bullet points for each of the thinkers. These thinkers are interesting and insightful and, I think, important to know in at least a cursory way in order to ground one\u0092s understanding of more contemporary modern social thought and modern social isssues. Prof. Szelenyi, I think, is a humorous and passionate lecturer and, as a discussion leader, he is equally humorous and passionate, but also incredibly generous and understanding. The work, I thought, was difficult. The readings could be long and dense, and the exams were difficult. But, in the end, I realize that we covered a lot of ground that I am now glad for having covered.",
    "This was a interesting course. The workload is not that bad, and the tests weren't that hard as long as you had gone to lecture and done most of the reading. Szelenyi was a good lecturer, and I found that it was worth going to lectures even though he put the notes online after class.",
    "This course covers need-to-know material. You'll come out of it capable of having an intelligent conversation regarding the foundation of social theory. The lectures are actually interesting, but the Prof. posts them on classesv2 so it's not 100% necessary to attend every lecture. However, he is entertaining and it is worth going to class. The reading is kind of tough, and kind of a lot, but he discusses it so thoroughly that its only really necessary to skim it before class and section.",
    "It is a great introduction to social theory -- we read thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, Marx, Nietzche, Rousseau, Durkheim, etc. The class was especially great when thinkers were put against each other. Also, the class was especially interesting when we thought about how one thinker would respond to the other, even if one thinker did not even know the other existed. Also, a key part of the course was relating the thinkers' ideas to current events. For example, an essay question (we had online take-home essay tests) was to think about whether Max Weber would call Barack Obama a charismatic leader. The sections were very interesting when we related the ideas of the thinkers to current events.",
    "A helpful introduction to the life\/work of dead white men.",
    "You should take it because it involves reading all of the things you \"should\" read to understand a lot of aspects of Western civilization. I really enjoyed the things I learned in this class. I didn't enjoy some of the readings while I was doing them, but was always glad I had done them afterward. There was a lot of reading but none of it was gratuitous. And some of it was fascinating. Lectures were good, I only wish Prof. Szelenyi had spent less time on the biographies of the authors and more time on their ideas. I loved hearing his interpretations of the authors. He is awesome, very knowledgeable, and the authors explored in this course are truly a part of his life.",
    "The readings are interesting and the exams quite simple. I rarely did any of the work or go to lecture but still got a great grade. I'd recommend it but know that it isn't the most exciting class in the world.",
    "i would recommend this class. the lectures are entirely off power-points that he posts online after class, so class attendance isn't a necessity to do well. grades are based off of three take home exams and a 7page paper at the end of the semester. the exams were just answer two out of three questions in 2 hours.",
    "this class provides a solid foundation for early political philosphers. I would recommend this class because it is very interesting and tought by a great professor.",
    "The workload is not too bad, but make sure you are interested in reading a lot of philosophy.",
    "Yes. Not stressful, great thinkers. Tests can be annoying at most, but don't let them stress you out.",
    "Great survey course in political philosophy, amazing professor. You will get out of this class with a solid understanding of the issues the greatest modern thinkers have dealt with. An indispensable part of a liberal arts education. Try to get into a discussion section with the Professor; he has been by far the best discussion leader I have had at Yale."
