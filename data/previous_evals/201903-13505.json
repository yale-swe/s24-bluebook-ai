    "Weaknesses: * The course has no textbook and assumes a much higher level of requisite knowledge of various areas of physics than is actually required. The course has no formal prerequisite courses, and definitely should have at least a few. That very much inhibited my understanding of the material. * The course problem sets are much, much harder than the course content. Even if I perfectly understood the lecture material, the homework is about 10x harder and there is very little guidance on how to do it, where to refer, or often even what the questions refer to. * There is little formal guidance for the course, and I would recommend that the department strongly encourage first-year students to refrain from enrolling. Strengths: * The professor is accessible to students.",
    "the material in the psets is related to what is taught in class, but it requires A LOT of individual legwork -- reading up on other textbooks and classes not specifically given by the instructor -- to be able to do the psets. even still, they are super hard.",
    "better structured lectures",
    "Good in depth treatment of many mesoscopic topics. Wish there was a more direct overlap between lecture and homework. Homework was way too difficult for the amount given and amount of time allowed. Wish lecture prepared students more for problems given. Felt very much like I understood lectures but very often had no idea how to do the homework."

    "No. Sadly, it is quite relevant for my line of research. I should've taken it in my 3rd year at the earliest. I would not recommend this course to anyone who hasn't at least taken graduate electromagnetism and some kind of modern or quantum optics.",
    "yes, but it's really hard.",
    "yes",
    "Yes just because the topics are very interesting."
