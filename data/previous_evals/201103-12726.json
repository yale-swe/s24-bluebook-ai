    "Recommend to anyone who needs a language credit who doesn't want a super intense experience a la Chinese",
    "I would definitely suggest it- I took Greek as a way to learn a new, different language. I plan to continue it even though I've fulfilled the language requirement.",
    "Its a great way to learn beginners Greek (provided you already have a small base from L1 and 2). I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in ancient archaeology, learning Greek, or mythology\/folklore from ancient Greece as understanding the language is pertinent to this (and Maria also is very knowledgable in this subject).",
    "Modern Greek 130 builds upon the foundation set in the introductory classes. I would recommend it for the necessary grammar and vocabulary that is taught, as well as for the favorable learning environment."
