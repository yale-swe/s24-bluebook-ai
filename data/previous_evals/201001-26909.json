    "Awesome class! Professor Underhill is incredibly nice and the coursework is incredibly manageable. It was my first time ever taking an archaeology class and the professor was very understanding of that and helped me out a lot. Definitely take this class, even if you have never thought about archaeology before.",
    "a new world about ancient china history. strongly recommended if you have interest and background in china history or archaeology.",
    "Study of ancient Chinese civilizations. Again, key words is ancient because we stop at the Qin (terracotta warriors period). Focus on archeology which means digs, pits, tombs, and burials.",
    "Great course with a wonderful professor. Visit her outside of class if you need to. As far as class work and structure: The research paper is hard if you want it to be good. You have really free rein in the course - choose your own paper topic, leading a class lecture\/discussion of your choice, choices on the midterm and final, etc. The reading is really varied as well, and includes things that aren't covered in lecture in detail. Great sources.The material itself is great. It was the first archaeology course I've taken at Yale, but others in the class were majors. Professor Underhill really knows her stuff. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning to look at things from an archaeological perspective, or to anybody interested in some focused ancient Chinese perspective (instead of a survey course in East Asia).",
    "Excellent course, light workload but focuses on critical thinking and evaluation of overall themes. Fun class to go to."
