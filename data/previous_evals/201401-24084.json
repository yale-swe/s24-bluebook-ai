    "I wanted to love this class and save a few glaring issues I did; Hagens is an enthusiastic professor and the literature you read is probably the best I've explored at Yale. That said, the first-year pains of the class definitely showed through: we had difficulty discussing all the readings in class and grades were basically non-existent until the last few weeks which made a lot of people anxious. But if you love Kafka or Mann or just want to explore two influential and rightly revered authors then you should at the very least shop this!",
    "An interesting class, but difficult if you don't have a strong foundation in philosophy or German. If neither of those are your wheelhouse, I would definitely recommend starting it Cr\/D\/Fail.",
    "A good course if you like Kafka or Mann. I came in having read a little Kafka and no Mann, and never having taken a literature class at Yale. I grew, both personally and academically. If you can tolerate slow grading, it's a good course with a relatively light\/reasonable workload. No final paper or midterm paper made the class a welcome relief towards the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in these two authors, however, unless Professor Hagens is able to commit more time to this course, you will not improve on your writing in this course.",
    "All things considered, a delightful course. The readings are pretty powerful - Mann and Kafka are both confronting the central problems of modernity head-on, in very different ways, so if that's the type of thing that excites you, the course is probably worth your time. Because the whole class is short stories, the reading is never too heavy, and you really get the opportunity to read closely. Professor Hagens is a really friendly guy (ask him out for lunch!), knows German literature well, and is passionate about the authors in question. However, he's not always so good at guiding discussion. The assignment structure is unlike any other I've seen at Yale - simply a two page paper, each week, with no midterm or final papers. Comes out to roughly the same amount of work as any other course, but much more spread out.",
    "The syllabus is great -- just Kafka and Mann stories. It allows you to read a lot of literature you might not have read, and to get to know these two authors very well. Students lead the discussion on 2-4 stories during the semester, which was worthwhile and valuable. There are weekly writing assignments of 2-3 pages. My main issue with this class, and the reason why I unfortunately wouldn't recommend it, is that the professor was incredibly lazy\/didn't do anything. I received not a single word of feedback about any of the 12 or so reading responses I wrote during the class, and there was no final or final paper. So my writing did not improve at all, and neither did the quality of my ideas. The professor also did little to guide class discussion, as students lead the discussion on 95% of the stories. If the students in your seminar are smart and interested this can be fine, but the professor contributed very little to either the class discussion or the experience of the class outside of the course in the assignments. For these reasons, though I loved the readings, the class was very disappointing."
