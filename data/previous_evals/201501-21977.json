    "A great 126 section. I really enjoyed the choice of \"Omeros\" for the last book, because it was a nice push-back against the \"western canon\" that is the core of 125\/6. The material itself was a little dry in parts, but exciting in others. Paradise Lost especially has sections which I couldn't get into at all, but in other sections it was low-key brilliant. Wordsworth was very simple\/enjoyable for the most part, with the notable exception of The Prelude. All in all, take this class if you'd like to learn more about the themes of English poetry, and how they inspire the people\/writers of today.",
    "I thought I wanted to be an English major, and that's why I took this course. Now I don't really want to be an English major (but maybe that's because I hate literary analysis and major English poetry)."
