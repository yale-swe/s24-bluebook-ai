    "I would highly recommend this course for anybody interested in chemical biology research.",
    "A must-take! A truly great advanced course.",
    "This is an awesome class! For anyone with interests in organic chemistry and biochemistry, this is a great elective. The workload this semester wasn't bad at all, and the material was very interesting. If you can take it with Professor Slavoff, seize the opportunity -- she is one of the most engaging, kind, fair professors I've had at Yale. Her tests and problem sets were totally reasonable, and she chose very interesting topics to focus on.",
    "This is a very interesting class, and not too difficult! The material is really cool and useful, and the professor is great, so I would recommend it!"
