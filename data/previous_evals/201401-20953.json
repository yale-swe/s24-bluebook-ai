   "comments": [
    "Low stress upper bio class. I wish it had a little more consistency (twice the instructors just forgot to show up due to the rotating schedule). Problem sets only assigned by Dr. Sigworth - light workload, but little learning as a result. Dr. Boulpaep teaches a majority of the lectures - his slides are horrible. Crammed with information, he always runs overtime trying to teach last minute obscure details. Loses the attention of his students so quickly that many simply stopped showing up to his lectures. If he just listened to student feedback about trimming down his slides and learning how to restrain himself from \"overteaching\", his lectures would be so much better.",
    "Two take home exams and a few problem sets. The lectures were hit and miss. Overall, an easy way to get a high-level MCDB credit.",
    "The content of this class is difficult but I don't think it is difficult to do well (then again, I have no idea what my final grade will be, so I might be totally wrong). There were just 4 problem sets and 2 take home exams. That's your entire grade, so just do well on those and you should be okay. A more chill upper level MCDB elective.",
    "interesting stuff, take home assignments and exams, but instructors don't make going to class worth it",
    "A class that you probably should not take. There are definitely pros: the material is really really interesting especially if you're interested in medicine, Sigworth is an awesome professor and teaches really well for the first half of the course, there is so little work its ridiculous. But many cons: there is so little work that if you mess up a couple of things it will really hurt you, the midterm and final are take home and a vast portion of the class chooses to ignore the \"no collaboration\" rule, Emile Boulpaep teaches most of the time and, while a nice and legendary figure in physiology, is a woeful lecturer whose slides contain as much text as his famous physiology textbook. I skipped most of the lectures because they are at 925 am. I wish I was cut out for this class but it takes a special kind of person to actually benefit from it.",
    "This class was really interesting, and overall very easy. While it may seem hard to go to class since you are not tested on the material really, if you go you will learn a lot which will be useful in grad or medical school. So take this class if you are self-motivated, want to learn some cool facts, and if you don't want to worry about tests or grades.",
    "This class is an easy senior elective in MCDB. I got the most out of this class sitting down and combing through the lectures for the final and the midterm. Sometimes the actual lectures get to be bogged down in information and it's hard to know what is really important to learn. Prof. Takizawa's lectures were very good, as well as Prof. Sigworth's.",
    "Pretty chill course but don't really learn much from lectures.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 415! Take it. Great senior course to take for MCDB: all take home tests, weekly psets for a while (up until midterm), and guest lectures. Pretty relaxed, though the exams are challenging: start early, at least a few days before the deadline.",
    "This course can be really interesting if you want it to be. The class work does not require a lot of time at all, and attending class isn't mandatory. But if you go to class, you can appreciate the material so much more. Definitely a \"you get what you put in\" kind of a class.",
    "Interesting, straight-forward class for people who have already had a fair amount of bio and physio. You don't have to attend class, but it will make it slightly easier when you complete the take-home exams. There was a midterm (40 percent), a final (50 percent), and four problem sets (10 percent) at the beginning of the course. How much you get out of the class is entirely dependent upon the work you put into the exams. Some questions are difficult, but in the lecture slides\/notes, you have all the information you need to get everything right.",
    "Good senior course. First part is super math-y but highly interesting. Not too difficult but will take time. Adds quantitative value to the qualitative biology material you've learned all your life. At the end i learned a lot.",
    "This class was pretty interesting and focused. I would recommend to junior and seniors alike. There are two take home tests that are not too bad to complete in the given time. The TAs decided halfway through the semester that the final should be moved and secretly added it to the syllabus after reading period ended. They told us the week before finals and made it very difficult. Don't take it if Brandon Gassaway or Jinshing Wu are TAs."
