    "Instructor: Jon Terrence Powell \u00a0I felt that he was knowledgeable about the subject matter. His understanding helped frame my group final project and give our topic the depth it needed. I don't really think he displayed any major weaknesses and some of the times the course was weak was because of the overall subject matter. I think Jon, and the teaching fellows in general, could possibly have worked with the professors to give the course more depth. At times, I felt that the topics we discussed in class were very surface-level and lacked insight. I didn't feel that way at first, but then towards the end of the semester I felt as if we were continually talking about the same thing.",
    "Instructor: Jon Terrence Powell \u00a0Jon was very kind and diligent at the moment of solving doubts and handling with the logistics of the course.",
    "Instructor: Jon Terrence Powell \u00a0I am really interested in Jon's work on waste and landfills in the U.S. and worked on a waste related topic for my final project, however I don't feel I got to take advantage of his expertise either on the project or in class. It would have been nice to have a session with him, as we did with Tamar. I also felt he was often too busy\/distracted to give us meaningful feedback on our project. We also lost his comments once because he only sent them on to one group member who did not see them in his email until much later.",
    "Instructor: Jon Terrence Powell \u00a0I thought Tamara was a bit slow on grading, but other than that, the TA's were stellar!",

The fact that we always had the 3 TAs in all the classes in a room that we often run out of seats was not a good strategy.",

    "The survey nature of this course made it less substantive than I had expected. As a non-MBA student, I was hoping for this course to be an introduction to some applied business skills. While it did introduce many concepts and helped teach the language of business, I feel it was taught at a very high, broad strokes level that left me with strategic thinking skills but not so many hard skills. Breaking up into groups for all of the projects meant that the financial analyses were always done by the MBA students, because many of us didn't know how to do them. I think this was a great class, and understand the cross-listed nature of it, but I wish there was non-cross-listed class that could be a true intro to business course for FES students.",
    "Generally, I tend to be more of an introvert--- or somewhere in between introvert and extrovert. That said, it'd be great if there are ways to facilitate involvement from more people in class. One way that I've seen this done effectively is to provide key discussion questions in the syllabus (or otherwise in advance) for each of the class sessions and\/or readings. This takes a little more in-depth planning, but I think it could be a way to encourage everyone to be engaged in the conversation, instead just a few key people that are more comfortable thinking\/speaking when less prepared. Generally, I really like the format and set-up of our classroom this year. It was designed to be engaging and conversational. I wouldn't change this aspect. Instead, I would give students a little more to prepare and think critically about before each class session.",
    "I really liked the course during the first two-thirds of the semester, and then it got a bit redundant. It seemed as if the professors stopped caring about the class toward the end of the semester. One of the teaching fellows taught a couple courses and, although she was clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter, it was evident that she was not accustomed to lecturing and her lectures were not up to the standard I would expect at a Yale graduate program. Similarly, we had a couple other guest speakers who varied in ability to engage the class. One from The Nature Conservancy was quite good, but the other woman we had lecture (Diana Glassman) was clearly not used to speaking in front of students. A lot of her comments were combative and offensive, and she was not at all encouraging or engaging. I am sure she is very accomplished, but it felt as if she was talking down to us.",
    "i wish this class gave more case studies and examples! both professors have consulted on many projects yet ONLY discussed GE's Ecomagination! It was so frustrating, repetitive, and even futile half way through the semester. This class could have been more \"strategy\" oriented rather than just general management concepts.",
    "The case studies were relevant and helpful exercises, but a lot of the readings were duplicative and outdated.",
    "Q 6: I thought the overall content of the class was very good. I wondered sometimes about how up to date some of the examples are, it might be something to consider changing cases and PPT content from year to year.",
    "As an international student, it wasn't clear to me that I had to write a lot for the midterm exam so I recommend helping next international students giving them a clear description of what is expected of them.",
    "The material covered was very superficial and it would be more suitable for an undergraduate class.",

    "The debates were very challenging, but I think we all learned so much from them. It was also a good opportunity for us to practice public speaking. I also really appreciated the powerpoint slides being posted to Classes v2. I definitely referred to them during my studying for the midterm, as well as while I was working on the final term project. That said, I also get that Prof Esty didn't do slides, which was OK. It would've been good to emphasize that his \"slides\" were really drawn from specific chapters of his books. I referred to Green to Gold for more in-depth materials and readings on Prof Esty's lectures.",
    "It was clear that both Professors Esty and Chertow were very knowledgeable about the subject matter. I enjoyed the readings and the class discussion. Dan Esty especially was a very engaging speakers and his lectures during the first two thirds of the semester were interesting, and I always looked forward to the class. I think both professors brought up very relevant and important topics that were a good source of discussion. The discussion in class was one of the best aspects of the course and I think it brought value to the overall learning of the subject matter. I also thought that the three assignments we had to complete were very interesting and helped me grasp the concepts of the course materials.",

    "The exercises should have been uploaded to the class server earlier--we often had to request for the assignments to be uploaded, which I find ridiculous. The TFs also took a long time to grade assignments and so I could not incorporate their comments by my next exercise.",
    "I would have appreciated going deeper into certain topics rather than quickly touching on many. For instance, supply chain is very interesting to me but we did not speak in detail about it.",
    "It would've been helpful to have a little more clarity\/guidance on the final project earlier in the semester. In fact, if we could've teamed up sooner and perhaps had more check-in's over the course of the semester (rather than just 1-2), it'd be even better.",
    "My one major criticism of the course was that we discussed similar US-based concepts almost every class. I think the course would have been greatly enhanced if it had a more international focus. Since the student body f the class was very international, it did not make sense to me that we mostly discussed US companies, policies, points of view, etc. I thought that the professors presented materials from a very one-sided, linear perspective that did not take into account the overarching global world view.",
    "I thought Marian's lectures had a lot of great and interesting material, but she often rushed through them and sometimes I missed the point she was trying to make because she had rushed through them. The lectures could be improved if she selected only a few of the topics in her initial slides and then elaborated more on those topics.",
    "Marian's slides need to be shortened and be more focused. More real world examples need to be worked in like the case with Trane. Furthermore, our evaluations of our debates should be given to us immediately after class.",
    "More case-study classes. Some of the concepts are to vague to be completely understood without a case.",
    "Grading was pretty slow, so it was hard to get feedback after the cases or debates in time to adjust for the upcoming cases or final group project. Lectures based off of slides could be pretty slow.",
    "The midterm was a little out of place for the style of the class, a take-home midterm might make more sense.",
    "The course would highly benefit if it has a more balanced mix between teaching concepts and discussing about business cases related to environmental issues. In my view, these two ways of teaching can be mixed in order to have a better balance throughout the semester. Maybe instead of assigning that amount of readings, one case would be enough to introduce the concepts and learn how it is put into practice in the real world. On the other hand, I believe that the final project should have been introduced earlier in the semester for student to have more time to develop a good case. In addition, more attention from the faculty members on how are the projects going throughout the semestre would increase the level of the final projects. Also related to the final projects, and acknowledging the effort from the teaching assistants to assign students to the projects they most wanted, I consider necessary to have balanced groups between domestic and international students.",

    "While the course was interesting, I found that there was heavy focus on profit gains as the central criterion in assessing corporate sustainability. While the sustainability concept itself is largely grounded in eco-centrism, I felt that the course structure viewed the environment as a fringe consideration in making a case for sustainability in a corporate environment.",

    "No",
    "Mostly, but as I mentioned above, a deeper understanding and introduction to hard skills would have been desired.",
    "In some ways, yes. But I feel that it lacked depth of big picture international issues. Almost all of our discussions were very focused on the US and I thought that the course would have been greatly enhanced with some international depth.",
    "This class met my expectations for the most part. I wish I had been exposed to a bit more financial techniques and methods.",
    "I learned less than I thought I would because I already knew much of the material. If we had studied specific cases I feel I would have gained more knowledge.",
    "Partially. I was expecting a more hands-on\/case-studies approach",
    "yes",
    "Yes. However, I would have liked more a case-based course.",
    "Yes they did. I learnt a lot from it",
    "More than met my expectations",

   "comments": [
    "Advantages were that I had some awesome teammates and learned from them. Disadvantages were that my final project was such a struggle because I had a few teammates who would not pull their weight.",
    "I learned a ton from my group and really enjoyed working from them. We all came with very unique backgrounds and contributed different skills and knowledge to the team. As I mentioned above, however, with group projects, the financial analyses always end up with the MBA student, and I did not have the opportunity to work through those exercises and really understand them.",
    "For the smaller team projects, such as the debate, things went well. Otherwise, the term project that we did in groups was really tough. Different team members had varying levels of commitment, which made it difficult to really produce a good\/solid deliverable in the end.",
    "The group I worked in was given a complex topic to research. I was disappointed that not all of the group members were engaged and it seemed that there were varying levels of commitment within my group. One advantage was that different members of the group brought different types of thoughts and strength to the discussion of content. But, overall, I felt that the work load was put more on some group members than others.",
    "Group work is always a good simulation of real-world working conditions, and a great way to apply concepts learned in the class in a hands-on manner. That said, some of the group projects in the course seemed less well-formulated and thought out than others. Ours lacked direction and a particularly clear deliverable.",
    "Advantage: I loved the collaborative nature of it and how it simulated the types of projects that people do in real work environments. Disadvantage: Some individuals did not do their work, leaving others to take on most of the responsibility of completing the project.",
    "Advantages include learning about other people's work and learning styles as well as leveraging their backgrounds to make the group better. Disadvantages include the increased time and effort it takes for projects to be undertaken because group work requires more input from people.",
    "Advantages: getting to rank the projects that you want to work on Disadvantages: our group size (five) was bigger than some of the other groups, which made it hard to coordinate schedules.",
    "did not like it when groups were chosen.",
    "Not being able to choose what group you are in for the final project made for some difficult group dynamics.",
    "One of the most interesting advantages of the group was that it was balanced between domestic and international students. I believe the mix of different backgrounds and cultures was appropriate to promote open and respectful discussions.",
    "There should have been more consideration for mixing intentional and US students so no one person is overburdened as the native English speaker.",
    "I thought the timing of the final project was great. I also thought having different partners for the debate and the final project was nice.",
    "Team members were very intelligent and dedicated, but sometimes had different expectations for the level of commitment involved.",
    "Cultural and academic differences. Age differences.",
    "Time is always an issue when working in groups. I discovered that the intensity of the semester funneled into the final weeks because of multiple group projects. The advantage to the group project is that we could all be part of a larger project by dividing the work in to manageable parts. It allowed us to present a more complete story and report in a shorter time frame.",
    "Group discussions helped shed light on the course content. Through the discussions, I was able to understand aspects of the course from different points of view.",
    "Disadvantages- No team dynamics, no help from the teaching fellows to foster team dynamics",
    "Advantage: Good practice for real world situations, which often involves group work. Disadvantages: group work.",
    "I was very happy to work with my group work. Sometimes it can be hard to work in teams but for this class the team was very cooperative and I believe we could work fine and it was a good experience to be able to apply what we learned in class."

    "Expect a high-level survey course that is interesting and engaging",
    "Take it!",
    "I would encourage students to take this course if they were interested in US views on corporate environmental strategies. I think that both professors are very knowledgeable and Esty especially is an engaging speaker. This goes for all of the FES classes I have taken so far, but sometimes i felt that the professors were presenting their opinions as fact. Sometimes I felt that we failed to look at the opposing side of an opinion or concept.",
    "Take the course if you don't have a background in CSR and are interested in learning more.",
    "I think this is a valuable course to take to understand some of the challenges corporate leaders face and the strategies they can employ when integrating environmental decisions into their businesses.",
    "Take it. Try to do the first three assignments and participate in the debate early in the semester.",
    "I will advise them to take the class",
    "Make sure you understand your debate question before you start researching",
    "This class is pretty straight forward. No surprises.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in corporate sustainability. Prospective students should prioritize readings. Very helpful to complete all readings for a specific class before the class session as it makes it much simpler to participate in discussions.",
    "Do all the readings, even if it is repetitive with what is discussed in the class!",
    "I would recommend them to take this course if they want to learn more about corporate sustainability and they can also learn how it can be applied in a business setting as well as to understand different case studies to be able to apply their knowledge in a professional context."
