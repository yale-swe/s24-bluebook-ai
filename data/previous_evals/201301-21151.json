   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it not only to every student in the history department, but even to students outside this field. I think being able to write well is at the heart of every academic discipline, and this is especially true for history. This class was very effective for making students better writers. More over, it makes you think harder about what it means to write well, and what it takes to achieve that.",
    "History 790 is a course on narrative history that is aimed at getting us to reflect on the genre boundaries in writing. Highly recommended for students interested in narratives. Not recommended for students more interested in historical data rather than writing,",
    "It would be difficult to summarize this class. Basically, it's about how we write history, and what an awareness of literature and literary techniques can bring to the practice of historical composition. I would recommend it for any aspiring historian.",
    "A great course for those interested in writing history in non-traditional ways. The course becomes a writing workshop at some point, which helps a lot to create a nice space to discuss each others writing. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend the class for anyone interested in the craft of writing history and anyone who wants to experiment with writing style. I would warn them that it's more of a workshop, in many ways, than a reading or research seminar, traditionally conceived. As a student, you get the chance to read some very interesting, experimental work (of differing qualities, in my opinion) and to try your hand at 'narrative history' yourself. A wonderful opportunity, overall."

   "comments": [
    "This class helped me in two main ways.First, it made me more attuned to good writing, and this will contribute to not only my dissertation but also to any other academic endeavor I undertake in the future.Second, it also made me more aware of the personal nature of studying history, and deepened my sensibility towards the inner voice.",
    "I think this course made me re-consider the way I am going to approach the writing of my thesis. Although it didn't give me new ideas for my dissertation, it made me realize the importance of feeling strongly for a subject matter and historical characters. I think I will be seeking that elusive alchemy with my dissertation topic.",
    "As I said above, it's not immediately clear to me what benefit this class will have. It's not a class with an obvious, tangible \"gain\" (like, say, ideas for orals reading). It's lessons are more nebulous. I hope that I have gained a new appreciation for history writing and a new way of looking at my own work.",
    "It pushed me to expand how I think about the boundaries of my discipline. I think it will be very useful when it comes time to write my dissertation and to think about style and form."
