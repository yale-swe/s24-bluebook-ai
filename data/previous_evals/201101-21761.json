    "The textbook and course is very interesting but if you have a choice then take it in the fall with Samuelson.",
    "i dont know what this class is like with other professors, but dont take it with Faingold. he basically just copies the textbook when he makes his lecture notes...so its not really worth coming to class. the tests are just...weird. you might be better off in the micro theory class, just because the tests will probably be more straightforward. faingold also tends to get defensive when students ask questions in class.",
    "Required course. Sometimes interesting discussions.",
    "take it if you need to, somewhat helpful to learn these skills",
    "learn lots of information",
    "No i would NOT recommend this class. Econ 121 is extremely annoying, and difficult. It made me not want to be an econ\/math major. Do not take this class; it will suck the spirit out of your soul and make you want to die.",
    "If you're an Econ major, you don't really have a choice in the matter...",
    "Super hard. Lecture doesn't always help you solve the problem sets. Lots of time spent at office hours",
    "for the major, maybe easier than spring semester, still bad, material interesting (kind of) but faingold is poor",
    "Run. I don't know which other professor teaches this class, but take it from that professor. You might actually learn something.",
    "It's required, so you have to take it.The question is whether to take it in the Fall with Samuelson or in the Spring with Faingold. Samuelson is probably a better teacher, but the course is a lot easier with Faingold. Take your pick.",
    "Econ 121 with Faingold was challenging. Faingold can be tough to understand but all he basically does is follow the textbook. Problem Sets are time consuming and not always the most beneficial. Only take it if it's required of you.",
    "I would recommend this to econ majors - if you're not a major, it's definitely not worth it.",
    "Subject matter is very interesting. Read Varian's and Dixit's book to learn great Micro\/Optimization theory which is very useful in Economics. This is a requirement so you probably do not have any choice but if you are motivated to learn these subjects, this is a great class to take as it takes off where Intro Micro left off but at the same time goes through all the same topicsonce again.",
    "Only take it if you have to for the Econ major.",
    "Only for your major. Really no point to taking this otherwise.Tough with Faingold, but definitely easier than other professors (at least up until the final).",
    "Don't take it unless you must",
    "A pretty simple rule to follow: take it if you have to. Don't if you don't.It's a pretty painful class, but there aren't many other options. The curve is pretty generous, so you shouldn't worry too much. That said, it's not all that enjoyable or useful.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need to take it. It's not great but if you need to get through the intermediates, it's not too bad.",
    "Professor Faingold honestly has no idea how to teach at all. He spend each lecture going over proofs really slowly. He gives the students no economic intuition, and teaches as though each student were a moron. If you can somehow avoid having him as a teacher, I recommend doing so.",
    "Take it if you're an econ major. Don't if you're not",
    "Pretty difficult, very math\/proof intensive. Don't really learn any new concepts just the math behind the concepts from intro. Wouldn't take it unless you had to.",
    "You'll be glad to be done with it.",
    "Only if you have to take it as a requirement for a major.",
    "It is mathy, generalized intro micro. Do it if you're an econ major.",
    "Not as bad as you think. Sure, some of the proofs in lecture were a little bit boring, but Professor Faingold really looks to make students understand what is going on behind the math. In a fairly math-intensive required econ class, it was great to have a professor who ultimately emphasized thematic understanding.",
    "only take this class if you are an econ major",
    "Professor Faingold's lectures are super boring. He's not an eloquent or passionate speaker; he relies too much on slides and seems to just want to get done with the lecture. His examples are extracted directly from the textbook so lectures seem redundant. The course is a mere repetition of the concepts taught in Introductory Microeconomics. Take it only if you have to (i.e., if you're an Economics or EP&E major).",
    "This class is more centered around the concepts of Micro and less on the math or algebra. If you have a strong understanding of econ and can stomach lectures that may be boring or confusing, and if it's a requirement, then take the course. Otherwise, there's nothing special or reason to take it.",
    "It is a highly rewarding class if you put the effort in. This is a great class to truely understand the the foundation of microeconomics",
    "If you're an Econ major, you have to take this class, but be forewarned - it's absolutely terrible. In the fall, you can take it with Samuelson (you learn more but it's a lot harder, with ridiculously long psets), or you can take it in the spring with Faingold (and suffer through his terrible lectures and TA's, but the psets are a lot more doable and I think people end up with better grades) - so it's a lose-lose situation. I feel like I learned very little from this class that I didn't already learn in intro micro. At the end, it's doable, but still one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, it's interesting.",
    "After Steven Berry's microeconomics, this class only makes you dumber.Take it because you have to.I found myself going to class just to see the kids in it that I was friends with, then doing emails or other work, because he was so bad at lecturing\/explaining things.",
    "It is a really boring class but altogether not that challenging. I am an econ major but I have a definite preference for macro. Basically, it boils down to the following: if you are an econ major you have to take this class, if you are not, do not take it. Because it does really suck.",
    "Hard course, but if you like economics, you will definitely be rewarded at the end of the semester, when you finally understand some of those hard concepts and how they can be applied in the real world. Exams are fair, problem sets are unnecessarily hard-- definitely do them with TAs over office hours. Doing them by yourself will only make you miserable.",
    "Take it if you have to for major, I don't see why else you'd want to.",
    "Do the readings. Go to the TA sessions. Don't go to lecture, it's really not worth your time. Faingold takes all his lecture notes directly from the textbook, Intermediate Micro by Varian, which is actually a great book!",
    "If you're an Econ major, you gotta take this. Not too hard (though not too easy) of a class, just follow the lecture notes and read the textbook for a few hours every week and you'll be fine. Faingold never tests anything too far out of left field, but going to lecture is definitely not necessary. Print out the slides and follow them assiduously, and MAKE FRIENDS (PREFERABLY MOTIVATED FRIENDS) TO OVER PSETS WITH. You'll go far, young grasshopper.",
    "a class that you take because you have to take it, if you like econ just be careful it doesn't kill it for you!",
    "Intermediate Microeconomics fell well short of the expectations I had after hearing my friends talk about how much they enjoyed taking Economics 121 in the fall with Professor Samuelson. I believe this class was not up to par mainly because of the way the class was handled by the instructor. I would recommend taking this class with anyone other than Eduardo Faingold: either take it with Larry Samuelson in the fall or take the Microeconomic Theory class. Even though ECON 121 is more mathematical with Samuelson, I would definitely recommend that to anyone any day. This class had asymptotically zero mathematics and the calculus used in the class was a joke. The homework assignments for this class were jokes. The homework assignments definitely should have been greater in number and in length, as well as more mathematically and economically in depth so that I could actually say that I walked away from the class feeling either enlightened or that I learned something that would change the way I think about economics. Instead I feel that Iwasted my time sitting through this course. Many homework assignments were never posted and\/or were posted late and we had three fewer problem sets than stated on the syllabus simply because Professor Faingold forgot to post the assignments. For a busy student who picks his schedule based on when assignments are due, this is terribly unfair. As a result of forgetting to post homework, Professor Faingold pushed back the second midterm examination an entire week which was extremely unfair to students who choose their classes based on when examinations are scheduled as listed on the syllabus, the contract between students and the instructor. Minor unilateral changes to this contract are typically acceptable; however, postponing an exam by a week is a major change and represents a breach of contract and a breach of trust. Typically, I try not to look back on things with regret; however, I have no choice but to regret choosing to take this course when I did even though it is required for the economics major and it most logically worked in my schedule in terms of feasibility and continuity. I can now understand why so many people dread taking the core courses required for the economics major: they simply do not want to waste their time taking a course which is supposed to teach them the core of microeconomic theory, but instead teaches them practically nothing at all. Professor Faingold seems like a very nice guy, but being nice certainly endows no special teaching ability on an individual, nor does it guarantee this individual will expend effort toward making his students succeed. The class barely touches the surface of the most important concepts in microeconomics and considering many students will not be taking more advanced microeconomics, this class falls well short of what an economics major should be expected to know. A more in depth coverage of all the topics taught would be very much appreciated in the future. Professor Faingold really needs to look to Professor Samuelson in order to make this classa lot better in succeeding terms. Based on my experience in this class, I would recommend that no one take Intermediate Microeconomics with Faingold unless he improves dramatically in terms of teaching ability and attitude by the next time he teaches Economics 121; instead I highly recommend taking one of the alternatives, as I wish I had waited until the fall semester to do \u0096 it would be Pareto improving.",
    "This is the worst class I have taken thus far at Yale. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this class is not bad (like many econ classes at Yale) because of the way in which it is taught. I ended up not liking Professor Faingold but honesty it wasn\u0092t his fault. The TAs (especially Anne Guan) left nothing to complain about either. No, the real problem with this class is what it\u0092s trying to teach you. The material in this class is nothing more than what you\u0092ve already seen in introductory micro but this time you get to learn the 'exciting' mathematical explanations behind the intuitive concepts you were taught in your introductory classes. YOU WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING NEW IN THIS CLASS--you will just learn how to prove that the things you already know. Only take this class voluntarily if you hunger to learn the calculus behind why competitive equilibriums produce pareto efficient outcomes or if you want to spend hours puzzling over elasticity equations to learn why monopolists produce on the elastic portion of the demand curve.If you do end up having to suffer through it though don\u0092t worry too much. Despite it being the worst class I ever took, I survived thanks to: (1) smart friends\u0097the problem sets for this class are a huge pain but if you have smart friends to \u0093teach\u0094 you the material on the problem sets, things get much easier and (2) the curve\u0097something like half of the class getsAs (1\/3 of which are straight As and 2\/3s of which are A-s) and unless you are in the bottom 5% you won\u0092t end up with anything less than a B-, also Faingold leaves people on the curve who drop out of the class which provides additional protection for your GPA.",
    "Don't take this class unless you're an econ major. The more interesting and applicable aspects of the topics were already discussed in intro micro. If you have to take the class though, Professor Faingold isn't too bad. The problem sets are much harder than the material discussed in class, and the exams are based a lot on lecture, problem sets, and old exams. The curve at the end is supposed to be pretty generous.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to.",
    "No, never. Only if you have to take it for Econ.",
    "Tests focus on the concepts of intermediate micro with some application of mathematical concepts. Faingold is a good professor and I would recommend students to take intermediate micro with him as I heard the other professor focuses heavily on mathematical aspects.",
    "Its a good class. It is interesting stuff. I would not recommend it to a fellow student unless they are majoring in Economics.",
    "Overall, Faingold's Intermediate Micro can be pretty unstructured. I like structured classes that let me know exactly what I need to study and how I should study it to do well. This usually comes from a class that has plenty of practice tests and practice problems, as well as homework problems that are related to testable material. This is not that I don't like classes that involve out-of-the-box thinking; what I like is a class that will give me a rigorous foundational practice so that I can know I am using the correct approach to coming up with creative solutions. After all, a class should teach you a new method of thinking rather than letting you try to materialize it during a test.The textbook for the class was by Hal Varian, the chief economist of Google. The textbook is pretty qualitative, and will rarely give a rigorous quantitative approach or QR examples. Instead, it gives intuitive explanations of Micro concepts such as deadweight loss. Perhaps this class could be improved by selecting a better textbook in the future.For each lecture, Professor Faingold creates his own powerpoint lectures and uploads them before class. This was much appreciated and proved very useful when it came time to study for the tests. At the beginning, the powerpoints followed the book very closely. Eventually, the powerpoints started covering material that Professor Faingold deemed relevant and deviated from the book, making the book almost useless (again, this would be helped with a better textbook in the future). His lectures were a little dry, but overall I found that he did a pretty good job of explaining things during them. He did become a bit frustrated when kids asked questions though, I guess that's a side effect of being a brilliant Yale professor.Faingold has an undergraduate Math degree. This is reflected in about 2\/3 of his problem sets, which were highly quantitative and involved a lot of equation-juggling. I'm an econ-math major so I didn't mind this, but I know that it turned off a lot of econ majors. What bothered me the most was that his tests proved to be minimally quantitative and had almost no correlation to the problem sets. Hence, you have very little practice before entering the tests other than listening to and reviewing the lectures. When he posts a practice test, often the answers are missing.You're probably deciding whether to take Intermediate Micro in the Fall (with Samuelson) or in the Spring (possibly with Faingold, if he teaches it again). I have heard that Samuelson's Micro is a good deal more quantitative, rigorous, and challenging (ie harder to get a good grade). But with Samuelson's class, you have plenty of practice and know exactly what you have to learn to do well, it just becomes a matter of spending the time to master the concepts. Faingold's class is more qualitative and nebulous (as explained above). The grade weighting is 25% psets, 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, and 35% final. Faingold historically gives 17% of the class an A, 33% A-, 45% B+\/B\/B-, and 5% C+ and below. Cheers.",
    "My only reflection on this class is that I wish I hadn't taken it. Too bad it's required for the econ major.",
    "This class is hard. The material itself isn't that difficult to grasp, but as with any econ class the grading is very harsh. The problem sets took a long time as well. Take it for the major, but not a class I'd suggest for someone who isn't an econ major.",
    "Take it as it is a requirement for the econ major and spring is better than fall",
    "The curve is extremely nice (50% A\/A-) but don't expect much out of this class. You'll spend 4-5 hours on psets (1 hour on understand the economic concept and then the rest of the time doing useless algebraic manipulations\/calculations). Exams aren't bad if you're decent at math. Lecture is useless and poorly taught.",
    "Yes, by all means",
    "This course, overall, teaches you about the concepts you learned in Intro but with more rigorous detail. However, the lecture was extremely boring, and not particularly well structured for retention. Often, what was on the tests was only skimmed through in class. Other times, the mathematical concepts underpinning a certain proof or concept were not explained. The sections also did not help make matter particularly clear. Overall, not a fun course at all, but a necessary one. I just wish it was constructed and taught more clearly, then perhaps it could even be an enjoyable course.",
    "This lecture is probably required for you if you're an econ major, and taking it off-season might be the right call. I can't say for certain because I don't have a direct comparison to the fall lecture, but the curve did seem a little more generous than other econ lectures I've had in the past (although I obviously don't know about the final yet). That said, from what I understand, the class is boring whether you take it in the fall or spring, and I'd definitely agree that Eduardo's teaching style leaves something to be desired. He'll always stop to take student questions (which is good), but lectures are unbearably dry and he sometimes made the material more confusing with the way he explained it. Shop around for sections and see which one you like the best. My TA (Anne Guan) ended up helping us through a lot of the material, and I think my experience in this class was a lot better because of her.",
    "waste of time, but you have to suffer through this for econ, epe, and the development track of global studies. have fun. btw class is entirely unimportant. section might be helpful.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise, you don't have any use for this class.Nor would you really want to take it. Personally, I didn't think the class was very difficult (or very easy), but I could see how some people might find this stuff incredibly confusing, especially since Faingold isn't the best lecturer. So yes, please be aware that thisguys lectures can be terribly boring at times, especially for people who don't find this stuff that interesting.Midterms and the final were not that difficult really. The grading on the first midterm was horrendous however, so be aware of that. The TAs didn't really seem to know what they were doing when they graded that, as their reasoning for taking off points didn't make any sense for many of the questions.Problem sets could be a bit difficult sometimes, but none of them were impossible by any means.If you go to lecture and look at the book every once in a while, it is not hard to get an A- in this class. Personally I never really opened the book, as the lectures were usually 90% or more of what you needed to know.",
    "This class is really bad. To be fair, professor Faingold is really nice and cares, but the material is poorly taught, the math is poorly explained and sometimes used too often (making it seem like a math class than an economics class sometimes), and it is unclear what students should know. If you are taking it, it is only for the credit for the major, because you will probably not enjoy it. This course should be restructured or taught by a professor who may make it more accesible.",
    "Yes, take it. It's pretty boring, but the textbook is pretty good, and lectures are very slow-paced, so you have time to digest the information. Do the problem sets carefully and make sure you understand them.",
    "I do not recommend this course for non-economics majors. The course goes into specifics that may not interest most students not studying economics. The problem sets take quite a while, and often lead to frustrating late nights.",
    "I would not take this class unless you are interested in further economics courses. Definitely a weed-out class for econ majors, and I was \"weeded out\", you could say. Not very difficult math involved, just a deeper look into Micro that left me pretty bored and regretting taking the class.",
    "pretty bad",
    "For majors only. Just a mathematical abstraction of Econ 115 that provides a foundation for more quantitative modeling \u0096 all the insights and intuitions can already be found in intro micro."
