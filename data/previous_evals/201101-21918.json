    "Easy but stimulating class. Highly introductory and at times frustratingly broad. I would recommend it, but only if the student has a vested interest in pursuing linguistics.",
    "i really liked it. the problem sets took 20 mins, 30 tops, exams were easy!",
    "YES! The material isn't always what I thought it would be (I don't know what I was expecting, in retrospect) but it was taught really, really well and I feel like I have a great foundation.",
    "The content is inherently interesting (for the most part) but the lectures are so, so boring.",
    "Definitely take this course if you need a social science. So much more enjoyable than my intro poly sci class (Comparative Politics). You learn something and there is no advantage to humanities, social science majors, because there are no papers. In fact the pset\/midterm mindset might even be an advantage to science people.",
    "Take this class. Your education is incomplete without it. I feel like a gaping hole in my general knowledge that I never knew existed has now been filled.Some parts of this class will interest you more than others. It's truly a survey of the major branches of linguistics. Each branch is related but the questions and methods are diverse.A cappella and choral singers- a solid foundation in phonetics is essential to you. This class will make you a more complete musician.",
    "I loved this class for the first several weeks of the semester, but I started to lose interest towards the end. That's not because the class got old or because I lost interest--the class moves through several different topics, and some people like some more than others. Dasha is mostly quite entertaining, and linguistics as a whole is a subject I'm very glad to know a bit about. I'd definitely recommend the class. It also involves almost no work.",
    "I enjoyed the class. Dasha is a really fun lecturer. Some of the units are more interesting than others, and I found the guest lecturers really dull. However, for a broad overview on how language works, this is a fun and easy course. I would recommend it.",
    "This is an easy and interesting social science credit. I don't know if there are many people searching for these, but if you are, this course is for you.",
    "Great class! It's like having the combo platter in a restaurant; there are a lot of different topics and one is bound to interest you. That said, you probably will be truly bored by some topic, most likely by the guest lectures at the end, which were dreadful\/useless\/confusing. Also, some people in lecture tend to get over-excited and ask nitpicky questions that are beyond the scope of the course, which can be frustrating. Don't let that dissuade you, because the course itself is well taught by Dasha, whose lectures are engaging and accompanied by useful handouts. The homework and tests were never too difficult, and you will be amazed at how much work your brain does without you ever knowing.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's a good combination: lenient grading, fun material (it's an intro class), and not too much work.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in Linguistics or Cog Sci. I learned more in this class per hour of work I put into it than in any other class I've taken at Yale so far. A solid overview of subjects in Linguistics. If you already know some Linguistics, you might be a little bored, but I bet you'll have fun anyway (Dasha is really cool).",
    "This course is good - it covers a lot of material, but in a much better way (in my opinion) than most So credits. The exams are not bad, pretty close to the homework which is nice. Best way to complete a So credit for someone who isn't interested in Social Science. Dasha is wonderful - we had two guest lecturers at the end but I found myself wanting her to come back. Some parts of the course won't interest you as much as others but since there's so many aspects of it, you're sure to find one that's your area. This class has a super light workload - the hardest it gets is studying for the two exams and writing a very short (1 page or less) paper. Homework takes about half an hour a week, and reading is about a chapter every two weeks out of a very interesting textbook.",
    "I would recommend this class! It's great and it's very interesting!",
    "Brief overview of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and historical linguistics, with guest lectures on neuro\/psycholinguistics and animal communication at the end. The guest lecturers are so-so, but Dasha is a wonderfully clear instructor. However I don't think she will be teaching next year, so it really depends on who is teaching it. Easy course, good if you just want to get a taste of what linguistics is.",
    "It's not a lot of work, and it's a discipline that many people know nothing about. I'm not sure how much the course does to give people the kind of basic linguistics education everyone should have. It's more of a sampler of the different subfields. I would call this class \"Linguistics for the prospective concentrator\" or something like that, and create another class called \"Basic linguistics you need to know if you don't want to study it further.\" Maybe.",
    "This class was rather like an antipasto or sampler tray, since it features a little bit of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, historical linguistics, and other areas of interest, neatly arranged into chapters. Dasha did a great job of clarifying the premises of these disciplines--shame she's leaving for Berkeley this year. You only get basics (not even necessarily THE basics, but a certain approach to them) of each discipline, but they're all very interesting. It's kind of like academic speed-dating. It's fun, it's challenging but not too hard, it's a unique way of looking at language. I recommend it.",
    "I would recommend LING110 as an intro to the various fields of linguistics. If you're considering linguistics as a major, it does help you get a sense of what you would like to concentrate on in the future. However, beware that the textbook sometimes simplifies things for understanding. The problem sets were eminently manageable and the midterms and final were just the right difficulty, in my opinion.",
    "Don't take this if you just love learning languages and think it'll help you with learning languages - it will not help. Linguistics is the study of languages themselves, and not how to use them.",
    "Take it if you know a bit about what linguistics is and you know that you are definitely interested in it. If you don't really know what linguistics entails, do a quick bit of research\/asking around to find out the nature of what you'll be doing in problem sets--syntax trees, IPA, phonological rules. Then, reevaluate whether you're interested. I wish I had known what I was getting myself into because, although I'm sure it was interesting for those who were interested enough, I know I wouldn't take it again.",
    "This was a fun, lively course. I knew absolutely nothing about Linguistics before, but Professor Kavitskaya made everything so clear and interesting. The class moved at a perfect pace, and the amount we learned from each linguistics subsystem was just right. It was a true delight to take. Professor Kavistskaya is a lovely, lovely woman. I couldn't have taken this course with anyone else and enjoyed myself so much. If you can, get E-Ching for section - great TA and you can approach both professor and her about ANY QUESTIONS.That being said, there are some people who are just not into linguistics, and you may be one of those people! For such people, this is NOT a gut course, though the workload is manageable. I had a great time, but I am not into phonetics\/phonology as much as I am into suntax\/semantics, and had a difficult time the first few weeks (since phonetics\/phonology were covered then). Now, I love all of it! But really determine for yourself if this course is for you. Many of my friends discovered that the linguistics discipline was far more difficult than they could take or just different from what they thought it to be. Find out for yourself! T took it credit\/d\/fail, then changed to a letter grade.",
    "A good, interesting, not-too-heavy class. Lecture was more complicated than the homework, which was kind of confusing but kind of fun. Worst part of this class was the time slot. Sleepy afternoon time.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are dedicated to going to all lecturesAnd sections, because it'll be a good class to get an A in. If you're not really interested in the material, it'll drag on and feel like a chore. It was a good overview course, though.",
    "Linguistics 110 is an in-depth introduction to linguistics. It's more than what you're looking for if you're interested in completing a distributional requirement or are curious about the subject, and for those students I can't say that I'd recommend the class. However, if you're primary focus is something of this nature, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this if you are planning in majoring in linguistics. If not, try to just sneak in to a more specialized linguistics seminar or small lecture because I think that would be a lot more interesting.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest whatsoever in linguistics or language. It's a super gut but a fun one. No papers, minimal homeworks, easy tests, interesting material.I learned that the English plural ending is really \/-z\/ not \/-s\/, and the reason why we say \"symporter\" and \"synporter\" and \"impossible\" not \"inpossible,\" even though normally \/syn-\/ and \/in-\/ are the prefixes. It's cool, I promise.",
    "It's a decent intro to the subject, especially if you've never done any linguistics before. However, the depth of coverage in any single topic is not that great.",
    "yes - not stressful and very interesting, since covers diverse fields in linguistics.",
    "This is a good overview of linguistics. The material can be pretty boring, though, and a lot of it is dry. I took it because I love learning languages, so I thought it would be very interesting, but I quickly realized that it was very different from what I had anticipated. I do think it was worthwhile - I think it depends a lot on the individual. Some people in the class loved it. Definitely worth shopping it to see.",
    "Great introduction to linguistics--you'll learn everything from phonetics to semantics, with a few extra lectures on historical linguistics, neurolinguistics, and animal communication. Dasha (Darya) is a great lecturer with a lot of insights on language. Course is paced reasonably and definitely not work-intensive.",
    "I would only take the class if you strongly believe linguistics might be your calling.",
    "If you don't know what linguistics actually is but want to learn about how people speak things and what that wordsy stuff actually is at heart, this is a great way to start. Though it gets dry at times and is somewhat easy, this class covers the basic areas of actual modern linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, historical linguistics, language in the mind\/brain, animal communication); by covering each one in some detail, this class will give you a very exact idea of which linguistic areas excite you and which connect to other disciplines you might have an interest in (cogsci, compsci, philosophy, anthropology, etc.) It'll take some sitting through things you'll hate, but it's better to learn exactly which things those are early on.Dasha is also a terrific lecturer who gives very clear, solid lectures while keeping it funny and engaging.",
    "Take it! Some of the topics aren't super interesting, but this varies for everyone. It's a great way to take care of a Social Science credit.",
    "This course is a broad survey of the major subfields of linguistics, which is a very diverse field. Some people prefer certain subfields to others, but I really liked that we got to get a little taste of everything without spending too much time on any one subject. Phonetics\/phonology seem really tough at first, but at a certain point they just click. Advice: memorize the IPA chart early on (and, once you get to phonology, understand how the features chart maps onto the table). Dasha is a very fun professor whose lectures are helpful, and her supplementary handouts are very clear. Be aware that you\u0092re not responsible for memorizing everything that\u0092s covered in lecture when it comes time for the tests, which are very reasonable just like the eight problem sets. You just have to figure out how much material you\u0092re responsible for before the tests. Take section with E-Ching Ng if at all possible; she was fantastic and possibly the best TA I\u0092ve had in eight semesters at Yale! I took this class in my last semester at Yale as a fun, stress-free elective with no papers to write, and I couldn\u0092t have made a better choice.",
    "Well, there are two reasons to take LING110. If you want to knock out an EASY Social Science Credit, take this course; if you want to figure out (a) in which field of linguistics you would like to specialize or (b) whether you would like to major in linguistics at all, take this course. Do not expect something at all difficult, and likewise, particularly, mind-blowingly interesting. This class was a wisely-chosen fifth class in my schedule that didn't really challenge me, but that was what I wanted. Darya, by the way, is great: very knowledgeable, personable, and also subtly funny.",
    "I would recommend it ONLY if the student is interested in intro linguistics or has some background but wants to explore more topics. The class can be a bit boring and dry, but the material itself I found to be quite interesting and enjoyable. If you keep up with the handouts and textbook readings, the class is quite easy and moves at a good enough pace - 2 weeks per section. I definitely found the course to be interesting because it touched on many different topics, and would recommend it only if you are interested in linguistics.",
    "Linguistics 110 is an introductory overview of topics in linguistics. The course summarizes a great deal of material with relatively little work. I would definitely recommend the course to any student interested in linguistics.",
    "Many people shop linguistics, and far fewer actually take it. You'll find out within the first couple of weeks if it's for you. If it is, you're in for a fun semester. Don't let phonetics scare you away; there's many more interesting things to come!"
