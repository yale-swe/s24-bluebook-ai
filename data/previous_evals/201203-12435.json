   "comments": [
    "it is absolutely necessary to do all of the readings. they are the most fun, exciting works in the history of mankind",
    "yea. Take it. you'll have a better picture of how social theories have developed and apply to the society, if you have not yet.",
    "Take it. Professor is great and content is very interesting",
    "Interesting course. take it.",
    "A synopsis of major social theorists. I had been wanting to take this type of course for a long time, and I saw it as a great opportunity to tackle of of the greatest sociology works.",
    "Yes. I think the understanding of key western thinkers that this course provides you with is important for all sociology majors.",
    "SOCY 151 is an overview of the major Western canonical sociologists, ranging from Aristotle all the way to more modern Du Bois and De Beauvoir. I would recommend this course because it is a great broad-base class for anyone interested in learning more about the basics of sociology and philosophy without drowning yourself in readings or annoying papers.",
    "Good class, good lectures. You have to be motivated to do the readings. Otherwise, you can still learn a lot.",
    "If you're looking to explore different areas of study, this is a great class to try out. Informative and fun without a lot of stress.",
    "Yes, its a good intro course to all the basic sociology theories out there. the class is pretty well organized and Professor Erikson is a very clear and concise lecturer.",
    "Yes. Will teach you what should be learning in college.",
    "I would recommend this course to a peer only if it is taught by Professor Erikson. She makes a daunting selection of readings more understandable and enjoyable. Students are graded on five quizzes and two short 5-6 page papers. The quizzes were not too difficult; they were usually three questions of which you had to chose two to answer. For the papers, the TF and Professor Erikson were willing to look at first drafts and give feedback. It is a very manageable course.",
    "A good course for students with no background on sociological\/political science courses and for students with such background. Professor Erikson explains the material very clearly, and is always willing to help\/talk to students about any matters.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Marx, Durkheim, Weber -- these are readings that everyone should probably do as an undergrad. Professor Erikson is great! She's really really nice and approachable and helpful. The lectures are engaging, and she does a wonderful job at showing the relevance of social theory to our everyday lives. Every other week there is a short quiz that's not too difficult and as long as you pay attention in lecture you're fine. And there are two short papers which were actually enjoyable to write. Fantastic class!",
    "Required course for Socy. Emily Erikson is really nice, and the course isn't too difficult.",
    "This class is really interesting--you read the theorists you really SHOULD read if you're a social science major, and Professor Erikson does a great job of explaining them in lecture. If you go to lecture regularly (which you should because it makes the readings so much clearer) then you will do fine in the class. There are regular quizzes and two papers, but it's absolutely a manageable amount of work.",
    "This class is a good way to explore a lot of really important thinkers from Aristotle to Marx, and read a lot of texts that I think everyone should have a basic knowledge of. It definitely helps you get a good, basic understanding of important Western social theorists and Professor Erikson is good at making it interesting.",
    "Professor Erikson is a great lecturer and her presentations are generally more interesting than the readings themselves - while they are foundational texts, the sociology majors who are required to take this class have probably read most of them already, and they're pretty dense to boot. The class has five short quizzes on the readings that should be pretty simple if you've gone to lecture, where Professor Erikson really gets at the core concepts of the readings. There are two 5-6 page papers that are also very straightforward.",
    "A great sweep of the great theorists. Very basic information that one has to know to become a better sociology student."
