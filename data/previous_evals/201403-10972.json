   "comments": [
    "I found it to provide the tools and skills that are necessary to help historians professionalize through an examination of themes such as historical objectivity, micro-history, macro-history, and historiography. Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is essential to help history graduate students develop their thinking as historians.",
    "Since this course is required for all incoming history PhDs, I wouldn't really be in a position to recommend it or not. I probably would not have taken this course if I hadn't had to. But with that being said, I think I learned a lot of valuable things from it.",
    "It is a nice course to begin your Phd with, the reading list is a very useful list for people curious about everything and histories of everywhere.",
    "Overall an interesting class, but one that required a very selective approach. The heavy amount of readings meant students needed to pick and choose what to focus on in a way that could sometimes leave the class feeling disjointed since not all were on the same page and had read the same material. By far the greatest aspect of the class was the introduction to new subfields and historical approaches and the ability to learn from students working in different fields and frameworks.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this course to another student. I might if it were with a smaller group.",
    "It was a great opportunity to know my cohort and read text outside of my field.",
    "Hist 500 encourages students to engage with seminal texts and historiographical movements. Moreover, it offers a crucial opportunity for students to collaborate with others outside of their fields, creating a collegial atmosphere that I believe will facilitate future success. I absolutely recommend this (required) course!",
    "This course offers an excellent introduction into the craft of writing history."

   "comments": [
    "As a broad introduction to numerous authors and historical theory, it was invaluable. I especially found the introduction to the history of the American historical profession appropriate.",
    "I was pushed to examine my biases. Not sure how the assessment would pan out since we are all working on such diverse books and fields but I did take away lessons from the course.",
    "Essential knowledge of the field-- required, but also very helpful.",
    "I think the course does a fairly useful job of introducing students to the history of the field and the development of specific approaches and subfields over time. Whether or not it has contributed to my personal research is hard to say at this point, but certainly it introduced me to new readings that have opened new interesting questions for future thought.",
    "This course helped me see many of the issues scholars grapple with when attempting to communicate with each other.",
    "You know what? I've actually found Novick to be quite helpful in putting together those dratted historiographical papers for classes outside of Hist 500. As much as I would like to have seen therapy and uppers administered to him by court order, he's proven useful!",
    "This course offered several model works for which I hope to adopt certain creative methodologies when writing my own dissertation."
