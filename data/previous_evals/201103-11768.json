   "comments": [
    "You have to take it with Mme Koundi! She is energetic and always positive, and her attitude helps balance out the sad and depressing stories that we read. Plus, she is good at criticizing a person's French without cutting them down. Overall, L4 is similar to L2 and L3 in the workload, but is different in that we focus more on the stories and themes than on the grammar and vocabulary.",
    "your French will dramatically improve; Koundi's a clear and enthusiastic teacher who will sometimes play favorites; the curriculum is remarkably well put together; be prepared for the terrible grind of a five-day-a-week class. Daily assignments take between an 1-1.5 hours and - in ways that will remind you of high school - always extend your evening longer than you'd like. But this is what learning a language requires and ultimately your work yields much, much improved French.",
    "This was a decent class we read interesting (depressing) books and it was a lot of work. Take it if you need to and it can be fun at times. Madame Koundi is nice and does seem to care about us as students. She sometimes plays favorites of the students are really good at french. Overall, a very good professor who taught me a lot of french.",
    "This is a great course for those who have covered mostof the rules of French grammar and have a large French vocabulary but are not yet fluent. Although I do not feel fluent after coming out of this class (it would take at least a term in France to achieve fluency in the spoken language alone) I feel as though I have a much better grasp on the syntax and diction of the language and have increased my vocabulary by hundreds of words. I would recommend this course to a student who either wishes to touch up on his grammar before moving to higher level French or to a student who would like to take only one semester of a language at Yale and then be done with the language requirement.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to improve your French writing and reading ability. You should be prepared to do a fair amount of work most nights.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is debating between French 4 and 5. This course is great for someone who enjoys French and wants to fulfill their Yale language requirement but does not want to be too challenged and overwhelmed with homework.",
    "A lot of work, like any language, but very enjoyable.",
    "I have learned so much through the L3\/L4 sequence, and my French has gotten a lot better as a result. Yes, there is a lot of work, but you learn a lot as a result. This is the first French class in which you will begin to be weaned off of grammar - rather than focusing on rules, the emphasis is on clear and articulate speech. Good, in my opinion.Mme Koundi is a wonderful person and professor. She is great during office hours and is interested in her students as real people, which opens the door for real conversation (in French, of course).",
    "If you're not a freshman you've already taken some french courses at Yale, and you know how much work they can be. You also know how friendly and helpful the professors in the department are. This class is no different, except that the workload is a little less than L3 and L2. I would certainly recommend taking it with Madame Koundi if you can, she's entertaining and a wonderful teacher, even at 9:30 in the morning. If you're a freshman, buckle down, it will be fun and a lot of work, and since you're a freshman going into L4 I'm sure you can do it. The readings are very interesting and it is really rewarding how much of if you find yourself able to do at this level of French. French 140 is a good class and if you put the effort it you will reap the benefits.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to solidify their grammar, speaking, and writing skills, whether they plan to move on to French 150 or not."
