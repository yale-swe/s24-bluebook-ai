    "Great class, manageable work, great professor.",
    "Good way to maintain your Chinese after returning from Light. Definitely a step down in intensity, but still worthwhile. Both Zhou Laoshi and the textbook are superb.",
    "Take it for sure if you want to keep up your Chinese skills. A easy class with the right amount of work to make some progress with language skills. Zhoulaoshi is great and extremely nice!",
    "Chinese 154 is a great class. Although it only meets three times a week, you still learn a lot. It's hard work, but well worth it.",
    "Chinese 154 is extremely different from a Light fellowship summer program, which most people finish before enrolling in 154.Wasn't extremely impressed by this class. It doesn't take a lot of work, but what work it does take was always really annoying to do.If you are dedicated to learning Chinese, then you have to take it. If you're on the fence about Chinese study, then maybe try looking for other classes.",
    "Take it! Great class! One of the best taught chinese classes I've ever taken. Manageable and fair. Zhou Laoshi is amazing! So organizing and caring and thoughtful. Completely upfront with expectations and very consistent."
