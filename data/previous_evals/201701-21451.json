    "Definitely improved on my conversational French. Much more help with conversational than with grammar - grammar was a lot of repeat from L2.",
    "I improved by comfort in speaking and writing French significantly.",
    "My French got so much better! My accent, ease of speaking, knowledge of the verbs, vocab... it's a pain to show up to class every day of the week, but it does pay off. You get out what you put in... if you show up every day willing to learn, you will."

   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of work. I think it is structured very well, with French literature being used as the basis through which to learn. My issue was I dislike literature, so it was often painful to get through.",
    "The books and films are a highlight of the course, but the audio program falls a bit short in both length and material and could be updated or modified.",
    "Soumia is amazing--very French in spirit, you might be a bit scared of her, but she really is one of the most caring and understanding professors, so I strongly recommend picking her section! She really cares about all of her students, and if she seems to be picking on you, it's only because she knows you can get better and wants to help you to do so. The course is very formulaic insofar as you follow the syllabus very precisely, so you know what work you have to do when. The exams were fair--you basically knew what would be on them in advance. The biggest pain was the vocab: you'd have to memorize all of the vocab words (and there were over 50 for Jules et Jim) and then reproduce them on the exams without a word bank. While it's good to have a lot of practice, I think that some of the work in the course-pack was busy-work, not really helping me to learn that much. It's unclear if the work in the course-pack is graded: Soumia checked it for completion twice throughout the semester, but I didn't see that reflected anywhere--it's probably minimal if it is. So use your time wisely and in whatever way you will learn best. Sometimes we were given assignments to do after class in addition to the coursepack--those assignments were usually much more useful.",
    "Super boring, outdated material, that does nothing to keep students entertained or engaged. Nothing in the course is relevant to student's lives. I don't even think the grammar is well taught and the class hardly has a structure other than going through the texts\/movies."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah, I mean you have to take it if you're doing French and are completing the language requirement.",
    "Madame Koundi is an excellent teacher and the course certainly improved my French abilities.",
    "While I can't say it was the most thrilling class I've ever taken because it's an L3 language class, I really did get so much better at French. French is one of the most robust languages at Yale--it and the East Asian languages are notoriously difficult, so if you want to skate by on your language, consider something else. However, if you really want to succeed and learn how to speak, then this is the class. It's a lot of work, some of which is more and less useful that other parts, and it's a pain to go to class every day of the week, but I would recommend it. Soumia is lovely and energetic, and I was always happy to see her. The course isn't really that difficult if you have a decent French background--if you do all of the work (or even most of it), you should be fine, because you can basically predict what will be on the exams, and then it's just learning grammar rules and memorizing the vocab. Just go into it knowing that it's going to chew up a decent amount of time, and then if you have the attitude of wanting to learn this language, it could be a real pleasure. Do the assignments that she gives you in class to do for homework--those are often what's going to be on the test. Most important thing on the coursepack is the listening\/identification section, because those always come up on the test.",
    "Absolutely not. Horribly boring class, the workload expected is absurd, considering it is a required class. Much more difficult than other L3 languages that peers have experienced."
