   "comments": [
    "This course provides a thorough introduction to the Persian language and Iranian culture. Writing, speaking, reading, and listening skills were emphasized and progressed rapidly throughout the semester. I am now able to hold basic conversations about myself, my family, my home, and my daily routine fairly competently. The differences between spoken and written Persian are highlighted appropriately. I also gained valuable insight into the culture of Iran and the Persian-speaking world.",
    "Huge improvement in writing (learned a whole new alphabet), reading, speaking an understanding Persian!",
    "I learned a great deal about the Persian language, as well as about Persian culture. My Persian skills, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening improved immensely over the course of the semester. I also gained new insights on how to study for language exams, and the best methods with which to study for language exams, compose essays, and prepare for presentations.",
    "I immensely enjoyed my time in PERS 110. Professor Shayesteh expects you to practice your Persian at home, but she does an excellent job of teaching the basics without bombarding you by speaking in just Persian. At the end of one semester I can carry an in-depth conversation, write and read Persian.",
    "I definitely improved my language skills by taking this course. I feel a lot more comfortable learning a language now, and I have advanced significantly in my knowledge of Persian."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the variety of activities that you do (conversational practice, oral presentations, partnered skits, etc.) and the professor herself. Professor Shayesteh is such an asset to this course and this department; her firm but caring demeanor is perfect for language study, and I would not have been able to progress so quickly without her help. The main weakness of this course is the textbook; there are many typos, and some of the activities are hard to follow as the book was clearly not written by a native English speaker. There are discrepancies between what the book includes and what is necessary to know in class, such as certain vocabulary words that have to be added in on top of the textbook vocabulary because it is so lacking. Obviously, there aren't that many Persian textbooks out there, but it would be worthwhile to search for a new resource.",
    "Great course, with a lot of energy from the students and professor. Persian is a beautiful language and not too hard to learn once you get a hang of the alphabet. My only suggestions for improvement are to increase the speed slightly, increase the amount of vocabulary learned in each chapter, and provide more feedback to students (especially on speaking) throughout the semester.",
    "The strengths of this course are certainly the small class size and the competence and expertise of the professor. The course is extremely effective at teaching reading and writing skills, however, the course is less focused on speaking and listening. To improve the course, a greater focus on hearing the language, both online and in class, would be amazing.",
    "The strengths of the course are the manageable pace, conversations about the political and cultural past of Iran, and the fun projects, such as a role play and introducing your family.",
    "One major strength of this course was its uniqueness. Not many people have a knowledge of the Persian language or the nation of Iran, and this course shed light on both subjects. I feel that one slight weakness of this course was the workload, I felt like I devoted most of my time working to this class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student serious about learning Persian. The workload is engaging if you are interested in the material, but can become overwhelming if you simply don't care.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it! As a senior who took it for personal reasons, I really enjoyed it. The class is very rewarding and you learn quite quickly. In the first couple months who learn an entire new alphabet, and by the end of the semester you're able to give a 5 minute presentation completely in Persian, and write 2-3 page long essays in Persian. While there is some homework almost every night, I did not find the workload overwhelming at all. Constant practice is the best way to learn a language. My main criticism is that I sometimes felt we could have gone through the material a little faster and learned more vocabulary in each chapter. Looking forward to L2!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Persian language and culture. Although L1, this class is certainly no joke, and Professor Shayesteh has high expectations, so don't expect a gut language. However, if you're ready to put in some work and show enthusiasm for the course material, this class is a very enjoyable and rewarding experience!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's a great language (with only two irregular verbs and no gender assignments), plus Professor Shayesteh is passionate about teaching the course, which makes it enjoyable.",
    "Yes, I would. I had a lot of fun in this class and I would want to share the knowledge of a unique subject with others."
