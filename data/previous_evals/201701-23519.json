    "I think the online lectures were helpful and gave a strong overview of ethical considerations from a variety of perspectives. I do think in order for the class to feel a bit more substantive the in-class lecture time should be extended to 90 minutes rather than 1 hour.",

I really liked her a lot and hope I can take another class with her next year. I really appreciate how she incorporated issues that are not always present elsewhere (environmental justice, environmental health, etc.)",
    "Interviews with experts were really engaging - it would be great to have them guest lecture some time in the future.",
    "The subject matter is vital for people to learn, at least since the concepts behind thought experiments are broadly applicable in post-grad life, even if the thought experiments themselves will never actually happen.",

    "So I think this class is really important and I'm SO glad it's at FES. But this format doesn't do the material justice. We would have really benefitted from a longer class time for more discussion - things always felt very rushed. I like the half-semester schedule, but maybe a 1.5-2 hour meeting slot instead of just 1 hour?",
    "Time could be extended for class discussion. Sometimes felt like the class wasnt as focused as it could have been.",
    "The course readings and work were not taught in a very engaging manner. Professor Bell explained topics well and was responsive to questions, but the layout of the course really felt shallow in how topics were discussed. Things seemed glossed over. I think the flipped nature of the class hurts it in some ways, and stronger lecture times would be better.",
    "I think this course should be expanded for more credits and to provide more time for classroom lecture and discussion. I would have definitely liked to have more in-class time to hear other students thoughts and get more lecture from Professor Bell.",
    "This course needs an overhaul. The weeks did not seem to build on one another. The readings were too broad. The online discussion forum was not particularly useful or illuminating. In-class presentations were not an effective way to learn.",
    "Explanation of jow the group \"debates\" would be performed\/function."

    "Michelle is great!! And its a wonderful class for a 2-credit course.",
    "Save the lecture videos and take notes as they are really fantastic!",
    "In its current form, this is not a particularly useful or interesting course. I would recommend looking at the syllabus and talking with students who have taken the course. This course needs help. This is true for many of the 6-week courses. It is hard to gain much from 6 short weeks. If you are someone who wants a super easy 2-credits and wants to simply watch some videos on-line this may be a good class for you. But if you want your time at Yale to be a bit more meaningful, find another class. I would suggest looking at some courses at the Divinity School instead. Look at classes by Willie Jennings. He seems good.",
    "This is a interesting course, but it could benefit from a longer and more vigourous course structure. I really enjoyed the in-class discussions and thought all the material was very valid and interesting. I just wish there was more time to get into the topics in a little more depth."
