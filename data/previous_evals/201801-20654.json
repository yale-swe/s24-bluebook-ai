    "Learned about a broad range of topics in machine learning (particularly deep learning).",
    "I learned about many different topics in machine learning, especially in deep learning.",
    "the latest knowledge about deep learning.",
    "Seminar format was great for deep learning, which is a rapidly advancing field. Getting to have lively discussion with current applied math PhD students was very helpful. In particular, discussions around deep networks and generalization were very clarifying.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The course is very shaped by its students and their interests, so we spoke about a range of research topics during the semester which I found to be particularly memorable. Weaknesses: The class is pretty unstructured, which can be difficult at times to ascertain how well I'm doing in the class.",
    "Interactive format is good. Would have been better held in a small meeting room to encourage discussion.",
    "It's very relaxed and student-run. I was very satisfied with the course.",
    "I thought the reading, presentation and discussion format was quite good. My one suggestion would be to have a smaller set of readings for each class and have everyone read each reading instead of having a selection of readings to choose from. I think this would have lead to more productive discussions."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in research and don't really want to do more problem sets, this is a great low-workload class for the Computer Science and Applied Math majors that discusses interesting material.",
    "Yes. This is a very good way of learning about a wide range of topics in deep learning and encouraging critical thought about the current dogma. Also the interactive format meant I got to know more of my peers than I otherwise would have.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if that student wanted an introduction into a wide range of current machine learning topics."
