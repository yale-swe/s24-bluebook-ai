   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, it allowed one to rethink African American history.",
    "This course was amazing! It provides a thorough overview of African American history since 1865 and you will learn a great deal from Glenda. I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to fellow students. The course provides an essential foundation of knowledge in African American history and a reading skill-set that is essential for understanding the field of History. Professor Gilmore is an extraordinary teacher, and each class session is an opportunity to engage critically and rigorously with major ideas in the field of African American history (and AFAM studies more broadly).",
    "The course is a helpful seminar that enables students to study the history of African American life from emancipation to 2015. The course readings mainly focus on the east coast of the United States with some attention to the west coast in the final weeks of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The way that Glenda navigates the course material and encourages discussion and debate on the topic is useful to both academic and persona growth on the subject.",
    "A critical course for students interested in U.S. history.",
    "Professor Gilmore really crafted the syllabus to guide students through African-Americans' history from 1865-present. She not only taught about major milestones like Emancipation, Reconstruction, and the Long Civil Rights Movement, but the cornerstone of the course was her emphasis on focusing on African-Americans' interior lives as not solely defined by interactions with whites in order to examine the black communities that flourished after the Civil War and beyond in order to underscore African-Americans' joys, heartbreaks, and triumphs apart from whiteness and white supremacy in order to demonstrate that while blacks' lives interacted with and were impacted by white supremacy, that there were other important, enjoyable aspects of the black experience.",
    "\"If you're in African-American Studies, you need to take this class. It will be the best foundation possible for all your future study.\"",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, especially to any students working on American history\/American Studies\/any work related to race and ethnicity. It's a wide but very intensive survey on African American history from Emancipation onward, with a significant load of reading but one that's well worth taking on.",
    "HIST 750 is a rigorous course and imperative course for all students of History and for all students who are getting a degree from a U.S. institution. Methodologically it provincializes conventional narratives of U.S. history and re-configures the dominant narrative to consider the African American experience. Very important both methodologically and content-wise.",
    "This course is a must-take for a rigorous and thorough history of African American post-Emancipation.",
    "I would describe this course as a rigorous introduction and recalibration of the last 150 years of African American history, a course designed to challenge and enlighten on multiple planes. I would strongly recommend this course to others."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I have now a number of books and articles that I can teach.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline profession as it not only provided insight into the history and experiences of African Americans, but also was attentive to paradigms and debates within my discipline. This course will contribute a great deal to my research and dissertation.",
    "This course provided me with essential content knowledge in African American history. It also provided me with a set of critical reading skills that will support my secondary reading and research when I approach my dissertation. I feel much more knowledgable about the field and profession of African American history after taking this course.",
    "It offered a more holistic understanding of African American history since Emancipation",
    "This course heightened my understanding of the black communities that existed\/formed and how they not only resisted white supremacy as it continually transforms in American society, but also find joy in their lives despite dire circumstances and also apart from white society.",
    "I can't speak to a dissertation quite yet, but its readings and Professor Gilmore's scholarship exposed me to different ways of thinking about African American history that I hadn't really encountered in my prior study, which focused on the political and the theoretical.",
    "As an African American Studies PhD students, I feel like this course gave me the critical historical foundation for my field, and I do feel quite comfortable and more than capable in engaging with some of the conversations and aspects of black American history.",
    "This course has allowed me to develop conceptual ideas for my dissertation research - the LCRM has proved extremely useful. The practical assignments - mock orals, syllabus, imperative historiography - are all work-products that I will use throughout my doctorate.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge considerably, but the biggest impact was something far greater than the addition of many texts to my reading lists. This course guided my thinking--honing in on what it means to think historically, to think like an historian, and to understand oneself in relation to one's work. This course and Gilmore's introduced new vocabulary and ways of thinking that I will without doubt place at the center of my own research."
