    "Spanish 120 is a terrible course. I don't think I learned very much this semester. I was constantly frustrated because there was so much useless busy work assigned. This course is available to learn spanish and fulfill the language requirement. Take it for that reason.",
    "I would recommend this course. You'll learn a lot of new grammar and phrases that would be very helpful in a Spanish-speaking country.",
    "it was a good class overall- not too much work and expands upon basic spanish",
    "You probably don't have a choice.",
    "dont take if you dont have to",
    "Spanish 120 was more fast-paced than 110, and we learned a lot of new grammar rules in a short amount of time. However, with constant studying, the workload was manageable.",
    "This class is for furthering your knowledge of web tenses and vocabulary."
