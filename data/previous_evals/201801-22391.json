    "No, I would not recommend this course. While the subject matter is interesting, the current professor does not have a good command of it and does not relay the information very well. Feedback is vague and disjointed, and you never really know where you stand in the course.",
    "Don't take this course if Professor Kritzman-Amir is teaching it. The course material may have been interesting, but she had no idea how to teach undergraduates, and her final paper assignment that was worth a large portion of the grade (a legal brief) was ridiculous given that we were never taught how to write a legal brief. Participating in class was impossible as she did next to nothing to facilitate conversation. Overall the course was very poorly taught and material that may have otherwise been interesting was rendered boring by Professor Kritzman-Amir's teaching style (lecturing from power points for 2 hours).",
    "The best class I have taken at Yale, I truly felt like I have learned a lot and actually following this semester decided to follow a path in refugee\/migration law in the future. Prof. Kritzman-Amir was amazing and ensured a good balance between theory and thinking about real case studies which we were made to work on in class and then for the final brief. The course was grounded in reality and no other class I have taken at Yale gave me so much in terms of tangible knowledge that I can use in the future. The readings were mostly a mix of legal texts and reports, and Prof. referred those interested in a theoretical-ethical framework to relevant literature that wasn't assigned. Because of what type of people are selected for the seminar, you'll be discussing with a bunch of inspiring, open-minded individuals with very diverse experiences, which was an additional plus and made for some of the best in-class discussions I have ever had."
