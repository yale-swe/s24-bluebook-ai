   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want to continue with math but do not want to be a STEM major. It is interesting and engaging and you will learn a bunch. Professor Hall is wonderful, and while the workload is difficult, it is absolutely worth it.",
    "Im so glad I took this class over Math 115 or Math 120. I was fairly intimidated coming into this class, because math has never been one of my strong suits, and I generally love studying economics for the people-related aspects more than the number-related aspects. After taking this class, I feel a lot more comfortable with my math background in any future classes, and also have discovered that I might even like the subject a lot more than I thought I did. The class is very well structured, even though it covers two separate subjects. There is a lot of guidance and support offered from both Professor Hall and the TAs, both of whom do a very effective job of explaining the concepts.",
    "This course is more skewed toward linear algebra but covers linear algebra and multi-variable calculus. The information learned in the latter half of the linear algebra section is very important and widely applicable in the rest of the course, so the two subjects integrate well together. I would recommend this course to somebody interested in furthering their learning of mathematics.",
    "Math 118 is an enjoyable and worthwhile course. It's also a lot of work. But, Professor Hall is a truly fantastic teacher. He is very, very good at what he does and it is clear he cares a lot. It was a pleasure to take his class.",
    "If you're an Econ major, you will probably benefit from this class. If you're interested in linear algebra take a course in the 200s. This class is also very conceptual, so be prepared to study the general application of principles. If you take it with John Hall, be prepared for two (yes, two) challenging problem sets a week.",
    "MATH 118 is a very good class, though challenging. Be prepared for many long problem sets. Linear algebra is really cool, conceptual math, and I loved exercising this part of my brain in a small class with a great professor. Take it if you are up for the challenge and want to learn about matrices.",
    "I withdrew from the class, so only take this class if you are very good at math or want to be an econ major.",
    "I would recommend this course since it was extremely interesting. I would warn other students about the terribly long and difficult problem sets. I think the problem with problem sets could be addressed with the suggestions above.",
    "Definitely!",
    "A lot of work, but provides good math base.",
    "If you are thinking about majoring in economics, this would be a good course to take. The course is about 2\/3 linear algebra and 1\/3 multivariable calculus. While we had 2 problem sets due every week, this helped with understanding the material and preparing for exams, although they were sometimes difficult and time consuming. Professor Hall is helpful and has a lot of office hours along with the course peer tutor, so do ask for help when needed. The true\/false section of exams can be difficult, but the practice exams are helpful for preparing for exams.",
    "If you are planning to take a math class at Yale, but do not want to get too deep into the material, this is your choice to go. MATH 118 is an incredible introduction to linear algebra and multivariable calculus with a great teacher. You are guaranteed to understand the material if you do the psets. Just take this class. You will not regret it.",
    "Math 118 is a combination of LinAlg and Multivar, but most of the class was spent on the Linear Algebra(basically all the way up to the second midterm). We moved very very quickly, and combined with two p-sets a week, the class ended up being much harder than anticipated. Overall, I'm still glad I took this class, as I was ready to move beyond single-variable calc, but not yet into the 120 course, even if this class was difficult.(A TA remarked that this class surprisingly seemed harder than the regular LinAlg class??) Professor Hall understood that this class was difficult for some students, and was really great about being available through office hours, one-on-one tutoring sessions, and frequent emails. He was always very patient and eager to answer questions. That being said, Professor Hall might be leaving next year, so the class may or may not be different.",
    "Professor Hall cares very much for his students and it is very apparent. He takes time out of his week to hold multiple office hours and stays after class whenever he can to ask questions. His dedication to the class was the primary reason why I remained excited about the material. In terms of the work and class structure, my critique is much like everyone else: there's too much work. Usually, the problem sets would include one or two questions that required a kind of \"plug and chug.\" That kind of busy work seemed unnecessary, especially when we were already spending 8-12 hours on the problem sets (which focus on creative problem solving). The tests are challenging and require a good deal of problem solving--so it will definitely test your knowledge. Overall, a good class. I thought this would be my last math class, but I've since changed my mind (and this class was so rigorous that I could probably enroll in another)",
    "Super, super work intensive. But I definitely think it was worth it.",
    "This course is an insane amount of self-preparation. It is a good mix between Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus and has the potential to be a great course but was terribly executed. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. It is too much work and not enough teaching. Terribly hard exams and 2 problem sets per week."
