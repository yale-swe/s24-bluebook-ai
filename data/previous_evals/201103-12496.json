   "comments": [
    "I have always said that the benefit of any course at Yale is defined by what the individual student puts into it. And although the idea of a class about clubbing and dance music and nightlife has been ridiculed in the media and to a lesser extend, among our peers at Yale, I got a lot out of this class. This seminar tackled issues that are so prominent in the lives of college students and young adults but that are rarely addressed in any organized or semi-serious fashion. I learned to have perspective about going out, that nightlife is a business just like anything else, and that the \"night\" represents to a certain extent an inversion of the rules and demands of the day and therefore is highly deserving of study. Sure, you could probably take this class and do nothing, but you could for pretty much any class at Yale. If you did the work, you got something out of it.",
    "I would take this class in a heartbeat. It's unique, fun to learn about and includes a lot of American history that is not often discussed - Harlem rent parties, Cabaret Laws in NYC, F.Scott Fitzgeralds role in changing Victorian culture.",
    "Hands down the best class at Yale, ever.",
    "This was an awesome class. People always harp on expanding your knowledge and perspectives while in college, and this class achieves both of these. This was a class that I looked forward to going to every seminar. There is a lot of assigned reading, but seminar does not revolve around the reading which gives it a better environment and maintains a conversational flow. Overall, great class.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. The final paper is 15 pages but .you get tm talk about whatever you want as long as it involves nightlife in some way so you should have a fun topic.",
    "Take this class. The workload is moderate, with about 100 pages of interesting reading and a 1 page reading response every week, but itwas by far the most fun I've had doing reading for class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the history and development of American Nightlife. The class is a simultaneous historical and ethnographic walk of the development of New York City (but really American) nightlight, consistently of a variety of different phases (including disco, prohibition, and the \"era of the DJ\"), all of which are presented and discussed at a high academic and interesting level."
