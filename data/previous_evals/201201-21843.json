    "This is a very interesting class that offers a great deal of current and relevant knowledge about evolutionary biology and genetics. I was especially interested in learning about the molecular basis of evolution, and this class provides great insights into this realm. However, as a science writing class, this class is definitely a lot of work. Midterms + essays + final paper = a lot of work.",
    "Absolutely take it! The lecture material is fascinating, but Professor Ochman is what really makes the course worth it. He is fun and friendly, and his motto is \"Don't stress\" -- rare for a science professor! However, the workload is no joke; we had a 2-3 page essay due every week, plus textbook reading, exams, and a final 15-20 page term paper. So take it seriously! Also, Professor Ochman may tell you that his exams are \"easy,\" but trust me, they are not; maybe they seem easy to him, but for the average Yale student they require serious studying. But if you learn the material from lectures you should be fine. I have no regrets about taking it!",
    "Mixed - the content is fascinating, but it's a lot of work and the tests were hard. As a non-science major, I also found it harder because I hadn't been acquainted with scientific jargon, etc since high school. It takes getting used to. If you're looking just to fulfill a Sc credit no-brainer, then this might be too hard. But if you're up for a challenge and are interested in the material, go for it.",
    "E&EB 150 is a class that I would not recommend as it stands. It seems like it was a lot more work than other courses for which one would obtain a WR credit, what with the weekly 2-3 page papers based on uninteresting prompts in addition to the 15-20 page term paper, which should have been the sole focus of the entire semester. In addition, we are expected to keep up with the assigned readings, including the ridiculously out-of-date Jared Diamond book on the Third Chimpanzee, which we barely discussed. In addition, Professor Ochman's nonchalant teaching style may not be for everyone.",
    "I would recommend this class to any science students looking for a writing credit. The material was interesting, and while there was a lot of work, this was only the first year so it was more of a test run. The paper focuses on a scientific topic of your choosing, and so is as interesting as you choose to make it."
