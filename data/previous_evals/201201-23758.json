   "comments": [
    "Anyone who is a heritage speaker should take this course. It's a great way to practice listening and speaking skills while improving grammatical skills. It is also a great way to learn about the different cultures in Latin America, something many hispanics in the US do not know much about.",
    "A great class with a great professor. Definitely recommend it!",
    "It's a language course for those who have grown up with certain rules of grammar and culture but do not have an understanding of those rules. It's a great course and Profesora Alexandrov is excellent.",
    "Yes. You get a basic grammar review plus a strong vocabulary word bank to advance your own proficiency skills. Also, the professor's revisions of your essays are thorough and helpful, which leads to improvement in one's own writing as well. Above all, you get exposure to beautiful poetry from Pablo Neruda and to Mexico\/Chile political history.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 142 for anyone familiar with Spanish, but in desperate need of grammar and structure. You will be given everything you need to do well, but you will have to put in the time studying.",
    "It's a course focusing on grammar for students who are native speakers. You study grammar (mostly forms of the subjunctive), and then you read two short novels. I would EXTREMELY recommend any native speaker to take this class. Not only have I learned, but I have a greater appreciation for the language!"
