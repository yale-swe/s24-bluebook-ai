    "A wonderful experience- recommended in the highest possible terms to all. Take this class- you will not regret it!!!",
    "This is an excellent course and I highly recommend this class to both English major and non-English major students.I was introduced to a myriad and array of African American authors and artists. Our trips to the rare book collection both at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library and the Haas Family Arts Library, to view the original works of many artists discussed in class, in tandem with professor Stepto's commentary was especially illuminating.",
    "I loved the class because the subject matter is so specific and fascinating. I learned so much, and we had amazing field trips around Yale. Professor Stepto is amazing as well.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in American Literature or Art History. I came to the class with very little experience in the particular subject matter, but I have left with a new perspective. An engaging and unusual course. Definitely take it."
