    "In this class, you will gain a deep understanding of how to access and use archival materials at the Beinecke. You will also get to read a great selection of literature. The exhibition assignment will teach you how to be concise and present the most salient information.",
    "I learned how to do in depth research in the Beinecke and became really comfortable with this task",
    "Amazing background in archival research. How to access the Beinecke archives, how to incorporate materials into scholarship, and how to supplement with different research databases. The course also introduced me to the work of great African-American writers -- not just their texts, but the often-unseen production\/reception of those texts as well as the trajectories and connections within their own lives."

   "comments": [
    "Good!",
    "I thought the assignments for this course were great and would not suggest any changes there. I liked the reading list a lot; if I had to change one I think it would be the introduction to Dispossessed Lives (a little too academic\/theory-heavy for my taste) or Dust Tracks on a Road. I also sometimes had a hard time coming up with something to say for the reading responses. It might be helpful to provide some prompt questions for the reading responses that students can optionally respond to.",
    "I wish we spent mor time analyzing the text esp because we were reading such important works. This would also help with making insightful comments about its relation to the archives. Looking at the archive while reading pertinent text was such a cool and valuable experience.",
    "LOVED this course. Our discussions were best when we were looking at the archival materials themselves, not talking about the texts as entities separate from the archive (as typical English seminars do). I would suggest focusing more heavily on the boxes during class, as opposed to using them as supplements for the class discussion in the last half hour."

    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Melissa (Prof. Barton) is extremely knowledgeable and kind and is a great class leader. It shows how much effort she puts into preparing every session and as a result the seminar never drags. The reading list is great and the projects are fun.",
    "Yes I loved looking at archives and feel like I walked away with so much cool knowledge\/facts",
    "100%!!!! What an incredible chance to use one of Yale's finest resources in such an intimate setting. I really looked forward to seminar each week, and have gained so much comfort with archival research."
