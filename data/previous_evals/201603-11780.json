   "comments": [
    "This class taught me so much about the complexities of sex, consent, societal structures etc. I am honestly still working through the questions posed in the class and understanding the ways these questions manifest themselves in everyday life. It truly changed my outlook on the world.",
    "This class gave me what I should have gotten in elementary school, what I never should have to have gotten because it just shouldn't even exist. I learned about myself and how I am who I am and why the world is how it is and thats all abstract but I swear to you its real, itsjust so real and so big that I can't do it just in a Yale Online Course Evaluation. Seriously, if you're thinking about not taking this class then you are doomed without even knowing it...",
    "I learned oh so much in this class! Totally changed my perspective on consent and how we perceive of things as wrong or right based on our own morality, and not the actual harm caused to others.",
    "This class really improved my knowledge of feminist theory in general, particularly theory relating to consent. It was an excellent class, and the class discussion greatly improved my experience.",
    "This class is mind-blowing - engaging with complicated theoretical texts and wonky movies that introduce ideas I've never knew existed this class should be required for every Yale student",
    "This class is my introduction to WGSS and feminist theories, and definitely the best I could hope for. I learned so much about sexual consent, its strengths and limitations. This class culminates in a discussion about Yale's sexual assault policies and Title IX in higher education, which are very relevant and timely. We also read U.S. legal cases, which trained my critical thinking and analytical skills.",
    "I really learned to think in a whole new way about consent and harm. I'm someone who has participated quite a lot in activism related to sexual violence, and while I'm proud of how I'd abandoned patriarchal scripts about sexual violence I feel like contemporary activism has its own \"scripts.\" This class exploded the canonical contemporary archetypes of sexual violence into a million pieces. I feel like I became a better writer, a better activist, and a more discerning and critical feminist. I also feel like this is the first class at Yale in which I've felt empowered to reach out to the professor. I take almost exclusively seminars, but this is the only course thus far in which I would actually want to go to office hours, etc. Last thing -- I really feel like this course improved my writing, a lot. Oftentimes non-writing classes don't challenge students to write with clarity. This class did, very much so.",
    "I learned a process by which to think critically about why I hold certain principles and how to try to defend those principles according to a logic. This was an extremely valuable course. Also we considered how to adjudicate (sometimes bizarre) questions of sexual consent with regards to the law that I had never thought about before, which helped me consider the relationship between law and societal norms."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are everything, and I want it to be broadcasted to the world, so I guess it can be improved with a Netflix or nation public media deal?",
    "This class was superbly well taught. The readings were manageable and we discussed all of them, in depth, in class. Each day, Professor Fischel had a comprehensive lesson plan which made every class run smoothly with room for group discussion.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN IN 5 SEMESTERS AT YALE! If you get the chance to take this class, take it, no questions asked. Joe Fischel is a superstar who really cares about his students - he brought us Katalina's cupcakes every week, gave us amazing feedback on our writing and in-class performance, and went out for Happy Hour with us during reading week! Our whole class became obsessed with him and agreed he is the best professor we have ever had. He is great at steering and adding to the discussion without dominating it. The syllabus of this class is incredible, covering many of the most important feminist theorists as well as articles, videos and more niche academic writing.",
    "Fischel is the best teacher of all time, and the course is designed perfectly love the twice weekly seminar structure, wish we had more time together great mix of academic texts, books, and movies",
    "I really liked the course syllabus: it started with general discussions about consent and intersectionality, zoomed into sexual consent in various contexts, and culminated in Title IX and higher ed institutions. I also loved our class atmosphere and of course, Professor Fischel! He gave a mini lecture at the beginning of each class (a summary of arguments raised from the previous class) and sent out discussion questions beforehand, which I found particularly useful. The assignments are also well designed. You write 2 response papers, take one mid-term, and complete two final essays.",
    "The strengths of this class definitely lie in Professor Fischel's dedication to the topic, and the interest expressed by the students. There was never a dull conversations, nor were students ever reluctant to contribute. The readings are generally thought-provoking and varied, and indicate consideration on Professor Fischel's part. At times, the discussion did become a reductio ad absurd, and we considered things on a very theoretical and unlikely plane. Still, it was an interesting thought exercise. We bounced between legal and social spheres somewhat randomly, as well. There is quite a bit of legal theory\/court cases in the class. For the most part, this was engaging, although sometimes the legal language required so much explanation by Professor Fischel, we had little time to discuss legal context and analyze the arguments.",
    "Strengths: everything, but in particular: the final papers, the response papers (normally those can feel low-stakes but Joe really presented them as a unique challenge of making an argument succinctly rather than just a mini-paper), the integration of personal essays\/memoirs as cultural objects to analyze rather than just ~experiences~, the balance of larger conversations about What Is Harm with the legal cases. Weaknesses: why did it have to end so soon? The court cases were some of my absolutely favorite parts of the class -- maybe more of those?",
    "This class is 99% strengths. The format is perfect: just the right amount of readings so that you actually do all of them, class discussion was open\/democratic in feel but still remained focused on the topic at hand. Readings were extremely engaging (after all, you're talking about sex). The class had an incredible community feel, and Prof Fischel is the best."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in thinking about difficult philosophical questions regarding sex and consent, then definitely take this course. If you're interested in learning about the history and evolution of rape law, then take this course. Honestly, just take this course. Everyone could benefit.",
    "I would recommend no course at Yale more highly. This class is superb, and Professor Fischel is the MOST fantastic professor.",
    "Are you kidding me? This has to be a joke question. Did YOU take this course? If you did then you wouldn't even be asking because THIS CLASS IS LIFE. I'm not even kidding. As a woman, this class is life. As anyone, this class is life. If you think that you can live your life without taking this class, then honestly shame on you. Honestly you are hurting yourself so bad, no matter who you are, no matter your race\/class\/gender. You. Everyone. Needs. To. Take. This. Class.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Please, take this class. You will learn so much, Professor Fischel is THE BEST, and there may be snacks involved!",
    "I cannot recommend this class enough. It has been my favourite class at Yale. Professor Fischel (\"Joe\") is SO kind and really cares about his students, as well as being an incredible genius professor. Just take this class, regardless of your personal identity. I have learned so much, this is truly a life-changing class, and all of us got very close - we had class breakfasts, a groupchat, a Facebook page, we went to one another's performances and activist events etc. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SUPERLATIVES IN THE WORLD TO CONVEY HOW AMAZING THIS CLASS IS, JUST TAKE IT.",
    "YES!",
    "EVERYONE MUST TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Fischel is OUTSTANDING, caring, brilliant, and creates the best class atmosphere I've ever had at Yale. The class material will expand your thinking in ways you didn't think possible and change how you look at the world. I wish I could've taken this class forever.",
    "Yes! for anyone who has the slightest interest in the topic of sexual consent.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any upperclassmen at Yale, even if this is their first WGSS class. If students are interested either in American legal history of and attitude towards consent law, or want to better Yale' sexual climate, this class will certainly be engaging and incredibly enjoyable at times.",
    "What can I say about TPSC? I'm sure many other folks have also stated that this is without a doubt the best class they have taken at Yale and I will reiterate that: TAKE IT. Rigorous, rewarding, provocative, engaging. The best part of my week. I felt like there was a wonderful balance of theoretical vs. personal vs. journalistic course materials, an amazing progression of the material, and many opportunities to demonstrate your knowledge. It's not easy but it's so, so worth it. Also, I felt like everyone genuinely had their ideas challenged and complicated. Also Joe is the absolute greatest -- like most of his classes, this is very theory-heavy and very much oriented towards investigating what consent actually is rather than developing strategies to End Sexual Violence On Campus like some might expect. I'll say it again: TAKE IT!",
    "YES. YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CLASS. TAKE IT. Some people might look at this class and think that it's only for campus activists or those super into feminist theory. And while this class DOES have its appeal for both of those populations, I can guarantee you that it will also be extremely engaging for so many other people. This is the kind of class that causes you to go home and talk to all your friends about what you just talked about in class. You will not regret taking it."
