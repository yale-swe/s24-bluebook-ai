    "Yes, Professor Hunter is awesome and the class is really great! It touches on really important urban problems that everyone should know about!",
    "Yes! It's an interesting class that teaches you about issues that affect the inner-city. Take it if you're interested in cities, poverty, city culture, or African-American culture.",
    "This class is a must take. The course surveys Urban America and the professor is amazing! The fact that there are no reading responses helps with getting the assigned reading completed.",
    "A fantastic course to get a solid grasp on urban issues, especially relating to low-income communities. Prof Hunter is friendly, approachable, and a great seminar professor. Worth considering whether or not you've taken sociology classes in the past.",
    "if you're interested in the syllabus, yes. good discussion, but the topics really do center on minorities (blacks and hispanics) in urban neighborhoods. also gay minorities. all great by me, but any prospective shoppers should be aware."
