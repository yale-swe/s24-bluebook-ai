   "comments": [
    "I learned about an interesting genre of ancient literature that is often neglected by later generations, in addition to its influence on the genre of the novel. As a Classics major more used to philology, this class felt a lot more like a literature class, and we read a lot of literary theory pertaining to the novel. I found some of it useful, though I'm still not convinced that most of it as a field isn't BS \/ mental gymnastics by the analyst that speaks more to their creativity than anything in the text. I'm maybe a little less cynical now, but only slightly. The short writing assignments with very circumscribed goals were helpful though in tackling specific issues in analysis and engaging with scholarship.",
    "I learned (obviously) about the fascinating genre of the ancient novel, but I also, somewhat unexpectedly, developed a rather eclectic understanding of approaches to literary theory.",
    "This course taught me how to critically read and interpret both the primary source texts (the Greek and Roman novels) and the scholarship surrounding them. Each week was assigned to a different subject and lens through which we focalized certain themes and techniques in the novels, and I became acquainted with many different theories of narrative and literature whose application far exceeded just the novels we read in class. This class also focused particularly on analyzing method and argumentation, allowing us to evaluate the scholarship we read and then more rigorously offer our own ideas about the novels in our papers.",
    "This course was unique in its pairing of literary theory (Bakhtin, Foucault, Zunshine) with the reading of ancient novels. Through extensive seminar discussions, the tools provided by these theorists were analyzed for their usefulness in the ancient context. The novels were compared to each other in order to understand what an ancient novel is, what are the cohesive characteristics of the genre."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the class did a good job of appealing to hardcore classicists and people interested in the literature and time period. Working with the texts in translation made them accessible, but a curious student can always \"look under the hood\" at the original. On the flip side, students with more background in literary analysis could bring that side to the discussions. It did feel like we often talked a lot more about the theory than the texts though, and frankly I find the texts a lot more interesting than the theory.",
    "The course was very engaging and a lot of fun, and the reading material largely fit that description as well. Sometimes it was a bit difficult to see the connections between the theoretical readings and the readings of the novels themselves, though, so if\/when the course it taught again it might be worth making those connections clearer.",
    "This class was very rigorous and well-taught--I was introduced to a lot of fascinating scholarship and discussions were always thought-provoking (it could definitely go on past the two hours allotted for every class). I definitely walked away from this class with a good consciousness of how to read both literature and scholarship. The time restraints made it difficult to balance discussion of scholarship and literature, and often the secondary literature went undiscussed. The portfolio was an excellent way of keeping up with the reading and thinking more thoroughly about the scholarship--I felt like it was a unique feature of this class that allowed me to assimilate the material better than I have in other classes.",
    "The course relies very heavily on critical reading and discussion. The greatest strength was the engagement in demanded, which led to meaningful conversation which allowed the novels to be seen in a new light at the end of every class. The diversity of participants in terms of age and major was also a strength, although I think at times there was a barrier in terms of how the course was approached by Classics vs non-Classics majors."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It was really interesting and I liked the literature a lot. I would warn Classicists who don't have much experience with or don't care about literary theory that we will spend a lot of time if not most of the time talking about that, but some of the insights are useful and it's worth it to access and discuss the literature.",
    "This class is absolutely wonderful! Life-changing readings, the novels are great, Professor LeVen is totally incredible.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone with any sort of interest or engagement in literature I guarantee you'll learn a lot.",
    "Did some incredible things with some difficult and obscure texts. Pauline LeVen is the best kind of instructor -- organized, helpful, sincerely caring, and deeply knowledgeable. If offered again, would highly recommend. Under her, these bizarre old books became a point of entrance to a ton of unexpected and powerful new ways of thinking about literature.",
    "I recommend this course to a Yale student looking for a serious and intellectually demanding course which will change the way you perceive literature in antiquity."
