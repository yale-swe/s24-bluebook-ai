   "comments": [
    "I would summarize Physics 624 as a course containing \"good-to-know\" information for anyone seeking to complete a physics background. However, if a fellow student were to pursue research topics very closely related to the material in the course, I would suggest that the student do more rigorous independent reading alongside the course. Prof. Iachello provides external references to key papers, alternative textbooks, etc. which would be important for someone who might need group theoretical methods in research. Using external references was optional for students in the course, but would be essential for someone who needs the material as a research tool.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 624 to another student. Group theory is one of the most useful mathematical tools in Physics. The course material is very interesting and the workload is manageable. This was an extremely useful course.",
    "This class will teach you the math which underlies some of the important formalisms an approximations of modern physics; it would definitely be worth taking for theorists,, although experimentalists may want to think before taking it, since it goes into the theory behind applications but less into the applications specifically."

    "I think there were many topics that I would like to explore further, but in the very least, I think that I would find the material useful for when I might teach quantum mechanics later on in my career."
