    "presenting a clear and complete argument in my papers",
    "I became a much better thinker in this course. I also refined my skills at writing philosophy papers. I had never taken a philosophy class before coming to Yale and after a year of DS, I feel like I have a solid grasp on how to write an effective philosophy paper.",
    "I learned a lot about many of the modern philosophers that have made a large impact on the course of philosophical thinking.",
    "I learned to write clear philosophy papers that reconstructed arguments and considered objections in depth. I learned to discuss philosophical texts and to find objections of my own to the arguments presented by the philosophers. I also gained a general sense of the major Western philosophical thinkers with an emphasis on their writing rather than secondary sources.",
    "Lots about how to analyze arguments and counter them.",
    "I became very familiar with some of the greatest minds of modern philosophy.",
    "This course helped me develop an understanding of the relation and interaction between some major works of philosophy of the Western canon. I learned to evaluate the arguments of different philosophers that we studied and improved my writing skills as well.",
    "I learned to think like a philosopher to evaluate any argument in different dimensions.",
    "I learned to question, to cast doubt on each philospher's theory.",
    "How to think critically and not be afraid of very seemingly incomprehensible texts; to question every thing we learn and to be confident to speak up and write about it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "we read A LOT of books, which is good but also I think there were a few too many and by eliminating just a few we could focus more on the ones we keep and get much more out of the class and the readings",
    "DS Philosophy is great! Wouldn't change anything.",
    "The strengths of the course are that many of the philosophers are very prominently known figures, and their philosophies make sense to study. The weakness of the course is that there is too much reading per philosopher, which is at the cost of actually understanding the philosopher. With DS second semester, HP and Literature often take preference philosophy, meaning I would have to not read the philosophy work many times in order to finish the reading in the other two classes, which actually helped discussion by reading them in advance. Reading the philosophy works, because of the large reading assignments, rarely meant I understood anything. This discourages people to read the works at all.",
    "The course could have removed the thinkers that felt artificially added to increase the diversity of the thinkers we're reading. Thinkers like Douglass and Conway could have been either more fully added to the progression of the texts or if not, it would be better for them to be omitted. My section was quite uncertain, in particular, about the connection between Hegel and Douglass. The course does do a great job giving an overview of philosophical thought and I received lots of helpful feedback on my writing.",
    "All of the books were fantastic. I just don't see why we needed to read Conway and Douglass. They appeared to be artificially attached to the syllabus for political purposes. Too bad.",
    "I wish we had more time to spend on certain texts.",
    "The strength of this course is its focus on analyzing the connections between the different works we study and understanding the value of the works as they interact with one another, as well as the teaching format that combines seminar and lecture. One weakness is that the small amount of time spent on each text makes the discussion of some of its arguments limited or sometimes superficial.",
    "Philosophers are less (or more, depending on your way of thinking) connected in second semester DS philosophy. And they are very hard to understand. I suggest you making sure that you understand the material before sections so that you can get the most out of the sections.",
    "Perhaps too few weeks dedicated to the much harder texts like Kant and Hegel. Otherwise the course is fantastic and very fun. Authors covered are lovely, if difficult. Lecturers were all engaging and brilliant."

   "comments": [
    "I ended up being more confused by doing the readings and found that class discussions focused too much on terminology and the same few arguments over and over again with slight variations among the philosophers so it was tedious.",
    "Yes! DS is awesome. If you are interested in the humanities and\/or want a foundational liberal arts education, DS is for you.",
    "I found this course to be the least interesting of the three DS classes this semester. In fact, I would say that second semester Philosophy might be the least engaging of all six DS courses. The material just felt a little flat at times, which could have been a combination of my personal experience, my class, and my professor and may not be an accurate representation of the course as a whole. It was still enjoyable, regardless of these flaws.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in the texts covered by the syllabus or to improving their ability to think\/write philosophically.",
    "Yes, this stuff is important to know so learn it. Can be life changing.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in gaining a foundation in major works of the Western canon and learning to write and argue coherently, but also did not mind sacrificing an in-depth reading of the works for an overall grasp of trends in Western philosophy.",
    "Yes! You'll learn a lot and be under the guidance of some of the best minds in the business."
