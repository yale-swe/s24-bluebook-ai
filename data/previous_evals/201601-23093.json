   "comments": [
    "This course covers Heidegger's thought from the 1920s to 1950s, including the \"middle period,\" often neglected in Heidegger scholarship, when Heidegger was a member of the German Nazi Party. Reading Heidegger is a challenging, frustrating, and rewarding experience - it may not provide a lot of answers to philosophical questions, but it will unsettle a lot of preconceptions and contribute a peculiar kind of mental discipline which can be rare to find. This particular course brought Heidegger's texts to the forefront and let them speak for themselves.",
    "An excellent course -- niche, but exciting and engaging.",
    "Heidegger is a philosopher where spending a semester on reading him is really worth while. Definitely having some background in philosophy would be preferred because he is not an easy thinker. However, he is fascinating and Khawaja does a great job making him a bit more digestible.",
    "seminar course on the works of Heidegger in chronological order from Being and Time to Building Dwelling Thinking with a short detour into secondary literature on his involvement in the national socialist party. terrific if you really want to get to know heidegger and change your mind.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Although the material is extremely specific and challenging the course is especially valuable because the instructor creates a great environment for learning and interaction. Probably the best aspect of the course was that the professor was very willing to include broader discussions on papers that pertained to individual student research and even to personalize some of the assignments."
