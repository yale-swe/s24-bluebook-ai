    "A seminar course where the students prepare presentations on papers of various cell biology topics. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend taking this course to a student getting familiar with cell biology. It surveys the field and many key faculty at Yale quite nicely. It is also a good intro to critical reading of papers. The workload is pretty heavy relative to other seminar courses, but this probably improves the overall quality of the discussion.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It is an interesting way to learn about topics in cell biology for people not in cell biology.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It's a good course that benefits its students' presenting and critical reading skills.",
    "I would highly recommend Cell Biology 606 01 to other students."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not going into a cell biology lab, but I still thought the papers, for the most part, were interesting and taught me a lot about cell biology.",
    "This course improved my overall knowledge of cell biology and cell biology techniques. It also strengthened by knowledge of microscopy and structural biology substantially.",
    "This course addressed a variety of topics important to cell biology, which helps broaden the horizons from dissertation-directed research.",
    "Thanks to this course I have a better understanding on live imaging and intend to use it for my research."
