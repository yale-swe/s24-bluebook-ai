    "PHYS 206L gave me the opportunity to get more familiarity with concepts that my theoretical physics lectures did not cover too well. It also taught me how to write better lab reports and to do nice data analysis.",
    "I gained relevant experience in the composition and building of circuits, and understanding of topics such as how to calculate electron charge to mass ratio, nuclear scattering, and polarization of light. The laboratory sessions and the write ups that followed provided a comprehensive learning experience.",
    "I learned a lot about the experimental techniques that were used to demonstrate what we now know as some of the most fundamental laws of physics. I also developed my technical writing and communication skills through writing lab reports.",
    "You'll just do a bunch of labs and write a bunch of lab reports. The specifics of what you learn will depend on the labs you choose.",
    "I learned a lot from each of the individual experiments as well as in general how to write a better lab report.",
    "One of the most significant things I learned from this class was how to write in a style more reminiscent of a scientific report than some other type of academic paper. Relying on the notes taken during the lab helped me to improve my ability to include important information and omit extra notes that would have been included in my lab notes for 205. Somewhat indirectly, I learned to use LaTeX, which while a bit of a nightmare to learn initially, was ultimately a good skill to have the hang of by the end of the semester.",
    "We learned techniques regarding research and scientific writing. We were also given the opportunity to work with x-rays, superconductors and even the particle accelerator.",
    "I learned about and did experiments on superconductivity, Plank's constant, the electron charge\/mass ratio, Rutherford scattering, nuclear reactions, acoustic cavities, resonance, Fourier analysis, digital logic, and coupled oscillators. I had a lot of practice doing basic data analysis, error propagation, and experimental write ups.",
    "This course taught me how to use equipment like an x-ray machine, the van de graaf accelerator, a breadbox for circuits, among others. It also reinforced many physic phenomena that I learned in class, or had heard about but had not had formal education on. I also got practice on writing lab reports. I think the most important skill I learned in this class was to really try to make sense of the material myself, and kind of figure out where the gaps in my understanding were."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the labs are really amazing. Measuring the e\/m ratio of the electron is a fun and compact experiment that taught me a lot about theoretical physics and experimental physics. The labs that I found most engaging and useful were labs such as this one: labs that had one compact goal. The nuclear scattering lab was interesting but a bit confusing on the theoretical level and a bit repetitive on the experimental level. A major negative point about this course is that writing the reports take a lot of time even though the course is only .5 credits. I also found that some lab manuals did not give enough background information and seemed to just want to rush to the experiments (e.g. transistors). The most common EM courses do not treat circuits that much and it is probably not a good idea to assume a lot of background information",
    "The independent nature of the laboratory experiments pushes students to solve problems. However, the TA was there in case students needed assistance. This proved to be an effective combination for engaged learning.",
    "Though the experiments in Physics 206l are more interesting than those in 205l, the workload exceeds that of many full-credit courses that I have taken at Yale. My lab reports averaged 18 pages (including figures) each week, which, when figures are subtracted, is nearly on par with the amount of writing required by some WR courses in the English department. Therefore, it is my opinion that students taking 206l should earn a full course credit.",
    "I really enjoyed the enormous amount of freedom and flexibility we were afforded, from choosing which labs that interested us to choosing the lab days that worked best for us. The lab handouts were mostly very straightforward and easy to follow, and the expectations for our lab reports were clearly outlined.",
    "This is definitely a lot better that PHYS 205L. However, it's a lot of work and is relatively hands off. I don't know that there's really any problem with the course as long as you know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "The strength of this course is the wide variety and complexity of experiments. Where else can you casually use a particle accelerator?! The weakness was the length of the lab reports. I spent as much time on this class as full credit classes even though it only counts for half.",
    "The work it requires is far superior than 0.5 credits. It's super frustrating to put in so much effort and to be rewarded with so little credit. The weekly lab reports are very long and time-consuming. However, the structure of the class (how we can pick from a set of experiments) is super cool. Also really cool to be able to use the particle accelerator.",
    "The biggest strengths of this course were the variety of lab investigations available, which catered to a spectrum of interests within the physical sciences. A lot of the investigations were really interesting and it was fascinating to see more involved applications of some concepts discussed in physics classes. In addition, the professors for the class were also fairly accessible, which was greatly helpful. Plus the accelerator lab was pretty cool. In terms of weaknesses, the lab write-ups were extremely involved, and required a considerable amount of time (and planning ahead) to complete without having to lose too much sleep. In addition, the experimental guidelines could use an update, since on several occasions we were directed to find materials in some room in Gibbs lab, which (rather inconveniently) was in the process of no longer existing. Also, the course should be 1.0 credits instead of 0.5-- that was definitely a full credit's worth of work.",
    "This class is very difficult. The labs are very cool to work on, but it's a lot of work. I think it's probably a worthwhile trade off and I would do it again. I feel like it has to be a lot of work, though, or else we wouldn't get the full of grasp of the labs.",
    "The flexibility in choosing labs and rather independent nature of the labs was great to facilitate learning. A few areas of improvement: the grading of the lab reports often seemed rather arbitrary, even considering the guidelines provided at the start of class; large parts of the lab report did not seem to facilitate very much learning (for example, retyping the theory portions) -- a Physics 205 summary structure might be better? Also, many of the handouts seemed not to be fully updated or clear.",
    "As it is now 206 lab is unmanageable. Over the course of the semester it is 50-80 pages of analysis and write ups. This is about as much writing as Directed Studies which is worth 3 credits. The course guidelines have no bearing on the actual demands and expectations. The example lab report would receive a failing grade if a student actually handed it in. In some cases if you follow the instructions you actually do it wrong and cannot successfully complete the lab nor learn the relevant physics, and results in many hours of wasted time that is not the student's fault. Because of these bare minimum time demands of the course, I never had time to actually do background reading to fully understand what I was doing. In short, the course fails in most respects. The course needs to decide what its objective really is. I think the course should focus on exposing students to many different experiments and fostering real understanding of those same. Towards this end I recommend a much abbreviated lab report focusing on the theory (not just restating the handout in different words. This helps no one) and analysis\/results. Additionally, much better resources to actually learn the material (not arcane books from 30 years ago that no one can find and have out of date numbers anyway). Save the pedantic attention to the formal details of the lab write up for the advanced lab.",
    "If I'm being honest, I learned very little from this class. I can't see why it is mandated despite the fact that so many students in the field do real research in real labs on their own time, and even despite this, the format of the labs teaches only one thing: Scientific Writing. That said, I do think there is a way to fix this. If this course were integrated into a physics program where students were learning theory at the same time, and, instead of being walked through experiments, they had to set them up for themselves, then they would be able to learn both writing, but also how to conduct research of their own. The labs are currently designed to prioritize results over methods, and to dispense with precision in favor of doing an impossible number of often unrelated sections for one assignment. If however, there was something tying them together, it could be a useful way to teach students research methodology.",
    "The course was good in that there was a lot of guidance for us during the lab, but could be improved if the lab guides were made clearer. These are updated but often the updated guides were not posted on the website for students to access."

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend this course but it is mandatory for the major so it does not matter too much. This class will take a lot of your time (~10 single-spaced pages of lab report on a weekly basis) for only half a credit and some lab manuals are pretty confusing and assume a lot of background information (especially the circuits lab, which cover things that you will not have studied in your E&M physics lectures). On the bright side, you will get to play with a particular accelerator and some of the labs are pretty interesting (e\/m ratio of the atom, conservation of energy in 2D, etc.). The professors and TFs are very useful as well.",
    "I recommend this for anyone having already taken both introductory level courses in physics. This will help for background material.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 206L, if you're interested in learning the physics behind some really cool phenomena. This was definitely a lot more organized and a lot less frustrating than PHYS 205L, and you get to choose your lab partner (one for the entire semester) and which labs interest you the most. However, although the labs are generally shorter and there is less time pressure, the lab reports are extremely time consuming -- it should definitely be more than a half-credit lab. Although churning out lab reports every week was grueling, it also felt very satisfying to see how our data confirmed some of the most fundamental laws of physics. We got to work with some very interesting and fun tools and experimental setups, such as liquid nitrogen and even a particle accelerator. Be warned though, some of the lab reports are a lot more difficult or tedious than others. I would definitely recommend C1, H4, H3, and H1 as labs that were a fun learning experience and also had very manageable lab reports. I felt that F1, B2, and J2 were slightly more difficult. Finally, the particle accelerator lab (J3) is fascinating and certainly a unique experience, but the lab report was lengthy and quite difficult to write. I chose this lab over PHYS 166L, and while there were definitely times when I regretted not choosing the easier lab, I ultimately think you get out of it what you put in. If you think you have the time and are truly interested in exploring physics through hands-on experimentation (perhaps for the last time, if you're not a physics major), I would highly recommend this class!",
    "I wouldn't go out of my way to take this. However, if it's required for your degree it's not that much of a tragedy as long as you're ready to type long lab reports.",
    "I would definitely recommend if you've already been through 205. I thought 205 was poorly structured and the lab guides were poor, but 206 is much better. The experiments are much more interesting, and the guides were better written and more clear.",
    "Be prepared for long lab reports. The labs are interesting but they're at least 5 pages long double spaced. You are able to choose which labs to complete. Do not take the Polarization of Light lab but others like superconductivity were pretty cool.",
    "I would recommend this course on the basis of having gained a lot from completing the lab activities and (to a degree) the lab write-ups. But I definitely would caution against taking this class on top of an already significant courseload: 206 is 0.5 credit for at least 1.0 credit's worth of work (especially true if you tend to procrastinate). If you take this class, definitely consider doing the accelerator lab (especially if you are a physics major), if only to be immortalized in the binder of polaroids they keep in the control room. Finally, LaTeX might not be a bad idea to have under your belt, though it is by no means required if you choose not to use it for your lab write-ups.",
    "This class is pretty interesting during lab, but pretty terrible whilst writing the weekly report. I spent much more time per week than for 205. For me the uniqueness of the labs made it worth it, but it's certainly going to be a major time commitment for your week, especially for a half credit.",
    "Good physics lab course overall -- some of the labs definitely were both cool and rewarding. Though grading could vary by TA, generally support is provided. Labs to avoid: fourier analysis was one of the more tedious and confusing, while polarization of light was quite lengthy Good labs: superconductivity, electric field plotting, nuclear reactions (though the second part is rather lengthy)",
    "If you are taking 206 you are probably a physics major and have to. If you are taking it for fun perhaps look elsewhere. Hopefully they will change it to a full credit like it deserves so you will get more for the effort you put in. Fair warning, as it is now the accelerator lab handout is wrong. You have to take into account charge balance so when it tells you to use the mass of an alpha particle you actually need to use the mass of a Helium atom etc. Ask the instructor if this is still wrong when you do it. Do the accelerator lab anyway because its pretty cool just be prepared.",
    "If you do not have to take this course, I would recommend not doing so. While there are one or two exciting experiments, the course isn't well designed, many of the teachers don't thoroughly know all of the labs or the equipment, and many of the labs were designed for a time when students would stay late and finish them, but given as we are not allowed to do that, you either lose points or have to finish up on a second lab day.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but the experience of the course would depend on the experiments chosen. Before the first meeting of the class, I recommend going over the experiments, and if you would want to pick a partner, getting that arranged. You decide on your experiments the first day in class, and you sign up for them with a partner. You stick to both the experiments and the partner for the remainder of the semester. Of the experiments, I really enjoyed the super conductive materials lab, and the accelerator lab, because it was really awesome to use the accelerator and analyze reactions, and there was a lot of help for that one. I really disliked the fourier analysis lab and the X-ray lab, because the handouts were confusing and the data we collected we weren't really sure how to make sense of."
