   "comments": [
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a general overview of political ecology. It is comprehensive, great, and interesting.",
    "Yes definitely! It's a thought provoking class and will definitely prepare both EVST and non-EVST students with a valuable theoretical \"tool set\" to deal with the complexity of environmental problems, social justice issues, and other items that intersect with critical studies of the environment.",
    "I would recommend this class to all students. Political Ecology doesn't provide any answers about socio-environmental problems, but rather provides a set of tools with which to contextualize and historicize these problems. The types of frameworks and theories introduced in this class are relevant to any social science student.",
    "Yes for those are interested in environmental issues. A lot of the course material and discussions overlap with other EVST courses which was great, but for someone that is new to environmental studies it might be a bit overwhelming. But it is a great course with super interesting material and the discussions are fantastic."
