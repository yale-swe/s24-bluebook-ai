    "great course, i would recommend it you read the great works of the western cannon",
    "For G-d's sake don't switch sections with anyone! Professor Bloch may be the best professor you have all year (and this is someone who had several super DS instructors). And, let's be real, when else are you going to read Don Quixote, Paradise Lost, and War and Peace over the course of a few months? Talk about an overflow of knowledge. The books are really great and worth the reading, though, not simply because they're \"classics.\" And hold on through the end, because crashing before To the Lighthouse would be a shame.",
    "This course is extremely enjoyable and follows major themes that center around ideas such as love, social interaction, gender relations, and time. Literally every work in the curriculum is so interesting and touches on recurring themes in new ways and from unique perspectives. The writing styles are so different, ranging from Milton's brilliant \"epic\" poetry to Woolf's stream of consciousness. I loved everything we read.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. If you took the first semester of DS, stick with it until the end. It's well worth it.",
    "I would say that this course is a survey class of some of the most important writers from Cervantes to Tolstoy to Woolf. I would strongly recommend reading the works we have in this class and would also recommend a class with Professor Bloch. It is very fascinating to draw connections amongst the syllabus works, but if you are looking for a deep analysis of one writer or a specific genre of literature, I would not suggest Directed Studies to you.",
    "While DS Lit is a lot of work, if you decide to continue DS to second semester, try to get Bloch. His insights are fascinating, and you will always enjoy coming to class, even if it's at 9 am.",
    "DS literature was consistently my favorite of the DS sections, simply because I really love literature. DS literature in the second semester feels like a whirlwind as you pass by so many literary movements and ideas. Second semester was a very rewarding experience, and I would definitely recommend it to those who are questioning whether or not to continue with DS for the second semester.",
    "Some life-changing, essential pieces of literature that I think everyone should read. Highly, highly recommended. Lots of reading-more than first semester Lit, but worth it.",
    "Literature is fantastic, though a little less cohesive than philosophy and H & P (in my opinion). Still, you need to take this class. Bloch is pretty good. He is a very intelligent man; he just doesn't really put that much into class. That being said, what he does say is usually very insightful."
