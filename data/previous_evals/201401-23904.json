While I think we tried to do too much, I appreciate how everyone likely saw their favorite topic at some point in the class. I also liked being walked through the policy writing process. I think the expectations for each of these assignments could have been better explained but the walk through was great.I also liked working on a final project with a group. I'm all for collaborative projects since that's what we'll see in the professional world."

    "Course discussion. Get rid of the student presentations! A number of presents simply listed off the details of article without synthesis or thought.",
    "The use of the time spent in class could be improved. Students are expected to summarize papers but feel like some of the connections between papers, bigger themes, and conceptual theories could be better explained.",
    "1) WAY TOO MUCH READING MATERIAL. A number of the papers were redundant or unnecessarily vague\/dense\/unhelpful. Reading are important for this class but I would like to see readings chosen with a better eye for clarity\/conciseness\/usefulness, not simply with the aim to fill a set number of pages to read per week. Quality over quantity please!2) Need to totally redesign the class format. There are SO many ways this class could have been better conducted. The material is incredibly important, especially for those of us who have no other place at FES to learn about these topics, but I found myself totally regretting taking this class due to the format.-having each paper assigned to a student and then having each of us summarize our paper, one after the other, day after day, with little guidance\/discussion generation from Prof. Burroughs, just resulted in me leaving class each day with a vague idea of the topics we were supposed to gain. At least have one student present all papers (fewer papers per day please!) on a given topic so at least THEY can synthesize the material if Prof. Burroughs doesn't want to.-Everyone learns differently. This class only worked for those who are good at processing large amounts of dense reading. Vary the ways that material is taught and you'll engage ALL your students, notjust a few.3) Field trips and guest speakers please! We are RIGHT on the coast with many great field trips option and interesting people working on coastal issues within a close drive- let's make use of that! Class variety is important, especially for people who might learn better with hands-on\/face to face interactions, rather than straight reading all semester.4) The lack of focus on international topics meant that literally half of the people shopping the class in January walked out during the first class meeting. I recognize that there are lots of issues one could cover but Prof. B does have international experience and he should bring that to the classroom.5) Please don't make us use CATME again please =(6) Would be great to have the exam right before spring break with ALL the non-project-related topics and then focus on the final project for the rest of the semester, with no final exam. It was kind of a weird, disjointed evaluation schedule."

In the real world nobody cares and this type of evaluation should be left \"unsaid.\"",

If there is not a dramatic change from this year (Spring 2014), I probably wouldn't suggest taking the class. There's a lot of potential for this class as Prof. B really knows what he's talking about but he needs to reimagine what this class could be in the future."
