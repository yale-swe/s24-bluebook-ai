   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a GREAT senior English seminar and I barely got sick of Spenser even though the class spends practically the entire semester reading The Faerie Queene. You will need to motivate yourself in writing the last paper. Professor Nicholson doesn't offer too much guidance on this last assignment, so you will have to be proactive in meeting with her and seeking out advice.",
    "Absolutely. I had no experience with Spenser but Nicholson made the class wonderful, and made 16th century poetry feel relevant to the rest of my coursework in a way no other professor has.",
    "Take this class if you liked Spenser. Take it if you didn't like Spenser. I'm still ambivalent about him, but Professor Nicholson more than makes up for that.",
    "Take it! Nicholson is wonderful, the reading is interesting, and the workload manageable.",
    "GREAT class! Spenser is not easy, but once you get used to his writing, you really feel like you're reading a semi-foreign language...in English. (It's amazing that he did this intentionally.) Prof Nicholson is absolutely wonderful. If you're at all interested in topics like religion, colonialism, gender, morality, and more, this is the class to take. The Faerie Queene is one of the few books I have ever kept after a course, and this class has everything to do with that.",
    "Take this class! Forget your relationship to Spenser back in the days of 125. You were so much younger then; he is so different now. Catherine Nicholson is a gifted teacher, and she in herself is a great reason to take this class.",
    "Spenser is a great senior seminar--even if you don't know if you'll like Spenser, Prof. Nicholson will convince you that he's a fascinating writer both for the way his work reflects on allegory and for the way it relates to the political and social aspects of the Renaissance. Nicholson sets a good, reasonable pace with the readings and also includes several great pieces of criticism on the syllabus. Weekly reading responses help keep everyone on track and there are a few short assignments so you can get feedback on your writing before the final paper.",
    "Take it. Don't be a plebe.",
    "I did not like Spenser before this, I now love the Faerie Queene! Get started on your final paper early. I ended up doing far more poorly on mine than I would have liked to, due to 3 other final papers and 2 finals.",
    "This course is difficult and work-intensive, but a wonderful way to wet your feet producing literary criticism. Cathy Nicholson is a fantastic instructor, and class discussions always made the labor of reading Spenser (who is a fabulous but very difficult poet, at least in my experience)wonderfully worthwhile. I highly, highly recommend this course.",
    "This is an AMAZING class. I know Spenser gets a bad rep but you MUST take it if you get a chance, because it is so rare to have contact with someone who is as gifted and inspiring a reader as Professor Nicholson. She makes the poem sing - she speaks off the cuff about Spenser as if she were dictating the final draft of an amazing critical essay, and her talent, dexterity with language and incredibly sophisticated readings will change how you read everything, not just the Faerie Queene. The most perfect way to round off the English major."
