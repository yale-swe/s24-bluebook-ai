   "comments": [
    "If you have to take Stat, take this one.",
    "If you have to take statistics, take it with JRS.",
    "take the social science section -- it continues with JRS who is a great prof, and easier than other sections...take this class if needed for requirement - youu will also learn important tools",
    "It is a useful beginning stat class.I would recommend it, as statistics classes go, this one is very good.",
    "It's an easy survey of statistics. I would definitely recommend it for an easy QR.",
    "This is a low maitenance QR. It seemed that everyone was in the clas for some requirement, which is reflected by people's enthusiasm towards the material. If you haven't done any stats before and need a QR, you might do better to shop around, but this course is a okay as a stats course can be",
    "Not too much work. Be careful of the AP Stat trap. You come in with a 5 on the AP exam, think you're going to breeze through it then you end up with an A-. fml.",
    "Take Data Analysis. No Final and the chinese guy teaching it was apparently oblivious to everything and would give everyone A's.",
    "It's okay if you're not that great at the QR. Just don't fall behind! Or it will be awful! Take it with a friend.",
    "Take it for the introduction to stats if you need it. If you want to take an easy QR I'd say take Statistics in\/for the psych major second semester, it's supposedly easier. Although this class was totally reasonable in the workload. Seriously, two midterms, a final, and 8 problem sets is not that bad. JDRS also occasionally gives you a week off of problem sets which was awesome.",
    "If you need it for a requirement, you really have no choice -- but JRS makes it relatively palatable. He clearly enjoys teaching, which makes it easier to stay awake. Definitely go to lecture if you want to do well, but there's really no need to buy a textbook (I bought the Cartoon Guide to Statistics, which was mildly useful, and very cheap.EP&E majors: Take 103 (social sciences), NOT political science! Much better to have the continuity with JRS (he teaches the 103 section, which is really not that difficult), and I hear that poli sci is not fun.",
    "If you need a QR, take this class. Professor JDRS makes the material as painless as possible and with TA office hours, professor office hours, and the chunk of the grade that is homework - if you keep up with the material - you should be fine.",
    "Much of this class is relatively simple math, which allows you to focus on the underlying concepts. I enjoyed it -- people with background in statistics should expect a review of familiar material and introduction of new topics.",
    "Good, all-around intro stats course. If you're going to take this class, try and get into the Social Science section with JDRS because it is pretty good. I'm not sure you should take it unless you have to. Because the lectures are accompanied by a handout (which is necessary because there'd just be too much to write down without it), it is kind of easy to slack off and not do anything in class. But, if you can keep yourself paying attention, and JDRS will certainly try with his very engaging teaching style, this class is pretty solid if you have to take it.",
    "Very good course. Prof R-S is enthusiastic during his lectures, and he does a really good job creating his own textbook from slides. This class was not ridiculously hard, but it is definitely not easy. If you are doing it for the QR, there are easier courses. If you have taken AP Stats, the beginning of this course is probably easy but I think we went well beyond that material.",
    "Only take this class if you need the QR. The lectures will put you to sleep, the material will not stay with you, and the homework will not prepare you for the midterms or final at all. The structure of the class is based entirely around the program Minitab, which can leave you with great grades on the homework (which are almost exclusively plug-this-into-Minitab) and horrible ones on the midterms (which are mostly conceptual, an aspect of the class which gets breezed over and hardly ever talked about). Take this class if you already know something about statistics, but do not take it if you're looking to get a solid base of knowledge, as I left this course almost as empty-handed as I went in.",
    "Definitely; the professor and his lectures are so great and you actually learn even if you don't want to!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in statistics or needs to take this for a requirement. Professor JDRS is incredible, and there is no better way to learn statistics than by taking his class.",
    "Yes! Definitely. Truly useful subject matter.",
    "If you want to learn statistics, this is a great course to do it. Jonathan Reuning-Scherer challenges you but is understanding and offers TONS of opportunities to help you. It was challenging at times (not a gut), but it was still relatively painless.",
    "A good introduction to basic statistical tests. Interesting and well-worth your time but know that the class is primarily based around the program MINITAB, which can make studying for tests (where you don't use the program) very difficult.",
    "If you are willing to pay attention in lecture, and you need a QR, I guess that considering the other QRs available, this one worked out fine.",
    "Good for a QR requirement. Super useful for analyzing\/doing fieldwork.",
    "Intro stat is going to be pretty dry no matter who's teaching it, so if you're going to take it, you better make darn sure you're taking it with Jonathan. HE IS SO HILARIOUS. It's impossible to fall asleep because he's up there making corny jokes and just being an overall awesome professor. I attribute all my statistics knowledge to him and those corny jokes. If only the econ department was this engaging.",
    "Not a bad class. If you have taken AP Stat, don't listen to the recommendation at the beginning that you should take a more advanced course. You'll know the material for the first five weeks of class, and then you'll see stuff that's totally new. Weekly problem sets take a while but are easy and generously graded.",
    "The subject matter is pretty boring, but the professor tries to keep you interested. There's a problem set every week, two midterms and a final. As long as you study, you should be fine.",
    "I don't think even Will Ferrel could make this subject matter as entertaining as Prof. R-S. Which perhaps isn't too surprising because Prof. R-S looks pretty darn similar to Ferrel (twins?) -- the pronounced forehead, the kinda sunken eyes. Basically, R-S is one-man show and he soldiers on despite a student audience that seemed deathly allergic to positive energy and laughing (we were a pretty tough crowd).If you want a QR credit, this isn't a bad choice. With all the cross-listing, you can probably get credit towards your major, too. Also, the subject matter is (as much as I hate to admit it) quite applicable, at least for poli sci, which is what I'm interested in.Prof. R-S: awesome. Stats: not so much. Overall: worth it.",
    "I enjoyed this statistics course. JRS was engaging and did a good job presenting the material in an understandable way. The tests were very fair.",
    "This is a good stat course to take. The professor is clear and makes useful lecture slides.",
    "If you want to take Intro Stats, sure. But don't take this course unless you think you'll use the knowledge. I'm not sure I will right away, so I don't think I'll retain much.",
    "good",
    "This is a great course for humanities majors looking to satisfy their QR requirement. Not only is JDRS a really enthusiastic professor, but the subject matter actually proves to be really helpful in flushing out a lot of the methodology used in the social science literature that all of my other classes assign. Take it!",
    "No I wouldn't recommend this class to another student because it's not a good class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to those who have never taken stats before.",
    "Take this course if you are required to do so. It is not particularly challenging, but it moves at a decent pace and will require a weekly time commitment to deal with problem sets.",
    "If you need to take stats, this is the course to do so. First, the professor is amazing, as will become obvious if you go to even one half of a lecture during shopping period. Second, it's not hard. At all. I know stats is supposed to be QR, but there's fairly little analysis here. You just learn all the varieties of statistical tests you can perform. Third, the lectures can sometimes be fairly entertaining, so you get to enjoy the time. Overall,while this course is not mind blowing (mostly because it just gives you the tools without telling you what you can get with them), it's an easy QR credit and not unpleasant. Oh, and the problem sets take under 5 minutes.",
    "A good intro course for statistics, if you have to take this course for IS or Econ it's a good bet.",
    "I would recommend this course to every student. The skills taught in this class are necessary.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you're interested in the subject. There are easier QR's out there",
    "Definitely!",
    "It's a gut class, no doubt.",
    "It was a really good class! While Statistics can be boring, JRS did a great job making it interesting. Much better than a lot of my classes with more interesting subject material, and a great intro to statistics (which I think it is important for anyone to know).Take it, but only if it's with JRS! It's worth knowing.",
    "It seems like people often choose to take this course since they \"have to\" for some reason: to get QR or credit towards PoliSci or EPE. For me it was the latter. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much more enjoyable the course was due to the professor. While not everyone will fall in love with formulas and charts, JDRS did his best to make the subject more lively and appear more relevant to actual academic research, and he is both funny and helpful. Best piece of advice for the course: go to the weekly Q&A sessions he holds and office hours if you need anything clarified.",
    "a decent stats course where you'll have to look over all the lectures again because you don't learn that much during class. the good news is the professor hands out all the lecture notes at the beginning of class. not terribly exciting.",
    "This class was really helpful in understanding basic statistics. It did move quickly at times, but keeping up is not too bad. Attend help sessions, because they will definitely help you with problem sets. The class had 8 problem sets, two midterm exams, and a final exam. The problem sets were not too bad and the exams were mostly fair. I would recommend this section, because the professor is really interesting and we learned alot. If you need it for a requirement, want a QR credit, or just want to learn stats, I would definitely recommended this class.",
    "YES I recommend it!",
    "Not too bad. Stick with Professor Reuning-Scherer instead of the other sections.",
    "It is probably about on the level with any of the other courses that will satisfy an intro stats requirement.",
    "There really is not a differentiation between STAT 103 and basic statistics. There really were no special social science case studies. JRS is an enthusiastic teacher, but he will fly through material and you will find yourself having to reread the packets he gives you over and over again for answers to the homework. If you have taken AP Stat, take this. If you want an easy QR stat, take Stat as a Way of Knowing or Psych 200 (I should have done this). I personally struggled in this class.",
    "Stats 103 is a good way to learn about the social science applications of basic statistical methods. The class covers everything from be very basics (Means and mode etc) to more advanced topics like regressions and ANOVA. The class is fast paced but manageable and the teacher is interesting",
    "The course is very comprehensive, but it went very fast for the amount of material it had. I think by the end of the term I had a very good knowledge of different models, but I wish we had focused more on fewer of them. For example, the last two weeks of class should not have been covered, and I would have liked for us to spend more time on the rest of the material. Also, the problem sets were not comprehensive, and some of the material on the exams was tricky considering we did not cover it in class or in the problem sets. Also, don't think that this is an easy course and you will get an A. The exams are difficult, and the raw average is around an 80.",
    "Yes, if you intend to use it toward your major. It provides a basic understanding of statistics, which will definitely prove useful.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to understand regression, or can use it for Poli\/Sci or a QR credit.",
    "it's okay; only take it if you have to",
    "Typical gut class. Tailored for non-math people, no calculus, once a week problem sets, 2 midterms and a final. You will learn the basics of stats and then, if you're like me, forget them immediately. Beware, lots of probability involve.d",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you need an intro to statistics.",
    "I had never taken stats before, this was a good introduction. The workload is one problem set a week. The material is, unfortunately, boring. It took it for fun. It wasn't."
