   "comments": [
    "Standard second semester orgo. Was a fine class with Spiegel--lectures were organized and learned a good amount. Test curves were pretty generous, but class is pretty self selective so won't be exactly like Orgo 1.",
    "CHEM 221 is a pretty standard second semester organic chemistry course, albeit one that is not particularly well taught.",
    "Memorize the reactions and do a lot of problems. Yes if you need it for premed requirements.",
    "Absolutely. Organic chemistry is really interesting and has a lot of important applications. This class is very well taught, presents the material in a clear and engaging way. Professor Spiegel is doing cool research and includes examples of work he's done or other's have done that utilize the mechanisms you learn in lecture. The TA's are super helpful in section and exam review sessions. Orgo gets a bad reputation, but this has been my favorite class this semester.",
    "Continuation of chem 200 with new functional groups and more detail",
    "Avoid if at all possible. Super stressful, hard tests (averages 60), challenging content that is not at all related to biology or has biological applications. Poorly taught. If you do take and John or Julian are TAs, take it with one of them -- they made this course passable and tolerable.",
    "Orgo 2 is undoubtedly a challenging course. It requires many hours of work just to get a good basic understanding of the concepts. The problem sets weren't bad. The exams were made to be purposefully very difficult, but the curve makes their effects on grades reasonable. The curve for the overall class was really good for this semester. I don't know if it will change. Spiegel was quite a good lecturer. However, he would go off topic from the material at times. These tangents weren't necessarily bad, since he would talk about applications of the topics, but they did slow down the overall progression of the course. He is a pretty approachable guy, and open to answering questions. Overall, take this class if you have to. It will be bad at points, but you'll get through it if you put in the time.",
    "Fine class. Take it because you have to. Spiegel's a pretty good lecturer and the curve is fairly generous. The exams are tough though for sure. Psets are pretty short. Overall if you got through Orgo I you'll get through this class just fine.",
    "I'm not sure how to summarize this version of Orgo II, as it seems like orgo I and orgo II seem to differ in curriculum across individual professors. Professor Spiegel takes some time to get used to, and can certainly seem rather strange or frustrating at times, but his course definitely pushes you in ways that Orgo I did not, and you will come out feeling like you've gained something from his class.",
    "Orgo 2 is just about as pleasant as it sounds. It is difficult and requires a lot of time and effort, and sometimes this doesn't even translate through to good results. I would not be taking this class if not for pre-med requirements. There are pop quizzes given at the beginning of class, 9:25am, to check for attendance (not the most fun thing to wake up to Monday morning). Weekly psets, 3 midterms and drop the lowest, and the final.",
    "The only thing that I didn't like about this course was the difficulty of the exams. A 40% average is upsetting and does not really show how much the class understands the material.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 221 to all students interested in pre-medical studies, because it gives a good overview of the other half of standardized organic chemistry courses. In addition, it is the only organic chemistry second semester class left for premed students, since its counterpart with a greater biological focus has since been canceled.",
    "Spiegel teaches clearly (and sometimes slowly-but that's why I'm usually not confused in class), really enjoyed this class. Organic chemistry itself is extremely interesting, and with some more mastery of it in orgo 2, you can do really fun things. I think I prefer this over orgo with bio pathways because there is less memorizing. Definitely a challenging class, but also rewarding. Class notes must be supplement with the textbook--the tests are very difficult and really require mastery of the material.",
    "CHEM 221 is a very rewarding second semester organic chemistry course. If you put in the time and effort, you will get more out of it than first semester orgo. There is much less reading, but you will still have to work hard to do well, since the exams are on the difficult side. But this is probably better since your grade is determined more by what you know than by careless mistakes on easier exams. Also, the curve is quite generous to begin with. Some people may not like this class because 1) it's hard, or 2) they don't like chemistry to begin with and are just taking this course as a requirement. However, if you find the material interesting and work hard throughout the semester, you will have a very rewarding experience. Compared to the other orgo 2 course which is more focused on biological pathways, this course is focused much more on principles, which in the grand scheme of things is probably more useful. I would recommend taking this course, especially if you want to take your understanding of chemistry to a new level. This course will help you greatly improve your chemical reasoning and critical thinking skills, especially when it comes to synthetic chemistry. You will learn a lot, and as long as you put in the work, you will get a lot out of this course.",
    "This is one of the hardest courses you can take at Yale. However, if you are premed, you will ultimately be very grateful for the difficulty of this course, because it forces you to learn everything about a given chemical reaction, and the depth of these concepts make them hard to forget.",
    "You might cry. You might consider dropping the course. You might wonder why you chose to study science at Yale in the first place. After the first midterm, you might question if you're actually studying organic chemistry, or if you just started a new language course on science hill. But fear not. If you put in the time and effort that the course material demands (something like 5 to however many hours you can manage each week), you'll likely find that you like Organic Chemistry. You might even really, really like it. Professor Spiegel actually cares about you learning. If you have questions, ask them! Seriously. It will make a world of difference, and your equally confused peers will thank you. Some will be too shy to do so verbally, but when you all achieve double your first midterm score on the next exam, you'll find you're actually learning something. And gosh, with ample effort, you'll learn A LOT. Find friends in the class to study with if that's your style. Attend the review sessions. For a week or two before each exam, live organic chemistry. You'll be fine. This might be the most rewarding science course at Yale. Take it.",
    "This is a pretty standard orgo II class. be prepared to work you butt off and study hard for the tests. I would recommend it only if you have to take it or are very interested in organic chemistry. btw the course focuses mostly on carbonyl chemistry.",
    "It's difficult, but doable if you put your work in. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it",
    "This is a very informative and very challenging course; you will learn a lot of cool reactions and mechanisms, both through the book and through the class. Every class and every chapter is important, so if you take this class, do not plan to miss any class or skip readings, because there is not a lot of overlap between the two.",
    "If you like chemistry, it's a great course. If you want to get an A and learn XYZ for your MCATs, you'll probably be stressed out a bit.",
    "Horrific course. Very difficult exams that were almost impossible to study for using the books and lecture notes. Neat material I suppose, and prof. Spiegel is a nice guy but it's just a terrible class. Take it if you have to."
