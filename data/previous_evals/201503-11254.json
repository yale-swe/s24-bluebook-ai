    "There are very interesting materials in the course. The discussions are not too complicated, yet very different from what we are used to, so I found them really intriguing. But you kind of have to have a connection to Mexico\/Aztec or an interest in archaeology to be engaged in the course. If you're interested, take it! There is virtually no risks for ya.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in Latin America, Mesoamerica, Ancient civilizations, or human sacrifice. If you're Mexican or Mexican American, please take this class. I promise you won't regret it.",
    "One of the BEST classes I've taken at Yale. Class involved watching videos on Aztec traditions that are still practiced in Mexico and looking through Codices (pictorial manuscripts). The readings were very informative and sometimes felt like novels when they explained Aztec myths.",
    "This class is a nice, easy, interesting class. As long as you keep up with the readings, you will do well. It is fun to learn about another culture and Prof. Chinchilla is thorough in his lectures.",
    "I would summarize the class as an \"introduction to Aztec culture in society through archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence\" The class was wonderful, and I believe it could be of interest to anyone."
