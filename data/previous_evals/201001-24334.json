    "Only if you're in CS and really enjoy Math. Until the focus shifts back to the CS aspect of Cryptography this will remain a weak elective.",
    "Interesting material, but the presentation was a little dry. Take if you're interested in the mathematics behind cryptography or want to memorize some protocols",
    "Cool stuff I thought. Kinda hard to hang in there with Fischer, you'll see what I mean. Be prepared for lots and lots of modular arithmetic and not a lot of coding",
    "Take this coarse if you really love cryptography. As you take it, you will have to constantly remind yourself why the material is so awesome. Seriously, it's awesome, but it's hard to recognize that in the midst of Professor Fischer's mind-numbing lectures. It's worth it if you're really excited about the material, but if you aren't, you will be incredibly bored.The homework is very easy to anyone who is rather good at math. The programming is trivial, it's just a matter of being able to do the number theory."
