Additionally, we were given the option to work in groups (maximum of 3 students, couldn't work with the same students more than twice) which I absolutely loved. This cut down the number of hours per week significantly. Outside of class, I would probably spend about 4 hours independently working on homework assignments and probably 2-3 working with group members.

   "comments": [
    "I really loved this course. Having a quantitative background in engineering, this course was excellent at tying together concepts I learned in my previous course work with public health. Excellent course to do so! Strengths: definitely a very applicable public health class, complex concepts explained infectious disease transmission, this modeling course is probably the most useful course I will take away from my time at YSPH. Weaknesses: during the lectures, it was often hard to stay engaged when there were so many equations on the board. While Dr. Pitzer did explain them, the material was often a little too dense and completely Greek to me. Dr. Pitzer did a great job trying to make all this material more digestible though!",
    "I really enjoyed the problem sets and labs and found them to be very useful.",
    "The course covers a wide variety of modeling related material which is very nice. It goes more in depth on some subjects like vaccination than others. The homeworks are nice because they relate back to actual studies that were done and papers that we read for class. Sometimes I was a bit confused as to what direction the home work questions wanted me to go in, but I think that's a product of just not giving away the answer in the question itself. Overall, I think it's a great course. I would probably just prefer some examples of code in the lecture itself, instead of sequestering it all in the lab portion, that way you can tie things together more quickly. I also wish lab code, for the R section at least, was a bit more annotated for those of us using R for the first or second time in this course.",
    "This course was well taught and the labs and lectures made it easy to do pretty well on the homeworks and the final exam. I just feel like it was a lot of copying code or using premade code and less learning how to do it ourselves (which is fine if that's what you're into). This course also used Matlab (or R), but I wish we had the choice to learn how to do homework in SAS. The homeworks were challenging but also really interesting problem solving exercises. I am really happy that we got to work in groups for the homework as it helped me learn the material better (and working in teams is what public health is all about!).",
    "Wonderful course overall. Definitely learned some very cool\/valuable techniques for analyzing infectious disease data. Especially enjoyed the lectures on vaccine efficacy and time series data analysis, which I feel that I can\/will use beyond this course. Also loved the ability to learn\/use MATLAB (although I will admit that the MCMC material was difficult to work through). I would say the course material was difficult but ultimately manageable. The first lecture on probability distributions was crucial and probably should be emphasized even more. Assignments\/homeworks were fair. Professor Pitzer was a good lecturer and responsive to student questions\/concerns. Joe was also great in helping to explain questions regarding homework assignments. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in exploring some cool analytic techniques for exploring infectious disease data, although you should expect to spend a significant amount of time struggling with the material before it \"clicks.\"",
    "Very thorough introduction to research methods in infectious disease analysis - extremely informative, even for one with limited background in the field.",
    "This is a really interesting class. I think the strength is seeing the different methods available to you. One of the big weaknesses though is the methods are complicated and I'm not sure how much of it you would be able to do on your own having just a few classes related to this under your belt.",
    "I thought the class was very interesting. Definitely a",
    "It's an interesting course, but one of the most difficult I have taken. The labs helped solidify what we learned in class, but I would have benefitted from working through more examples to put it all in context. The final exam was actually quite helpful in pulling everything together, and so going through similar examples would have proved useful.",
    "I think there needs to be some kind of pre-test of the mathematical concepts that will be covered throughout the course so that students can determine for themselves whether they think they will be able to handle the material.",
    "Overall I think the class has been very thoughtfully constructed. The lecture\/lab\/problem set organization was very well done. It was great to introduce a topic in lecture and then further discuss it in lab where there are smaller groups, and then test the knowledge in problem sets. It was helpful working in groups on the problem sets so we could learn from one another. Lots of great examples of data were drawn from different studies. Often we discussed the applications of the data in making recommendations. I think we covered material at an appropriate pace, although I think we needed some reminding of the what the quantitative measures we were calculating meant, namely pertaining to MCMC and vaccine efficacy. Some students mentioned they felt unprepared for the mathematical operations we were asked to perform, like working with logs and other advanced math topics you may not have seen since high school. I felt like this was a small part of the class to quibble over, and I don't really agree we needed a math primer, but also I'm not sure why these topics were emphasized in lecture and problem sets the way they were.",
    "This course felt like a deep-dive into relatively complex (or at least unfamiliar) quantitative methods in IDE, but Ginny and Joe made \"the plunge\" manageable and digestible. At the end of the course, Dr. Pitzer went through the original summary\/outline of the course, and I felt a collective \"ah-hah!\" being let out of the room. I think it would have been helpful for the prof to have supplemented most lectures with this summary, so that students could have an active understanding of the broader flow of the class, instead of often getting lost in the minutiae of the methods. Because of my lack of prior knowledge on IDE analyses, I did often feel lost and confused by some of the mathematical (and even epidemiological) concepts and ideas. Acknowledging the breadth of the scope of the course, I'm not sure how this could have been avoided, besides having personally taken more math and epi classes prior to this course. Nonetheless, via supplementation with weekly labs and bi-weekly problem sets, I felt I ultimately gained a broader understanding of potential tools that could be applied to secondary datasets, and I came away with a number of very tangible methods to approach data. This course is a great example of something that I will come back to many times, and may very well be essential, to my future research.",
    "excellent course, learned a lot of information, went very quickly at some points"

    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0The professor is personable, incredibly knowledgable and approachable. The material is difficult and dense but Professor Pitzer made it easy to understand and applicable to our overall course of study.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Great professor, very down to Earth. She did a really great job trying to make sure these complex ideas were more easily understood by a classroom of public health students. She is very passionate about her research and these concepts, which really made the class enjoyable and engaging. During the lab section, it really felt like she was giving the students one-on-one attention.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0She was flexible and able to answer students questions. Knew her material well.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Very caring and wants the students to understand as much as possible from the course. Her slides are nice and she's interested in the material which makes her presentation of the material more enthusiastic, which I appreciate. I would only suggest that she adds a bit of code to the class lecture also, that way we can start tying the lecture and labs together more clearly and quicker.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Great professor! Very laid back and engaging in lecture and lab. I wish she would have included more notes and notations on slides, lab code, and hw answers. It would make doing the homeworks and final a lot easier. I would say that sometimes she had trouble explaining really hard or tricky concepts into something easier to understand for those of us that don't have extensive backgrounds in math and PH modeling.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0The course was great. I would prefer if the instructor could have regular office hours.",

    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is great, keeps lectures interesting and relevant, works hard to make sure her students get it.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0The instructor was very good. Classes and readings were coherent and well-organized. I think the instructor did a good job of navigating some of the more abstruse underlying mathematics and presenting them appropriately for the class.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0I think Professor Pitzer is incredibly intelligent and tries her best to convey concepts to students. However, at times, I think it is a little difficult for her to \"dumb\" down concepts for students.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Terrific professor! Really cares for the class and willing to stop and explain anything. If you tried answering a question in class and didn't give the answer she was looking for, graciously helped you out. Put a lot of effort into the class and it shows.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Dr. Pitzer was extremely knowledgable on the subject matter, but was also very considerate and respectful to students who (majority of which) did not have the same grasp of the context or math. She routinely \"checked in\" to see if we were understanding the material she was teaching, and often asked what kind of background we as a class had in certain topics, so that she could alter her course material to better cater to our prior knowledge. Ginny's lectures were also always fun and entertaining, and she often included games or interesting real-world examples (sometimes even her own research), which always kept me very engaged during class.",

    "I have nothing but good things to say about this course. The workload outside of class was a little higher than my average classes but definitely worth every minute! After taking this class, I have the ability and knowledge to be able to apply material as an epidemiologist, which says a lot about how the course was taught and the content of the lectures. For future reference though, the lab time and day should be decided and put in the syllabus\/registration before the course begins. I ended up having to shift my work schedule because the class voted to have labs on Friday. Okay, that was the only \"bad\" thing about the course.",
    "Learn how to analyze data from a variety of infectious disease study stypes and estimate transmission parameters. Learn how to analyze time series and vaccine study data. Yes, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "This course covers a range of modeling techniques from MCMC to arima and time series analysis of, typically, outbreak data. It is very math and coding oriented, so be prepared for that. All classwork ties to an actual real-life example, usually measles, ebola, rotavirus, which is great. I particularly enjoyed the portions of class that focused on vaccination and time series. I would recommend this course for anyone in EMD, even if modeling isn't your specialty, just because it covers a lot of how modern outbreak investigation works.",
    "Really interesting class, and it was kind of cool that we got to learn another coding language (Matlab). I'm not sure how much I will really use what I learned in this class in the future, but it is a fun challenge if you're up to it. Not too much work, though the problem sets do take a decent amount of time (but there's only 6 of them throughout the whole semester and you get to work on them in groups).",
    "See overall assessment.",
    "It's a good course. It's definitely a hard one and you will feel really overwhelmed at different points in the semester but you'll make it because Ginny does a really good job of prepping you in the labs and making sure you have everything that you would need to figure the problems out.",
    "Extremely interesting subject matter. Programming in R\/MatLab is a relatively important component of the class.",
    "My favorite EMD elective so far and I'm not particularly interested in modelling. Good introduction to quantitative topics for going forward. Definitely recommended!",
    "This course focused on how infectious diseases are a unique subsystem to study that require unique quantitative methods. Dr. Pitzer delved into a breadth of different quantitative methods and offered contexts as to how they all tie together. Very high level (to students without significant background) but manageable by putting in the time."
