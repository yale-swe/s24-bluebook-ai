    "It's definitely something to consider.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the foundations of the eastern Roman empire.",
    "Origins of Byzantium is a very, very detailed look at Roman history from the rise of Constantine to the beginnings of Islam. This class is more about the sources used to write history about this period rather than a linear chronology of important events and themes about late antiquity. Readings for class were extremely short, and sort of optional (though helpful for the midterm). The final paper (15-18 pages) was very manageable given that there wasn't really other work. Overall, I would say the course was best geared for a classics major planning on writing a thesis on late antiquity. That said, Matthews is an awesome guy, and if you can stomach a lot of detail on things you might not be as interested in as him, then it's worth considering.",
    "Yes. I would caution a prospective student that this class has little handed-in work and their grade will thus be based on only a few assignments, but I would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in ancient Rome, the breakup thereof, or the development of the Byzantines. Or really anyone else, because everyone should be and will be if they take this course.",
    "Professor Matthews is great professor. He prepares his lectures well and often has interesting historical insight. He is also eager to meet with students individually. The work load is not too heavy and the course is interesting if you find the subject matter interesting.",
    "I am not sure if this seminar will be offered again, but I do indeed recommend taking a class from Professor Matthews. He is a wonderful scholar and lots of fun to listen to in class. Expect seminars with him to function like lectures. I find this format ideal since Matthews is an engaging lecturer and an expert on many of the topics introduced.",
    "An interesting introduction to the history of Byzantium. Unfortunately, the class could drag a bit and could be dry, especially because Prof. Matthews treated it less as a seminar and more as a lecture. If you like the period, however, I think you should find this quite interesting anyway. Prof Matthews clearly is certainly extremely knowledgeable about the period in question and brought some very interesting sources in for our perusal. He is very willing to meet outside of class too and definitely cares about his students."
