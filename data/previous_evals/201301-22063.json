    "Professor Weiss was very responsive and extremely helpful, and willing to let me keep my own schedule while working the paper during the semester. (This could be good or bad for a student, depending on whether you need somebody setting up checkpoints for you as you go along.) She is very knowledgeable about modern China generally, and had some specific print resources that were relevant to my thesis."
