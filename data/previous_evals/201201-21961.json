    "If you write poetry there is no reason not to take this class. Professor McClatchy was a joy to learn from and I can't get over the fact that he sets aside time to help people like me with their poetry when he is so busy editing books and the Yale Review and writing poetry and opera libretti...He has a wonderful sense of humor and runs a very straightforward class. His anecdotes about \"That one time I was eating lunch with Anne Sexton...\" etc. are priceless and always either incredibly funny or incredibly enlightening.You write a poem per week, and workshop everyone's poem during class, plus discuss various poems from the week's readings. The culminating project is a long sequence of poems that you'll be proud of.",
    "A course in which you will write poetry (in different forms) every week and workshop on a daily basis. You will revise your poems and have an opportunity to read a wide variety of American poets. Take this course if you're serious about becoming a better poet!",
    "Yes! If you can get in, take this class. You learn so much about writing poetry and become a better reader of it, too.",
    "I would highly recommend the course, whether or not you have much experience writing in form",
    "no, while I enjoyed my experience I feel like a lot of time was wasted in this class.",
    "This is not an easy, fun fifth class: that said, I kind of took it on with that half in mind, and definitely had to re-evaluate my priorities throughout this semester, since I began to feel totally devoted to this class. A challenge - both in terms of workload and in terms of Professor McClatchy's critique - but hugely rewarding, and I really feel it helped me so such in both my writing and criticism of poetry. It was also such a wonderful opportunity to have the critiques of the rest of the class at hand - there is a lot of class discussion of work, and it was wonderful to hear what other people were producing, too. Would highly recommend this class!",
    "I wish I knew how helpful office hours were earlier, but this is where you receive specific, invaluable feedback about what works and what doesn't. Experience writing poetry is a good idea, otherwise everyone in the class will be out of your league. Enjoyment of reading poetry and a creative imagination is also needed for this class, but even if you're not the best poet, you go away a more creative, observant, and careful writer of poetry and prose.",
    "This creative writing course combines a weekly workshop atmosphere with a literary overview of contemporary American and International poets. The class focuses for the first part of the semester on technique, assigning different poetic forms for students to study, read, and try their hands at each week. The second half of the class is more open-ended as students pursue free verse and longer pieces and put their newly acquired skills to good use. The course significantly improves one's writing, as well as one's awareness of contemporary poetry.",
    "I'd recommend it to a poet who is willing to be challenged."
