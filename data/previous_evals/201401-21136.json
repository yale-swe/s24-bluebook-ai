   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a great class! Hands on experience and lots of practical knowledge with writing lab reports and presentations.",
    "Take it. If you're ABET you have to but if not, take it instead of the second physics lab. Jan is a great lecturer and the review process is extremely helpful, especially if you haven't written a formal lab before. Due dates are sometimes a little unclear but Jan was always accommodating. Be sure to be careful when making revisions to follow all Jan's suggestions, he does check.",
    "Great way to solidify the concepts learned in MENG 285. Would totally recommend for anyone who is interested in how materials work.",
    "Material Science lab is a mixture between lectures and four (3-hr) lab sessions. The workload for the course is basically three 15-page lab reports and one final presentation (all with a partner). Budget your time in advance for the lab reports and this course shouldn't be a problem.",
    "This is more of a writing class than it is a science course. It teaches you how to write a seemingly professional lab report and is good preparation for fluids lab (or so I hear). You do learn how to perform apply some valuable material science skills also.",
    "It\u2019s a requirement for the major and the lab reports will often feel like you\u2019re just rewriting the textbook, but enjoy your time with the TAs and other members in your lab group and you\u2019ll be fine.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone that needs to take it or students that are interested in improving their lab write up abilities or seeing cool lab applications of materials science like making nanorods and then analyzing them in an SEM.",
    "Fun, kind of weird structure-wise, but a good class, not too much work.",
    "The TA's and Professor for this class are awesome. The labs are really interesting also. The write ups are long, but not too bad with a partner. Its just tough because they all come at once.",
    "Essentially, you learn how to write a proper lab report. The labs themselves aren't too much work, but the schedule got crunched and we sometimes wrote labs one week after the next, which was very difficult. However, during the beginning of the course, we literally had no work.",
    "Take it if you're interested. Great lab. Gives you an idea about engineering research. Bridges the gap between theory and application.",
    "This is such a nonsensical class. The first half is classes where you have no psets, tests, nor attendance taken. The second half requires you to write 15 page scientific papers based on just two hours of research. And since you're constantly revising these papers, the due dates accumulate until you have multiple projects due a week. My april was absolutely destroyed by this class. Don't take it unless you have to. It's a bizarre class that's ostensibly about material science but actually meant to teach you how to write science papers. I have no clue why the department chose to organize it this way. They should call it what it is and make it a full writing credit. I wrote twice as much for this class as my writing course taken simultaneously.",
    "You're most likely taking it as an engineering requirement, so just don't let the lab reports pile up to right before they're due. Going to the lectures also pays off when trying to write the background and intro parts for your lab report.",
    "If you're looking at this class then you probably have to take it. It's actually pretty good. The first half is a summary\/overview of materials science, and specific topics related to the labs. The labs themselves are pretty fun, by far the best labs you'll have at Yale. You get to use some really cool stuff like electron microscopes and automated hardness testers, and we actually got to help the TAs test out some new equipment and procedures for their research. The class is really great, and not a huge amount of work, as there's just 3 or 4 lab reports and an oral presentation. Jan really cares about helping you learn how to write scientific papers, and is a pretty engaging professor. Even if you're not an engineer, you should consider taking this class.",
    "It's a lab about materials science. There isn't a lot of work, but there is a lot of dealing with microstructures."
