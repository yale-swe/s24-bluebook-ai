   "comments": [
    "I would summarize Materials&Methods as follows:This is a class you should take if you are unsatisfied with acrylic and interested in learning traditional painting materials and their functions. This is not a class about painting technique, but rather one that will allow you to develop your technique or mimic others' techniques using media that is not taught in a general painting class. Do not take this class if you are wanting to learn how to paint, but rather if you would like elucidation on media you willnot be taught in the context of other painting classes.I would absolutely recommend this class to another student if they were interested in the specific content.",
    "Take it! Highly recommended for art majors",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in understanding artists' materials. It is such a good class and professor aronson is great.",
    "This is a GREAT course and I highly recommend it, particularly to art history and art majors. It is unlike anything I've ever taken before -- you learn traditional painting methods like egg tempera (literally cracking an egg and mixing it with pigment, and we mixed in seashells to be extra authentic), gilding (with real gold leaf!!), oil grounds, etc. Don't let the long hours scare you - it was a really relaxing way to spend Friday afternoons, the painting sessions are really fun and you don't feel stressed about making a good painting because its all about experimenting with the materials and the methods. Mark is wonderful and its amazing how much he knows about these methods.",
    "Study of materials and methods of painting, in depth and hands on! Learning by both looking and doing! Great opportunity to paint and explore different materials! Highly recommended to people interested how paintings have been made and how they continue to be made.",
    "Really helpful and amusing.",
    "Yes, absolutely, to anyone in the Art or History of Art program."
