   "comments": [
    "I felt that this course struck a really nice balance between providing a variety of different texts in American literature but also allowing us to work with them in a way that was close and focused. Not only did we read the traditional texts in the \"American literature canon,\" but we also engaged with works such as Octavia Butler's Bloodchild and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee. I think that pushing the bounds of what \"America\" and \"American literature\" entail is so crucial now more than ever, and ENGL 127 with Professor Xiang really challenged me to think about that. In the current conversations surrounding the English department and ENGL 125\/126, I think my experience with ENGL 127 with Professor Xiang is actually the best example of what a class around a canon should look like. Moreover, though we read works by multiple authors, it didn't feel like a broad \"survey\" type course\" because we were still able to focus on and discuss very specific ideas within each of the texts. We discussed Walt Whitman alongside Langston Hughes, and didn't ignore crucial questions around race and gender when talking about each of the texts. I think a class that purports to center around a certain canon of literature, whether that be American literature or Major English Poetry, should also incorporate texts that challenge the bounds of the canon and discuss the canonical works in relation to other minority literatures - and ENGL 127 with Professor Xiang was a great example of such a class.",
    "I definitely improved my writing skills in this class. The small class size was also really helpful in fleshing out ideas and really gave me a chance to grow intellectually."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - variety of texts, reading outside readings and essays that critiqued or analyzed those texts as well Weaknesses - a large amount of reading! But I actually wouldn't necessarily say that this is a weakness - just a challenge.",
    "Good reading list, but the readings seem pretty disconnected and don't flow as nicely as they should, especially in the second half of the semester. it also feels like they tried to artificially add \"diversity\" to the course without thinking of quality or what made the course a cohesive unit.",
    "I thought this course was wonderful. I enjoyed the in class discussions, the reading assignments, the reading responses, and the alternative\/creative reading responses. The variety of methods of learning made sure to cater to a variety of students which was great."

   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this course to anyone who's interested in reading both canonical and non-canonical texts in American literature. I think that understanding and critiquing traditional notions of \"America\" and \"American literature\" are so crucial now more than ever - and taking ENGL 127 with Professor Xiang really challenged me to think about the role of literature in our current political moment. The course moves quickly, so naturally the amount of reading isn't necessarily light, but it is definitely a manageable workload and I found all the texts really interesting and important to read and think about alongside each other. Professor Xiang is also the best professor. She is really intelligent, but more than that, she facilitates discussion in a way that encourages collective thinking and very open conversation. She also gives the best feedback on papers and is really and truly invested in all of her students.",
    "This is a nice introductory course to some of the big names in American Literature and also a bunch of lesser known names from the past hundred years. It is a lot of reading, especially when you're reading Moby Dick, but it is pretty easy to keep up if you're on top of your game. The papers (3 small ones) are really manageable so this is a nice intro English course or one to top off an otherwise heavy and hectic schedule.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it has been one of my favorite seminars."
