    "I highly recommend taking Portuguese. There is a huge difference between it and Spanish, but Selma makes learning the language easy and natural. The class has a super-low workload compared to other introductory language classes: short weekly homeworks, five blog posts, five straightforward in-class tests, a five-minute presentation, a five-minute oral exam, and a final. It seems like a lot in writing, but it's really not. Meeting every day can be a pain, but Selma brightens the room when she arrives and asks, \"Tudo bem com vocs?\" If you know Spanish and want to learn Portuguese, this is class for you. If you don't know Spanish, 110 might be a better option because knowledge of a romance language is not assumed.",
    "Portuguese is cool. Brazil is cool. Learn it.",
    "Take it with Selma! Portuguese is awesome.",
    "Fun and laid-back introduction to Portuguese for speakers of Spanish (or other romance languages, but everyone in our class spoke Spanish). Would definitely recommend to another student!",
    "Port 112 is a class that you probably should have taken instead of that language class which you now hate. It is so fun."
