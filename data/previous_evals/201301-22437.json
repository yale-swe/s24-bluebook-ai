    "It's a standard intro multivariable class. I recommend Miki.",
    "I think it was a fine course. It was small so we had a very personal connection with our teacher. For me, this class was a requirement for my major, but I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would.",
    "It's mostly about how functions behave in 3D space.",
    "It is the standard multivariable class, suitable for post-IB Math SL study. The class sizes are all quite small, but the quality of the class really depends on the instructor."
