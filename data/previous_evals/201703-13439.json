    "This was a wonderful course! Dr. Irwin invited some great guest lecturers, and the guest lectures combined with the course material was a great way to receive an overview on the multifaceted disease that is obesity. It was great learning how to write a systematic review as well. I would've liked some more guidance and feedback on the different sections of the systematic review and oral presentations -- I feel like our ideas of what was expected often did not align with Dr. Irwin's expectations.",
    "wonderful class discussions on obesity while learning the important skill of systematic review writing",
    "I really enjoyed this course - definitely my favorite course of the semester! It was a great way to learn how to write a systematic review paper, and I liked how we worked section-by-section through the process. Class was engaging and I liked all of the guest speakers. My only suggestion is that I would have liked a bit more documentation (e.g. rubrics for assignments) to prevent confusion.",
    "It helped me understand the various layers and players involved in the obesity epidemic.",
    "really gave me a different perspective on obesity and how to view it from the perspective of people who are obese. Never really gave much thought to the stigma especially they go through",
    "This course was great, engaging, the lectures were relevant and interesting topics, and learning how to do a systematic review was very helpful.",
    "Strengths: engaging, interactive, small class size Weaknesses: sometimes assignments were not very clear, for instance: During presentations, we were told that each person should only speak for 3 minutes. Everyone spoke for over 5. I felt like because I spoke for only 3 that I was going to look bad and get docked. Improvement: assignments should be described more clearly",
    "really good course. would recommend. wouldn't change much",
    "Good class, but the systematic review was a bit confusing; could have used more support towards the beginning",
    "Great course. Very interesting topic. Loved the invited speakers.",
    "I loved how discussion-focused it was! It was the perfect format for the course content.",
    "The content was very informative, organized and relevant to public health issues. All the reading were also relevant and appropriate for the course.",
    "The strengths of this course was the wide and in depth knowledge of the professor teaching. She was vital to the success of the class as she provided the insight of her own work in cancer epidemiology and obesity to help us understand the diversity in academic research regarding obesity and lifestyle prevention strategies. She also provided us with guest lectures which further contributed to the class. I would only have one complaint and that would be that timeline for the meta-analysis due as a cumulative project at the end was short. Sometimes feedback and even working on it seemed rushed."

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin was so passionate about the subject and was very detail-oriented\/analytical in assessing\/presenting research.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Super passionate about her work and extensive experience in obesity-related topics.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin is awesome!! Her lectures and readings were useful to learn about the basic issues of obesity and intervention design, and her feedback was helpful in the systematic review writing process.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Strengths: Engaging, knowledgable, passionate, created an open class atmosphere where people felt comfortable raising their hands Weaknesses: expectations for assignments sometimes vague Improvement: assignments should be described more clearly Melinda is a rockstar!! Loved so much by her students, and my favorite professor at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Great professor, very knowledgable. put together a really interesting course.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Prof. Irwin is interesting and cares a lot about obesity prevention and management; she also did a really good job of providing us w feedback",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Fantastic instructor. Very sensitive to student's opinions and flexible if students needed extra time to work on assignments. Loved this professor!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Professor Irwin was an engaging and knowledgeable instructor. She made discussions interesting and fun, while ensuring that we understood the content well.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0It would have been nice if the instructor was a bit more engaging and invested in the students.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0The instructor was extremely helpful and feedback was essential to deliver a quality product at the end of the semester, the meta-analysis. However, feedback on paper was sometimes sparse and in person meetings were more productive. She was flexible and I never ran into any problems with this. As mentioned before, she really knows her topic even outside her own research, and was willing to admit when she was not an expert and provide guest lectures for topics she was unfamiliar with. Overall an excellent professor."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, especially for those interested in obesity epidemiology and lifestyle interventions. Very interesting elective.",
    "It will help you understand that the obesity epidemic is more complex than just diet and exercise, and the likely culprit is the built environment more than anything else.",
    "This course was fun and interesting, and writing the systematic review was challenging but useful (make sure you pick a topic you are interested in, and Kate at the library is very helpful for explaining how to set up search terms). I would recommend this course to anyone interested in obesity research or lifestyle interventions, or to anyone interested in learning how to more effectively write editorials and systematic reviews.",
    "For those interested in obesity, this class is amazing! It gave such great insight into the pressing needs facing our nation surrounding obesity and the obesogenic environment we live in. There are no tests in this class, and students are graded on participation, two editorials, a presentation, and a systematic review. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Highly recommended this class. New and interested topics and perspectives every week.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to explore obesity in-depth and brainstorm ways to address this public health challenge.",
    "You will learn a lot about obesity and its current treatments and options. You will also learn a lot about obesity policies and effective and ineffective lifestyle interventions. You will get valuable experience in writing a literature review.",
    "The course is useful for a first introduction to not only the topic of obesity and lifestyle prevention strategies, but also for drafting a meta-analysis. I've come out of the course knowing how to critically analyze academic literature, but also how to write a good meta-analysis. Additionally, if you are interested in the topic of obesity then this would be a great start to get an idea of what the field looks like to use in the future for a potential internship. I would highly recommend to take in the first year."
