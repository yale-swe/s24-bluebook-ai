    "If you have any interest in Buddhism or Tibet, take this course! The advertisements from past years are true: this is an incredibly solid introduction to a complicated and often misunderstood\/mythologized culture and religious practice. It's one of those classes that you walk out of feeling so much more knowledgable about the world. Plus Professor Quintman is a great lecturer and really dedicated teacher - he was able to get some of us tickets to see the Dalai Lama at an event that had been sold out for months. And he's always looking to expand our learning like that - such a cool class!",
    "If you're interested in Tibet, Buddhism, or the Himalayas, take this class. There aren't many others on these particular topics. The class is more useful if yo see Professor Quintman not just as a professor, but as a resource to further your understanding of the Himalayas, as he lived there for many years. Don't take the class thinking that it will necessarily be easy, as the readings may be more challenging than you expect and the assignments, though few, can be tricky.",
    "This is an interesting course. Unless you're a religious studies major it won't have too much relevance to your other coursework, but that means it's a good way to mix up your schedule. The workload is manageable, and the grading is fair.",
    "Great course. If you're interested in Tibetan Buddhism, in East Asian religions, or in Orientalist constructions of the East...you have to take it.",
    "This is a great introductory class to Tibetan Buddhism, taught by an amazing professor. Ultimately though, you get out of if what you put in. You can get by without doing any of the readings because lectures are both informative and accessible to the non-expert and weekly posts on the classes v2 forum are usually about the weekly movie screening. However, I highly recommend doing the work. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth it. On another note, the class is advertised as half discussion, half lecture. But really, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lecture that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open to questions and comments, which is probably necessary given that very few students know anything about Tibetan Buddhism. Overall, this is a great course and I highly recommend it!",
    "This class is great. It's a really good mix of introduction to Tibetan Buddhism from a practitioner's standpoint combined with historical and political perspectives. I'd never taken a religious studies course before and I was really glad I took this one. Plus Professor Quintman is really great. And I got to see the Dalai Lama speak! How cool is that?",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone that has even a passing interest in Buddhism or Tibet.",
    "This is a great course to take whether you're interested specifically in Tibetan Buddhism or you're just interested in the field of religious studies. Professor Quintman knows what he's talking about and he's a strong lecturer."
