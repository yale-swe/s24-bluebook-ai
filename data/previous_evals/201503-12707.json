   "comments": [
    "A lot of work for a half credit. Take 165 if possible.",
    "PHYS 205L is a lazily taught course with poorly written materials. The only upside is that the lab reports are very short. I would not recommend it, but I haven't taken the other physics lab so I don't know how they compare.",
    "Straightforward lab class, experiments covered all the basics of mechanics and E+M as well as statistical analysis. Weekly work probably totaled about 3 hours outside of class (lab notebook tidying, lab summaries, quizzes, and psets at the beginning of the semester). The labs did significantly vary in time however; we were there until anywhere betweeen 3:30 and 5:30 depending on the week. Final covered a lot of material but was fair given that it was open book. This class was a solid amount of work, but still a pretty painless way to satisfy the major\/premed requirement.",
    "They are really picky about how you do your lab reports. You will probably miss a lot of points on the first few labs but once you learn what they are looking for you should be fine. We rarely got out of lab on time. The problem sets aren't bad.",
    "Physics 205 is an introductory physics lab which both illustrates concepts from the Physics 180-181 or 200-201 series and provides an introduction to error analysis. I would recommend Physics 205, but I would advise taking at least one conceptual class first. I took 200 and 205 concurrently, and found myself struggling with some of the electromagnetism labs.",
    "Crap.",
    "I would not recommend this lab class. It was poorly structured and organized. I did not learn much and only took it for my major. I disliked going to the lab every week.",
    "Phys 205L was a challenging yet enjoyable experience. The workload was significant, yet the knowledge gained was amazing. The concepts were elaborated nicely in the experiment manuals and guides. Although I had not yet been introduced to some concepts in the Phys 200 lecture course, the experiment guides helped introduce me to the concepts. I would recommend Phys 205L to another students, because this course helped me see the real-world applications of Physics. From the use of gyroscopes in steering planes to the use of circuits in modern-day appliances, I believe the knowledge gained was especially relevant to the modern world.",
    "Physics lab is actually not a bad class but I don't think it would be too interesting for someone who isn't considering a major in physics or something similar. You can definitely take 205L first semester of freshman year. Totally manageable",
    "Worth while class but a lot of work for just a half credit.",
    "While Phys 205L is not a bad class per se, I didn't feel it greatly contributed to my understanding of physics. My takeaway from the class is mostly rules for error propagation, and I felt that could be taught in one or two traditional class periods. However, I understand that it is a major requirement, and as a basic lab intended to give foundational skills, not a seminar designed to really teach concepts.",
    "I would recommend this lab to any student well-versed in physics. If you're taking 180, or 181, or have only a nominal amount of experience with physics, I would recommend 165. You will get the same half-credit, the same major requirement will be met, and you might even learn more because the learning curve of the class won't drown you.",
    "Physics 205L is clearly a course designed to satisfy a requirement in particular majors. I personally did not feel that the lab helped my reasoning skills in Physics. However, I did learn a great deal of error propagation. At times I felt that the emphasis on the summary was a bit toiling. For example, our grades were boiled down to the titling of graphs and tables. At times, I did make interesting connections, but I wouldn't recommend the course to students for whom the course is not a requirement.",
    "Good physics lab, much more interesting than PHYS 165L, and not too much work either! Fun experiments, lab reports 2 pages each week and there's homework some weeks, but you can get them done in 2 hours or so.",
    "It is a necessary introduction to any physics or engineering major.",
    "Physics 205L: Where you verify that gravity, circuit laws, and electromagnetism are true. Thank goodness. I would not recommend 205L to anyone unless they know nothing about oscilloscopes and error propagation. Seriously. While verifying things like the Lorentz force law through experiment is satisfying, it's not worth 4-5 hours a week unless you really need to learn how an oscilloscope works.",
    "This course could be a shock to some students as the content of each experiment does not necessarily agrees with the progress in your current physics class (e.g. PHYS 200). Therefore it requires pretty extensive reading and research based on the lab handouts before coming to class. Besides, the mechanics of writing the notebook and summary can take a while for the student to get used to. Be prepared to spend more time than you think you would on this course.",
    "The experiments are generally interesting. I'd recommend the course, but I'd say it's very important to prepare for the lab each week a day or two in advance to make sure you understand all the concepts--being familiar with the entire experiment beforehand speeds it up a lot.",
    "It's a solid lab class, I took it with PHYS 200 and it was at a comparable level, though it only followed the same curriculum for about the first half of the semester. There are some error analysis problem sets at the beginning that can be annoying but the workload is in general not bad at all in my opinion.",
    "I would highly recommend Phys 205L to a fellow student. It isn't exactly something exciting, but I found it enjoyable. It teaches you the skills needed in the lab and is helpful in figuring out a solid way of thinking in the world of physics. The handouts basically tell you exactly what you have to do and the practical is also very straight forwards, so it's really just about putting in the time to do your pre-lab prep and then writing up everything in a neat fashion. If you budget your time well, this lab is a real blast!* *No blasts actually occurred during my time in the lab.",
    "Most labs in this class are very interesting and it takes around 3 hours besides lab period per week. I would recommend this course as a good option for anyone who would like to complete the lab requirement.",
    "This is a difficult lab. Expect to be there for 3.5-5 hours a week--labs never ran for the 3 hours that were scheduled. A lot of work is required, but grading is not too harsh.",
    "Do it if you have to. It was more work than fun, but tolerable.",
    "I despise phyiscs lab. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Phys 205L is a great introductory physics lab that exposes you to the basic principles and techniques used in physics research. The labs themselves are not extremely difficult, but the write-ups do take a fair amount of time.",
    "A reasonable choice for physics lab. Not the most interesting or exciting class, and a pain at times, but overall a good class.",
    "PHYS 205L was about what you would expect out of physics lab. You have a weekly lab, which takes about 3 hours to complete, and then you are responsible for a 2-page typed lab report (which I found obnoxious) and a completed lab notebook by the next week. Additionally, there are four short and easy problem sets about error propagation at the beginning of the semester. Some of the labs were really interesting, like one that taught students how to use an oscilloscope, and another that taught students about radiation and Poisson statistics. Others were more more mundane, like basic labs about circuitry and optics. But again, about what you would expect. Overall, you come out of the class with a better understanding of how to handle error and how to keep an overly rigorous lab notebook (even though I have never been in a real physics lab that required notebooks to be as rigorous as we had to keep for class). If you have to take it, get it out of the way as early as possible so you an get on with your Yale education!",
    "This physics lab had some really interesting experiments, and the two page maximum lab reports didn't take up a lot of time. For me, I would write the lab reports in one or two hours the night before lab, and that worked out fairly well. I wouldn't recommend this course if you're simply interested in physics, but it's a great course to take if physics lab is required for your major. Our TA was a tough grader, but he and the other professors were very available for help and quiz question clarification. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this course - the two page lab reports are wonderful, and NOTE THAT YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO FINISH THE REPORTS DURING THE SAME LAB PERIOD."
