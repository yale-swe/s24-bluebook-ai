    "I gained immense knowledge and skills in L2 of Arabic this semester. I learned a plethora of new vocabulary, and can now speak Arabic with a bit more freedom and description.",
    "Arabic language reading and writing skills.",
    "We acquired lots of new vocabulary and learned about verb forms and different moods and tenses.",
    "I learned further arabic grammar and vocabulary. I am now able to construct grammatically correct sentences and maintain conversations in arabic.",
    "I received a broader vocabulary and insight into the Arabic language. I was able to study the culture as well as advanced grammar.",
    "I continued to learn Arabic vocabulary and grammar. I improved my speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. I gained greater familiarity with the Levantine dialect of Arabic and aspects of Arab culture.",
    "Amazing"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Aziz made the class fun using charades as a method to learn new vocabulary. He also played Arabic music (that I later downloaded and now listen to regularly) that helped me learn colloquial arabic and become accustomed to the culture.",
    "Strengths were that the instructor was very understanding and able to get the best out of his students.",
    "The class covers a lot of material, and the work expectations were very clear, but the fact that we cover so much material so quickly means that there is very limited integration and practice of the new skills. I like that we learn dialect, but we also did not really practice or apply that speaking very often or very well.",
    "My weakness is that I do not memorize the vocabulary when I have to. Instead, I wait until the exams.",
    "I think that the class was very difficult because there were a lot of people who had previous exposure to Arabic. But overall I would like more handouts and vocab quizzes.",
    "I liked Professor Aziz's teaching style and lesson plans. He helped tailor the course material to each person's level of learning. The course was well organized, and all the assignments were made clear from the beginning. It was sometimes frustrating that many students would not show up to the 9:25 class until 9:45 or later. I don't think I gained very much from Shaami section. Exams were fair. Class was always really fun--I genuinely looked forward to beginning my day with Arabic, and I'm excited to do the same next year.",
    "The course is superbly taught!"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other Yale students (I often do). Arabic is a very useful and beautiful language that I think students should have the opportunity to learn.",
    "I highly recommend Arabic with professor aziz to all new comers. You do not need a previous background in Arabic to do well. Professor aziz will help you help yourself if you reach out for him for help. He's a great professor and I would highly recommend his class. You take away a lot and see tangible improvements in your Arabic.",
    "Much like any language class, the other students really make or break it. It is hard. Less busy work than L1 but probably more actually difficult work. It saps your energy and takes a lot of time to do well, but you really get out of it what you put in.",
    "Yes, I would because the Professor is very jovial and learning another language is worth it.",
    "Arabic with Professor Aziz is a wonderful experience. The course workload is not too heavy, but you will learn a good deal. This is a course in which you truly get out what you put in. Take it for a fun introduction to a fascinating language and culture!",
    "Yes it is great!"
