No complaints!",

   "comments": [
    "The readings more helpful than readings in most other classes I've taken, grad school AND undergrad. I liked the class discussions, and got a lot out of hearing other students' thoughts.",
    "The readings were useful, and final presentations",
    "The course did an excellent job of connecting heavy theoretical concepts to real-world problem and solutions. Additionally, the course covered a wide-range of topics and materials.",
    "This class really expands our thinking and perspectives, a really valuable class not just for FES students or people in social justice and\/or food systems, it covers so much nuance about social justice that it would be a valuable class for anyone to take - and our society would be far more functional if most people were aware of the principles and ideas of this class.",
    "I really enjoyed class discussions. Kristin did a really good job of facilitating discussion, as well as seamlessly incorporating current events (such as the presidential election) into our conversations. My classmates were respectful, thoughtful, and reflective; even disagreements were enjoyable! The class could feel a bit long, as it meet for three hours straight on Thursday afternoons. However, there were plenty of weeks in which I felt completely engaged and lost track of time. Other highlights of the class include the topics covered (understanding social justice and its many faces\/frameworks is so important!) and my classmates. As an undergraduate, it was wonderful to feel so welcomed by everyone. I learned just as much from my peers as I did from Kristin and the readings!",
    "Readings were great. I liked how the class time was separated into different components, which kept me engaged. And the topics we discussed were so important and have been really formative for me.",
    "Professor Reynolds was instrumental in creating a really safe and encouraging atmosphere in the class. This was crucial in facilitating discussions as she made it a point to acknowledge opinions. I especially appreciated her race sensitivity briefing as it gave students a framework to work within and allowed for better discussion.",
    "For me, the readings were the most valuable, and the weekly readings responses. I think there was a good balance of theoretical readings and case studies, laid out in a logical progression that made it possible to understand the latter part of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes Kristin steered student discussion when I would have preferred we just let it go where it was going.",
    "Group bonding",
    "Integration of more interactive activities. Although I gained a lot from the discussions, I am a very hands on learner and would appreciate a wider range of in-classroom activities.",
    "My main suggestion concerns workload. Although I really enjoyed writing reading responses and being forced to think about our readings critically, they were a pretty big time commitment. Perhaps 6-8 reading responses over the semester would be better than 10?",
    "I think the course could be improved by spending less time having really theoretical or conceptual discussions, to discuss practical situations or the real world.",
    "I think that the readings can be reduced a little, I appreciate the comprehensive reading list, but I do think that some readings could be listed as recommended.",
    "Don't have students make weekly posts.",
    "More flexibility in the final assignment would have been nice, as graduate students I'm not sure writing a 20 page paper directly related to theories learned in class is that helpful. Continuing an ongoing research project or preparing a research proposal would have been nice options. Reading responses should be max 250 words and should be entirely flexible."

    "Yes! My understanding of the food system and social justice issues expanded so much in the past semester, and I'm so much more excited than I was to learn and work more in this field.",

    "It was great to collaborate with peers from different schools and backgrounds. This was a very effective way to learn about social justice issues from a variety of vantage points.",
    "The advantages to working in a group included bouncing ideas back and forth, sharing the work load, having other people to hold you accountable, and meeting some really cool folk. Disadvantages included logistics (finding times\/places to meet), disagreements (albeit minor ones), and all of us feeling a bit lost at the beginning of the project.",
    "We were able to provide varied input that enriched our reading of the text and our discussion with the class.",

    "I believe everyone should take this course, because it relates to everyone--you eat, so you are part of the food system whether you like it or not. Taking this course has been an incredibly valuable experience for me, and I recommend it to everyone. No matter what your field of study is,s you'll be surprised how it overlaps with this course.",
    "I would advise spreading out the readings to be able to finish them before the reading response is due. I would also recommend starting to brainstorm the essay topic in advance to as to do adequate research. The lightning presentation should be practiced a few times to ensure a good delivery."
