    "This is a great class to be familiar and expose to Ralph Ellison's writings. There's more to Ellison beyond Invisible Man.",

    "I would strong recommend the course, but I would also emphasize that on a class-by-class basis the chemistry of discussion and extent to which all students choose to participate will have an impact on what the course amounts to. Individually and independently, however, I think one can get from the course a great deal."
