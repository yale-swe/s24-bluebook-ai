    "I would recommend taking Italian if you want to learn Italian",
    "I liked this course more than 120 and 110. Since we already had a year of Italian behind us, this semester of review was wonderful to cement everything we had learned.",
    "take italian its the best romance language at yale no doubt.",
    "Italian 130 is essentially a review of 110 and 120. If you were behind in those semesters, do not fear. This is a relaxing and enjoyable class to go to. You won't regret taking it!",
    "Great review of L2. More movies and cultural stuff mixed in. Fun class.",
    "Si, un corso molto divertente.",
    "So much better than L1\/L2.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian 130 as almost any other level of Italian.",
    "Yes, Ital 130 is a class I'd recommend to a fellow student. Kaiser is great and the material is new and exciting",
    "I enjoyed Italian L3 - totally doable amount of work. Class time was generally pretty fun and went quickly; I especially enjoyed review games and making up stories. Chris is the best!",
    "Italian 130 is not as challenging or fast-paced as L1 or L2, with a greater emphasis on culture, literature, film, etc. It is still a great course and a great review of L1 and L2 material and introduction to higher level Italian language and speaking."
