    "It was a fun intro to acting course and I would definitely recommend it. Definitely try to get out of your head and just engage and not worry about how you look\/worry about embarrassing yourself.",
    "This class was a replacement for one that was supposed to be run by a different instructor, and this felt very apparent throughout the entire semester. Though Professor Augesen is a very accomplished actress, she completely failed to draw upon this expertise, and ultimately succeeded in teaching us nothing over the course of an entire semester. Since she has taught this class before, I expected some minimal level of competency when she had to fill in last minute. However, the class totally lacked structure or purpose, and each week I felt increasingly that we were being given meaningless assignments for the sake of filling class time until Professor Augesen could leave with no clear agenda for developing our performance techniques. We spent the first two months of class playing focus games that involved passing balls to one another in silence and did literally nothing else. It was almost comical how unproductive this class was. Not only did we do nothing, but it was also agonizingly boring nothing. At the end of the semester, Professor Augesen voiced a concern to us all about the amount of concentration we showed as a group. I strongly believe that if she had given us any means of achieving progress, or any meaningful projects to develop over the course of the semester, this problem would never have arisen. Every student in this class chose to be there because they intend to major in Theater Studies. The fact that she managed to lose the interest of almost every single student in the room, every single week, is a testament to how poorly this course was administered. I would STRONGLY recommend waiting to take this class with Professor Margolin, or basically any other instructor available. This is simply not worth the amount of your time that will be spent sitting in the 220 York ballroom doing absolutely nothing. You're at Yale, use that valuable time to take something worthwhile, like a QR credit. Or use it to catch up on sleep. It would honestly be infinitely better spent that way.",
    "A basic introduction into performance and acting--a great class! Ren is a tremendous professor. She has a wealth of knowledge from her professional and graduate school experience that serves as a great resource for her students. She's always open to answering questions and spending time after class giving any advice you would need. She taught us warmups for rehearsals and performances (which are much more important than young actors realize) and some keys to acting successfully. She does run her classroom like a class in a professional program, though. You learn just as much, if not more, from observation as you do from actually performing, so she expects attention and respect from everyone. It's the least each student can give in class. I really enjoyed the class! My only wish was that we could have spent more time on our monologues and scene work, but I know that this year's scheduling made that impossible, so I do not hold that against the class or Ren in any way.",
    "I would definitely recommend 210 to another student who is interested in increasing their understanding of acting, specifically in approaching monologues. The smaller the class the better because the majority of the course is spent one on one with the professor, but if you are focused and take it seriously you can certainly grow from it."
