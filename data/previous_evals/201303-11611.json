   "comments": [
    "This is a very discussion-driven course. I enjoyed the readings, and the discussion, but sometimes wished for more professor involvement. If you are compelled by the topics at hand and are interested in the readings you will like it. If you would prefer information to be spit out at you, probably better to take the lecture course.",
    "Very average seminar. It's a total hit or miss depending on who the other students are.",
    "I would highly recommend PLSC 390 to another student if he or she is interested in China's domestic affairs. This course truly provides an in-depth learning opportunity about Chinese civil society.",
    "If you are interested at all in China, I think this would be an important class to take. Many of the issues discussed are about the most relevant debates regarding China today, and while there may not be definitive conclusions to such questions, it's important to understand the issues.",
    "A fairly low-commitment seminar that can be as rewarding\/interesting\/enlightening as you make it. Low workload.",
    "The readings covered some topics that are touched on, but never really discussed in great depth, in some of the other China-related classes here. I like the focus on the evolving role of state and society in the last few decades. Felt like in-class discussion was little stiff sometimes, but that's mostly because of the people who are taking it.",
    "Good seminar if you're interested in the topic; all of the readings are very interesting and up-to-date. Discussions really depend on the students themselves so they were occasionally a bit dry, but most classes were engaging.",
    "As China classes go at Yale, this one is just okay. If you are an East Asian studies major trying to do social science type stuff, this is a pretty good option (discussion can get stagnant, but it's a good syllabus). If you are just a political science major looking for a comparative politics class, you can probably do better.",
    "Great class; yes",
    "The class was good, not a ton of work. It was mostly a lot of discussion around political theory that related to China, so pretty academic and not really current events oriented. Professor Weiss is really nice, and a knowledgable China scholar.",
    "Interesting readings, but Professor Weiss was a poor discussion leader. I wish she had talked more and even lectured briefly every class, since she's clearly really knowledgeable about China. There were too many students talking who were just repeating what had been in the assigned readings. I think the system of students leading discussion every week was fine, but it would have been nice if Professor Weiss had lectured for a bit at the beginning of each class or took over more often when discussion leaders asked mediocre questions. That said, I think Professor Weiss chose good topics to focus on, and I came away with a richer understanding of post-Mao China."
