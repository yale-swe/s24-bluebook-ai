    "The professor should think about preparing more for classes. He often seemed both unprepared and uninterested.",
    "A wonderful class. Presented a wide and difficult literature with clarity.",
    "The course although very promising, did not leave to its expectations. The assigned readings were too much. There is no point in having student read over 100 pages per week if it is expected that student really understand the readings and are able to get something from them.",
    "More time should have been spent at the beginning of the semester discussing the different institutionalisms. It seemed like the foundational aspects for understanding institutions were mentioned at the beginning but a strong discussion never emerged from it.Readings should be consolidated down to a reasonable amount. It seems more important to get a solid understanding of a few pieces rather than a very superficial understanding of a load of materials. This was corrected for by the end but it was a bit of a rocky ride at the beginning which made it hard to adjust by the end.Having two classes in one week is a nightmare. It makes it really stressful and difficult to complete the readings and to have them fresh in mind come time for class."

   "comments": [
    "The open-ended nature of discussions was both the best and worst part of the course.",
    "The open ended nature may have frustrated some people, but really that is because they weren't willing to engage the instructor and the material. By keeping the course open ended the instructor made the material more accessible to student interests. The people who embraced this seemed to be rewarded with an original and enriching experience.",
    "readings were very interesting. Too bad i did not have enough time to read them thoroughly",
    "I really enjoyed discussion. Despite the occasional silences the discussions were fairly engaging and there was a lot to discuss. Unfortunately, we read much more than we ever addressed in discussion."

   "comments": [
    "The professor needs to organize his thoughts and the course more. While I understand the benefits of a less structured seminar, the fact that so many classes needed to be rescheduled and that so many discussions ended up off topic suggests a lack of commitment by the professor to teaching. Sometimes it felt like this course was the professor's last priority.",
    "More assignments would have been helpful in getting more feedback. As it stood writing four response papers felt a bit sparse. Perhaps increasing the number of response papers would have been better.",
    "The instructor needs to show that he is truly interested in the course. It is not cool to miss reschedule four classes when the class only meets once a week.Also, because of the complex nature of the readings it is important that the instructor lays out the main concepts of each so that everyone can add to the discussion.",
    "I think more time needs to be spent on figuring out the course material, particularly in terms of what readings are most important.The presentation for classes should have taken place earlier."

   "comments": [
    "Stefan was always accessible and quick to respond to email. Ben was often out of town and only occasionally accessible to students.",
    "The instructor and TA always went out of their way to make time for the students. The instructor showed a lot of flexibility and care in ensuring that if people needed time that he was there to provide it. I never had trouble getting a meeting with him every time I needed to discuss course assignments.The TA was easily accessible and was very helpful in guiding me as to what to focus my attention on in the literature.",
    "Ok. The instructor was helpful discussing the paper",
    "Both the instructor and the TA were very helpful. The instructor is sometimes unclear, mainly because he speaks too fast and I think he makes certain assumptions about what is or is not understood. It makes it difficult to keep up and absorb all that he is talking about."

    "It is a course with great potential. Unfortunately the way in which it is taught makes it frustrating.",
