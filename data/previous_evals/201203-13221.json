   "comments": [
    "This is a lot of work, and the work doesnt really flag when rehearsals start in earnest. The work is rewarding, and will serve you in the long run. Toni's mind is a very opal aren't we lucky to get to take classes with her?",
    "I doubt that this course will be offered again any time soon, but you should absolutely work with Toni Dorfman if you get the chance. Preferably on Shakespeare.",
    "This is NOT a normal production seminar. We had class for the entire semester (it didn't turn into rehearsal halfway through), and we had a rework of a scene unrelated to Twelfth Night and a 12-page draft of our final paper due during tech for the show. If you're looking for a normal production seminar that isn't too crazy, take one from a different professor. Professor Dorfman is, however, an excellent director and rest assured you will grow as a theater artist if you take class from her; it will just be a lot of work.",
    "Performance seminars are a great opportunity to learn about your craft and a play in the context of relevant theory. Make sure you know what the details of the syllabus are before you begin.",
    "A surprisingly tough course. Professor Dorfman is brilliant but very demanding. She assigned a 12-15 page paper during the tech week for the show, along with continuing class straight through to the performances. I definitely learned a lot, but not without a couple sleepless nights.",
    "This is a class for the serious and committed actor. It is a huge amount of work. The rewards, likewise, are huge.",
    "I would. Production seminars are wonderful and allow an acting to really immerse him or herself into the world of the play. Plus it's one of the few opportunities on campus to be directed bg a professional.",
    "Great class, and the end result is very rewarding. The one thing that must be stressed though is that this is a HUGE time commitment - if you're taking this class, you must make sure that you don't have many other things going on and your schedule is flexible.",
    "I doubt this is applicable, given the nature of production seminars, but my experience was definitely extremely recommendation-worthy.",
    "You read four plays, Twelfth Night, The Tempest, Love's Labour's Lost, and Every Man in His Humour and discuss them to some extent. Three scene presentations in class. Rehearsals for the show almost entirely outside of class, three papers, including a final draft, and an annotated bibliography. I would probably not take this class unless you have a quite free schedule at the end of the semester. There were far too many assignments at the end - on top of tech week(s) it was very stressful."
