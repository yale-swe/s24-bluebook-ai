    "Great.",
    "Spanish 130 reviews material from L1 and L2 (and I think covers a little more), incorporating the standard textbook\/workbook exercises with more interesting short stories and movies. I wouldn't recommend that a student take the course just for the sake of taking the course--its not difficult, but its a lot of busy work (the up-side of that is there are many opportunities to boost your grade). Only take the course if you need to fulfill the requirement, if you want to take some of the more interesting L5 classes, or if you really really like Spanish\/languages (in the last case, you could probably just go live in a Spanish-speaking country for a summer and learn to communicate that way).",
    "THis is not an easy class. Everything is conducted in Spanish with practically no English at all. Try your best, but even that might not guarantee success.",
    "It is a review of levels one and two. If you need to take it, just stick it out, but if you don't need to take it, there is no reason to. If you want to learn spanish, take intensive.",
    "I tested into L3 freshmen year, I would have preferred to learn more Spanish on my own or abroad and then take an L5 class, which would have been more interesting and less tiring.",
    "Standard Spanish class. Getting a good professor will make a big difference in how much you enjoy the class, but ultimately it will be dry at times no matter what.",
    "Yes, mainly because I thought the instructor was very engaging and helpful, though I don't feel that the course significantly improved my Spanish abilities."
