   "comments": [
    "This is a low-workload, utterly fascinating class. I would recommend it as a 5th class (it's mad easy to skip if you don't have time to go and you can still do well in the course), and also to anyone interested in development and international conflicts.",
    "It is a cool course and I am glad I took it! Beware that assignments are graded harshly.",
    "This is a super interesting class. I wasn't a global affairs major and I still felt that the material was very accessible to me. Don't be turned away by the impact evaluation section of the course. It is actually one of the most interesting parts. You will come out of this class with a much more nuanced view of aid and development. Professor Lyall is great and the course load isn't super intense.",
    "amazing class; very interesting material",
    "Yes, it is challenging but worth it if you're interested in poli-sci or global affairs",
    "What Development Under Fire is about is exactly as the title says -- learning how aid and conflict work with and against one another. This class is very well-structured and thought out, and never once did I feel that the contents were forcefully mashed together to produce such a class. Professor Lyall is a great professor and him alone will be worth it to take this class. If you are looking for a class to know more about aid work in conflict areas, this is the one to go for.",
    "Dev under Fire with Prof. Lyall is an excellent course. I took it as a non-major, which makes up a minority of the class, but not by too much. The subject matter is truly fascinating. I'd never really thought much about how foreign aid money is actually being spent, but this will give you more information you could want. Prof. Lyall is an awesome professor who has spent time actually doing what he teaches in Afghanistan and will frequently use examples from his experiences, which is really enriching. The class is a little bit of work. There is a lot of reading, and some of it can be pretty dense, but Prof. Lyall talks about them in his lectures, so it's not all that necessary to read every last one. There are two papers, a midterm, and a final paper, all of which are pretty straightforward. If you're looking to take a political science or global affairs class, take this one.",
    "Yes absolutely. Don't keep it an intro class though. Make it a higher level course so people who really like this stuff can get more engaged.",
    "Great lecture! Prof Lyall has real-world experience and knows his stuff (since he's actually done this work!). Workload was definitely manageable. Don't let the final paper scare you off at all; the TAs and Prof Lyall are extremely helpful and will answer any\/all questions.",
    "Yes, it is a class that allows you to learn what you apply and every time you read a news article about conflict settings and aid you will understand complexities that go far beyond the material.",
    "Great course that is on a very hot subject in the field of both development and security. The line is being blurred between the two and this course gives a great introduction as to why. The course also gives you a great understanding of how impact evaluations on development\/security projects is carried out and gives you first hand experience with designing your own which is a very cool experience. Professor Lyall is an awesome lecturer and really cares about his students, he takes the time to meet with anyone and is very approachable despite being so busy himself. He is a great example of practitioner\/professor and brings valuable insights from the field to the classroom. Definitely a course worth taking for anyone interested in global affairs international development and security.",
    "If you get frustrated at the stupidity of others, don't take the class.",
    "Yes! The subject is cool and the class is not that hard.",
    "Development Under Fire is a great class that you should definitely take! It's super interesting - if you have any curiosity about aid programs in war zones and how we evaluate them. A lot of the info is pretty intuitive, but the research is cutting edge and exciting!",
    "A mediocre class. Not very hard at all, but I don't feel like I actually learned very much. I learned some techniques to design an impact evaluation, but I think I could have learned them in a research methods class much more easily. I don't really have an answer to if development is good in conflict zones. I probably wouldn't recommend unless you're willing to commit to attending all of the lectures and reading everything. Pretty easy 5th class though if you don't want to do work, esp. because you don't really have to go to class for the 2nd half because there's no final.",
    "yes! would recommend",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It tackles some really serious methodological issues of practicing political science in conflict settings, while also addressing the development and insurgency theories related to this context. The readings are fascinating, you will never want to miss lecture, and the workload is not the heaviest.",
    "Development Under Fire is an excellent introduction into two things; the concept of humanitarian aid in conflict settings, and methods of political science experimentation. It allows for creative engagement with these aspects, as you desgin your own political science experiment, drawing on theories and methodologies you have studied throughout the course. It is very relatable to current events and conflicts, and draws heavily upon the interesting perspectives of those who have practised and experienced the concepts and methods we discuss in class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. However, I would warn them that it is not an intro level course and that it requires a lot of work, time, and sometimes an understanding of mathematical concepts. The use of formulas in the reading and the scientific nature made it very difficult to follow readings at times.",
    "If there is one class you should take outside of your major at Yale, take this one. You graduate not with a cursory knowledge but a really in-depth understanding of the topic and implementable skills which is something I really valued. Professor Lyle is really engaging.",
    "This is a really interesting course. Prof Lyall is a rising star in the Polisci\/Global department so was a brilliant lecturer. The material has lots of hands on applications.",
    "This was a very interesting class, and Lyall is a phenomenal lecturer. I really enjoyed hearing about his experience in the field with these topics too, from the theory of what makes people act in certain ways under certain circumstances, to even what kinds of survey and experimental methods he had used or seen in practice and his take on them. The section was not too different from the usual: discuss the readings, talk a little bit about the lecture, but it wasn't too interesting. The assignments were fairly light, though the grading wasn't too lenient. The readings were relevant (I preferred the recent studies in the second half of the class, compared to the theory readings in the first half). I also enjoyed the final, which is to make your own study based off one of four real-life research questions. It's a class with a lighter courseload that you should definitely go to lecture for, and has a lot of interesting material, especially if you want to know what actual studies and strategies are used in underdeveloped war zones.",
    "Pretty interesting class, not too difficult. Take it if you're into Global Affairs or want a taste of developmental work.",
    "This class is a great overview of the important considerations that must be taken into account when conducting impact evaluations and implementing development policy in regions with ongoing civil or insurgent conflicts. Take this class if you want to explore topics, such as: the theoretical arguments regarding civilian behavior, the legitimacy of global powers' \"right to protect,\" and the various research methods that are used in this field. Professor Lyall and section leaders will really make you think about what constitutes a comprehensive impact evaluation and why researchers must carefully asses whether or not their treatment is actually having the intended effect on the civilian population. Would definitely recommend this class if you want to think critically about research and\/or are interested in pursuing development\/aid work.",
    "If you are considering foreign policy or getting involved in humanitarian\/development aid work, it is almost essential that you take this course. However, I would recommend this course to pretty much anyone as it relates to conflicts that will affect our generation.",
    "Very interesting fun class. Professor Lyall is awesome and there are hardly any dull lectures. 100% recommend.",
    "Absolutely! You will have an entirely different perspective on foreign intervention and aid once you take this class. It challenges you mentally and emotionally as you have to face ethical dilemmas as well as structural issues within foreign aid and development.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to everyone, especially if you are interested in development and the challenges that come with it. This class gave me a better picture of how complicated it is to bring development programs to the places that need it, especially when these places are in a conflict zone. It is very interesting and even if you are not interested in development or PoliSci at all, professor Lyall is great and so engaging that you will enjoy the class a lot!!",
    "Take it. It is interesting and manageable for students in any major.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It was challenging and a lot of work, but the material was so interesting and so relevant to today's world that I didn't mind spending a lot of time on homework outside of class."
