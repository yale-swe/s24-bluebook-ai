   "comments": [
    "A very good class. Depending on student interest, Toni will vary from year to year whether the class is divided into directors and playwrights or whether everyone does both. Even when the class is divided, as it was for me, you will get opportunities both to direct and to write scenes at various points. The focus is on two-page, two-character scenes, so for playwrights it really hones your ability to craft an event with a limited amount of text, and for directors it is all about coaxing moments of honesty, interaction, and connection from your actors. As a director you also cast your own scenes, from classmates or from anyone willing in the Yale theater community, so you'll practice matching actors to parts as well. Overall, I'd say it is an excellent class for developing skills in these two roles, and especially in practicing the collaboration between them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to playwrights and directors alike. For playwrights, it's a great and rare opportunity to see your writing performed each week. For directors, a great opportunity to influence and dictate the development of new works. Definitely take this class!",
    "If you are interested in directing and work with playwrights and new material definitely take this class. You will improve as a director and a person.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in honing his or her playwriting\/directing skills. This course is especially fulfilling for students interested in collaboration and the creation of new work. It provides many opportunities to work on new scenes and collaborate with peers. This is truly a laboratory, a course in which to hone your technique, try new things, and gain helpful feedback.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is in their junior or senior year. It is stressful trying to find actors every week and sometimes the scenes come together in the last minute. Still, a great class if you want to practice your skills and interpret new work.",
    "THST 324 is a fantastic course that anyone interested in playwriting or directing should take. Prof. Dorfman is insightful and cares deeply about her students. She can be a tough grader, so do not expect to waltz out of the class with an easy A. However, it is not very often that one has the opportunity to create work and have it performed in such a short time span. Out of all my theater classes, I have probably grown the most in this one."
