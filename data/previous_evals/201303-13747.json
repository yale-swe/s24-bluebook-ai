    "It's an amazing opportunity to be involved in discussions with some really intelligent and inspiring faculty. Having more of the faculty in attendance at more of the meetings would help. Having some small group reviews\/discussion of individual research projects would help.",
    "The interdisciplinary nature of the course was incredibally rewarding, and other YSPH classes should strive to be as inclusive.The exposure to such wonderful professors (5 in spring, 4 this fall) was similarly rewarding, always generating fascinating discussions from disparate points of view.The course structure was unlike any I had experienced before. The student-driven discussions as faculty oriented the way in which we interacted lent us to integrate the concepts and findings of the primary literature far better than any lecture-based course could. This teacgubg method should also be attempted in other YSPH courses- we weren't just seen as students, we were seen as burgeoning experts in the field whose thoughts and opinions were worth voicing. The back-and-forth between students was where the learning occurred.The way this course could be improved, more YSPH support. Yale college sees the importance of these types of classes and has allocated an enormous amount of funding to support their students - every undergraduate has guaranteed summer research funding regardless of their placement (national\/international). It's not that I expect YSPH to be able to do that- it just is an example of the way they value this type of course. Other YSPH professors should attempt to emulate the course structure, or contribute as visiting professors when we discuss topics related to their field of expertise.Merely recognizing the value and impact this course can have on its students should be enough- this course is only mentioned in the principles of infectious disease class, with Dr. Childs as a co-instructor. Why isn't this course mentioned everywhere (anywhere?) else? Topics in SBS, CDE, EMD, and even policy\/management are touched upon and yet there is little\/no support from outside faculty.I can honestly say I've learned more from this course than all my other YSPH classes combined - so the fact that this course might not be held in the future is actually upsetting.",
    "Strengths: good introduction to many fields of evolutionary research which adds dimension to infectious disease examination"
