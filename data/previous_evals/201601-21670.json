    "Take this if you want to read a lot of great material and discuss it in-depth! Be prepared for a semester centering around exile-- if you don't want to talk about it every class for five months, then this is probably not the course for you. Professor Gosselink is a wonderful source of help in terms of helping you improve your writing skills, and her classes are well-led. Just expect a moderate (but overall enjoyable) work load.",
    "Good intro course; teaches how to think and write critically in the context of the literature of exile. Good intro to the library and the process of research.",
    "This is very much like a high school English class with a faster pace. The books on the syllabus are very good and it's a low-pressure seminar environment which helps to build confidence for later classes at Yale. That said, I found the course less-enriching than I would've hoped; I don't think my writing improved. This is a good course if you are looking for a non-judgmental seminar environment, but it is very difficult to get high marks and you won't actually learn very much.",
    "Highly recommend, good contrast to other courses."
