   "comments": [
    "Good way to improve your Chinese. Definitely recommend. Fair warning, daily quizzes and homework every week, but it's all extremely manageable.",
    "A solid L5 Chinese course. Workload is consistent, with a vocabulary quiz to begin the class every day, but not overwhelming. Professor Xu is very quick with teaching her material. I would recommend to any student that wishes to get better at Chinese.",
    "As expected for a chinese class, this class is a lot of work -- there are daily character quizzes and tests every few weeks, but you do learn a lot!",
    "Great class. Xu Lao Shi is understanding and a good teacher. I feel my Chinese has greatly improved. I took this class as a sophomore (didn't take any language freshman year), and I was scared my Chinese would be too rusty, but the pacing is great.",
    "Highly recommended. The course requires a lot of work, but it is extremely rewarding. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Excellent, wonderful, glorious course for improving both listening and speaking, and reading and writing. The workload is more intense than it seems on paper--daily quizzes and assignments pile up, and if you don't review old lessons as you're learning new ones, studying for the tests will be much harder. Xu Laoshi is phenomenal, and her class was a rock during the semester: you could always rely on Chinese to actually learn every day, and you could always look forward to an engaging seminar-style class with a cute and sweet Asian mom caring for you. The grading is devoid of any curving whatsoever, so just beware of that. Also, there's occasionally grading inconsistencies, but other than that, if you're looking for a way to satisfy your language requirement and are comfortable speaking Chinglish, or just want to improve your Chinese, THIS IS THE COURSE!!",
    "Yes, this is a class you should take if you are okay with the work load because you will definitely learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for heritage speakers with a solid Chinese base and are looking to start getting into formal written Chinese and more complex topics (civil rights, government, immigration, etc.) For those who have not had as much Chinese speaking experience at home (such as me), the speaking portion may be a bit difficult. However, it isn't that hard to catch up-especially if you put some time into the class.",
    "Would recommend. Learned soooo much.",
    "Yes! This is an amazing class. I've only taken chinese at sunday chinese school until a middle school level, and this class teaches you more chinese than your entire time at chinese school combined. There is a lot of homework (this class meets every day) and daily quizzes, so be aware of that.",
    "I would recommend the class, but the class is quite fast paced so its very easy to fall behind. If you have a lot of other pset-heavy classes, this might not be for you.",
    "It's a great class for students who want to improve their reading and writing of Chinese. There is a lot of homework and daily quizzes so it's a lot of work but this helps the student improve drastically. We learned formal sentence structures that make our Chinese more sophisticated.",
    "If you take Chns 152, your reading and writing will definitely improve. There isn't as much emphasis on speaking in class. It's a really well structured course though, so you'll definitely learn something. Study with others in this course--it's more fun, and for languages, group study works really well.",
    "Definitely take the course! It's a lot of work, but I think it's worth it in the end, especially if you've got cultural ties to China. We not only learn Chinese but discuss a variety of issues relating to the Chinese American experience (though arguably some of these issues are presented in an oversimplified and one-sided manner)."
