    "If you're going to take a language class, take Latin over ancient greek, and take it with Tristan Taylor.",
    "I would warn the student that the class moves very quickly and is very intensive, and that a lot of work will be required to keep up in the class. I really enjoyed the teacher that I had, so I can not speak for other sections, but I would tell them only to take the class if they are willing to work hard and be dedicated.",
    "A pretty fun course if you don't know any Latin and are curious. You will learn most of the entire grammar system. Shop a few instructors first.",
    "The course is intense. You cover a lot of material in a short time, but it is certainly worthwhile. To avoid cramming Sunday nights for the Monday quizzes, do a little each day."
