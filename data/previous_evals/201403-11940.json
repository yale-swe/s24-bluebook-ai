    "I was automatically placed into Spanish 150 because of my AP score, but chose 130 because I wanted to improve my grammar and conversational skills. Even though I have to take more classes to fulfill the language requirement, I'm happy with my choice.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. It is great and not too much work. Really helps improve your spanish.",
    "There is quite a bit of work involved outside of class, but overall I think this class was an important step for me in my Spanish career. I learned a lot and became more confident speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. There is a lot of work, but it is manageable, and I feel as if I really improved my spanish from it.",
    "Good follow up to Spanish 130. It has quite a bit of work, but less intense compared to Span 120 and 110",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The goal is to be able to communicate in another language and I feel closer to that goal."
