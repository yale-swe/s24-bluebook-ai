    "This is a very demanding lab, but you do learn a lot of biochemistry. I would recommend this lab only if you have some time on your hands to write the two long reports, and you want to hone your lab skills.",
    "I've done a bunch of lab work in the past, so I can attest to the fact that this lab would prepare you well for anything you may face. Compared to other bio labs, this one is definitely on the more pleasant ends. Definitely beware of the lab reports - they are not the kind like in a chem\/physics lab where you can knock it out the night before - you really have to start at least a week in advance of the deadline. I also had great TAs, but I'd imagine that the TAs really make a difference since this lab would've been pretty brutal without TAs that really interacted with you, chatted with you during the hour-long wait periods and didn't make you feel like they were constantly judging you.",
    "This lab is brutal. Chances are you have to take it for the major",
    "251L is a pretty easy intro biochem lab. You only have two lab reports and they're worth most of your grade, so take the professors' advice and actually start early. A lot of kids in the class already had experience with biochemistry lab techniques, so if you're the kid who doesn't, don't worry and just make sure you actually read the lab manual beforehand- everything is very straightforward so long as you know the procedure going into the lab. This will also help you with the prelab quizzes.",
    "Really fun lab class! The lab reports are huge! Don't underestimate them. But the work during each lab is useful and fun.",
    "The course was enjoyable, but only having two lab reports that basically determined your grade was a bit stressful. The lab report themselves were very difficult, but the professors and TAs were all a pleasure to work with. If you are looking for an easy lab to fulfill your lab requirement, I would recommend looking elsewhere. I don't think that the workload required to do well in this course was representative of only a half credit.",
    "I would not strongly recommend MB&B 251L to other students. I took the course to satisfy additional premed requirements, as well as to fill in for a bio lab course. However, considering how much time and effort the class took from the week, I would probably recommend doing a different lab, where the techniques that students would learn would probably be more interesting than the very basic techniques that defined this class's curriculum."
