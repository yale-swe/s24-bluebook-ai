    "Great class for pushing your drawing skills. You learn to draft as well. The tools are not cheap (just know, Hulls will take a fair amount of your money...but think! You could be in Orgo spending $250 on a textbook, and this class doesn't have a textbook, so...). I would recommend, even to someone with not much drawing background, but be prepared to work. You learn a lot from working and working with your classmates. Also, note that several assignments are pair or group assignments, which can be challenging to do (logistically and just in terms of drawing). But also great learning experience. You'll have some amazing work by the end of the semester and be really proud of it, too!",
    "The class is as good as you and your classmates make it. The more ambitious the group, the more you get out of the course. Prinarily for architecture majors, a lot of work, but if you are into it, it will be enjoyable. Victor is fantastic and really helpful ans constructive in crits. Befriend your TAs, they are really cool grad students and an invaluable resource.",
    "Yes! Great for both arch or non-arch majors!",
    "You will draw a lot. You will learn a lot. You will have a lot to show for your work over the course of the term if you keep with it.",
    "Great course to learn how to draw. But more importantly it teaches you how to be more critical with your work and with visual analysis.",
    "Very good class with lots of support even if you are coming from outside the major. However, the workload is very high.",
    "There is no reason in taking the class unless you're applying to major in Architecture. But if you are going to do Architecture the class could be a lot of fun. It's a lot of work but the schedule is balanced and they give you a lot of time to do the final project. You'll learn both free-hand drawing and drafting. If you are reading this as a freshman I recommend to take Basic Drawing first as preparation for the free-hand (and especially charcoal) part.",
    "Drawing Architecture is a challenging course with a very high volume of work. Its strength is that it gets you to think critically about how to represent buildings and ideas about architecture. It will push you to improve your drawing skills and consider things like line quality and line weight, composition, level of detail, and much more. By spending so much time drawing, you will learn to observe closely and you will internalize certain thoughts and feelings about some of the buildings on campus. By the end of the semester you will produce work that you are very proud of. The downside of the course is that it is very fatiguing due to the amount of work. You may spend up to 50 hours a week on some of the assignments. That being said, if you are committed to putting in the time, you will get so much out of this course. Victor is a wonderful, kind, and supportive professor, and the other students have lots of interesting ideas. I ended up deciding not to be an architecture major, but I am still glad I took this course."
