    "I really wanted to like this class, but I couldn't. I was constantly confused by the syllabus and what we were supposed to be learning in lecture. I don't think feedback on the essays were very good. I didn't find lectures to be particularly engaging. Although the workload isn't very high, I didn't enjoy the class. It is a good introduction to comparative politics, but it isn't a class I would take for fun.",
    "Lecture is sometimes interesting but mostly really boring. If you do show up to lecture on days when there isn't an exam, do your best to actually pay attention because the stuff he talks about shows up on the midterm and final. Just a warning though, it's really hard to pay attention because like I said, it's generally really boring. I very happily took it as a 5th class to learn a little bit about comparative politics\/the world. Professor Simon is smart and approachable, but just a tad dry. Also, find a good TF. Makes all the difference.",
    "Pretty easy, boring polisci class. The reading is really boring, and watch out because the assignments will make no sense.",
    "Acceptable for what it is. Gut, if you can write (TFs will grade papers legitimately). Take another class if you're interested in Poli Sci: there are other, more interesting low-level classes that will expose you more to what the field is like.",
    "A good introduction to comparative politics. Not too much work but not really a gut. The grading isn't harsh but it isn't a guaranteed A.",
    "This class made me never want to take an Introductory level Poli Sci class.",
    "The material is fairly easy because it is intended to be an overview of all the topics encompassed by comparative politics and the class therefore never goes too in-depth into any of them. The professor is clearly passionate about the material and he tries to present it in the most entertaining way possible, although this tends to lead to long digressions. Attending lecture (or getting notes from someone else) is a must, as the slides he uses barely have any information and both the midterm and the final are mostly based on the lectures. The other grades consist of a series of three papers on comparative politics that has little to do with the class material directly, so having a good TA to help you through the process is essential. Finally, since there is no homework during the year, you will likely fall behind on the assigned readings and end up cramming before the midterm and the final.",
    "No",
    "Yes! Take it if you want to do polisci.",
    "It's a solid course. Not necessarily a must take, but will be beneficial if you decide to take it.",
    "Kind of boring, but if you like politics and stuff then it might not be so bad. Not a must take, but not an avoid at all cost type of course either.",
    "The course details many different factors in comparative politics and I would highly reccomend the course.",
    "A course in comparing countries to one another in an attempt to draw out some kind of conclusive answer only to realize (or to have your professor inform you) that it is actually impossible to compare countries because they are all different.",
    "If you really like politics, this class is pretty straightforward and might be interesting to you. If not, don't bother. I found the readings to be super long and boring with lots of technical political science\/economic jargon. The lectures are pretty boring and section is mandatory.",
    "DON'T take this class. It had good reviews from previous years, so I took it, looking for a more relaxed poli sci class. It turned out (and maybe this was partly a function of it being a much larger class this year) to be boring and difficult because we didn't seem to be learning much and papers were graded harshly. One of the least rewarding classes I've taken at Yale, and certainly the worst in this department.",
    "Very basic political science course. I had comparative politics in high school and found this course much less interesting. The scope of the class is simply too broad to go very in-depth with any specific case studies, and lecture was dull. Don't take it unless you have no experience with comparative politics and are fascinated by the topic.",
    "It's a good intro course in that it's pretty general and conceptual, but it does also get into some specific world examples which is nice. I would recommend it, especially if you're interested in different governments around the world.",
    "I recommend PLSC 116 to those majoring in Political Science.",
    "Pretty interesting intro to comparative politics. Do readings for sections and show up to lecture and take notes. Only somewhat hard thing was the divergence assignment. Consult the professor if you're really drawing a blank. Otherwise, the midterm and the final were perfectly fair (he sent out a really nice informative study guide prior to the final - use it).",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are interested in learning about the types of things that affect politics in foreign countries. I was hoping to learn about the politics in other countries and was very disappointed. Professor Simon would reference places abroad but it was very difficult to keep up if you weren't already familiar with the place. That can be very overwhelming especially as the powerpoints rarely included details about these places that were intelligible to people with no background. There is not too much work for this class, but, as I said, don't expect to learn about global politics and of you don't already know about them, you might struggle a little.",
    "Not too tough of a class and you don't have to do too many of the readings until right before the midterm\/final",
    "I would not suggest that you take this class. Some of the concepts are interesting and it provides a basic introduction to comparative politics. However, the lectures aren't engaging, sections aren't too lively, and the papers don't seem to be worth the time and effort neededto be put into them. If you want an interesting intro PoliSci class, don't take this one.",
    "The course overall was an interesting introduction to comparative politics. The lectures were dry many times, and I felt like I could have just looked at the power point from my room in order to take notes in the class. The assigned section reading was confusing many times which made it hard to get through the long texts that were assigned. Overall, it was an okay course.",
    "Thought it was a gut, but the class was so boring that you don't do the work and don't do that great. It's easy if you're willing to do a lot of busywork.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about politics around the world. However, I would warn them that the professor is very hard to follow, but he is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course as a fifth class. It would also be useful if you were to want to learn more about a particular part of the world (especially Africa) - that prevents the class from becoming so nebulous a to be much less useful. Otherwise, consider smaller political science or history classes first.",
    "I'd recommend the class only if you are very interested in the material or know very little about international political\/governmental systems (like me) and genuinely want to gain a good understanding about them.It's a good compliment to Intro to International Relations (some overlap, but not much), although if you're choosing between the two I'd definitely recommend taking Intro to IR instead.Workload -- average. 1 midterm, 1 final (both fair, but u have to study a lot), and 3 papers..2 of which are short (4 pages or less).Lecture -- can get a little dry because we go through very few slides and it takes a while to get directly to the point of things.Readings -- a lot of political science articles, which I found dry. But I enjoyed readings from the book much more. Average workload.",
    "It's exactly what it is. A good introduction to comparative politics.",
    "I think comparative politics is a fine course to take to try out the political science field. I still don't know what I will be majoring in, but I have a better understanding of political science because of it.",
    "I would only recommend it if they are very interested in comparative politics. Otherwise I would tell them to try other political science courses.",
    "This course is very manageable, but it's certainly not a gut. If you want a good grade, expect to work hard on your papers and be sure to take good notes during lecture. Simon's powerpoints won't make sense to you while you study unless you write down all the stuff he says in lecture.",
    "The class is not very interesting. It is a good introduction to a number of classes, but involves a lot of memorization of facts, and is not very intellectually stimulating. I would not recommend it to another student.",
    "The class that turned a would-be polysci major into a history major. Now I understand why those in the sciences disparage of social \"science\" majors.",
    "I would suggest this course to students interested in getting a general overview of what political science comprises.",
    "This class not very interesting, but it's a good start for those of you who are interested in political science. The readings aren't very hard, but in the end you really don't have to read at all to do well. Most people don't. Not too hard class, but at the same time not extremely interesting. A good stepping stone into the political science major.",
    "I would recommend it as a credit D class- material is generally very interesting and applicable to real life. Although you don't really have to do all of the reading, some of it is worthwhile (although I admittedly am a political science major). Take it if you have some sort of interest in the class- either have to do the readings or go to class but class is probably the better option.",
    "No. Some used to call it a gut. It's not. Decent amount of reading. Three essays. Midterm. Final exam. Some material is just plain stupid (\"What is a state? What distinguishes an authoritarian state from a democratic state?\"), and some of the material we are tested on is just unfair (\"Who was [some guy that I mentioned in passing in one lecture about a month ago]?\")",
    "Standard intro class. Lectures are somewhat boring, but the tests aren't very hard. Professor Simon is a nice guy and I get the sense he genuinely wants everyone to succeed, but the class (and section) is not that interesting.",
    "Would only recommend if you are a Polisci major seeking to fulfill a requirement or are looking for an easy 5th class.",
    "I would recommend the course if you really have some interest in what's going on around the world and you know about some important conflicts, movements, etc. Because I didn't know much about current issues around the world, sometimes it was hard to understand the examples discussed in class. If you are comfortable talking about world politics, this course will be very helpful and informative.",
    "No, a lot of reading and information.",
    "This is a good class to take as an intro to political science courses at Yale. Otherwise I didn't think there was a lot to gain from the course.",
    "It really is an 'intro' class. Hardly any substance.",
    "Pretty easy to get by without doing much, but also not very interesting. It gets a little better if you're willing to do some of the readings, though.",
    "Yes I would recommend",
    "It's a pretty solid intro course, and will give a good overview of a variety of political systems around the world. The papers aren't too bad, and if you structure them right they can build off of one another, which helps. Simon's lectures are pretty easy to follow, but make sure to take notes to supplement the PPTs online. Overall, if you're into this realm of PLSC, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Take it if you need a not-so-hard PoliSci (or SO) credit.",
    "This course is exactly what the title would suggest-- an introduction to comparative politics. If that is a subject you're interested in then take this course",
    "I recommend it if you are interested in politics and you are not familiarized at all.",
    "A great introduction to different political systems and how successful they are in other countries. If you already have a good knowledge of the subject matter it might be a little simple for you, but I learned a lot about different countries.",
    "Overall, good poly sci class if you want to learn a lot about our governmental system and about other countries.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Worse course than I was expecting. Lots of theory and much harder than I expected. Bit of a disappointment to be honest.",
    "Definitely would not take this course unless you already have a good grasp of international relations, and think that you are interested in political science theory. Otherwise, the lectures and readings are not the most thrilling, and you won't take anything away from the course.",
    "I probably wouldn't take this course if I had the chance to go back and do it differently. It was just too boring and inconsistent.",
    "I think its a fairly good introductory course, but very broad and dry at the same time.",
    "This class is an interesting introductory political science course. As a science major, with very limited knowledge of political science, I felt like it was very helpful in presenting an overview of the field. The professor is a good lecturer and my teaching assistant held very organized sections and both were very open for questions to clarify things that were difficult to understand. Nonetheless, I feel that someone who has sufficient background in political science should not take this course as most of the material might end up being review. The workload is relatively light.",
    "It's a fluffy intro class, there are more interesting classes out there but not bad for an intro lecture course.",
    "I would recommend it, if the topic really interests you. At times, it became difficult to stay on top of it because it had this tendency to be very general and superficial.",
    "If you can keep up with the reading...",
    "A big disappointment. The lecture was at times interesting, yet for the most part it was a somehow voyeuristic stream of words and loosely related themes. There were very few actual case studies, little connection between the lecture and the readings, not to mention the section (which was a part of the cours living its own life). I have attended every single lecture and section and did not feel I learned much apart from smart academic expressions like \"convergence\" or \"cenrifugal\". Plus a few random facts taken out of context, plus a few names, on average one for each country mentioned... Perfect if you like playing Trivia, horrible if you want to learn.",
    "take it!!",
    "Great overview of global politics! This course has a little bit of something for everyone interested in politics from a comparative perspective: from study of government structures and institutions, to the democratization process, to conflict and security, to a brief focus on economic development and inequality. The papers give you a great opportunity to look at whatever regions of the world and political concepts you find most interesting."
