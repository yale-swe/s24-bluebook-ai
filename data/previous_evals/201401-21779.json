    "LATN 448 is course in Latin epigraphy. We translated and studied inscriptions from throughout the Roman Empire that related to certain topics. I think my translation skills improved substantially, as did my knowledge of Roman history and culture. The inscriptions are not always conventional, so they took some getting used to, but being able to translate them is immensely useful. The class was a lot of work for me, because I had no experience with taking Latin in college, but Classics majors in the class thought that the workload was extremely manageable. Professor Johnston is incredible; you will want to take every other course he offers at Yale. Overall, I think that this is an excellent course, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the material.",
    "For those interested in historiography, this is an excellent course and very much worth taking."
