   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is great if one wants to acquaint oneself with the 19th century canon. The course does favor theoretical texts to a close reading of the literary texts themselves, due to the general nature of the course.",
    "The best course for introducing oneself to, or expanding one's knowledge of, French realism. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "\"Realism and Naturalism\" is more or less an essential course for students interested in Western European literature since the Enlightenment, in literary theory, or in French history since the Revolution. Many students with primary interests beyond these borders might well also get something from the course, if only to deepen their perspective on a body of literature that most humanists have come into contact with at one point or another.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any comparative literature student who can read French.",
    "It is a course that gives both a historical overview of the evolution of realism and naturalism in France in the 19th century - mainly in the literary field, but not only -, linking this evolution to social and material changes of the time, and an aper\u00c3\u00a7u of the kind of criticisms, very good or less so, that is done in that area. I would recommend this course.",
    "Strongly recommend, for the aforementioned reasons."

   "comments": [
    "It filled in a lacuna that needed filling; it will provide context and counterpoint to my research, at least, though it's unlikely I will write on realism.",
    "I am sure that my dissertation will include work on the authors studied as well as the critical traditions presented in the course.",
    "I thought this course, more than any I have taken, made a point of giving us a good overview of the living, working field of nineteenth century studies, and in this way addressed me as a future professional. I also appreciated being initiated to different types of criticisms, which helped me better understand how I proceed when I analyze a text, what would be interesting for me to do more of, and what I don't like and why.",
    "Will contribute significantly to my research, and to knowledge within my discipline."
