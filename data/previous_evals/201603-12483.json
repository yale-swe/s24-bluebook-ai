    "This course was comprehensive and I learnt a lot from it. However, it may not be the best Econ course to start with for students who do not come from a prior Econ majors background. However, as a student taking a masters level Econ course for the first time, I learnt a lot of new concepts that will have a lot of use in my future research."

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely well organized. The two halves were really well paired. Problem sets were carefully thought-out to reinforce the material, and the lecture notes (first half) and textbook (second half) were excellent resources that perfectly matched the lectures.",
    "The first half is too fast. The second half needs more explanations for big picture I think.",
    "The second half seemed to be glorified calculus\/algebra, which I suppose is good to go through, but I'm not convinced it made me that much better as an economist. The first half was very challenging but very interesting.",
    "Strength -- well-organized lecture notes and homeworks",
    "This course has a good curriculum, nice review material and good professors and TAs. However, it is not the best introductory course in Microeconomics. Sometimes it is so mathematical that we fail to see the economic insights in it."

    "Yes",

    "no",
    "I would definitely recommend it to all quant PHD students but I wish there was a more basic course before this for students not from Econ backgrounds who wish to work in quantitative fields like Accounting or Quant Marketing."
