    "I learned how to effectively begin to speak a foreign language for the first time. I learned how different European languages can be from English, and that it is very difficult to learn on.",
    "Beginner level Polish",
    "I developed the ability to speak Polish at its most basic level. I learned a lot of new nouns, adjectives, verbs, and phrases. I learned how to count, read polish sentences, and listen to Polish dialogues.",
    "A basic understanding of polish vocabulary, grammar, and syntax as well as exposure to polish culture, songs, and foods.",
    "I learned the foundation of a new language in a manner that was easy to understand.",
    "I learned many polish phrases and the basics of how the language works. It was very fun and exciting.",
    "I learned about polish culture and the basics of the native language.",
    "I learned Polish. How to speak it, write it, and listen to it.",
    "This class was very unique and interesting to me because Polish is so unlike any other language I have studied in the past. Polish has taught me about new cultures, as well as challenged my speaking and writing abilities. I have a much broader understanding of language in general after taking this course.",
    "I learned more about the Polish language and culture, which I had never known previous to taking this course. I've also learned how to work on my phonemic skills by speaking the language.",
    "I learned a lot about the polish language and culture.",
    "I have learned a lot about the language structure of Polish, as well as the foundations needed to conjugate and use different verbs.",

   "comments": [
    "The professor is lovely! The class is very positive and has a good atmosphere.",
    "This course could be improved by making the starting time later, especially since so many athletes take the course and therefore have workouts or other obligations. This course could also be improved by giving us more worksheets to fill out.",
    "Incredible teaching",
    "The strength of the course is our professor. She made everyday fun and interesting.",
    "The course is very interactive which helps students learn the material quickly. I Would not change much.",
    "Strengths: Professor Illakowicz is an amazing teacher. She is invested in the course and her students and makes class fun and interesting every day. She also does an amazing job of giving feedback and meeting with students if they had to miss class. Being a fall athlete, I had to miss a few classes for traveling and Professor Illakowicz helped me get back on track immediately. I do not see any weaknesses within the course.",
    "My strengths were asking for help when needed, conjugating, and translating. My weaknesses were mostly around forming questions out of statements. I could improve by practicing more speaking and writing simultaneously.",
    "The class helps students learn a lot in a setting that is laid back and welcoming",
    "The strength of the course was the repetition used to help reinforce previously learned topics, and the constant feedback to show you how you were doing.",
    "The class is very helpful due to the class size."
