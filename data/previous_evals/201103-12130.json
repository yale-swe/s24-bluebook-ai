   "comments": [
    "Take it if you can get in! Brilliant professor, great students. A lot of reading, but not too much work otherwise. No assignments except the final paper, so you should be okay with going through the semester with no idea where you stand. Gets a bit redundant by the end, but before then it covers everything to do with rivers, from dams to eels. It's informative and thought-provoking, no matter what your interests.",
    "Do it if you're interested in thinking about how humans relate to our environment. It's really a beautiful subject.",
    "Yes but only if you're interested in anthro and rivers.",
    "Lots of reading, most of it interesting, with a large final paper at the end (effectively the only grade in the class)",
    "It is an interesting topic, though got a bit repetitive at the end of the semester. I wasn't enthralled by the entire thing, though. Professor Scott is very knowledgeable, but he did not get to know the class that well in my opinion and did not give great feedback throughout the paper process.",
    "I would recommend it if you enjoy discussion and don't mind talking a semester about some pretty esoteric topics. Scott has some really interesting, unexpected knowledge that, while not necessarily useful to say, your future profession, is nevertheless really interesting. The only real assessment is a final paper, but that doesn't mean you can't not do the reading all semester, because every week Scott picks two random names out of a bag and those two people have to give a 15 minute presentation on the book. You always have to be prepared for that presentation (although you get two free passes for the semester if you email him beforehand).",
    "maybe, if you want to read about random rivers or go on facebook. not great, not terrible",
    "amazing subject matter, great way to organize a course, superb, intelligent and genuine teacher with a good eye for selecting students. learned a lot, and very glad to know professor scott. only criticism is that some of the readings and conversations became repetitive beginning in the second half of the course.",
    "Be prepared for a book a week.",
    "I very much recommend this class. Discussion covers critical subjects including environmental ethics and failures of human interventions in the environment. The final assignment is left wide open and really becomes what you make of it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a serious and intellectual student who will make an effort to read every page. If you don't take this class seriously, it is not sufficiently structured for you to get much out of it (a term paper is the only handed in or graded work). Coming from a sociological perspective, I took this class to study politics under Jim Scott. Nevertheless I came to appreciate Scott's approach to Rivers\u0097which is explicitly anthropocentric only in spurts. Rather than treat Rivers strictly as a 'resource,' and as such nothing more than an object over which humans engage each other in conflict, he chose to have us study Rivers in a more thorough and holistic way. Hence we read a book on eels (which ended up being one of the most fun and interesting books on the reading list), a book about working as a pilot on the MS river, and a theoretical study of whether rights should be attributed to nature. Still, each class ended up including discussion of human conflict, and some books were especially focused on the intersection of politics and nature. So ultimately, I was a fan of the way the course was constructed.",
    "Get ready to read a lot about dams! Weekly readings tend to be varied and very well-written, though they touch on similar (and often very depressing) themes. Each week, a sort of haphazard class discussion follows from the readings, spurred by the 'extemporaneous' 10-minute analysis of the readings given by a student chosen at random. I felt like the discussions were not all that they could have been, but if they were tweaked even a little bit, I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in rivers or man's relationship to nature.",
    "Really enjoyed this class - very interesting readings and great class room discussion. Definitely take it if you can",
    "Start the final paper early"
