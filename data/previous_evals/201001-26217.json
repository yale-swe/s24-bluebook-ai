    "Strengths- breadth of material covered in the classweaknesses- the same- at times it seemed that we were glossing over the material on a given subject and getting only a rudimentary understanding",
    "This class covered very interesting material about many different aspects of cancer epidemiology. The many guest lecturers were all quite interesting and the material was quite intriguing.",
    "Excellent.Professor Cartmel has done a terrific job of choreographing a great curriculum featuring many fine cancer-research experts, including herself.",
    "Covered lots of topics. Individual research projects allowed us to go in-depth into one topic of our choice which was great. However, lots of guest lectures and disjointed topics... lack of cohesion and fluidity throughout the semester.",
    "Strengths: Brenda is an excellent primary instructor and lecturer, but it was very exciting to have experts in other areas of cancer research come in and guest lecture. I thought this was the greatest strength of the class.Weakness: How do you cover everything about cancer prevention, etiology, and treatment?? Not at all something that can be fixed- and Brenda did a great job of covering as much material as possible in one semester.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I previously had an interest in cancer epi (and did not need to take this course, because I'd already taken vascular epi) and I feel like I got a lot out of it. The lectures give a broad overview on the topic, generally focusing on different exposures or specific types of cancer. Dr. Cartmel is very knowledgeable and was a great instructor. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in cancer epi, or looking to fulfill the requirement."

    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel seemed passionate about the class and interested in bringing guest lecturers to cover specific topics. The class presentations were interesting as well. She was responsive to questions from the class and encouraged participation.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel was an excellent friendly lecturer, showing herself to be quite knowledgeable whenever had questions about the material, and assigning reasonable homework assignments.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Excellent. Couldn't be better.Dr Cartmel is as thorough, helpful, and caring an educator as you will ever find.Also, she asks great questions of the students and the visiting lecturers, who all admire her for her appealing mix of expertise, kindness, and endearing Lake District humor.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Very good and kind",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Brenda is amazing. She is brilliant and has so much experience and knowledge working in cancer epidemiology. I loved coming to every class.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel was a wonderful professor who did an excellent job of assembling a group of guest lecturers throughout the semester who along with her own lectures provided a rich overview of the vast field of cancer epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel was a great instructor. She always provided fair and helpful criticism on our papers and assignments and I enjoyed her lectures as well. She was very organized and was able to coordinate lots of different lecturers, which I'm sure is no easy task."

   "comments": [
    "Overview of cancer epi- pretty basic concepts due to the wide coverage of material. Good opportunity to research a specific area of interest for the class paper\/presentation.",
    "Cancer epidemiology - exactly what the course title says. The course material is quite interesting, and Dr. Cartmel is an excellent lecturer.",
    "If you're interested in learning about the epi of cancer, take this course.",
    "This is a great course. I did not have a very strong background in cancer epi so there was a lot of new material. The guest lecturers were phenomenal, and Brenda is a wonderful professor. You probably do not need to purchase the textbook unless you want supplemental reading (assignments and the final exam could be completed with lecture notes and ppt slides)-- but the book is great if you do want the extra bit of reading.GREAT COURSE- I highly recommend it.",
    "This course covered a wide range of cancer exposures, types of cancer, and even tumor pathology (one of the best lectures in my opinion!)."
