    "G&G 111L is a great class. The trips are what make it worth it. If you aren't planning on going on the October break trip, I would say that the class is not nearly as worth taking, since the trip really is fantastic. If you like being outdoors and appreciate doing scavenger hunts for homework, you will enjoy this class.",
    "G&G111L is a lab about \"rock\" geology. Even if you're not super interested in rocks and minerals, this was a fun lab. The labs aren't very bad or long; in fact most of them were very interesting! The field trips were always fun - as are most trips through the geology department. The TFs and professors were both very helpful and knowledgeable. The labs really taught us a lot and were interesting and engaging at the same time. I really enjoyed myself in this lab!",
    "I really liked the lab. The field trips are great, and it really helps you contextualize material from the class (G&G 110). You'll learn a lot about identifying rocks, which is actually pretty fun to do. You'll also do some mapping, some mineralogy, and a few other various activities. The lab doesn't meet every week and is definitely not as demanding as most labs. I'd recommend taking it if this kind of material sounds at all interesting to you!",
    "Take the lab if you're taking the class. It meets every other week, just about, isn't too much extra work, helps you learn the material much, much better, and is a BLAST! This lab is basically one long field trip. Why wouldn't you take it?!"
