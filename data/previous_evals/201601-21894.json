    "Short homework assignments, fair grading, grammatical accuracy is required--Arabic tutors provided by CLS are recommended and section is a great use of time!",
    "A survey of Arabic literature focusing more on comprehension than fluency or vocabulary. Almost no grammar. If you've gotten this far you are probably pretty dedicated to Arabic. It's not super hard or fun, but it will maintain your Arabic.",
    "This is a course in a high level, you will get out of it what you put in, so go deciding to read the texts several times until you understand everything.",
    "It's a very good rigorous Arabic course for those who want to learn Arabic at a high level.",
    "Good course. Not too much work, the readings are interesting and diverse if a little unusual. You get out what you put in.",
    "It is a steady amount of work, but from the beginning of the semester, you know exactly what will be due on what days of the week, and it is easy to manage. I would highly recommend the class.",
    "This was a pretty typical Arabic department course. I think it was ok, and I really enjoyed the literature, but the class was not conducted as much in Arabic as I would have liked and most of what we did in class was not so useful in my opinion. The textbook and writing we did, however, certainly made me a better writer in Arabic and especially the final research paper. Professor Aziz gave good corrections and read our writing carefully. However, even though professor Aziz wrote the textbook and I liked it, I would not say that that means the class was particularly amazing, even though I got more out of it (from the homework) than I would have expected given what we did during our class time which I felt was not so useful.",
    "This class was fun, even if I felt frustrated sometimes by the work or how I felt my Arabic was not improving. The fact that everyone knew each other already and knew what to expect from the class made it engaging. If you have already made it to 150, I would recommend continuing because 151 is a step up from 150 in terms of how much I liked it.",
    "ARBC 151 is class in which students read excerpts from various Arab authors. It is a great introduction to Arabic literature and serves as a wonderful base for study of Arab culture, however, the difficulty of the stories is at too high a level given the level of Arabic language proficiency that students have after ARBC 150. Therefore, reading the stories can be extremely laborious. In addition, the class did not seem very unified and there were not really central themes. There was not much discussion of the stories in class (we answered comprehension questions about the story instead) which I believe did not develop out speaking abilities as much as possible."
