    "This semester, they changed the structure of the class. Instead of assigning the class to write a 30-page short, we had to write a \"master scene,\" recruit actors to come into class for a live table read, and then film and edit our scene. Essentially, they made the class Intermediate Fiction Film without any of the access to or instruction about resources and the filmmaking process. This was really frustrating. Professor Lapadula is still great, and the class is always fun, but if they keep this structure, I would probably not recommend taking the class (unless you want to take Advanced Screenwriting, in which case you have to take it).",
    "Having taken intro screenwriting I thought I knew what to expect in this class, but unfortunately I was wrong. The writing element of the class remained, as ever, fantastic. Marc Lapadula is an outstanding mentor and manages to keepeveryone inspired throughout. I definitely saw my writing improve over the semester with the many drafts that I wrote for the class. What didn't work was the new element of the class which required us to film our sequences. Having to imagine a feature length and then write a sequence to fit within it was work enough, but then having to film the sequence is another semester's worth of work at least. Most people in the class had no filming experience whatsoever which added extra stress and confusion. Further to this, with only around 3 weeks given to us to go away and film the sequences we really didn't have enough time to prepare locations, actors, props, equipment, storyboards etc.This class would have been greatly improved if it were a year long course, similar to the senior thesis course where the first semester you meet twice a week, once to go over screenplays and once to learn film practice and then have the second semester to workshop the screenplay in class, edit it further and film it with the knowledge gained in the previous semester to support you. While the intention of the class was to encourage more students to take the advanced fiction film workshop, I feel like more people will now be inclined to stick with screenwriting due to the lack of training and focus on the filming element of the class. In short: great idea, bad execution.",
    "Yes i would recommend it. However, I wish it was still the old way.",
    "A great segue between intro and advanced. I would recommend it to another student, as it provides good prep for longer form of screenwriting.",
    "take it !"
