    "Of course. Take DS.",
    "We began class with 10-minute starters (1 or 2 per person for the semester). Make sure you do a close reading of the given text. Fun, great discussions. Really enjoyed history and politics readings this semester. Papers were more difficult to write though, I thought. Professor Landemore is really approachable. Just go to office hours and she'll give you tons of comments, which will be far more focused and helpful if you have an outline or draft by then (fight those late thursday nights, I tell you!) She always makes insightful remarks about the work and writing for poli sci in general. And don't forget to clearly define terms in your essays! try to come to class prepared - the reading is so delightful, and we move so fast, it's better if you make the best out of these next few months. Enjoy! You've made it this long, and the reading only gets better.",
    "DS History covers many social contract theorists including Hobbes, Rousseau, and Marx. Small groups are very good for discussion; there are not many other opportunities like this with an integrated curriculum.",
    "Awesome. Do the reading, talk in class, take good notes. So worth it."
