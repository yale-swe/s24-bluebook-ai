   "comments": [
    "History. Very complex. Great lectures. Horrible readings.",
    "I took European Economic History (the second one, mostly during the 1900s) pretty much on a whim, having read reviews that said the professor was great. I didn't have a profound need to know about the time period, but by taking the class my curiosity developed. Professor Guinanne is excellent. He's kind, funny, very approachable, and a great teacher. The workload isn't that bad and the papers are useful in both understanding the subject and developing one's writing skills. I had a great time in this class, and wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "take this class! Prof Guinnane is a great professor and the class is very well taught.",
    "ECON 187 brought the econ major into a whole new light for me. Guinnane did an awesome job of teaching actual economic theory, like the Solow model, elasticity and profit functions, but in a completely historical context. The readings are interesting, and the entire class has a well-though out structure - you will know exactly what is going on. Although the class wasn't overly \"hard,\" it is difficult to know how to do well. The three problem sets are bizarrely worded, and the two papers have unusual expectations. But take it. Guinnane is a great guy, and will put in effort to get to know you.",
    "I would recommend it if you need another Econ course even if you think you wouldn't be remotely interested in the material. The prof is a good lecturer and makes the material interesting. The reading is very dry, but you don't have to do it (despite the prof's threats). The problem sets are fairly easy and few in quantity. The first (short) paper isn't bad at all, and the longer one does not take very long either but is kind of a pain.",
    "Great class. You'll learn a new way of looking at economics and how to apply basic econ concepts from micro and macro to history. Make sure you go to lecture, take good notes, and get there on time. Guinanne is a great professor and really takes an interest in his students. If you are willing to put in the work, this is a class you will remember.",
    "One of the best I have taken at Yale - great lectures, interesting readings that weren't terribly long, and challenging but rewarding assignments (psets and papers). The lectures are really really good, Professor Guinnane keeps it interesting and I was surprised by how small the class was this year. I'd recommend especially to people who are NOT econ majors and have an interest in econ - the work is manageable and it's definitely one of the more interesting econ courses.",
    "Fantastic class, best Econ class I've taken at Yale. But as a heads up- he is a strict teacher who will stare you down if you're not to class on time."
