    "You read a graphic memoir or two a week and have a reading response. At the end of the course you make your own graphic memoir using Columbia's oral history project. It's an awesome class!",
    "yes! amazing reading, not too much work, awesome creative project.",
    "read awesome graphic memoirs and create a storyboard of your own. highly recommend",
    "Yes! The reading is so pleasant, and much more profound than I had anticipated. The final project, creating your own graphic memoir, is actually really fun even if it sounds daunting and you have no skills at drawing.",
    "Take the class, if you care\/are interested in the subject...a waste of time otherwise\/distracting to people who do want to be there.",
    "It's a good class, but only if you are very interested in graphic novels. Fun reading list and fun final project (you make a graphic memoir).",
    "I would recommend if the student has an interest in reading in the graphic form and hasn't had the chance before.",
    "Excellent class! If you can get in, take it. Life changing."
