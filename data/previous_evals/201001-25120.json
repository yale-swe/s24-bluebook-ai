    "I thought that this was a very good class. Professor Weiss is not the most dynamic lecturer, but she is very clear, easy to follow, and nice. Her lectures are probably not the most exciting if you are not interested in the material. However, because I was interested in the material, I enjoyed this class very much. The material is extremely important for everyone to know. This class is very much a \"what you put in is what you get out.\" I did most of the readings and felt like I learned a lot. However, I also had friends that didn't do many of the readings and therefore didn't get much out of it. In conclusion, if you are interested in the material and are willing to spend a few hours a week doing readings, take it. If not, don't take it. The grading for the class is not harsh, but it also not lax.",
    "As someone with little prior knowledge on Chinese history or politics, I found this course to be very rewarding. The readings were all very interesting and section was great. The lectures were a little bit dry and I stopped going after a while. The paper options were (Three 3 page papers, one 15 page paper, or one 3 page paper and one 6 page paper). Just having the options was pretty nice. The grading was not too harsh or too easy.",
    "Very interesting class and very relevant to what the US is experiencing now in relation to China.",
    "I took this class because I felt the body of information was important to know, but was disappointed in the class itself.The amount of reading assigned for an intro level poli-sci class was unreasonable- easily over 100 hundred pages of pdf articles for each class meeting twice a week. Lecture was rarely engaging, and the style of notes (the powerpoint would literally have only the topic and then the professor would talk about it at length) wasn't one I particularly enjoyed.The redeeming factor was that in section, groups would present the week's readings and prepare a memo summarizing each. These memos are critical for the final since there was far too much reading to handle each week.",
    "Good class. The history parts of the course were especially well taught and worked well with the readings. You'll get the most out of it if you do the readings and go to lecture, which is usually pretty doable. I would definitely suggest it. It's also not too much work.",
    "If you are interested in China, in US contemporary issues, or in history... this course has something to offer you!",
    "Yes it was great I learned a lot",
    "I do recommend.",
    "Before this class I knew nothing at all about China's history or political relations, and I definitely learned a lot. Lectures were somewhat dry at times, but I think Prof. Weiss has a lot of potential. Read selectively. The work is manageable and you can get a lot out of this class. It's a very important subject matter.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It gave me a great survey of Chinese history and world politics, and I walk away from it incredibly more informed about East Asian politics in general. Also, the workload is more than manageable, and it really isn't necessary to do all the readings.",
    "I would recommend it for a good overview of China in world politics and international relations theory, but even though the material is interesting, Prof. Weiss doesn't really do a good job of conveying that interest. This is a new course and it's the first time Prof. Weiss was teaching a lecture, so it needs more time to age. The course was very well organized, but Prof. Weiss wasn't a very good lecturer. She's a bit dull and doesn't convey the passion she has for her subject very well, but she'll probably get better with time since the lectures did get better towards the end of the semester and she put more jokes into the lectures.",
    "It's a good class if you want to gain a broad, cursory understanding of various issues plaguing China.",
    "I would recommend the course because there is a great grade distribution over 3 short papers and a final",
    "I would recommend the class to another student if they are interested in learning a quick history of China.",
    "Terrible class.Lectures were short (usually 30 minutes) and just a review of the reading.The professor changed the grading scale\/assignments\/due dates 8 times during the course of the semester.For example, discussion section participation and presentations (2 of them) suddenly became mandatory AFTER the end of shopping period.She would not announce assignment due dates until 2 weeks before they were due. And then change the due dates. And then change the assignment completely (e.g. you can now do a long paper instead of two short papers).The final exam was easy. But don't take this class unless you enjoy being frustrated about class logistics. Or if you expect to learn something.",
    "I enjoyed it, although it had a deceptively little amount of work at the beginning and middle of class, with a cumulative final that has a TON of information packed into it. Try to do as much reading as you can before lectures.",
    "The class has some interesting readings, but lecture and section were both uninformative.",
    "Definitely take this course! I've never taken any polsci or chinese history classes at Yale but I felt this class was a perfect intro course that changed my perception of China and China's role in World Politics. It's an awesome course with really interesting lectures. The professor talks a bit fast and soft but she presents material in a very clear and organize manner.It's also just the right amount of work. Not a gut class but not overly intense.",
    "A very good combination of history and contemporary politics, focused on the linkage of the two. The history is fascinating, and the politics are highly relevant (China's disputes with Taiwan, Chinese energy needs, etc.). I think the course will continue to improve and work out some of its disorganized spots (especially section) in the future. I very much enjoyed it, especially because I learned so much and enjoyed the work (60% of the grade is 3 reaction papers, 3 pages each, that are easy and enjoyable to write).",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in China and want to understand its relations with other countries. If you want to get the most out of it, I recommend reading all the readings and attending all the lectures. It probably is possible to get a decent grade without truly grasping the material but that shouldn't be your goal from the onset.",
    "Unless Professor Weiss improves her lecturing, I would pass on this course. If she does, though, the material certainly is interesting and could make for a great course.",
    "This is a great intro poli sci course. Professor Weiss is an excellent lecturer, the workload\/reading is very manageable, and my section leader, Ms. Yi Kang, was great. The grading is reasonable, with three papers, one exam, and participation factoring into the grade, and I myself got a much better foundation in contemporary political discussions involving China. One of the better courses I have taken thus far here at Yale, and certainly one of the best lecture courses.",
    "Good class, interesting subject, medium workload take it if you are interested in China\/Asia and its politics at all",
    "Yes, it was enjoyable overall.",
    "PLSC 179 is a GREAT class. Take it. Lectures are short and sweet, the readings are incredible, and the workload is light. You learn REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF ABOUT CHINA THAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW!",
    "This is a class about China, from the historical period to today. It's pretty chill, but get the history down in order to understand the current stuff.",
    "Perhaps, if you really like the subject and are willing to get most of your information from the readings. Otherwise it's not a particularly burdensome survey course, with a bunch of different paper options for people who either like writing long or short papers.",
    "If you want to get a basic introduction to China's role in the international order, this class is definitely recommended. But if you're looking for more specific analytical politics, this would not be ideal.",
    "its an okay class, you aren't going to come out with a ton more information, but if you want to be exposed to some issues surrounding china then its decent.",
    "PLSC 179 was an interesting look at China in the world with regard to politics.",
    "A good overview of chinese international politics, take it if you want to learn more about that. the reading responses were easy but graded hard and the final snuck up on you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Not only if you want to be a political science or eastern asian studies major, but also it gives you a good overview of what China is all about and its historical and future interactions with the world. Great class to take if you are interested in knowing more about this ancient and modern nation."
