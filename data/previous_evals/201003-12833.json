    "Intro Painting is not for the weak or unmotivated. Do not take this class if you want to play. Be serious about your work, what you want, what you see. Studio is a very different environment than drawing in your room or wherever you want. One of the biggest surprises was sometimes, I just didn't want to be in studio -- but you HAVE to make it your home because you will be spending a lot of time there. You get into a groove -- what is efficient for you to make the work you want to that night? When do you want to work? Do you have large chunks of time that you can devote to studio? Why do you want to paint? It's not about \"expressing yourself,\" it's about learning the language of paint \/ color etc. A great class if you have the drive.",
    "Take this class if you are a wannabe painting major or only if you have time. If you want improvement and personal growth as an artist, it depends on how much (time, effort, money) you put into it. NOTE: This is NOT a Humanities credit!",
    "I would recommend this course to other serious art (especially painting) students. It has a lot of work, but it is reasonable if you schedule your time well. It may not be for the art student who is just trying things out or is not sure about their dedication to art. You definitely learn a lot, though, about your own painting skills and limitations.",
    "Again, this class's pacing and definite momentum is it's surest strength. It is one for serious artists who have motivation. That motivation can help the student look past the intensity of the course and the emotional drain it can occasionally cause.So I highly recommend this course to those who are truly serious about art, who are open to new ideas, harsh criticism, and a change in perspective.I also recommend that you not hold a grudge against the instructor, but feel that you are working WITH Robert Reed.",
    "If you want to make work (and a lot of it), and you dig Professor Reed's methodology (aka -- make work explicitly for one man's aesthetic, not your own), then go for it.",
    "Take it."
