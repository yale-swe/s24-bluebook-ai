   "comments": [
    "Math 120 is a difficult course, and it is designed to extend and push you. Don't let that put you off. With the right support and studying, anyone can succeed in this class. I would recommend taking the course under Professor Havlickova, she is a faultless teacher and effortlessly teaches the course. Take it especially if you're interested in Majoring in Maths or are debating about it.",
    "Challenging and covers a lot of material. But many resources are there to help. I would definitely recommend this course to students who are prospective STEM majors.",
    "Math 120 is a great course if you're into math and have a strong foundation in calculus already. Even if you've already been exposed to multivariable calc, take 120 anyways. Miki especially is very good and makes a huge difference in the class.",
    "I would recommend MATH 120 if you are willing to put in the time to practice the concepts you learn. It's not always enough to just go to class or read the textbook and class notes. You have to take the initiative to do a lot of practice problems -- as many as it takes to completely understand the concept. I think having a good teacher makes a huge difference though, because a lot of the concepts are hard to grasp conceptually. It's definitely possible to rely on self-studying to learn most of the topics, but this would be very time-consuming. I'm so grateful that I had Miki; she's the best math teacher I've had in a long time.",
    "A course without a curve and a ton of tough students. Worth it though. Miki is a grey teacher and you will learn a ton. I didn't even finish bc in highschool and was fine.",
    "It is a good intro to multivariable calculus. Take it with Miki or Miriam.",
    "Yes",
    "Math 120 is a challenging course. Miki is a fantastic instructor, but the course material is difficult for those who have not taken multivariable calculus before. The course moves relatively quickly and many students in the class have prior experience with the material. If you have taken multi before, this class is definitely feasible. If you have not taken multi before, just know that you will definitely need to put a lot of work in to understand the material.",
    "Good course with useful material, the things like optimization turn out to be pretty useful in other subjects as well",
    "I'd summarize it as a good math course that is challenging if you haven't had prior experience with the material. I would recommend it if they were able to get a good section.",
    "I would recommend MATH 120 to another student; although it is a challenging course, I think it teaches you to think about math in a different way.",
    "Good, rigorous course with enjoyable, informative classes and problem sets that can be time-consuming.",
    "MATH 120 is a pretty standard course with a very manageable workload. I wasn't particularly interested by the subject matter, but if you want or have to take it, I would recommend taking it with Miki.",
    "Math 120 applies calculus to situations with several variables. It is fascinating to learn about functions with more than two variables and their properties. It was an eyeopening experience and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would only recommend Math 120 if you have to take it for your major, or if you are a math genius. Try to take it second semester if possible because apparently the curve is better. Also, try to get Miki as your professor.",
    "If you like math even a little bit I would recommend this class.",
    "Math 120 teaches you what you need to know, and even if you've done a bit of multivariable before it's a great refresher and really solidifies everything. It's pretty hard stuff and it can be kind of fast-paced, and you'll want to start on the homeworks early and check answers early so you can catch silly mistakes. It's not a thrilling course, it is just math, but I definitely learned some interesting things!",
    "Although the material may be a little challenging at times, the overall course difficulty is definitely manageable, and I felt that I learned a lot during the semester. I would recommend MATH 120 to any student who is interested in taking a math course.",
    "It is a difficult class that expects students to not only understand the concepts learned but apply it to difficult questions as well but there are many resources available to improve, however catching up is difficult once you fall behind. It is not a course for people who are not interested in mathematics or who are not required to have a Math 120 prerequisite.",
    "I would summarize it as a great foundation in Multivariable Calcukus that is a great class for students that plan on majoring on a variety of different areas.",
    "Avoid this class if at all possible",
    "I would recommend this course as it is interesting and appropriately paced. The material was challenging but the course did not require much time with just one weekly pset. The amount of time needed for this course is mostly dependent on the student."
