   "comments": [
    "Amazing class. If it's offered, take it. Be ready for a lot of reading, but it's worth it, Professor Manassa is great.",
    "Yes, and if someone has a bit of prior knowledge or a high interest in the region, even more so.",
    "Fantastic course and highly recommended. There's something of interest to practically everyone, and Professor Manassa is amazing. On top of it all, you will come out of the class knowing tons of information about ancient Egypt.",
    "This class gives you a general background of ancient Egyptian history from the Predynastic period through the conquest of Alexander the Great. This course has a heavy load of reading every week, but I found the information interesting. No previous information of Egyptian ancient history is required. I would recommend this course under Professor Mannasa, but the caliber of the professor would greatly effect my recommendation.",
    "A very interesting history of Ancient Egypt. Everyone should definitely take advantage of Yale's unique and very prosperous Egyptology program.",
    "Yes, the professor is amazing and most of what is covered is very interesting.",
    "Take this course! It's interesting and you might not have time to take another like it. Also, read the course packet, not for exam purposes or grades but because the readings are kind of cool.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students as a fantastic freshman seminar, but only if students are already interested in ancient history and archaeology, especially of Egypt."
