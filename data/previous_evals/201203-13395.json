    "Hard class but great. The more effort you put into it, the more you'll enjoy it and the better your writing will get. Prof. Shirkhani is superb - she does a great job at giving comments and feedback to you ASAP.",
    "Take this course.",
    "English 120 is all about non-fiction narrative writing. I recommend this class to every student at Yale. No matter what subject you wish to pursue in the future, the ability to tell stories is indispensable.",
    "Great course that will push you academically. I'm leaving ENGL 120 feeling more confident in my writing. Before writing a 5 page paper was annoying, now it seems just natural. Be conscientious about what other classes you are taking with this class. If you are going to have a lot of weekly work of classes that have more than one paper, consider taking ENGL 120 at a different time because it does demand a lot of your time with readings and papers.",
    "I spent the longest time during the shopping period agonizing over whether I wanted to take 114 or 120... And I am happy to say that every day I spent in 120, I found myself silently praising myself for making the right decision. The readings are fun, the discussions are lively, the professor is engaging, and the essays are quite enjoyable to write. The five themes of personal experience, place, person, cultural critique, and satire really challenged my creative boundaries and pushed me to think deeper and harder than I ever had before. The class was undoubtedly challenging - not only in writing and revising the essays, but also in analyzing and discussing the readings every class period. I often felt too cowed by everyone else's eloquence and insight to offer up my own thoughts. But this class really has taught me to be a better thinker, in addition to a stronger reader and writer.",
    "English 120 is a great all-around writing class. You will compose 5 or 6 full length essays on topics like satire and personal description\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well an equal number of shorter, more flexible writing exercises. Biweekly writing workshops help you both examine your work with a more critical eye and learn from the writing of your classmates. English 120 is also particularly enjoyable because the readings are varied and entertaining. In Professor Shirkhani's class, readings are mostly drawn from the New Yorker and similar publications. The shortest assignments are but a few pages long, and the longest ones maybe 30 or 40 pages. Very manageable.",
    "I highly recommend taking English 120 03 because it sets a strong foundation for your writing at Yale. You learn different styles\/approaches, as well as how to construct a solid and organized purpose\/argument.",
    "English 120 is definitely a class I would recommend if you are looking to really learn different writing styles and improve your writing. Though if you're looking for and easy A, this is not the class for you.",
    "This was a great course. I got myself into more work than I realized and had to pick up the slack quickly. A lot of the discovery\/learning revolved around reading the passages\/essays thoroughly on your own. I found myself a better writer by the end. A lot of work but definitely recommend to anyone."
