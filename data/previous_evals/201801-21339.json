   "comments": [
    "I have a much better understanding of different traditions and religions. I feel much better equipped to have deep conversations about the meaning of life. This class really helped me find a path towards a life worth living. It also taught us a lot about really seeing other people as people.",
    "So glad to have taken this course and so glad to have met Ryan and each and everyone in my LWL section. It's a blessing to have a chance to take a course outside of SOM, and it's an even greater blessing to especially take LWL. I am a better human being because of this course. I would advocate to make this a mandatory course for all SOMers.",
    "How to consider the life I lead each day and be critical of how my choices relate to my vision of what makes a good life",
    "What it means to live a LWL- beyond what SOM leads you to believe.",
    "one of the best classes i've taken at yale. i learned a great deal about how to think about different religions, about different religions \/ school of thoughts, and learned a lot about what my classmates' thoughts about life worth living are.",
    "LWL is basically a crash course in Utilitarianism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Nietzscheanism, Buddhism, and Scientific Naturalism, but through the lenses of life going well, life led well, and life feeling good. Every week you do a reading response on each tradition and you talk about it for both seminars, and then on Thursdays theres a guest speaker on the tradition (lecture is very chill). If you do not have significant understanding of these religions already, it may be difficult for you to keep up with conversation in class. Most of the insights I developed were on the class retreat, and it caused me to question what is worth wanting. This course changed my perspective, although perhaps not in the way that was intended. If anything, I learned that finding a life worth living for me CANNOT be found in a classroom, and that the most interesting parts of class were the conversations I already had with friends. Most of the time in class we wrestled with the difficult questions, but often I walked away from class extremely disappointed as it felt we made no real progress and spent a lot of time spiraling off into theoretical conversations that held no practical value.",
    "An overview and in depth discussion about what major traditions (Utilitarianism, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Nietzsche, Islam, Scientific naturalism) say about what makes life worth living. Interesting historical overview. Discussions with fellow classmates about life goals, plans, the fruit of life.",
    "Life Worth Living is a course that everyone should at least try to take during their four years at Yale. The course provides broad introductions to various philosophical and religious traditions, and because the course centers itself around student engagement with these traditions, it goes beyond intellectual engagement. This is one of the very few courses I've taken at Yale that are designed for personal introspection.",
    "I learned about myselfmy own values and beliefsbut also about the intimate values and beliefs of some of my classmates at Yale, in a way that I never would have otherwise. I learned how to think more critically\/intensely about my own world views and measures of success and worth.",
    "Great overview of how various traditions and individuals approach the good life. Skills in intimate classroom discussion and debate, critical reading, and incorporating personal ideas and vulnerability with academic and philosophical content."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think it did a really great job with picking readings and leading discussions. I found the first half of the lectures (Effective Altruism, Judaism, and Islam) to be the most interesting and informative. The other lectures did not really live up to those standards. I don't think the social media one actually taught us anything new. Also the Christianity readings were much better organized than the others which seems kind of wrong.",
    "A+",
    "More explanation of the theory",
    "Ryan is a terrific section leader- so glad to have met him and learned from him.",
    "Strengths: 1. Retreat was definitely a highlight of the class. 2. Small class size, and by nature of the subject material its a pretty personal\/vulnerable class so you really bond with your classmates. 3. Paper topics were interesting to think about and put to paper. Weaknesses: 1. Not as relevant to everyday class as I had expected, and conversation felt unguided in class. For a class that requires an application and has its own promotional video, I had hoped that the day-to-day class life would have been more fulfilling. 2. Peer review in this class was not really helpful because it was after the papers were handed in. I would love to have talked to my classmates in groups of three the week before the paper was due, and I could have used more guidance. I think it would be helpful to talk about Yale's or my peers' vision of a LWL in class before writing a paper on it, instead of afterwards. 3. Prof. McAnnally-Linz as compared to the other LWL professors. 4. A 200 WORD reading response on ~100 pages of reading. To improve, either cut some questions or cut some readings. Also it made no sense that the reading responses were due at 6 pm on Sunday when the class met at 1:00 pm on Tuesday\/Thursday. Sometimes they would take up to three weeks to be graded. 5. Word counts in general in this class. Its hard to cover all the bases and make a strong argument in 750 words, and for a class that requires this much self-awareness the papers should match this.",
    "Readings, retreat, and seminars were very well synchronized to deliver a coherent syllabus. The seminar format allows for deep connection and discussion. Guest lectures were very eye-opening. Section leaders alternated between different class formats (eg. debates, candid conversation, turn-based) allowing for participation.",
    "An incredible class. Ryan and my classmates were its biggest strengths, but helped by a very solid syllabus!",
    "Incredible learning environment facilitated by great professors. Encouragement to share and relate deeply personal stories, thoughts and ideas, and engage with peers and texts."

   "comments": [
    "100% I think everyone should take this class. It is so thought provoking and you really get to know your peers. It is not too much work, just readings responses and 3 short papers, but you still get so much out of it.",
    "A+",
    "Yes. Makes you think in a way other classes wont. But only take if youll genuinely commit to it",
    "Absolutely",
    "yes absolutely.",
    "No, unless you really click with your professor or if you have a true interest in analyzing traditions. The grading is pretty subjective, and often I could not elaborate on ideas because of the word limit and then get criticized for not elaborating on certain ideas. No one else should grade YOUR vision of YOUR life worth living except YOU. Ideally this class would be a time and space to step away from the stress of Yale and remind us why we do what we do. In reality, it just added to that. The scope of the papers was quite overwhelming. I think this class would have been a lot better if it was pass\/fail, so I encourage those interested to take it Credit\/D. As hard as I tried every class to enjoy it, LWL was a letdown.",
    "Take it if you are completely comfortable with seminar setting and with talking about your life aspirations and insecurities and don't have social anxiety. I had a below-average experience of this class because I don't think I was ready for this depth of conversation. However, some of the ideas (especially Buddhism and what it has to say about no-self, compassion etc) really stuck and connected classmates well.",
    "I would recommend Life for Living to any student at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Especially to seniors (but really everyone)! It will help you at any point of your Yale career. Youll start to figure out what matters to you, and how to go about the business of the rest of your life accordingly.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale; the learning environment is intimate and unparalleled in other styles of classes. Deeply personal and actionable insights come from this class and will stay with you for the rest of your life. Incredibly supportive and engaging teaching and curriculum."
