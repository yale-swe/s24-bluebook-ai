The course does a good job of picking slightly oddball topics that end up giving you a nice picture of the state the field.",

    "This is an interesting course if you give it the chance to be. If you're willing to engage with the material, actually do the readings (which are not long at all), and pay attention in lecture, you'll like it if you like philosophy. Interesting and thought-provoking.",
    "Would recommend to people who already have an investment in the material due to a background in philosophy or related disciplines. I could see how the discussions might appear irrelevant or inside basebally to those who haven't seen much philosophy before.",
    "This was a really interesting course, intellectually engaging but not too taxing, and Professor DeRose is great.",
    "I think this is a good introduction to Epistemology and the content of the course is applicable beyond philosophy--I took it as a CogSci major and found that there were interesting overlaps."
