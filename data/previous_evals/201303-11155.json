    "A standard language course that explores a lot of interesting, cultural topics in the German-speaking world. The focus expands to Switzerland, Austria, and not only Germany. Some of the topics were: historical events, famous musicians, artists, cities, multiculturalism in the present day, etc.",
    "Depends on the teacher I guess. Didn't enjoy class with Marion all that much.",
    "In German 140, we learned mostly about German-speaking cities. Perhaps it was because there were only 5 students in our class, but there was a lot of speaking and discussion in German. We had weekly journal entries of 15 sentences and had to participate in 3 outside cultural events and write about those. We had a test every other week. The grammar concepts were not really new, and there was quite a bit of writing involved. We were assigned Skype partners who are German students learning English, and we spoke for approximately 40 minutes every week for 4 weeks (this really helped me be a more confident speaker).The workload of this class was probably a little less than other Yale classes, but Marion often changed assignments without much warning, resulting in more work for us on certain weeks.I would recommend shopping 150 as well, and taking a German course with a younger Grad student if possible. They are generally very relatable and relaxed, fun to learn with!"
