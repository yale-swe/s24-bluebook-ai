    "I learned about instrumentation of different telescopes, data analysis, observing, work flow lots of things youd need to go into astro research.",
    "This course was a great survey of the main principles of observational astronomy. We covered the nitty gritty details of telescopes, spectroscopes, and other instrumentation, and followed the path of a photon from a star to, the scope and instrument, to the data, finally to the publication. We also discussed broader topics like how to write a research proposal, good practices for astronomers, and current events in astronomy."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very small, so we had opportunities to ask questions and direct the class with them if we wanted, but if the class was happy to allow Professor van Dokkum to do his thing, he always came in prepared with good material. It was a steep learning curve for me as an undergrad, but well worth it. One improvement might be to have more, smaller assignments. The assignments that we did have were very interesting and fun, but we only had 4 or 5 including the final project, so sometimes it felt like we didn't get to practice\/review some topics outside of class if they were not covered by one of the assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if youre interested in doing astronomy research or instrumentation. Its a little too technical otherwise (and also run like a grad class). There are only a few assignments, but theyre pretty extensive & require independent online research on the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in astronomy, especially if they are majoring in astronomy or astrophysics. You definitely need some institutional astronomy knowledge for this class to make any sense, it is not an intro\/beginner course. But if you like small class sizes, and a professor at the front of their field, this one is for you."
