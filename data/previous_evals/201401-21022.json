   "comments": [
    "The coolest part about this class is Professor Safille's encyclopedic knowledge about history, religion, literature, art, and theater. You'll end up learning so much more than just the language. Professor Safille is energetic and earnest. She'll do anything to help you, but occasionally her intensity can be overwhelming to some because she is very insistent that every student put in their best effort, and. Not an easy language class, but totally worth the effort if you're serious about learning.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot in this class. Prof. Safille explains grammar points exceptionally well.",
    "Span 145 is definitely worth it, as you'll learn a lot of Spanish and get 2 credits without commensurate work. The hardest part is getting into the routine of being in class 2 hours a day. Profesora Safille is the most engaging and quirky professor, a lot of fun to learn from. She can be hard on students sometimes, which made some people feel anxious about making mistakes. However, as long as you're confident, you'll be fine.",
