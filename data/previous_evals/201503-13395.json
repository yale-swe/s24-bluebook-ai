    "Take it if youre MechE",
    "As a MechE, you have to take the class, but I wouldn't be too worried. I had heard it was exceptionally difficult so was pretty anxious, but Thibault and Professor O'Hern worked together to make it easily doable. The exam policy is great as well and helps to relieve the pressure and stress throughout the semester. Make sure to go to both Thibault's TA sessions and any review session O'Hern offers. MATLAB assignments take deceptively long - start early.",
    "An interesting class, going more into the physics of mechanical systems. Unfortunately the class was very poorly organized. The referenced text books were not followed at all, and were not very useful for the class either. Some concepts were initially either poorly explained or not explained at all. The homeworks were impossible without attending the TF-session. One homework was so bad that Thibault literally had the entire problem set done in the TF-session so that pooling all the students together with some advice we could figure out what to do. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to finish a majority of the problem sets. Towards the end, we had two TF sessions every week, so we were meeting every day and had a total of 6 and half hours of class per week. However, the midterms and final were very well done. In class and in review sessions before them, Professor O'Hern made it very clear what we were expected to know how to do and worked with us so that we could all succeed. Midterm and final reviews featured the teacher's pet, Cinnamon; the best! (a dog)",
    "There's no way you're taking this class if it isn't required for your MechE major. So, just be prepared (if its O'Hern) to have to go to 2 2-hour review sessions most weeks that are essentially mandatory (there's no textbook to study with).",
    "Great course...this was my favorite MechE class. O'Hern is hilarious, and has a great sense of where the class is. He brings his dog and kids to review sessions, jokes around to wake you up when the class is falling asleep, and reviews for each exam the entire week leading up to it (you basically know the questions before you take the exam) Thibault's review sessions are crucial. Make sure they're during a time you can go to, since the class would be infinitely harder without them and they sometimes are used to teach extra material. 2 exams, optional final that can replace one of the exams if you're not satisfied with your grade at the end.",
    "Great class and professor. Very well done - a lot of fun with O'Hern and Thibault and learned a lot. Came in with no Matlab background but learned a lot on the spot. Material was presented well and review sessions were really helpful. Take it with O'Hern if you can.",
    "If you're in the major, you have to take it! Won't be your favorite class, but it's also no thermo.",
    "Only take this course if you absolutely must. It takes much more time than expected.",
    "Dynamics is a hard, hard class. The material is already dense in the first place, and O'Hern's style of lecture only makes that more difficult. There is no one textbook, so all you really have to go on are his notes, which tend to be just pages and pages of math without any explanation. The TA, Thibault Bertrand, is one of the greatest TAs I've ever had in my life. He is the reason I passed this class. His evening sessions are ESSENTIAL to doing well in the course--do not miss them. O'Hern's shortcomings are very well balanced by Thibault, and they combined make one excellent professor. That said, I found the material incredibly interesting, but I'm a huge fan of physics, and not many are. Like most other engineering core classes, this is a struggle, but is has to get done, so grin and bear it, take it very very seriously, and you will be fine.",
    "This class was very challenging - especially the homework which focused on more advanced material that wasn't tested on. You must make the TA sessions where extra material was taught for the homework. There are also out of class sessions that are important to make for the tests. This class took up a lot of my time but was required for me to take. If you're interested in physics at the academia level I would recommend it.",
    "Thibault and O'Hern were great. Material was interesting. Great course as engineering lectures go.",
    "Dynamics with Professor O'Hern and Thibault is an excellent course. The course is structured to encourage learning (as opposed to memorization or too much stress about grades). The skills taught in this course (Runge-Kutta, Matlab, SolidWorks) will also tremendously useful in the future.",
    "You can not call yourself an ME major without taking this. Hats off to you if you want to take this outside the ME curriculum; you will get a profound (maybe a little overwhelming) understanding of things that are moving.",
    "If I could take this class for the rest of my life, I would.",
    "If you're here, you're ME and probably have to take this course. If you do get a choice, I'd advise against it. The material is not that interesting, and the course is pretty disorganized. O'Hern is an interesting guy nonetheless.",
    "I think dynamics was overall a good class. I surprised myself by how much I liked Corey. It's not particularly hard, especially if you go to the TA sessions. You also need a pretty good base in MatLab because you'll need it. If you did okay in the first semester of physics and can do math, you'll be gucci.",
    "One of those classes that get tossed from professor to professor in the major. Corey does a good job, and I hear that Udo makes it a pretty easy class (though I can't stand him as a teacher).",
    "If you want to be an engineer, you have to take it."
