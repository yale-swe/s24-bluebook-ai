   "comments": [
    "I think that this course is designed very well with small class sizes and that the lessons are organized and clear.",
    "Liu Laoshi is amazing in the seminar-style setting, and the discussions were interesting. The strengths are the clarity and transparency of the course. I always knew exactly what to prepare for the next day. The only issue I found was the inconsistency in grading--sometimes what I wrote was not grammatically incorrect, but rather marked incorrect due to the grader's \"taste.\" I found that unfair because I didn't feel, as a student learning to write Chinese, that I should be penalized for something that I wasn't taught.",
    "I realise the teachers made an effort to increase student engagement especially by encouraging discussion and debate in Mandarin. However, I feel that more pressure on us to prepare and perform would be helpful in incentivizing my progress. Largely the student's fault.",
    "The course is very engaging; we often had discussions about issues that not only affected China, but were very applicable and relevant in the US as well. A daily quiz helped improve our character recognition and writing and the teachers were excellent and always there for help. No major improvements I see that could be made.",
    "You really get integrated into the course through the immense work load.",
    "Strengths: Liu laoshi's explanation of the vocabulary and grammar in class is superb. If there are any questions, students are able to ask for clarification. Extremely knowledgeable and helpful teacher. Weaknesses: after a while, the daily quizzes become an exercise where students learn the vocab very quickly and forget very quickly. The course should have students do more short writing activities, either in class or for homework.",
    "Every day homework and quizzes are weakness. Interesting units and topics discussed in class are strengths."

   "comments": [
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. The professors are amazing and although the class is a lot of work, it is definitely worth all the time. Because class sizes are small, you get a lot of individualized attention and it really does improve your Chinese language skills.",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you're interested in learning Chinese, now is the time to do it. After a semester, my Chinese improved in leaps and bounds.",
    "If you are a heritage learner of Chinese, why not? I think one of the best things of the course is that you can see the improvement in your writing and speaking, as well as reading, as long as you put in the necessary effort. The difference between the first essay you write and the last will be enormous if you have worked to the best of your ability in the course.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Sure, its an interesting class."
