    "Yes; it's not a stressful class by any means (especially since the class size is small and you would probably know the other members of the class well from studying Japanese in the past), but it does put pressure on you to learn the vocab and the kanji, so you come out feeling like you've gained a lot. The teachers are really kind and patient as well!"
