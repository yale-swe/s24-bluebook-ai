   "comments": [
    "Good for underclassmen interested in archaeology or anthropology more broadly, how the past relates to the present and our perceptions of cultures. Taught in a way to foster individual development of opinions without being too biased. Prof. Honeychurch is one of the most active, engaging lecturers I've had.",
    "Take this bloody class. Interesting readings, interesting materials, interesting labs, the perfect amount of workload and a faultless teacher. There were guest speakers, fun projects and excellent TFs from all around the world and with a wealth of experiences. Cannot rave enough about this course, absolutely no complaints.",
    "This is a really cool class if you're curious about archaeology or hoaxes (some of which you might even be buying into, misinformed!) or even just for a SO distributional credit. The workload is very light and the few assignments you have are really good, not busy-work at all. The course is thought provoking and really well put together. It is definitely worth taking. For me, it felt almost like a study break to come to class and hear about cool, weird things! Very low-pressure, very high-intrigue!",
    "I would recommend this class because the material is interesting, not too challenging and Honeychurch is a memorable instructor.",
    "honeychurch is inspiring - super engaging, hilarious, and kind. so happy that i took this class. the workload isnt too bad, but i will say that the midterm was a bit difficult (quite specific) and if you let your lab attendances go to the end of the semester it will be a time crunch.",
    "The course is fairly easy to do well in as long as you take the midterm and final seriously and either do the readings or show up in lecture. It is a very fun and worthwhile class.",
    "Great introduction to archaeology. The professor is super engaging, and the class was such a good time that I didn't even mind that it was on Friday afternoons.",
    "Great course. Certainly not a light workload- at least two labs, two substantial papers, midterm, final- but it's all really interesting to do. Professor Honeychurch is a fantastic lecturer who clearly cares about what he does, and it's really nice to see his enthusiasm for archaeology come out in every class. Know that the course isn't all hoaxes and myths but more an intro to archaeology, with the mysteries mixed in as a sort of counterexample to the way archaeology should be done. Definitely recommended.",
    "A very good introduction to real archaeology perfectly meshed with discussions of ridiculous pseudo-archaeology. I would recommend ARCG 172 to another student simply for well-taught it is as well as its abundance of knowledge bombs.",
    "ARCG 172 is a really fun class, just keep in mind that it isn't a total gut. You can get by pushing back the reading every now and then, but it does detract from the class experience, and you will need to be caught up for the midterm\/papers. Overall, this was a class that I looked forward to attending because it was laid back, interesting, and fun. There are also lab sections outside of class (you need to attend a minimum of two) that are really interesting for getting an introduction to different archaeological fields. Professor Honeychurch is also very nice and funny. I would definitely recommend this class if you need an extra credit and aren't sure what to take.",
    "An ideal 5th class, doesn't require a ton of work, but it's fun and you learn a lot of interesting information. It does require 2 8 page papers, though so be prepared to write a bit.",
    "Take this course if you are at all interested in archaeology, or if you just want a fun class! The workload was relatively light (2 relatively free-response research papers, two exams, and short+interesting weekly reading) and I feel like I learned a lot about the basics of archaeology. The class was extremely entertaining- Professor Honeychurch chooses great material and is an amazing (and somewhat eccentric) lecturer. I was never bored in this class, and I get bored very easily. The labs were also super fun- my favorite was a flint knapping lab where we got to make our own spears using paleolithic techniques. I highly recommend this class!"
