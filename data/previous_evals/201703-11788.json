    "A very fun and intellectually engaging course",
    "This course introduced some new and interesting ways of thinking and approaching composition beyond typical methods. Really enjoyed the incorporation of production methods and electronic tools. One-on-one lessons with the professor were extremely helpful and I got a ton out of these.",

   "comments": [
    "It was a captivating course. There was one writing assignment I didn't really feel prepared for. I had never really written a music review, and I felt like I wasn't given much direction to do so. However, all the other assignments were unique and felt like a natural progression for the course.",
    "I enjoyed the independent and house band assignments, as well as the concert review. I would appreciate clearer communications on opportunities to compose for ensembles outside of class. It would be helpful if the guest lectures were connected more directly to work assigned in class.",
    "This course is a huge improvement over the level I and II comp seminars, and felt much better organized. This course felt much more like an actual seminar, and there was much more freedom and room for exploration in the assignments. In terms of weaknesses, the course perhaps tried to fit too much into one semester, such that there was a need to reduce the amount covered.",
    "The individual lessons were amazing. I was not the biggest fan on a core curriculum focused around improvisation.",
    "Strengths Guest lecturers Weaknesses I wish there were more class analysis of pieces"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. The student learns about what music really is, and it's a fun time for all.",
    "Composition seminar is a fantastic opportunity to make music in whatever genre you work in!",
    "I would highly recommend this course, mainly for the chance to take one-on-one lessons with the composition professors. I got so much out of the weekly lessons, and definitely had a better experience in this class than in 312 or 313.",
    "Yes, its fun",
    "This course is great because it makes you think about music in ways you probably never have before, giving you a greater scope of understanding compositionally."
