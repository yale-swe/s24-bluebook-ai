   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this class to another student. The class is a broad and all-inclusive investigation into the forces that shape the American built environment. A major theme is the way in which invisible and intangible forces shape the built world around us. This class makes it fun just to look around at New Haven.",
    "ARCH 340 is an interesting class, though it can be slow at times. It is important to stay on top of the readings throughout the semester, and pick a research topic that is manageable early in the semester.",
    "This course was fantastic. ABSOLUTELY take it!! it's a very unique look at American landscape which blends history and architecture-- something you can't find so compellingly in any other course at Yale. I took it credit\/d\/fail, because I didn't need the credit for anything, but still went to every lecture and soaked in a lot because it was so interesting. I sort of regret not doing more of the reading (or...uh...any of it, thanks cr\/d\/f!), but I learned a huge amount from the class anyway and really really enjoyed my time there. Dolores Hayden basically created the field of landscape studies, and she gives information you can't get from any other class at Yale. When I went home for Thanksgiving I viewedall the towns and landscapes along the way differently, because of what I had learned in this class. Also, Madison Moore is a GREAT TA, try to get in his section if you can!",
    "If you just need a writing credit, don't take this class. It's painful.If you're considering taking this class because you think the material is interesting, just know that a few weeks into the lecture you'll feel like you're in a WGSS class. What you'll learn in this class is that you can take any topic in American history and relate it to women. And not only relate it to women, but also attribute its CREATION to women. Forget black people during the Civil Rights movement or the wave of immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, it's all. about. WOMEN.",
    "This is a course about the history and expansion of cities and urban environments. Touches politics, sociology, anthropology, and architecture. I would recommend this course to another student who understands that the course is not a cake walk by any means.",
    "Great overview of how America came to be the way it is. Lecture can sometimes get a little dry, and readings can be a bit repetitive. However, Dolores Hayden is a total sweetheart. Go to her office hours. Quite a bit of work--short paper, long research paper (15 pages), midterm, final, long readings. Worth it. Fun class overall.",
    "A summary of what legislation, social under currents, media, technology etc. has done over time to create the built form of the world we live in (suburbs, sprawl, farms, tenements, apartments, etc)",
    "It's a fine introduction to the forces that shape the American built environment and an interesting survey course especially if one is not very familiar with the topic. Certain components become repetitive if you have taken other courses similar in material (Study of the city?) It has a lot of tiny bits and pieces that count towards your final grade which keep you busy almost throughout the semester",
    "Good for people interested in studying American history through the changes in the built environment. Relevant for Architecture, American Studies, Urban Studies, WGSS.",
    "YES! If you want to get a better understanding of the way in which Americans live the way they do, and the process in which to get there, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Definitely take it - great class, and manageable",
    "I found this class fascinating, but you might not. If you are interested in urban studies or land use, I would take it. The class was essentially American history from the perspective of buildings and the land. The papers werechallenging, but I'm glad to have done them. Professor Hayden is very knowledgeable and you will learn something interesting every class.",
    "Overall, a good survey course of American urban history. However, the lectures and reading material never really delve deeply into the course's \"cultural\" component, which can sometimes be frustrating and boring.",
    "If you've been wondering how we ended up with the cities, suburbs, roads, and shopping malls that make up most of America, this is the class for you. It's extremely well organized and taught, the readings are fascinating, and the papers are great opportunities to learn about your hometown. Once you take this class, it starts to pop up everywhere. You can't drive down the street or read the newspaper without seeing what you've learned in action. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in suburbia, urban studies, architecture, policy, or American history in general.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in knowing the background behind the places you see every day. It is helpful for an american studies, architecture, history, evst major, anything really.",
    "I'd say it's a fun class that also has the added bonus of giving a writing credit, but the class is worth it for the material alone.",
    "Yes, take this class. It's fun, interesting, and makes you think about what can be done to fix a lot of problems that currently plague America, such as classism and racism. I think it's a provocative topic that everyone should study.",
    "Yes, especially if you need a writing credit!",
    "A lot of the topics are interesting, some less so.",
    "I would recommend it but sometimes the lectures were a bit dry.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Do not take it for a writing credit. The only way it could possibly be tolerable is with a fantastic TF and if one were to take it Credit\/D. Do not take it for a writing credit.",
    "I would recommend this course for people looking to get some initial exposure to landscape studies.",
    "ACL is a chilled class. You do need to do some of the readings for section and pay attention in class as there is a lot of stuff that you need to know for the midterm. The final is a little less specific, which is good if you can just bring the knowledge that you have received from the whole semester. The final paper is rewarding if you put enough time and effort into it. I was not that impressed with the class on the whole though. I thought that Dolores Hayden was pretty boring and often very random in her examples of some of the issues covered in the course.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is an introduction to the study of the natural and built environments and how American culture shapes them. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone, no matter your major. The built environment is a lens to for any disciplines--politics, culture, environmental studies, sociology, etc. Hayden does an excellent job highlighting class, race, and gender elements in the landscape history.I now am beginning to understand the built world that is around me everyday--why it is there and what it means for American society and culture. The class made me become very interested in how we will shape the American landscape in the future, and how we can avoid the pasts' mistakes, use some of the successful strategies.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes teaches you about all of the features of the physical realm that you never really thought to question. How did shopping malls come about? Why are big box stores financially viable? What is the deal with Coney Island?It was definitely worth taking as a lecture class and a manageable amount of work, though start planning early for the big research paper. I found that the readings were worthwhile and almost all of them were online, which meant minimal textbook purchasing! This was a good follow-up to Study of the City (and would probably be a good pre-cursor, too).",
    "This class is a great overview of the American built environment and its development. The material covered relates to many areas of study: social history, economics, architecture, design. You'll never look at the American landscape the same way again. It will make you rethink development, home-building and what it means to be a resident, traveler and consumer in the United States.",
    "Focuses on women and minorities in the context of cities and suburbs in the United States of America. Take it if you are incredibly interested in all subject matter, don't if you are not.",
    "It's a great class no matter what your major. It's not too difficult if you don't mind the writing and the readings were usually very interesting. I would definitely recommend it for those interested in Urban Planning or for the American Studies or Architecture majors.",
    "Absolutely. For anyone in any major.",
    "Take it if you need an easy-ish writing credit."
