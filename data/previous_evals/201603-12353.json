    "I developed research skills, how to conduct an interview, how to ask for an interview, how to harvest information from that interview for a piece, how to write a 50 page essay, and a lot about food security in New Haven.",
    "My writing skills improved in this course more than in any other! I learned to really consider my argument, and to choose each word carefully.",
    "Writing my thesis was an incredible learning experience. I needed to compile information from a range of sources, including foreign newspapers, books, professional manuals, etc. My advisor provided helpful guidance with developing a research question and making sure I was tackling a broad topic from the right direction."

    "I really like how the senior essay is set up for EPE. I so appreciate that you get to choose your own advisors and that the major does not require a hard copy submission!!! I do think I got lucky, though, because Professor Freedman was so willing to help me on my project. He guided me in the right direction and was there to help every step of the way, and I'm sure my experience would have been very different had I had any other advisor.",
    "Having a later essay submission deadline would be helpful!",
    "I enjoyed the opportunity to embark on an independent study. Both my thesis advisor and Beth were very involved and always willing to discuss research, outlines, and ideas. The strength of this course was that it gave me freedom to explore a question of interest while my advisor gave me more specific direction and vetted my ideas."

   "comments": [
    "I obviously do not know much about writing a senior thesis in the context of a seminar, but I certainly liked writing it independently. It allowed me to only focus on my topic and get real hands-on guidance from my advisor. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I think the one semester thesis was the perfect timeframe. Instead of dragging it out for a year, I focused for a semester. Also, this class is entirely dependent on your thesis advisor.",
    "Definitely! It is a great chance to explore a topic that isn't covered by any other EPE courses or courses at Yale. If you find the right advisor it's a really good learning experience as well."
