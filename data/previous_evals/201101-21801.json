    "So you're thinking to yourself, \"Ugh, Spanish. I should take something romantic and interesting and sexy. Aha, Italian!\"And here's where I'll stop you. NO NO NO. The Italian language is a pain to learn, L2 grading is surprisingly tough, and your classmates will be fluent in another language and just want to \"dabble.\" If you just want to finish your requirements, RUN AWAY FROM THE ITALIAN DEPARTMENT. Also, Italians are also not nearly as sexy as you might think.If you were stupid enough to start L1 and need L2 for credit, remember: start compositions EARLY, don't kid yourself on the butt load of grammar you need to learn, and remember vocab is only 10% on tests.",
    "Sure, I mean you have to take it to get credit for 110.",
    "Yes! So much fun.",
    "L2 is less stressful than L1, but sometimes it's more difficult to do well on the tests because so much of class time is spent on culture rather than grammar.",
    "As a continuation of Italian 110, there's not a whole lot of surprises in 120. Kenise was really great however, very helpful, and I recommend her whole heartedly."
