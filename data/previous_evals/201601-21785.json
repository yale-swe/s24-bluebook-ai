    "I would recommend it if you're pretty comfortable and confident with your french abilities because you have to actually read French literature by the classics. The class can be a little boring and long at times, but most of the readings are actually pretty engaging. Not my favorite class, but a good one to take to keep up your french and improve your French reading abilities.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone who is interested in french literature. You don't have to be a major!",
    "This is a great L5 class, and totally accessible to a freshman (even if you're kind of rusty) who places into it. The workload is not bad (intermittent weekly paragraph reading responses, two essays, a presentation, and an oral final), the authors are interesting and diverse, and Prof. Sanjabi is truly wonderful and kind.",
    "This class provides a very good overview of French literature from the Middle ages all the way through the 20th century. Mme. Sanjabi is really nice and a dedicated professor and leads interesting discussions (you will have to participate in this class so do not take it if you are not comfortable speaking). The workload is also very manageable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class.",
