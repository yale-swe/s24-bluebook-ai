   "comments": [
    "I would think of this class as an extension to intermediate micro with a focus on technology and innovation.",
    "I learned a ton about modeling developing industries and the back-and-forth between competing companies. A great balance of mathematical modeling and real-life examples.",
    "This course was an insightful look at the feasibility and effectiveness of innovation in an economic context.",
    "This class was a great way to apply the skills learned in intermediate micro to a specific field of study (innovation and intellectual property economics, mainly). I learned a tremendous amount about technology and how economic models apply to the decisions that firms take to maximize their profits.",
    "The course covered a wide array of issues pertaining to the patent market. We investigated licensing, Cournot competition, mergers, litigation and a host of other issues. The class was very consistently and cohesively themed.",
    "I enjoyed being able to apply the economic models in class to understanding real-life situations that involve technology, patents, and innovation. I felt that my problem-solving skills were overall enhanced as well!",
    "This class teaches students a lot about how intellectual property works, how firms decide when to innovate and the benefits of doing so, and and the market effects of mergers and acquisitions. You get very comfortable doing style profit maximizations, which actually apply to a lot of cool problems that you don't get to see in micro.",
    "I learn a lot about innovation and the processes that brings it to the markets. Also a lot of first order conditions.",
    "ECON 414 build on Intermediate Micro. I learned how to solve various games and feel much more comfortable analyzing market structures.",
    "Learned some simple models relating to different types of monopolies and competition.",
    "I learned a lot about how technology works in accordance with economic theory.",
    "This course opened my eyes to IP rights and the models surrounding it. I previously knew nothing about technological developments and how they were legally handled, and this course was a great introduction for that.",
    "A good overview of the economics behind patents, copyrights and competition. A nice case study is done to apply this to the real world.",
    "Basically lots of micro stuff",
    "Economic Models of New Technology not only strengthened my mathematical and model building skills, it also gave me a profound understanding of the many ways in which innovation affects market structure and vice versa. The ability to distill complex industrial and economic circumstances in succinct mathematical relationships will remain invaluable for the rest of my career.",
    "Economic Models of New Technology is very similar to intermediate macro, just applied to new technological innovations. You will learn how these innovations affect supply and demand from consumers and producers.",
    "The course covered many topics in innovation, such as the instruments that companies and innovators can use to protect their inventions, how the market accommodates entry of innovators, etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really can't think of any weaknesses. This course is a ton of fun, Professor Chalioti is the best. The grading is fair -- there are six problem sets (you get to drop one), attendance, student presentations, a midterm, and a final.",
    "Strong all around in showing us new material, forcing us to practice it, and then allowing us to show off our knowledge on the exams.",
    "Professor Chalioti is probably the single greatest strength for this class. She is a treasure of the Yale economics department and is one of the best teachers that I have ever had. No real weaknesses come to mind.",
    "Strengths: a strong overview of various topics pertaining to economic models, using models at every step. Weakness: Not enough generalized mathematical theories.",
    "Professor Chalioti is very structured in her presentations, and is also very helpful during her office hours! I really liked how the problem sets were ways to practice the information taught in class. The class was very well organized and I also really appreciated how the professor walked through the math\/problems during class. The only aspect I think the class could improve on would be to include more challenging problems perhaps on the problem sets that went beyond just practicing what was taught in class.",
    "It was perfect.",
    "Strengths: Cool, relevant topics clearly presented; excellent professor Weaknesses: I thought exams were fair, but I don't think students would complain if they were given more time to complete them.",
    "Not a lot of weaknesses generally. Ava is an amazing professor and the problems are very challenging.",
    "Great course! I cant really think of any weak points. Professor Chalioti is super clear, very caring, thoughtful and knowledgeable. She always came prepared for lectures and explained the material in an easy to understand manner. Readings and problem sets are meaningful and helpful in learning the material. Case studies were a lot of fun!",
    "The strength of this course is Eva Chalioti. She is an awesome professor who was one of the few I have had at Yale that genuinely seemed to care about her students. The information is interesting and engaging as well.",
    "I think the material is interesting and the way its taught allows you to connect the models we learn in class to real world examples. I do think that the class suffered though from going a little bit too slow and skirting some of the complexities of those real world issues as identified.",
    "The course is great; you learn a lot and it has a very manageable workload",
    "This course was excellent. It had only strengths and did not suffer from any weaknesses. First, the material was extremely well structured. Lecture slides and exercises were coherent and easy to follow. Further, Professor Chalioti's teaching managed to cut through complex economic and mathematical theories with ease. Her explanations were easy to follow and the plenty of examples she added made any remaining misunderstandings disappear fully. The exams were more than fair and so were the problem sets. Finally, the opportunity to give a presentation in class--and engage with the material on an applied case-study, real-world level, was invaluable.",
    "Evangelica is a great professor. She was amazing for both intermediate micro and this course. She makes the course great for her enthusiasm. If you are looking for a senior seminar that is similar in workload to intermediate micro, this is the class to take. Psets can be long but are manageable. Tests are very similar to the psets.",
    "The group presentations were fun and low stress, the topics were really interesting and the case studies gave some perspective by showing how the things we learned applied in the real world. The problem sets were easy and followed the lectures very well, and the exams were a bit rushed but fair, so was the grading."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes 100% take it. This is a gem in the econ senior lectures.",
    "I would recommend. Clear communication of what was expected, the problem set material was all slightly more complex versions of what we learned in class, and the exams had no surprises.",
    "Yes, Eva is a great professor and brings in many relevant real world case studies that make the course very interesting.",
    "If you are a senior economics major, you should do everything you can to get into this class! Professor Chalioti is fantastic professor who will make your senior fall memorable with this class. The workload is not too bad and it gives you a great chance to think about real economic issues.",
    "Take it. You will find the case studies and models and examples fairly engaging, and even if you hope for more mathematics this is a good starting point.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course! I thought Professor Chalioti was amazing - very straightforward and willing to help her students with any questions.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Absolutely! Eva is fantastic, you learn about relevant topics including the business models of important companies like Google and Facebook, and the workload is fairly light (6 psets, midterm, final, and short, fun presentation).",
    "Yes, this is an amazing class that covers interesting material and Professor Chalioti is one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "This is an econ seminar so i would only recommend to an econ major that was somehow interested in innovation and not afraid of taking first order conditions",
    "Take it with Professor Chalioti!",
    "Good senior lecture for Econ majors. Very low workload and exams were easy (Say on a scale of 1-10 Intermediate Micro is a 6 then this would be a 3)",
    "Yes! Take this as an advanced Econ course. The workload was manageable and in the end, it is worth it just to take it with Chalioti.",
    "High recommend! Eva is one of the best professors Ive had at Yale; shes super sweet and genuinely cares about her students. The information in this class was both relevant and interesting. Workload is not bad either (6 psets). Class is kind of like applying micro to modeling intellectual property rights.",
    "Yes. As far as a senior seminar is concerned, I think you learn a good deal without an overbearing amount of work.",
    "Very good course for understanding the modern environment surrounding technology enterprises. Models are relatively simple and easy to understand in the context of real-life applications.",
    "A very good senior seminar for econ majors. Highly recommend!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning the economic models behind various aspects within the technology world including patents, licensing, etc. These models are then taken to real life examples of tech companies.",
    "It's basically a micro class with tech stuff thrown in. Very low workload (6 psets that can be algebra intensive, but are conceptually pretty easy and usually just follow from the slides; the midterm and final are pretty much just like the homework. Psets usually took like an hour or two max). Some of the models are pretty cool--though if you're interested in entrepreneurship and tech, you probably know the high level ideas behind the content already. The class basically just shows you how to model things like innovation and VC investment and patent races mathematically.",
    "This is an excellent, must-take course for anyone interested in the relationship between industry organization and innovation. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone even remotely considering taking it. If you have take Intermediate Microeconomics with Professor Chalioti, you will remember her charming and academically excellent teaching style. Do yourself a favor and enjoy microeconomics tackling interesting and innovative issues--and the opportunity of being taught by Professor Chalioti twice a week.",
    "Great class for a senior seminar if you like math and micro applications. Eva is the best!",
    "Professor Chalioti is the nicest and makes the course fun and easy to understand. The problem sets are easy, the group presentations are interesting and the exams not hard as long as you study for them. Really good senior econ lecture to take! Would definitely recommend."
