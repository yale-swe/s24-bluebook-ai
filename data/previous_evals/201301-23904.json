    "I would definitely recommend the course; in summary I would say it is a look through thebasic Black-Scholes model with a fairly formal mathematical treatment augmented by a consideration of issues in data analysis also arising from modern, interesting, legitimate mathematical considerations, but that the student should expect to have to seek out Paolo outside class as well in order to take advantage of everything the chance to work with him offers.",
    "This course has the potential to be an engaging and useful course for mathematicians, programmers, and economists alike, but unfortunately it was completely disorganized. I don't think anyone in the class figured out what was going on because the syllabus was completely thrown out after a few weeks, and we just talked about random topics that half the people didn't care about. However, I do understand that this course was not taught before, and I hope that a more down-to-earth class will be offered in the future.",
    "I would recommend it to math people who have interests in finance. The reason is the contents are really very practical and you can do a project that incorporates mathematical derivations and programming - sounds like a good choice for people with both capabilities.",
    "Only if you are mathematically prepared.",
    "Can be recommended. A lot of distinct interesting topics in one broader context with a project under helpful supervision."
