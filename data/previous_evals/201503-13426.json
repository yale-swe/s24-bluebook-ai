   "comments": [
    "If you do all of the reading, you're golden. It's a really interesting experience with a very fun professor, but as long as you do the homework (and it's really not too much), you'll enjoy the relaxed pace of the class, but still leave feeling like you've learned a ton.",
    "A really great class with an incredible syllabus and an excellent professor.",
    "A really interesting take on aspects of culture and dissidence in Early Modern Spain. Prof. Jordan is a gem and so cool and so smart and nice. She wasn't down for kids to spew garbage and would cut off unproductive threads of conversation and set us back on the right track. Each week in the class covered something different - medicine and mysticism, Catalonian and Portuguese independence - and made it a great part of my week. Not an easy class - the final research paper was a big slog - but she made it easier for sure.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class especially to students who have an interest in Spain, Early Modern history, or social\/cultural history. If you're looking for a history class and have no interest in this time period, you might look for something with broader appeal.",
    "This is an excellent seminar with interesting readings and a great professor. Professor Jordan is amazing, and one of the most caring professors you will have. Her enthusiasm is contagious, and her wealth of knowledge on the subject helps to stimulate the discussions. There are a lot of readings (as with most history seminars), but they are well chosen and the primary sources are especially insightful. Definitely take this course if you can!",
    "This is a good course to take if you feel you are interested in learning about this specific time period. The class covers many different topics, all of which are quite interesting. Professor Jordan is great and will be willing to help you.",
    "If you have any interest in Spanish history, take this class. While it is very specific, you will gain a good understanding of Spain throughout that time period, and it touches on so many different topics that are relevant to other areas of study. It isn't too much work, but that may just be that it was rather enjoyable to do. I felt like it was a great class for non-history majors, so don't feel intimidated by it. Make sure to do the readings since they are rather interesting and don't wait on writing your final paper. Overall, it was a fantastic course that was taught very well.",
    "Sure, I liked the readings and the professor. Honestly, the same class with a different mix of students would have been much more engaging"
