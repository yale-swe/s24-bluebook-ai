   "comments": [
    "Would recommend, especially for students who are considering doing social science research of their own for final papers\/senior projects.",
    "It's a pretty gutty class. Gives you some interesting things to think about.",
    "Cause& Effect research methods is a good intro to causal inference. Would be worth taking even it wasn't a req.",
    "Interesting class - wasn't my favorite personally, but if you want to get into how to construct and gauge causality with research models, its great !",
    "I was hoping that this course would teach how to USE different research methods; instead, it stopped at teaching how to RECOGNIZE different methods. If you're ok with that, go ahead and take it.",
    "I would recommend this class, keeping in mind the following strengths and weaknesses.Strengths: This is a very good survey course if you want to learn more about the different kinds of research methods for political science study. The TA, Malte, is very approachable and knowledgeable. Professor Dunning is too-you just need to find time to visit him and Malte before you do write out your final research design project. The project is fun and manageable, but again, remember to have the TA or the professor clarify what their expectations, and specifically in regard to your topic, before you create your final product. We also learned a few useful skills for R, which had its hardships that I will describe below.Weaknesses: The one week of homework that was done for R was difficult if you didn't have any kind of statistical programming background. The mid-term was difficult to finish and covered a lot of material, although the curve was pretty generous and Professor Dunning provided very useful sample test question beforehand (study those questions!!!). The research design feedback we received wasn't very helpful; you would have to go directly to Malte, the TA, to get a better idea how to improve upon it.",
    "A great course into the world of experimental designs and a very useful course for students interesting in designing their own experiments in the social sciences. Anyone interested in designing their own experiments for research projects should definitely check out this course. The professor is a leading scholar in the field of research design. Very interesting lecturer.",
    "Take if you want a pretty basic intro to political science methodology. Dunning is a great lecturer and really cool guy. Every political science major should know the stuff in this class, so take it if you don't already!",
    "The course focuses on the conceptual aspects of research design rather than quantitative analysis. It provides a good overview of what makes a research design robust and the process of developing a topic into a relevant research question and in turn an effective experiment. However, it was frustrating not to be able to put this conceptual framework to practice in terms of quantitative analysis. Note that the course covers R, which was annoyingly dry and random...Would not have taken this course if I didn't need it for Global Affairs...",
    "The class has a lot of potential. I would recommend it to someone who is planning on doing research. Professor Dunning is also a very good academic to know.",
    "This class was very theoretical. You spend a few weeks learning R but other than that you do not learn much about doing actual data analysis. The material wasinteresting at times but the workload is pretty uneven throughout the semester. The assignments on R took a lot of time and the midterm was not very fair in my opinion.",
    "For the research design requirement, this is a pretty straightforward and simple class. The concepts are valuable and Professor Dunning is good at explaining them. I thought the workload was manageable, especially since there is an early timeline for turning in research paper proposals.",
    "This course provided a very useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of research design in the social sciences. I definitely feel that this course would be more useful to those who already have a solid basis in a particular field of political science on which they could build a research question or experimental design--it makes the research proposal component more productive. The course was designed very well--Prof. Dunning made particularly excellent slides. Prof. Dunning seemed to know everything there was to know in the field, and so delivered thorough, effective lectures on different aspects of experimental design. He askedgreat questions, really engaging the class, in my opinion. A great teacher. I would highly recommend it to someone ready to move from theory to practice in political science.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to Global Affairs students---maybe Poly Sci students could get more out of it, but unless you are extremely interested in the subject and already have a background in research, I don't think you will come out of this class with much knowledge gained.",
    "I would recommend this to any student interested in gaining an introduction into research methodology. It is not too difficult, it is practical, and you learn a lot of important and applicable things.",
    "I would recommend the course for students who wish to pursue graduate studies in Political Science."
