    "If you enjoy literature or Brazil culture, definitely take this course. Also if you're looking for a writing credit, this class helps improve your writing and the workload isn't too heavy. However, if you don't do the readings (three or four stories per class), class will get boring.",
    "Pelin was great. She was always willing to help and go above and beyond the call of duty.",
    "The class is basically reading and discussing Brazilian short stories. It's interesting and not too much work. I would reccommend it!",
    "Fairly straightforward literature course. Readings were quality over quantity, which I definitely appreciated. The papers are not bad at all for a WR class, since you get a lot of freedom over your topics. Section makes up a large part of the course, so be sure to shop smart and be attentive to the other folks in the course. The readings are good and all, but a lot of the experience will ultimately depend on your classmates."
