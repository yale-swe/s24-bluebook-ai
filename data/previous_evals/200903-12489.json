   "comments": [
    "Yes - the workload isn't too bad and Prof. Thachil's a great professor who knows how to lead a remarkable class discussion (seriously, some of the best that you can ask for), constructed a pretty comprehensive syllabus, and keeps a sense of humor about him as well.",
    "Amazing class. Not too much work although reading load may get a little heavy. Professor Thachil is an amazing professor.",
    "The information is a little dispersed and there are a lot of ideas and concepts thrown around without much unity. However, I learned a great deal and would certainly suggest taking it.",
    "Great class. Professor Thachil leads very engaging discussions. I am often bored during hour and fifty minute classes (too long to pay attention), but this class usually flew by. Do the reading because it makes class discussion way better. The readings are generally interesting and the ones that aren't can be skimmed. The workload is really manageable.",
    "Take it! If you're up for a challenge-- it's not too intense; well worth it.",
    "This class covers the political economic development of India and Pakistan. It provides a great perspective to understand Modern India and the quest for development in South Asia.",
    "Great class! Take it if you're interested in the region at all or even development in general.",
    "Yes! Great, great class!",
    "If you are interested in South Asian politics or general international development, this is the best class to take. You will come out with much greater understanding of South Asia and with much honed skills in analyzing the issues pertaining to international development.",
    "Great class if you are interested in development or talking about India. Don't take this course if you want to talk about cultural stuff etc. That really is a minor detail. By development, they mean development. Most of the class discusses issues with the World Bank, microfinance, etc. ProfessorThatchil expects well thought out answers and responses- so be prepared to not just give general comments but really explain yourself. In my opinion, there is also a good chunk of reading.",
    "Great class. TAKE IT. Professor Thachil is fantastic! He is one of the best professors I have had at Yale and I am a senior, so I've gone through a fair share of them by now. He is very passionate about what he teaches and is knowledgeable, an excellent discussion leader and very helpful. He also really cares about his students and will go out of his way to help you. He is young and this was his first time teaching at Yale - I imagine he will only get better with time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for any poly sci majors or anyone simply interested in South Asia."
