As someone interested in pursuing an Econ PhD, I thought this class was super helpful both in terms of teaching you a way of thinking and teaching technical skills."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the curriculum and the professor are the strengths. I liked how we got homework that forced us to both actually understand the techniques we learned and helped us learn Fortran. Weaknesses: I kind of wished that there was more feedback on problem sets, such as a posted solution program so that we can observe if there was a more efficient way to program our solution, or if we actually solved the problems correctly. I thought the beginning of the class was organized really well, but kind of became less organized towards the end, and I also wished we had spent a little more time on some of the techniques learned in the latter part of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to you if you are actually interested in economics and learning more technical skills. If you're just looking for one last class to fill in the major, this class probably isn't for you. I thought this class was a really good combination of learning technical skills and synthesizing what we've learned from previous economics classes into more advanced models and ideas. This class gives you more the more you put into it."
