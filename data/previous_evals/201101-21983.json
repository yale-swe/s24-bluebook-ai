   "comments": [
    "Yes. Don't be scared of the final paper -- it's as hard as you want it to be.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for seriously interested students. Don't sign up casually, though. It's a class one does a lot of work for and must pay attention to. It is, however, very rewarding.",
    "TAKE IT! It's awesome.",
    "Yes. If you get in, take it. Amazing reading list, great assignments, true intellectual experience.",
    "This course, unlike many history courses, will make you focus on writing and prose to a pretty considerable degree. Gaddis is very interested in the way biography is told and the perspectives you take, and his emphasis is on making you a better writer and approaching your subject from a very broad, conceptual level of \"how do I tell this story?\". I am very glad that I took this course and got to engage with the final paper, which was a lot of work but a very valuable writing experience. Take this class if you get in! Gaddis is also a wonderful, kind, and interesting professor to work with over the course of the semester, and you will benefit from his comments and your discussions with him.",
    "This was a really great class with a thoroughly prepared and insightful professor and a very well-chosen reading list. Previous reviews have likened this seminar to a book club, and that's pretty accurate. But it also really made me think about what constitutes a good biography and certainly changed my approach to writing, at least when it comes to assignments on which I have anyfreedom to write more creatively. The discussions varied from week to week in terms of how much students contributed--Gaddis always had plenty of his own insights to share, and though I'm perfectly fine letting an expert professor impart his wisdom, I know some people don't like professors who talk a lot or lecture in seminar and those people wouldn't like Gaddis's style as much. The writing assignments were the highlight of the course for me, though, especially the ending biography assignment. Writing biography is like writing a history paper and a novel at the same time, and Gaddis gives you plenty of room to experiment with style as long as it meets the basic criterion he sets out, which is that it's interesting to read. It sucks up a lot of time and a lot of pages, but it may be the most fulfilling paper I've written at Yale. Definitely take the class.",
    "Take it. Amazing professor, interesting reading, and the opportunity to do original research on a person you are obsessed with \/ fascinated by. A class worth fighting for.",
    "Absolutely. If you are willing to put in some time to reading each week take this class.",
    "prof gaddis' wonderful book club. do what it takes to get in, and you'd be crazy if you didn't follow up on the offer. its a great opportunity to dig into whatever subject you want, read some original letters and journals, and work with material that few people have seen before. if you're ambitious, you can produce something really unique and powerful, something with a great narrative voice and with the freedom to write in a style that few other hist junior seminars empower you to. perhaps the best seminar i've taken at yale, certainly on par with kagan's greek history seminars.",
    "HIST 215J involves reading one biography per week, discussing it in class, writing an autobiography, and writing a biography of another person for the final project. Overall, the class is great -- Professor Gaddis is an amazing discussion leader and all of the books are great, so you actually want to read them. I would definitely recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in biography or history -- it will change the way you think about history on a micro and macro level."
