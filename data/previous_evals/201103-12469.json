   "comments": [
    "Good class, definitely worth looking into if you're not good at math. Some of the material is complicated, but after a while it begins to make sense. Standard midterm, final, and weekly homework layout. Problem set were never impossible to do, but were sometimes a little difficult.",
    "Do not take this class if you are trying to fulfill a QR. Take a more interesting class. Trust me! I made the mistake!",
    "If you need a QR and don't want to have to do too much work, take this class. Just don't expect it to be really easy.",
    "A math class that goes over a lot of different types of math [except Calculus]and how it could possibly relate to the real world.I would recommend it if Lachowska's teaching. She's good. The math is doable and sometimes fun.",
    "Pretty low level math if you don't feel comfortable taking any of the Calculus classes. I wouldn't recommend it because I would have preferred to just take Math 112 for a QR credit rather than having problems learning in this class.",
    "Do not take this class unless you are willing to put in hours of extra time each week to attend office hours or visit the college math tutor. The course is interesting, but the topics often seem random. Test consistently feature problems on methods that were never discussed in class.",
    "If you at all have problems with Math, this is most probably the most painless way to get through your QR requirement. Yes, it has its challenges, and 90% of the grade is based on the two midterms and final, but the material is generally interesting and workload manageable, and I feel like I was able to attempt most of it eventually and that, at the end of the course, I am a bit more confident with numbers and that I have actually learnt something useful in the real world. Professor Lachowska is lovely, and is more than willing to help you outside of class, which helped me hugely. Overall, the best QR at Yale for anyone scared of numbers, and probably the most genuinely useful.",
    "The teaching was awful - people who already knew the stuff in the class got 100% on the tests, those who didn't got more like 50%. The professor raced through the examples and seemed to panic more the more she realized people didn't understand, and would finally just tell us to look at the handout which was similarly difficult to understand.Much of the grading was arbitrary (she handed out final exam grade additions for students who happened to be holding a puzzle long enough to solve it) and and much of the content of the midterm and final was unexpected.Only take this class if you already know a lot of math, and are looking for an easy credit. If you expect to learn useful math, take a different QR.",
    "No, because the material is not very clear.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student. The class covers some fun topics. The occasional videos are funny as well.",
    "Yes. Easy QR. Not a pushover, but easy."
