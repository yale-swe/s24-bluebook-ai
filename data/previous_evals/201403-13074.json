    "No, do not take it, unless you need a no-work seminar for the Econ major. Otherwise, it really isn't worth it. There are so many other amazing, engaging classes. Grades aren't everything and b\/c we got no feedback about anything throughout the semester, none of us have any clue as to how we are doing even. PASS.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is very interesting and the professor obviously cares a lot about the course. The math may be a little tough at times, but you don't need to understand all of it to do well.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone looking for a relaxed senior seminar.",
    "NIce econ seminar, just individual presentations, and a final paper. Content is difficult but dont need to understand too much to get by",
    "Very straightforward class...you get out what you put in",
    "Definitely recommend, one of the best senior Econ seminars. I learned a lot and can now intelligently talk about auction mechanisms.",
    "Would highly recommend",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. It was a very manageable Econ seminar.",
    "This is certainly in the running for best econ senior seminar. You shouldn't take it if you're not comfortable with upper level math. The topic is very relevant to many areas outside of the theoretical nature of the class. Professor Deb is fantastic and really cares about the topic and the students.",
    "Interesting material, light coursework",
    "Yes, I recommend Auctions and Bidding to senior economics majors, especially if you like game theory. Auctions are really relevant to a lot of different business fields, but other than that auctions are just fun to learn about. The workload is not too high (a presentation and a final paper): no problem sets and no exams! The main thing I liked about this class was that I actually felt like I widened my horizons within economics; I explored a new branch of econ that I didn't realize was so robust!"
