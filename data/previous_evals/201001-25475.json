   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. It seems that it covers more advanced topics than the lecture course for intro macro but if you are interested in econ, you're going to have to learn them anyways. Get your natural log skills ready.",
    "I would. Definitely take the seminar with sigga over the lcture. It is not any harder, and class is much more enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend it if it is necessary for your major. It's better than the alternative, but a lot of work and can be quite difficult.",
    "Despite all of its flaws, Econ 111 is probably still the best intro macro class at Yale, which really isn't saying much.",
    "Sigga is very knowledgeable about economics, however I found her exams difficult because they often didn't relate to our problem sets. Problem sets came right from the lectures, but then the midterms and final were completely different. She didn't even give us a practice final exam. (Although that probably wouldn't have helped anyway because the real midterms were nothing like the practice midterms.) Sometimes lectures could be confusing but it helps if you do the readings. Overall though, this class is a way better alternative to Econ 116. If you are definitely going to take intro macro, take Econ 111 with Sigga.",
    "I would not recommend it. Despite being a seminar it is still taught like a lecture and all you get out of it is a harsher curve.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend the macroecon seminar to another student. It was so stressful and not well-taught at all. The fact that we had problem sets every week resulted in frantic scrambling to finish the work the night before they were do, usually without actually learning the material. I literally had to teach everything to myself before the tests, because lecture was completely useless in teaching the material. Take the lecture, because this course was not good.",
    "It teaches you the basics of how an economy functions on an overall scale. Not too much math beyond algebra and very basic calculus. Definitely take this class if you ever want to talk about the economic side of political decisions (health care reform, etc) and know what you're talking about.",
    "Monetary and Fiscal policy; very important matters but can be confusing.",
    "You learn a lot. Much of it, apparently, is irrelevant compared to modern Economic models, but it will teach you to think about politics, markets, and decisions in a totally different way. It is extremely useful to anyone thinking about being a political science or history student. But it will be a struggle. The tests are MUCH harder than the problem sets. Lecture is pretty useless, but the book and the power points are helpful.",
    "The seminar is a nice experience, but if you want easier grading, then definitely take the lecture based economics class.",
    "I didn't really get that much out of class itself, so I might recommend the lecture.",
    "The material in Econ 111 is incredibly interesting, but Sigga does not necessarily present it in the best way. She teaches off of Powerpoint slides and goes through the slideincredibly quickly. Although she was willing to meet with you outside of class, very little of the material was digested during class and most of my learning took place outside of class. The tests did not reflect the lecture material\/problem sets as well as it should have, and the class was surprisingly quantitative (especially for a SO distributional requirement). Although the seminar was disappointing, I'm not sure if it is worse than the lecture, which has a reputation for being incredibly, incredibly boring.",
    "Yes I will certaintly recommend this course to a fellow student."
