   "comments": [
    "231 is certainly more of an adventure than 230 was. The class itself gets more fun since everyone is closer and I swear Giulio grows a little crazier. That said, the material is more abstract, the problem sets are harder, and you don't get much sleep.",
    "Math 231 is everything a Math course should be. The content is challenging and stimulating, yet never too far out of reach. You will come to appreciate the intricacies behind so many mathematical results that you probably already use or take for granted, such as the fundamental theorem of calculus, the cross product, the determinant, and the Jacobian. I did not regret taking Math 231, and, if you are at all interested in Mathematics, I am sure that you will not either.",
    "Significantly more work than the first semester, several problem sets were hard, exams were easy.",
    "If you did well in 230, you'll do well in 231. However, if you're not a genius who can play Dark Souls 3 until sunrise on the morning of the final, you'll need to put a fair amount of work in. It's just about worth it for the satisfaction you get when you hand in a problem set or actually finish a question on a midterm. And the friendships you forge in the heat of Giulio's gaze will pull you through, to where you'll emerge as a fully fledged, if a little disheveled, mathling. The material is more coherent than 230, and the proof format should now be more familiar to you. It will open lots of doors and might even be your favorite class. Take it. Math 231 Class of (2^2)(2^3^2-2^3)",
    "If you can handle it, take this course. It's better than 230, and if you survived 230 you basically have to take this. The problem sets get more interesting along with the material.",
    "This is a tough course conceptually, but Giulio is great and you'll end up getting a lot out of it if you put in the effort.",
    "A continuation of Math 230 (though the coursework was a little bit harder, and the class went incredibly quickly over differential forms in the final two weeks of term). Take it if you love math!",
    "I would only recommend Math 230\/231 if you are interested in going into math. I'm interested in going into theoretical physics so I'm close, but it is not a sequence to be trifled with. Certainly don't take it without 230. It is a fun course but psets take between 6 and 12 hours and are usually assigned within 5 days of being due",
    "This is a very challenging math course, but good introduction for proofs.",
    "Math 231 is the logical next step from 230 and it is definitely a great part 2. Yes, it is tough but well worth it because it finished off linear algebra with determinants and it brings all the greatness of integration into vector calculus. Giulio missed a few lectures and the substitute lecturers weren't the greatest and got us a little bit behind. This was discouraging, however, the class was really great once that was taken into account. If you have taken 230 and liked it, then take 231.",
    "Take it if you took 230. It gets better",
    "I would highly recommend MATH 231 to any student interested in a pure math major. You've probably already taken 230 if you're considering 231, and while 231 is slightly harder, it's not unmanageably so. 230\/231 may not be the best for applied math majors, as it does get highly theoretical, but if you think you're interested in learning advanced pure math then 231 should be a good test of that.",
    "Math 231 is even more challenging than Math 230, and it covers quite a bit. As soon as you think you've conquered all post-230, 231 comes along and proves you wrong. However, it's very rewarding, and the connections to physics at the end are quite cool! The topics all feel much more connected to one another than in 230.",
    "This class is WAY more than just multivariable calculus and linear algebra. You will learn to approach math from a very in-depth, theoretical point of view, and cover lots of really advanced topics here and there.",
    "With only two classes per week, 231 has the notable problem that if you, like most of us, use the night before for your problem set, you'll only be fully awake for one class of 231 per week. Over time this can be detrimental to your learning. The problem sets continue to be incredibly hard. They might even get harder. The exams are definitely harder than first term's.",
    "Math 231 was a rigorous and oftentimes challenging class, but I found it deeply rewarding. It is definitely not a class you should take if you do not have a genuine interest in pure mathematics (as opposed to applied mathematics). If you are looking for a way to become introduced to more abstract mathematics and mathematical proof-writing -- and are willing to put in the effort needed to do well in the class -- then I would wholeheartedly recommend Math 230\/231.",
    "Taking this course is a lot like taking a shit - it can be rather strenuous while you're doing it, but it's totally worth the amazing feeling you get afterwards. The psets will take over your life, but you'll be weirdly happy about that. As for the lectures, the course moves extraordinarily fast at times, which means that little details are often glossed over. It can be really hard to find time to go over your notes on your own and digest all those details - especially when you're already spending 15+ hours on the psets every week - but it's really rewarding if you do. (If you don't, you'll probably still do okay in the class because Giulio went to Harvard and he's totally in on the grade-inflation thing...but you'll get a lot more out of the class if you do what I'm recommending.) Whatever you do, don't let Olivia Scharfman convince you that Giulio is a bad professor. You have limited time at Yale to learn from the Italian God of Math, so don't waste it.",
    "In structure, 231 is the same as 230. You will learn a ton and by the end tie all the year's material together. The course was run much more haphazardly than in the fall, and the last couple of weeks were extremely rushed. The spring material is less abstract--a background in physics would have been very helpful at times--but basically all that is needed is a solid grasp of everything from 230 and 231 as you go through it.",
    "I'd totally recommend this class! MATH 231 is a lot harder than MATH 230 (esp if you've taken a basic analysis course before) since this is all new material. Make sure you allot enough time in your schedule to complete the psets, because you can't just do them in one sitting like you might have done in MATH 230. And of course, Guilio continues being awesome.",
    "MATH 230 gives students the basic introduction to all higher math - injectivity and surjectivity, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, etc; and 231 is the actual linear algebra and vector calculus - Jordan canonical forms, differential forms, integrability, and the like. By all means, if you've taken 230, take 231. You get the full bragging rights, and you probably have to take it for a co-requisite anyway. It's harder than 230, period. But do it.",
    "If you took MATH 230, take take MATH 231."
