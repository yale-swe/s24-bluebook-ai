   "comments": [
    "Wonderful. Marvelous. Unmatchable.",
    "Yes highly recommend. You learn alot and its fun.",
    "Take it if you want to do architecture major, or you just want to know a little bit about American architecture. No previous knowledge needed.",
    "YES definitely recommended.You can really take it wherever you want to also, especially with the final project. Some people are into historical analysis, some people build models, some people do sketches, etc",
    "An overview of American architecture in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A couple of fun field trips, great guest lectures...I would recommend it. It was a fun, interesting class with a relatively small workload (two papers and a final paper, with various readings). A bit disorganized, but that kind of made it more fun.",
    "This is a fantastic class. You don't have to love architecture to like this class. It makes a lot of really interesting connections between architecture, philosophy and American history and society. There are a lot of interesting guest speakers and best of all you get to get out of the classroom and walk around New Haven and even go on trips. We went to Philadelphia, it was great.Words of warning, there is A LOT of reading. You can definitely get by in the course without doing it all but the more you do the more interesting the course is.",
    "This was a fabulous course! It really makes you have a better appreciation for architecture. Turner was fabulous. His lectures were informative and relevant. His enthusiasm permiated the entire class. And, his vivid speech makes the buildings come to life. He was incredibly approachable, helpful and understanding. The class was truly about learning rather than testing. There was a lot of assigned reading, which was interesting to read but not critical to the class. You could easily do well without opening a single book. The three assignments were more than reasonable (two short papers and a longer research paper or a model).",
    "It is a good, small class with a focused subject matter. The lectures are interesting and unique, and although the course is a brief overview of American architecture the class never seemed boring or too broad. I would recommend it to another student!",
    "This course is an intensive study of the origins of \"American\" architecture - it is an introduction to architecture in relation to poetry and art. It is an amazing course for the interested. I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in architecture and is willing to become an archtecture major - it is a great introduction, it really opens your eyes to everything around you starting from the tiny shack to the skyscraper.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone even with a passing interest in architecture. I learned a lot from class and it was very low stress.",
    "It's a great class, not too much work, the readings--if you have time--are very worthwhile.",
    "If you are at all interested in architecture, I would definitely take this class. It was my favorite class of the year."
