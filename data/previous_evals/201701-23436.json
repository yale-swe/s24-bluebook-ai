   "comments": [
    "The course is very theoretical, in which the theory of forming policies is explored and the process is thought about. I think this was challenging for me because much of the readings were theoretical in scope so understanding and digesting them were rather time consuming. The general layout of the course made theoretical sense but in practice wasn't as powerful as it could have been. The prohibition assignment was painful. The group assignment, which was not optimal in practice, allowed us to learn a lot and really drove the theoretical points home. Much of the class was Mark talking, which he is brilliant and I enjoyed listening to him and his thought process, but the class really didn't participate as they should have.",
    "The strengths are that the class changes the way you think about health policy and working as a health policy professional. The weakness is that you don't realize this change in thought process until the very end of the semester so for the first half the class feels up in the clouds.",
    "the class this semester was too big for the format of the class, so if there was a way to split up the class into two sections i would recommend that. it would be nice if the final project was something that felt more than just another assignment, like it could actually mean something for someone. i would recommend that instead of the other two projects being mostly unrelated to the final project that they instead help build the final project by being components to it.",
    "Professor is very nice but not practical or applied or not. Has no real value when applying for jobs",
    "Interesting concepts and important for health policy. Sometimes the concepts would get quite abstract and could be difficult to engage with as the last class of the day.",
    "This course should contain a section on how to do literature review. I didn't learn anything in this course. I would have paid money to not take this course.",
    "This course teaches you about a variety of methods to develop and implement policy. It was extremely useful and practical and provided both theoretical and practical approaches to policy-making. One of my only critiques of the course is that it may have been more useful to teach students how to translate some of the theoretical lessons into practical policy-making and writing. I think a greater focus on how to make your policy writing more effective would be a very useful addition to this course.",
    "The course was interesting-- like a philosophy class. But, the classes didn't always seem like the most relevant to policy.",
    "More interesting reading"

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great professor. I wish there were more instances in which he could provide feedback through assignments because his feedback was critical but I learned SO much from it. He has a way of conveying his thoughts without being denigrating and as a professor it was refreshing to experience that.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is AMAZING! It's obvious how much he cares about the subjects and students. He's always willing to get coffee, offer career insight or to talk through ideas for the class projects. Mark is one of my favorite professors that I've ever had in YSPH or outside of it. He is everything that is wonderful about the health policy track professors- brilliant, generous with his time, and thought-provoking! Mark even amended one of the assignment options because students felt it didn't connect with our 2017 Administration reality to have an option that seemed more relatable and current. I was SO impressed by that.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0it will always be impressive to me how Dr. Schlesinger leads discussions and lectures to us without any notes or powerpoints. He is a very impressive discussion facilitator and gives great feedback of your work\/thoughts when you make the effort to meet with him.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Articulate instruction and skilled facilitator. Exhibits a wealth of knowledge about health policy and shares it in a manner that is accessible to students. Appreciate his humor and levity, particularly at 4pm on a Tuesday!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is excellent as always, gives great feedback and very nurturing.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I wish Mark were able to organize the course website an a semi-intuitive way or name files in a way that made it possible to find them. I wish assignment prompts were clearer (or at least shorter in length than the assignments they were prompting).",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor Schlesinger is brilliant, clear, and passionate. His lectures are very clear and well-structured and he always provides his own unique insight on the topic material. However, I think he could allow room for a bit more student discussion in class.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is awesome and passionate and intelligent and knowledgeable and such a great resource! He didn't always let students talk enough\/ finish their full thought or engage them enough but overall he is fantastic!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Funny guy",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great professor who really cares about his students. He pushes students to think deeply about each topic discussed during class and on papers."

   "comments": [
    "The capstone is a theoretical class that explores the multiple ways in which policy can be explored. I would recommend this course for students who want to go directly into making policy recommendations, but to those who want to work in government without being heavily involved in the policy field it is not a useful course.",
    "When it starts out, you're not really sure where it's going. But when it ends, you'll look back and realized you just climbed a mountain and can see across the health policy landscape with an amazing view.",
    "if you are a policy student, you have to take this course and it does offer something great lenses and perspective that will help you in your career. if you are not a policy student, i would say (for the sake of the policy department getting the most out of their culminating class) that you skip it because it was too big of class already for me when it was only policy department students.",
    "I will recommend.",
    "Important course for health policy field and presents concepts that are not available in any other classes.",
    "This is a required course to finish an MPH in health policy. Students who take it are in their final semester after having worked toward that degree for a year and a half. Every minute of this course makes it painfully evident that it faces no competition from other classes and no effort has gone in to making it desirable, useful, or engaging.",
    "It is required but generally I would. Some classes were really interesting and applicable but not all were",
    "Lots of abstract and conceptual stuff",
    "Consider other capstones if you're able to"
