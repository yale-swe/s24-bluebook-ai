   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. Not very interesting, case in point: entire lecture on Oprah. However, many will vehemently disagree with this assessment, as half the class loved every word that was said.",
    "I would recommend this class be taken Cr\/D\/Fail because the papers can be difficult and frustrating but it is definitely a class to take!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--throughout the course of the semester, you'll come to understand how almost anything in America (malls, True Blood, Oprah, polaroid cameras, Footloose) signifies religion. Professor Lofton is absolutely brilliant--her insights into religion in America are incredibly stimulating. If you can take any class with Professor Lofton, DO IT! The TFs were also really good, as was the reading list. The course really engages with religion in America as it's been construed and conveyed--through culture, politics, and institutions other than the official \"church.\" This is a great introduction to the field of religious studies.",
    "This isn't just an amazing course, but an amazing experience that's going to have a really important place in my memory. Professor Lofton is engaging and fun and really passionate about the subject. I found myself looking forward to Tuesday and Thursday mornings, just because of this lecture. Take note that the course isn't what people generally expect it to be--though you get the background information for all the religions discussed, it's not a concrete overview of the different religions in America. It talks a lot about how religion affects and manifests itself in pop culture. It's really fascinating--you talk about topics ranging from lynching after the Civil War, to the Church of Scientology, to Oprah. Some people were turned off by how malleable the course's definition of religion was, but a lot of Professor Lofton's arguments were really enlightening. If the subject at all interests you, at least shop this course. It's so exciting and I'm so happy that I took it. The workload seems intense (4 papers, and pretty lengthy readings that you actually have to know for the midterm), but most of the readings are actually interesting, and the papers are fairly short and simple. And it all pays off every time you go into lecture. Professor Lofton cares so much about the subject and it really shows. Take this class!!!",
    "Yes!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! It was an incredible experience. I learned so much not only about the history of American religion, but also about how to think critically and analyze the culture that we are all a part of. You will never see the world the same way again after taking this class.",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Lofton is amazing and her lectures are incredibly creative, yet still packed with information. The readings for the class are also awesome and by the end you really see how all readings build off one another. I actually loved going to section - I mean, c'mon - you get to talk about Oprah! Take it - you won't regret it.",
    "YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS! Even if you are not interested in religious studies at all, you will learn so much that is beneficial in every aspect of life.",
    "I would recommend it to something who's looking for something a little more interpretative than a traditional textbook class.",
    "Yes. The class has a strong thesis that it takes a while to reach. You may or may not agree with it, but it's intriguing either way.",
    "A survey class that is taught by the funniest professor at Yale. I would recommend it to anyone.My only warning: the lighthearted spirit of the lectures may lull you into a false sense of security about the course--you definitely need to do the readings, and grading isn't a walk through a bouncehouse.",
    "Religion in Modern America is an eclectic overview of the history of religion in America, focusing on particular manifestations of the zeitgeists of each era since the Civil War. In that sense, if you\u0092re at all related to how religion and culture reflect each other and evolve together, take this class!There are four papers of increasing length and complexity, with particular attention given to how to find and analyze a source document by itself and in dialogue with secondary sources. It\u0092s the most complete training for academic research work that I\u0092ve ever received. If you\u0092re considering any sort of humanities (or even social science) major, this would be a great introduction to that practice.TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This was an incredible class. I'd never taken a religious studies course, but now I'm sure I'll take many more in the future. The material is fascinating, and Professor Lofton is AWESOME. She's probably the best lecturer\/professor\/person I've known at Yale. Brilliant and engaging, every lecture was wonderful. Quite a few assignments but they're mostly interesting and short. The midterm's pretty standard, but the final was really creative. Absolutely recommend it.",
    "I woud not recommend this class to another student. It is too much work for not enough knowledge gained. I am not sure that I really learned that much useful stuff in this class.",
    "Religion in Modern America is a fun but challenging look at religion, mainly in 20th century America. I would recommend it to a fellow student, but also warn that this is not an easy class. Even though it is a lecture, there is quite a lot of work: 3-4 readings a week, 4 papers, a midterm and a final. The grading is not easy either: Professor Lofton does not hand out A's and A-'s; quite the opposite. If you are interested in the subject and willing to except that the grading is harsh, it is a fantastic class. Professor Lofton's lectures are a lot of fun and the time seems to fly by.",
    "Yes. It was one of the best classes I've taken. Professor Lofton is an incredible lecturer, not to mention really funny and down-to-earth. The readings were not hard to manage and totally transformative. Go to office hours!",
    "This is hands down the best course I have taken at Yale, and I am a senior. Kathryn Lofton treats every lecture as an art form, and uses the course to make a number of interesting claims about how we live now. I could say so much more, but you need to take this.",
    "A mind-blowing, mind-stretching course. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. It will make you a better student in terms of writing, arguing, thinking, processing, questioning...the hardest humanities course I've taken at Yale, but for all the right reasons. If you take it, you'll find yourself doing all the work you need to do to do well anyway because it will be so interesting.",
    "Take this class! You'll never take another like it.",
    "Yes, you will look at America and how we religion functions in it differently.",
    "Not a textbook summary of American religion, but an exciting look at the way religion has expressed itself in different venues of American life since the Civil War. The course starts a little scattered and fast, but gains cohesion as it goes along. By the end, you will leave with a strong argument to make about the shapes of modern American religion.",
    "A great introduction to American religion that will make you think about the role thy religion plays in your daily life. Prof. Lofton is an engaging and hilarious lecture and I recommend the class to anyone with an interest in history or religion. I wasn't particularly interested in religion and I still really enjoyed the class!",
    "One of the best ways to learn American history, and certainly unlike any other history class I've taken at Yale or elsewhere. Professor Lofton is such an exciting lecturer and brings in many different objects into the study of American religion that you might not necessarily expect (Oprah, shopping centers, the movie of Pocahontas). People sometimes rag on humanities classes for not teaching \"practical\" skills, but I actually found the methods of historical inquiry and argument used in this class to be very useful not just in an academic environment but also in every-day conversations with people. Definitely consider taking this class!",
    "American Studies 150 is an ok course. Readings are interesting, lectures are always entertaining, and the papers aren't bad at all. Though Professor Lofton is incredibly likeable and entertaining, I often came out of lecture completely confused. The definition of religion that we use is very loose; sometimes I felt that I could pick anything and argue that it was a \"religion.\"",
    "It's a class with amazing subject matter that also teaches you how to think.",
    "Great course about the roles of various religious traditions in American culture. The work is manageable if you keep up throughout the semester. Do the readings throughout--it's not too much week-to-week, but if you try to cram in all the readings before the midterm\/final, it'll be a lot to handle.The course has a lot of assignments, but they're all fairly short. A couple of short text analyses, a film analysis, and a text nomination--all between 3 and 5 pages, so not too bad and you get to write about a lot of really interesting stuff.Subjects include public Protestantism, imperialism\/missionaries, civil war religion, freethought, modernism, cold war religion, buddhism, american evangelicalism, Oprah, and the Matrix. Fascinating stuff.",
    "Yes",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. TAKE IT. This was a well-run, student-focused class. The most common failing, in my experience, of lectures at Yale is that they don't try to teach students to be better writers or thinkers, in addition to teaching them the class material. Religion in Modern America excelled at teaching us to write and think. I trusted both Professor Lofton and my TA to critique my work and to make it better. Professor Lofton's charisma and the fascinating material, of course, could have stood on their own and convinced me to take the class, but the attention I received was by far the best and most unusual part of the experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in religion and popular culture. Professor Lofton's lectures are always entertaining and very relevant. You have to be prepared to follow her quick lecture-style and not expect to record everything she says as her mind runs at about 50 mph. Sometimes it was difficult to grasp the larger picture, but the themes were always stimulating and section discussions intriguing. The assignmentsalso allow a great deal of freedom and were on the whole quite engaging. Professor Lofton is really funny and class was never a bore! Definitely shop this course if you like pop culture, history, and embrace your inner hipster.",
    "Eclectic, but in the end you get a good sense of religious history of america",
    "OK, everyone is probably going to rave about this class, but the deal is that Prof. Lofton is awesome, but if you don;t have a good grasp on american history you'll be lost. honestly, don;t be persuaded by your friends who love her. you might get nothing except a waste of time.",
    "Religion in Modern America is a great course. It gets you to think about a major part of American history\u0097its religious foundations\u0097that many courses don't cover. The course gave me a new perspectiveon American history and society, and it really brought together material from past courses on American history. I took this course as a non-major my senior year, and I loved it.Professor Lofton is an amazing lecturer and approaches the subject in a very academic yet thorough and interesting way. Despite writing many books on the topic in her free time, she is very approachable and very generous with her time; she'll give you all the help you need.",
    "DO NOT LEAVE YALE WITHOUT TAKING A CLASS FROM KATHRYN LOFTON. SHE IS A GOD.Professor Lofton invests in her work and students like no other professor I've encountered at Yale. Lofton possesses an ability to go beyond excellent teaching into a world in which is fully invested, impeccably present, and utterly engaged with her work that elevates her courses into the realm of the extraordinary. (Friends and I often joke that it's no wonder she's teaching religious studies -- her lectures have the same emotional ebbs and flows that an impassioned sermon might have.) Her lecture style is passionate and provocative, a scholastic exchange in which historical figures become alarmingly relevant to contemporary culture and historical narratives are interwoven delicately to tease out fascinating insights. She never goes to the place that I, the student, expect her to go--not with the reading material we engage in during class and certainly not in her exciting and unpredictable presentations of her academic work. She's got MAD CHARISMA and invites me, the student, to not only engage in the material and lectures--but to play an active, defining role in them.This class material is LOADED with good stuff that covers readings, music, film, and other media. She ties religion into all sorts of surprising cultural artifacts, people, and trends. If you have any interest in religious habits\/patterns, pop culture, or a professor who will rock your world, TAKE THIS CLASS. (I've talked it up enough at this point ... but it's literally one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. DO IT.)",
    "An overview of America's religious history through looking at selected movements that are indicative of their times -- lynching, Scientology, Oprah -- pretty eclectic subject matter that ideally coheres into a unified picture of the religious landscape. Definitely a good class to take Credit\/D if you think you might be interested, but don't want to commit to doing all the readings and putting a huge amount of effort into the four short (3-4 page) papers, etc.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Lofton is definitely one of the most dynamic lecturers at Yale. There are four short papers, a midterm, and a final which is kind of a lot of work, and the grading is pretty tough on the papers. BUT, it is totally worth it! This class is not an easy humanities credit and I ended up taking it Credit\/D which was a good idea, but I don't regret taking it even though I didn't get the distribution credit. The class offers a very interesting analysis of religion in modern America and after taking it, I definitely view the world differently. Throughout the course I was a little confused and don't feel bad if you are because everyone is. But by the end, the class comes full circle and Lofton's analysis of American religion will change your life.",
    "I didn't think I was particularly interested in religion before I took this class, but Professor Lofton is so amazing that I really think everyone will find something that captivated them. The grading was a little harder than one might expect for an ostensibly introductory class but Lofton really tries to give everyone opportunities to succeed. I really loved this class and I would recommend it to anyone interested in looking at American history through a lens they might not have considered before."
