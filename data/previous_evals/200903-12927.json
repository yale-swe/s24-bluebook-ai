   "comments": [
    "Do it. Do it. Do it. No matter what are your interest, do it. If you are a science person, DS will give you a context in which to explore the sciences. If you are a humanities or social sciences person... well, duh.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend all of DS to a fellow student. The lit section was great, because we had a semester to look at several great works with a teacher who clearly knew very much what he was talking about, and had a lot of great insights into the works, especially on The Aeneid. Professor Duval always linked the works we read to one another, and showed us how they built on each other, and this also helped bring the large scope of the class together as a whole.",
    "This is the DS class that was most similar to other classes I had taken in high school, mainly English classes. The material that we read was GREAT - my favorite were the Greek tragedians - and even if I didn't enjoy every single work, I'm glad that I read it and I understand why it was on the list.Like all DS classes, there was a lot of reading, but the lit reading was easier and wasn't as excessive as the reading for H&P, for example. I would definitely recommend DS lit, and it's the least intimidating of the three classes, since it requires skills that you've used before in analyzing literary works. Plus you get to read awesome stuff!",
    "I would recommend highly DS Literature, especially with Professor Duval. The texts are of course classics and with Professor Duval's expert analysis, wonderful enthusiasm and extensive paper comments it is impossible to go wrong.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who enjoys the Western canon, needs to brush up on his\/her writing skills, and\/or wants to have his or her study skills seriously challenged. Also, if he\u0092s teaching it, TRY TRY TRY to get Professor Duval. He\u0092s incredible.",
    "Take DS!!! It was an outstanding experience! Your homework is to read the classics of the western canon! If you are at all interestedin the humanities... take DS... The seminar style is excellent... and the papers get more and more manageable as the year progresses. Professor Duval was excellent... he gave great feedback on papers, was a fair grader, and always have interesting things to say. Moreover, he always led the classes in an interesting and dynamic way. Your experience in DS does depend on your section leader... so make sure to get a good one (and you can't go wrong with Duval)",
    "I'd summarize Directed Studies Literature as a survey of the landmark works of literature of the past. I would recommend Directed Studies with a strong caveat: if you think you would enjoy works like the Odyssey, the Aeneid, and the Divine Comedy, and want to discuss them in a small group setting with a very capable professor at the helm of the ship, and are not afraid of a fair bit of hard intellectual work (because, after comparing with friends, I do think there is a far easier first semester to be had than a DS one), then go for it. If any of these things strongly puts you off, then it is probably not worth it. Personally, I enjoyed it greatly -it was perhaps even my favorite of the three DS classes. But it isn't right for everyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Literature to another student. It is an excellent class: the material is fabulous and Professor Duval is great. In-class discussion is rich, and we're given a lot of freedom in essays to explore whatever topics we find compelling."
