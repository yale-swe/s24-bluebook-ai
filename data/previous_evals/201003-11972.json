   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if you think you're interested in the material. Some of the films are great, some are absolutely horrible. There's a surprisingly amount of work, and somehow the number of pages we were required to write kept creeping up throughout the course of the semester.",
    "Films about migration and curious situations in which immigrants get into, followed by seminar discussions about them. Papers can be tricky for someone that does not take papers easily but for prolific college writers, this should be very easy.",
    "yes prof syrimis is amazing learned so much in this class",
    "This class studies how different facets of the immigrant experience are portrayed through film. I would recommend this course, particularly if you are interested in immigration or integration issues. It's really interesting, and the films are good, though often hard to watch.",
    "Great class for someone with no film studies background. A great interdisciplinary approach of the cinematic traditions of Southern Europe, its peoples and diaspora.A lot of work but worth it.",
    "Good class, interesting readings\/movies and prof. Syrimis is a really good lecturer! (The workload is too overwhelming though)",
    "TAKE IT. If you have space in your schedule for a low-key, fun, WRITING CREDIT course, take it. It is cross-listed under so many things that not only will it give you a writing credit, it might even go toward your major. The movies you watch are fun and the professor is very good. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Personally I had a really good time in this class, the topics were the most fascinating. It's a writing credit so watch out for assignments every three weeks or so. I hope it also becomes more of a \"film studies\" class, with more film theory to supplement the migration theory. Professor Syrimis is a wonderful person, I think he's the professor that smiled the most out of all my professors this semester.",
    "I would say that you should absolutely take this class. Its a lot of writing, but if the topics interest you it will not feel like work. If you do take this course, try to do some of the readings. They really are interesting and you will need to cite them in your finally papers. This course will make you think about identity, nationalism, sexuality,and immigrants differently. Not to mention, professor Syrimis will make you a better writer. It is a small relaxed course that is interesting, so take it."
