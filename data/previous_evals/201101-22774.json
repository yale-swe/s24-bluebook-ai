   "comments": [
    "Second semester DS Philosophy is intellectually rewarding. If Stephen Darwall is teaching it, I'd highly recommend his section - his explanations are extremely clear and concise, and he is a professor of genuine intellect and warmth.",
    "Of course. DS is awesome.",
    "If you can get into Professor Darwall's section, you are incredibly lucky. Professor Darwall is a wonderful professor who is able to explain everything with remarkable clarity. He is excellent at illustrating the points of various philosophers by creating applicable examples from everyday life. The reading for the second semester of DS Philosophy is challenging at times but always rewarding. Do not miss an opportunity to take this class.",
    "I would recommend Philosophy to anyone who wants to become familiar with issues of justice, epistemology, morality and ethics. Though some of the material is difficult (e.g., Kant) I walked away from the course with a greater appreciation for philosophical thought and inquiry.",
    "Second semester of DS philosophy is much, much more interesting that the first semester. Writers are more diverse and cover different themes, managing to be in dialogue with each other. I felt that I understood much better the concepts and philosophies than in the previous semester. Darwall was dry and not engaging from time t time, but he's great at explaining material for students. Overall, I'm happy I was in his section.",
    "Absolutely. Taking into modern philosophy in a seminar format is great. Prof Darwall is a blessing of a teacher, and while classes often stray into tangents or focus on one topic at the sake of of others, you can always (and should!) go to office hours, which are fantastic.",
    "The best-organized of the three DS courses; the teachers are in sync and the lectures are reliably excellent. Don't hesitate to look for a teacher who fits you; if you're not confident about a section leader, find someone who works for you. It makes an enormous different who your section teacher is, whatever DS class you're talking about.",
    "Great course, with a really cohesive syllabus; Professor Darwall is a talented teacher and an extremely kind, approachable man. He runs section with an eye towards the important questions and problems, and always makes sure everyone has a chance to speak.",
    "Prof. Darwall is the nicest professor I've had. He's enthusiastic, funny, incredibly accessible - a complete pleasure to be around.He's also an tremendously accomplished philosopher and very good teacher. He's committed to letting class discussion flow naturally from topic to topic. This means that he will rarely keep discussion focused on a certain set of issues. The upside is that class is lively, as we move quickly to interesting issues. The downside is that I often would've liked to spend more time in the text and with the arguments - I felt class did not sufficiently illuminate many of the authors.",
    "It's a reading intensive course and the philosophies are a bit more difficult to understand than 1st semester (i.e. Kant) but it's definitely worth it to learn about the more modern philosophers. I would recommend this class but warn the students that it definitely isn't a walk in the park.",
    "It's a great introduction to philosophical texts BUT I'm not sure it's the best way to be introduced to philosophy. Having to decipher difficult texts is a less welcoming introduction than discussing points more clearly presented."
