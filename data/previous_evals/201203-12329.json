   "comments": [
    "I can't recommend this course enough: it teaches students to examine, understand, and appreciate the musical techniques that underpin all of the 19th century music we know and love. Professor Cohn's teaching abilities are superb and engaging. The depth and breadth of the course was appropriate and effective. Take this course!!",
    "This class is a very good way of viewing 19th century theory. It is difficult to cover a lot of music, so the primary focus is on piano music and small sections from symphonies. I would recommend this course because Rick Cohn is a great guy and a genius at not only understanding theory, but displaying it in a visual way (really cool). Make sure you like your class though, because if you don't class time will just get more and more annoying seeing as a lot of discussion is led by the students.",
    "I would highly recommend Music 304 to anyone who loves late 19th-century music. The harmony you will explore is similar to topics you may have discussed in music 211, but you will go into much greater depth. Also, the study of meter at the end is almost certainly something you probably have never studied as an analytical device.Be warned that the class is a ton of writing in that you have 6 short analytical papers and a final paper. The short papers are still a lot of work, because you must supplement them with diagrams, which can take forever to make if you are particular about them looking professional. Overall, though, the paper prompts are very interesting, and the act of writing these papers gets you to really study these great pieces, so in the end I found it rewarding.Cohn runs a very discussion-based class, and he rarely will lecture, so participation is key for making class enjoyable, and he is really a good seminar leader as he knows how to keep the discussion\/debate on-topic.",
    "This is a survey of 19th century music theory. It goes into harmonic and rhythmic studies that are perhaps more exotic than what we've been used to, especial in AP music theory, but the class is great and the things we learn are very applicable.",
    "Musi 304 is basically a survey of every note and rhythm from the 19th century that doesn't quite fit but sounds cool. And that's pretty neat.",
    "Decent class- will be made much better by having good students in your class, since Rick Cohn opens it up for so much discussion.",
    "I would definitely take this course (especially with Cohn) to fulfill the music major upper-level theory requirement. There are 6 papers and 3 compositions, but they are spaced out evenly enough that the work does not seem like too much.",
    "If you love Romantic music, take this course. Cohn rocks, and the material is fascinating and relevant. Just be ready to give it the time it needs.",
    "This is a very difficult, wonderful class. The ideas Professor Cohn introduces will give you an entirely new appreciation of this repertoire - both in terms of meter and harmony. Be ready to work for it, though - the writing for this class is fairly extensive: 6 short papers and a term paper, as well as some short composition assignments. Overall, though, I'm very happy to have taken this class.",
    "Definitely; the repertoire is beautiful as well as being interesting from a theoretical standpoint, and the material is important. There's also a lot here that I haven't encountered in other music theory courses, particularly in terms of meter, which is applicable to repertoire from before and after the 19th century. It was a fair amount of work, but due at regular intervals and usually enjoyable. There was a fair amount of focus here on writing about music, both in the assignments and to some extent within the class meetings, whichmight be a negative or a positive depending on your background. For someone who is not overly interested in the academic side of music, however, there's a lot to take away.",
    "The course gave me a solid working knowledge of several different tools one could use to study the structure and compositional techniques used in 19th century music, and the music we studied was great! Professor Cohn gives extremely clear and understandable explanations of fairly complicated concepts in music theory, and his assignments always helped solidify my understanding of the material and led to very fruitful explorations of the music. I would absolutely recommend this class, as long as you're willing to put the work in - you will get as much out of the class as you put in. Professor Cohn is an excellent seminar leader, writes interesting and clear prompts, and is eager to give feedback and extra help whenever you need. He is also brilliant, and you'll learn so much! It especially fun to learn neo-Riemannian theory (Tonnetz-stuff) from him, as he is one of the leading theorists in the field. How could you go wrong? You get to think and talk and write about great music."
