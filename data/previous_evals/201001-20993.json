   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it highly: it asks one of the \"biggest\" and most interesting questions facing historians of any period. The key problem with the class was that it asked such \"big\" questions--it was difficult to uncover a project that could be completed in a semester. In other words, it was hard to find that slightly-less-big questions underneath all the big questions.",
    "This is a great course with an interdisciplinary approach to an interesting subject, which should be relevant to historians and social scientists alike.Be aware that the majority of readings and discussions focus on economic and political history, and not divergence in a cultural or religious sense.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Its thematic and methodological concerns make it relevant to a wide range of students, not just specialists in early modern Britain.",
    "History 611 is a comparative course that examines various explanations for why Britain diverged (from the Continental model, from the world, from the Netherlands, from its own late medieval trajectory...) It focuses heavily on industrialization as a factor of divergence, but the explanations cover temporal ground from medieval to 19th century Britain; address comparisons with France, China, the Middle East, the Netherlands, and elsewhere; and touch on such topics as legal history, economic production and trade, political forms, popular politics, empire, and social structure. I would absolutely recommend this course to a student of Britain, a student of the Early Modern period, or someone interested in economic history or social theory."

   "comments": [
    "I found this class very helpful in understanding how to build a thesis around a solid research question. Whether or not it was possible to both identify an appropriate question and also do the necessary research in one semester is another questions.",
    "This course helped me decide on a topic for my thesis, and greatly increased my knowledge of early modern European history and politics.",
    "The course's most important contribution to my development was to introduce me to a number of major debates in the fields of British and economic history.",
    "This course was interdisciplinary, and so it helped me understand how different disciplines (mostly political science and history) address similar problems. It did, however, lend enormous insight into a question that is central to my own field of British history. I am more at home in this discipline as a result of this course, and I found divergence to be a useful frame for becoming familiar with the central debates in early modern British history in general. My research project followed directly from the questions posed in the course and from our readings and discussions, and it may become a piece of my dissertation."
