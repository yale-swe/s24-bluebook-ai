   "comments": [
    "My main concern was that the dense material in this class wasn't prefaced enough with discussion of the underlying stakes and motivations. The TA was essential for understanding the material in this class.",
    "This class is really really hard. The reading is hard and the assignments are hard. But it also really really good. Paul Franks gives incredible lectures and the syllabus is well structured. It's like a math class in the sense that if you start to fall behind it's almost impossible to catch up, but if you're able to stick with the rhythm of the class, you will get so much out of it. I can think of few classes in which you learn more than you do in this one. Also Paul Franks.",
    "Only take this if you're willing to really engage Kant and devote A LOT of time to it. It can quickly get away from you, and it's hard to recover. That being said, you will learn a lot about Kant, and about reading philosophy in general: Kant is one of the worst writers in the history of philosophy (though one of the most important), and if you can read him, you're off to a very good start. I would be wary of the TA-Professor relationship, though. If the two are out of sync, it will be difficult to know what to believe; this was a problem for our class.",
    "Good class. Paul Franks is great, Kant is important.",
    "Don't take this class. One of the worst decisions I've made at Yale. Poorly structured, mismanaged, and a difficult text to begin with (I'm a phil major).",
    "Take this course if you like Kant, or if you generally are interested in the history of philosophy, because Kant has a way of situating himself in the center of every major philosophical controversy.",
    "I'd recommend it for someone looking for a REALLY HARD philosophical challenge. This class is incredibly tough. It's an excellent class but you'll only enjoy it if you're inclined towards this sort of stuff."
