    "I learned the different ways to study language and how to better understand the nuances of language. This class taught me dedication, observation, and resolve.",
    "Over the course of the semester, I went from barely being able to navigate a Latin sentence to reading comfortably an entire book written in Latin. I developed, through the leadership and insight of both the instructor and the lab instructor how to approach complex sentence constructions and unpack dense phrases. Moreover, I learned a great deal about Roman history and culture through the course's close reading of the Res Gestae."

   "comments": [
    "The course incorporates many different aspects of Roman history, which can be applied to the learning of the Latin language in the class. This class does much to involve all the students and receive their impact in many different ways.",
    "The two parts of this course, examined independently - the first half being focussed on grammar and the second half being focussed on reading - work well. The first leg of the course solidified my grammar skills and introduced me to new constructions. The second leg of the course was a great opportunity to read actual Latin. However, the second half of the course often became dragged down by the grammar points of the first half. I understand the purpose of reinforcing grammar while reading a Latin text for the first time; the Res Gestae was the class's first piece of \"real\" Latin, and it's important to reinforce grammar points while navigating a new text. However, the repeated focus on naming and identifying the titles of specific grammar constructions detracted from the experience of reading a work in Latin for the first time. By the time we reached the Res Gestae, I felt comfortable translating (and translating correctly) paragraphs in Latin. However, despite this, I, and the class as a whole, would often become stuck on procuring the specific grammar term (i.e. \"relative clause of characteristic\" or \"ablative of time when\") to describe the specific components of the text. Once again, I understand fully the purpose of grammar review, especially at this early level. However, I found that to grill repeatedly students on specific grammatical terminology doesn't do much for the actual translation of a sentence or phrase. The answer isn't to rid the course of all grammar review. However, a greater focus should be placed on making sure sentences are translated correctly. Less focus can be placed on making sure students can correctly label constructions and know specific grammar terms."

    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is interesting, captivating, and challenging. This class incites a desire to learn Latin and know more about the background of the language and the history surrounding the culture and nuance of the Romans and the Latin language.",
    "This course is excellent for students looking to reinforce their Latin skills in preparation for reading complex texts in Latin. After taking this class, I feel comfortable approaching Latin in a way I hadn't felt upon entering the course. I would highly recommend this class."
