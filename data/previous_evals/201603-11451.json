   "comments": [
    "This was my first philosophy class at Yale, and I really enjoyed it. Readings are very interesting (though dense, so if you want to get enough out of the class you need to put in the time to understand them) and lectures were fascinating.",
    "I primarily benefited by being exposed to a lot of different philosophical writings, which I found valuable.",
    "This is the first philosophy i've ever taken, and as a senior, I would say that the course definitely challenged me to think and form my argument and really consider what I believe in and how I can use argument to support it. The course definitely strengthened my faith in my religion and I find it extremely rewarding.",
    "This course observes the main points of contention for a 3-O God as observed by the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian faiths. It does an excellent job of observing these points of contention through the eyes of multiple world renowned philosophers throughout the ages. The course allowed for an in depth study of philosophical thought and the essays prompts were well written to encourage and continue this in depth study of the authors.",
    "I gained a foundational understanding of the philosophy of religion (mostly western religion). I was also able to work on skills such as analyzing dense arguments and unpacking them in my own writing.",
    "I got a very solid base of understanding the essential arguments for and against religion. A very solid and thorough intro class.",
    "I became much more adept and analyzing and critiquing arguments thanks to the critical philosophical discussions that we had in sections, as well as the rigorous paper topics and thorough instructor feedback."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was well-structured, workload was fair, and TAs were very helpful. Overall, very glad that I took this course (note that I took it Credit\/D, but I still thought that the grading was quite fair.)",
    "I really enjoyed lectures, and section as well. I don't have much to offer in terms of suggestions--Professor Hare's pretty much got it down at this point, I think.",
    "Readings are super interesting, Professor John Hare is a great lecturer. I love the material very much.",
    "I really love the set up of the course. It observes nine main points of contention for a 3-O God as observed by the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian faiths. The philosophers are chosen to show the different sides of the arguments and the philosopher are all excellent as they are very distinguished. The professor is also absolutely incredible and makes the subject exciting and accessible to all of the students.",
    "It was a very engaging course that covered a wide range of topics while remaining cohesive. The only \"weakness\" per se would be that we weren't able to study in depth religions other than the Abrahamic faiths (mostly).",
    "Strengths: beautifully structured with very relevant essays and very engaging discussion sections. the lecture was very well done overall and I loved writing both essays. Having weeklyquestion sheets really helped me feel prepared for the final. Drop policy for quizzes made me very satisfied with my overall performance being representative of my work overall. Weaknesses: None come to mind. The class was very well executed. It's sad so few people took this class",
    "The lectures are very efficient and the perfect amount of time, but some more visual supporting materials would be helpful. Also, it would be interesting to read a more diverse canon of religious philosophers, as the course is heavily Christian-centric.",
    "The structure of lecture was disappointing and not particularly engaging. The material was interesting but its presentation in lecture was such that it might be a more efficient use of time to miss lecture altogether and just do the reading. Very limited engagement with both the professor and the TFs. Section, too, felt a formality-- something done 'just because' rather than for any substantive discussion of the material. The assessments in the course were intended almost entirely as 'reading checks,' testing only surface-level details about the texts rather than actual engagement with and application of the ideas discussed. The papers were the only opportunity to pursue any substantive engagement with the themes of the class.",
    "Slightly misleading that it's basically a class on philosophy only of Christianity, with a couple other readings thrown in for contrast. Otherwise it does a fine job of addressing in a thoughtful way many of the questions I had about religion."

   "comments": [
    "Recommended to anyone interested in any topic tangentially related to religion. Also, Professor Hare is a genius, and it is a privilege to listen to his lectures.",
    "Yep. Was exposed to a lot of different philosophical writings, which is valuable. Warning: big focus on concept of 3-O (omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent) God, which means not as much focus on non-Abrahamic traditions. But not entirely 3-O; definitely had some exposure to other ideas. Valuable for theists and non-theists alike.",
    "If you are interested in religion, definitely take the class, it will challenge you to think about the meaning of life, morality, suffering, and it will humble you greatly.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to absolutely anyone and everyone. It is excellent for anyone interested in philosophy and especially religion of any type. Professor Hare is absolutely amazing and makes the subject very accessible to all.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "TAKE IT! If you ever wondered about why religion has been set up the way it is take this class. The class systematically goes over all of the arguments for and against god with very little bias. The readings are small and the lecture is amazing. I loved the class. Essays are not too bad.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to any student contemplating the big questions of faith.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, as it significantly changed and influenced how I think about God and the universe.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who have an interest in philosophy of religion, but would add that it is perhaps more geared for students who are new to philosophy. Students with a philosophy background may feel a bit disappointed by the level of engagement with the material offered by the structure of the class.",
    "All Yale students who want to understand Western religion on an intellectual level should take this course. Addresses with charity and thoughtfulness all the natural questions people have about religion."
