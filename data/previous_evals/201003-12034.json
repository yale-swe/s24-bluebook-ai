    "Words cannot express how much I loved this class. Seriously. I always looked forward to going to class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and felt like my creative writing skills improved tremendously.Maria Jordan is absolutely WONDERFUL. She is funny, enthusiastic, and honestly cares about her students. Her grading and assignments are very fair and often pretty fun.I also enjoyed the fact that there were only 6 students in the class. We got to know each other pretty well, which produced a nice, laid-back atmosphere.I have taken 4 Spanish courses so far at Yale, and, though I enjoyed them all, this one was definitely my favorite. It was a privilege to be in this class, and I will definitely miss it a lot.",
    "You read stories and poetry, and then you write. Maria Jordan is so much fun, and she brings in music and other writings if that's what the class is interested in. My writing improved tremendously, and it wasn't a huge amount of work time-wise.",
    "Creative Writing was a great class to take if you are looking for an interesting, off the beaten track way to improve your Spanish. I would highly recommend it; the class is very engaging and it allows you to express yourself in a different way. Overall it was awesome.",
    "I highly recommend this class to any student interested in Spanish and in developing writing skills. Maria Jordan is also a lovely and caring professor who is always there to help and guide. It is a very low pressure class and you learn a lot.",
    "Without a doubt, I would highly recommend taking Spanish 227. Professor Jordan is a wonderful, kind person who is very approachable and enthusiastic about what she teaches. Some of the writing exercises we did were a bit elementary, but I really enjoyed the unit we did on short stories. The course load isn't too bad, and only a few of the readings we did were difficult. However, if you are looking for a really serious creative writing course, this may not be the course for you. If you are looking to try your hand at some creative writing pieces in Spanish\/ improve your writing and vocabulary, then I would advise you to take this course.",
    "Take this course, especially if you're interested in Spanish literature and writing stories and poems. The workload is more than manageable (just do everything on the syllabus) and have a great time. I'm going to miss this class next semester."
