    "If you are an undergrad and do not have a vast working knowledge of modern religious theorists, you probably will get lost some of the time. BUT! Even though you might feel like you are drowning in the readings and struggling with the difficulty of the material, by the end you do end up learning a whole lot about our modern world. It ends up being really relevant whether you are a believer or not. If you are willing to stand the grind, this course is definitely worth taking.",
    "This is the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. Do not take it. Enormous amount of boring work, unbearable discussions, pompous, rude, disrespectful teacher. I did not learn anything and couldn't wait for class to end. The first class might seem fun, exciting, and even interesting, but save yourself the pain (pass\/fail is just as bad).",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of reading and learn a lot! An excellent course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students, if they like reading works that employ a variety of methodologies and if they are willing to read 100-200 pages of sometimes rather dense reading per week. The more you put in, the more you'll get out.",
    "It's a fantastic course that examines, rigorously, through a historical and philosophical lens, the structures and traditions that undergird our modern, Western, lives, but which are not usually noticed or talked about explicitly. Secularism is *not* Atheism, as you will learn, but is rather a whole set of ideas and theories that ultimately cuts to the core of who we are. The workload is minimal and includes only the reading and comprehension of multiple fairly complicated texts, and then an extensive research essay. This is easily the best, most interesting class I've taken at Yale. Take it, take it, take it."
