    "In the beginning I spent 3-4 hours per week on the reading. Towards the second half of the semester, I couldn't keep this up so I spent about 2 hours. There's not a lot of the assignments in this class. There's 3 individual assignments in the beginning of the class which took me about 8-10 hours each. Then there are no graded assignments until the very end when you have a presentation and a long paper. The paper is 8-10 pages single spaced. I have already spent 3-4 full days on it and I am only 1\/2 way through.",
    "6-7 hours per week",
    "10+ hours per week",
    "The workload is front heavy, so I spent probably 8-12 hours a week the first month. Following this, the weekly readings and write took approx. 3-6 hours. I grossly underestimated the time needed for the final toolbox project.",

    "This course requires an adjustment period to writing about law and as someone who had never drafted case briefs before, the class was very time intensive at the onset. if you do all of the required readings, it is also very time intensive. That said, it is totally worth it. The toolbox project also requires way more time that you would expect--best to get started early and get feedback if you can."

   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent introduction to healthcare law. We covered all major issues in public health and gained both legal and empirical insights into those issues. The course could be improved through fewer readings.",
    "Strength: The range of legal tools presented in the class Weakness: Not enough time to cover each topic. Too many students in the end, final presentations were too short. :(",
    "Strengths: Shelley! (She is super sweet and passionate about teaching) Another strength- class is discussion based and thus is much more engaging than the typical class. Shelley also provides a lot of detail in her presentations and brings to her teaching a lot of real world experience. Weaknesses: Wasn't much time to review the material. I personally find it really helpful if the instructor stops every 3-4 weeks and reviews what we have learned. It consolidates the material in my mind. Another thing I found difficult- I thought Shelley often went through her slides too quickly. I plan to go through slides during break because I think they contain info that will be useful during my future career, so they are useful now. But the fact that Shelley flipped through the slides so quickly in class often made me feel overwhelmed.",
    "strengths: a breadth of topics in law is covered and applications to public health are always made improvement suggestions: I think the weekly reading assignments are unmanageable\/unsustainable given that YSPH students are typically taking 4 other classes and also working on research or something else at the same time. I think also the Gostin readings are best; Goodman was much more difficult to follow--so simply eliminating the Goodman readings would reduce the time spent doing the weekly readings substantially. Also, the small readings\/journal articles are very helpful, too. Finally, speaking for myself and other students who do not learn as much from participating always in class, not because I don't like participating or not because I don't know the material very well, I really think that 30% of the course grade should not depend on class participation. I think something like 10-20% is more reasonable.",
    "strengths- practical cases so we could see how the legal concepts are applied. weaknesses- I think we need more a legal 101 class. I don't know if our section actually got to do this. maybe have some Law student TAs to hold a few background TA sessions to get more familiar with the language and legal terms. it is a lot of content to go through. maybe organizing lectures or handouts a little more clearly. Key legal concepts. key legal cases\/jurisprudence and then case application or discussion. I don't think we ever met as groups for the discussions. so, may be that can be more explicit. or maybe we can review more cases and there can be groups of 3-4 that can present each case.",
    "I really liked this class and learned so MUCH! I still feel like a lot of things went over my head but in the end it was a really valuable addition to my public health education. I think something that could really help students would be to provide a sample or part of a sample for the final project...because I think understanding what exactly was expected was vague.",
    "Great professor, and the material was very interesting. Strengths: good classroom discussions, professor had vast professional experience to bring to class, and material was very interesting. Weaknesses: I felt that the professor sometimes had trouble directing the class in the proper direction. Furthermore, the sheer volume of readings deterred me from truly engaging in the material, particularly during busy weeks.",
    "Great course but I felt like I was still lost during lecture at the end of the semester. There was way too much reading and much of it was redundant.",
    "Excellent course. I wish there was even more on the basics of law.",
    "This course offered a really valuable perspective on public health by teaching the fundamentals of law. It's value, however, comes at the cost of a lot of time and learning a whole new \"language.\" Reading reflections were helpful for digesting the weekly reading, but the quantity was just too big (even after the professor cut it back). Improvements to this class could come from more targeted reading and from even smaller class sizes.",
    "Strengths: work was front loaded, which was miserable for that time, but really helped me understand the law material better for the rest of the semester. Learned a lot about how law works in this country, and different public health precedences that were set by the Supreme Court. Weaknesses: too much material, went too quickly.",
    "Overall a great course. I might consider assigning less reading each week - sometimes there was simply too much to digest. Writing more briefs might be a nice alternative to more reading.",
    "At the start of the semester there was a lot of jargon I did not fully understand. What you get out of it depends on how much you engage with the readings and ask questions when you don't understand. By the second half of the semester I felt like I was understanding not only the terms, but also the concepts inherent in public health law, but you have to be persistant.",
    "I absolutely loved this class despite the big workload--I learned an incredible amount of law and health I was not aware of prior to the class!",
    "This class offers a great assessment of how the law can be used to help advance public health and what obstacles advocates should be aware of. It is useful outside of the field as well, only adding to its value. The reading is heavy, and can sometimes be a little repetitive. One suggestion would be to reduce the reading load a bit by focusing on the most helpful and relevant articles and chapters as a means to more directly hone in on a topic. Long reading lists force students to spread their attention too thin. Sometimes it seemed a little like there were a number of readings that were considered for the class but instead of just picking one or two, all were used.",
    "This is definitely one of the best courses I've taken at YSPH. Strengths: 1. Professor Shelley Geballe. She's an incredible professor. I admire her for her work experience, her sensitivity to students' needs and strengths, her perspectives, and her genuine generosity and kindness. She really goes above and beyond. 2. Unique subject. As Prof. Geballe explained, she created this course because she realized it was an unmet need in our curriculum - and it really is. Much of the material was very new to me, but what I took away from the course has been relevant and practical. Weaknesses: 1. 2 hour course. There was a lot of material, and most of it was new for me, personally. I think it would've helped me process if the course was split into two session during the week.",
    "This class is a tremendous amount of reading, but I imagine it is good preparation for classes at the law school or later enrollment in law school.",
    "I learned so much in this class. It is structured so that you cover basic concepts in the beginning, and then work through different areas of health in the later weeks. This class definitely requires work and doing the readings, which are time consuming, but important to understanding the material. I liked that the majority of the written work besides the weekly reading reflections was in the beginning of the semester, because I didn't have much work for my other classes and was able to focus on this class. I enjoyed the toolbox final project because it was a topic that I was interested in. I definitely didn't do as much on it throughout the semester as I should have, and so I wish that there was a little more of the thinking about how a specific weekly topic could work with your project throughout the semester, or something such as submitting a draft of our table of ideas at a earlier deadline to get feedback.",
    "There's only so much one can learn during a two-hour, weekly class. Our limited time was well-utilized, and I have a strong understanding of our current legal framework, including the history of its progression. I appreciated that the class was divided into two sections to cater the vast interest in the course. However, as a policy student, I did feel at times that our discussions didn't go as far or in-depth as they could. HPM 514 was critical to my understanding of this course, and non-HPM students haven't necessarily had this background knowledge. A section devoted to non-HPM students, and another to HPM students might rectify this. However, I still learned a great deal from the course and am very happy I took it.",
    "Sometimes too much readings but very useful overall.",
    "A lot of material and difficult to keep up but I learned a lot. I definitely feel more prepared to work in public health having taken this class.",
    "I could not speak more highly of this class - fantastic course material, subject matter, and perspective on how legal tools can shape the public health landscape of the United States.",
    "Its a great class, which will give you a strong general grasp of health policy as it relates to law. Initially, I was a little frustrated by the fact that she stacks the assignments during the first few weeks of class, since it felt somewhat overwhelming. However, fighting your way through those assignments gives you a great foundation for the class going forward, and things also got significantly more relaxed after the first weeks.",
    "Great course, so important to understand legal structure of public health",
    "Very insightful and relevant course.",
    "Phenomenal course. Best course I've taken at YSPH -- would recommend to everyone. This should be a required course, but still seminar style!"

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an excellent professor with an incredible command of her subject. However, she could improve the course by allowing greater discussion in the class and making it less of a lecture.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0One of the best at Yale in my experience. Incredibly knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Strengths: Truly invested in her students and helping them get the most out of the class. Very thorough with material selections, lectures, and handouts. Areas for improvement: The class was too large to do this, but it would have been helpful to receive individual feedback on the reflections and early assignments before more assignments were submitted; in order to know where we could improve before the next assignment, beyond the general class feedback. I think a TA would be very beneficial for this course if it's going to continue to be a larger class.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is wonderful!!! She answers questions in the form of saddle stitched books, which is incredibly helpful!",

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is absolutely lovely. She is super knowledgeable, kind, and responsive. A true super woman, I am not sure how she manages to teach such a heavy course. YSPH please give Professor Geballe a TF or two the next time she teaches the course!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0passionate, wealth of knowledge.",

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Great professor.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0It's nice to have a professor that actually cares about her students and what they learn. Shelley for Dean!!!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is one of the best instructors I have ever had- in undergraduate and graduate. She is not only an expert in her field, she is genuine delight to learn from.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley was easily the most invested, caring professor I have ever had. She was determined to make sure that we were understanding the material on a deeper level, and was so dedicated to answering questions. Her career provides her with so much insight to share with the class, and I loved hearing about her work. I would take another class with her in a heartbeat.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Absolutely amazing. You won't find an instructor who cares more about her students or who works harder for her students. Although the material was dense and difficult, she was always (ALWAYS) willing to meet and talk things through. Take advantage of that. She wants to know you as more than just a face in her class; she wants to now you as a person. Only weakness was that she went through the material way too quickly, so it was hard to keep up.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Phenomenal. Incredibly knowledgeable, with a wealth of personal experience to pull from. Always responsive and considerate of students' needs.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is so incredibly smart, understanding, and really wants her students to learn and grow. She was always available to answer questions and I think it is evident how much she gives to her students just by the simple fact that she held two sections of the class so that our experiences could be better even if it meant more work for her.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is one of the most incredible instructors and human being I have encountered. She is such an expert in the field but still humble, kind hearted, and just a pleasure to be around. She truly adds to our community at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is easily one of the best and most accomplished professors at YSPH. Her knowledge of the law is unrivaled at the school and her extensive experience in public health is an invaluable resource in that context. On top of all of that, she is one of the kindest people at Yale and it was a real privilege to be in her class. Her feedback to student questions was thorough and helpful, and she is always happy to let the class teach itself by allowing students to share their own expertise.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0(see above)",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an excellent instructor whose professional insights were highly relevant to the material, and helped the participants grasp the consequences of public health law.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is so incredibly smart and so passionate. This class was the only course that I had that I never felt like I was checking the time to see when it was over, because the 2 hours would go by so fast. She balances lecture and answering questions with class discussion that allows us to practice with the concepts we've learned about, and really guides the class discussion in the best way. She has so much to share and yet balances it with allowing everyone in the class to voice their opinions and ask questions. She also puts in a lot of work into compiling materials and resources for us which I found very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Astounding professor. So intelligent, genuine, compassionate. She responded so well to student feedback, and presented material in clear, concise ways. I look forward to next semester with her.",

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0So smart and responsive to students.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is fantastic and without a doubt the best professor I've had at YSPH - you can tell how deeply she cares about this course, the material, and whether you are actually comprehending and taking away valuable information from the class. She is always willing to meet with students or provide helpful feedback and guidance, and I respect that so much. In addition to my interest in the material, her investment and support was an extra motivator to put in more effort into the class.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Wonderful professor, always very available to students!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Open to questions, kind, thoughtful feedbacks to students. I was very happy to have her as a teacher.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0A brilliant professor. Very clever and knowledgeable. Shelley is also very sensitive to students and makes a challenging course fun and purposeful.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is wonderful--super knowledgeable, patient as the class is learning about law and using legal terms for the first time, very helpful with feedback on assignments. I would recommend any class she is teaching because you will learn a ton just from hearing her talk. Her class was so refreshing."

    "Lots of work, but very worth it. Excellent class that may seem like a foreign language at first and with so much to absorb - but final project really helps to bring it all together.",
    "I would say definitely take it if you have the chance. It is more work than most YSPH courses so if you can take it during a lighter semester that would be ideal. But if you have to take it with 4 regular rigor YSPH classes it shouldn't be too hard to handle. You learn a lot but more importantly you get to know Shelley! I can say honestly say that I've never had a teacher who works so hard to get all her student's questions answered. I just wish I had more time to put into this class.",
    "This course is at the intersection of law and public health. Law is truly an upstream, social determinant of health--public health, a public good, seriously depends on the law that governs its existence. As such, I would highly recommend ALL public health students to take this course; I recommend all YSPH MPH students take this course (after making the course work required more manageable, perhaps). The course DOES require a lot more work than usual courses--in my many semesters in higher education, this course probably comes the closest to being something like organic chemistry--but it is all worth it.",
    "a lot of work but well worth it if you want to have a good foundation in legal principles in public health. start on final assignment early and keep a draft as you work through the course.",
    "The material covered is very important and necessary to understanding a really important piece of public health practice. The workload is a bit heavy, especially for reading, but I thought it was all worth it!",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "This was a very valuable course for gaining another perspective on many issues in public health. As a non-policy student, I really enjoyed learning about how law can affect the issues I care about and also was interested to hear about the issues my peers focus on as well. I would definitely recommend it to another student, although I would attach the disclaimer that it is a lot of work!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It covers all fields of public health, so you'll definitely find it pertinent to your field. You learn so much about how law works in this country and how many ways a document can be interpreted. You'll be taught by an amazing professor. No reason not to take it (though, be warned--HUGE workload).",
    "Highly recommend this course as a way to learn more about how the law can be used to influence the health of the public (not always for good!). Not a light course, so be prepared to do a ton of reading.",
    "Excellent!! Yes--it's just one of the most unique courses I have taken. Challenging but so worth it!",
    "This class is essential to all MPH students and not as intimidating as it may seem on its face. Shelley does a wonderful job of making all of the new terminology palatable and easily understood, and then really challenging students to apply it to public health issues. The work is front loaded in a way that is appreciated later in the semester when other classes are busy. A must take.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course for everyone!",
    "Regardless of the department that you are in, if you are interested in public health law\/policy or the context in which public health professionals work (either for a state\/local health department, at the federal level, or in some capacity in cooperation with them) then I highly recommend taking this class. It is a decent amount of work but I learned so much!",
    "Fantastic. Should be a required course for all HPM students.",
    "Excellent",
    "This course is difficult but will give you a very good understanding of what legal issues you might need to look for when working in any area of public health. Now I read news headlines about legal issues and public health with a totally new appreciation and understanding.",
    "If you have any interest whatsoever in the intersection between law and public health, TAKE THIS CLASS. Beware: it's not a walk in the park by any means, and it requires a lot of dedication and time, but it's 100% worth it.",
    "Be prepared to put a lot of work in, but its a great, worthwhile class that will give you a lot of valuable tools.",
    "It was overwhelming at first, but rewarding in the end.",
    "A great introduction to the importance of law and regulation to public health and public health efforts. Very enlightening and is very highly recommended.",
    "Fabulous introduction to the law and how it relates to health. If you are even remotely interested in the law or even if you are not, you will be after this course. Take it, take it, take it! You won't regret it."
