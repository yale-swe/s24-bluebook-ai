   "comments": [
    "Really does help with reading in spanish and literary analysis and understanding of culture",
    "Learned about cultural identity of people in Latin America with a strong focus on indigenous populations. Very interesting! Not very much work on grammar \/ language usage, but we do work on pronunciation and intonation because Professor Adorno has everybody read passages aloud individually every class.",
    "Learned about the relationship between Latin American countries and Spain, the meaning of independence, and definition of culture and identity.",
    "I learned so much about literature from all over Latin America in this class. Further, my speaking skills were greatly improved after taking this class because we had to read aloud everyday. This class gave me a new perspective into cultures from the Latin American world. It was a great class.",
    "We learnt a lot about a variety of Latin American cultures and in specific, about how their colonial history has shaped their culture today. The course begins with a lot of historical interpretations of culture, and ends with reading more modern writers (Cortzar, Marquez, etc). Besides the content, Prof. Adorno spends time going over some grammar and pronunciation rules, which help a lot!",
    "Culture in global and personal contexts, how to analyze a Spanish reading word for word, understanding of Latin American history",
    "General knowledge of Latin American cultures and improved Spanish skills",
    "My eyes were opened to the universal aspects of culture. Many cultures appear very distinct and niche, yet their underlying themes are applicable to nearly everyone.",
    "My Spanish improved a lot throughout the course. Not only vocabulary but the facility to use more \"academic\" but real world spanish.",
    "I got a lot of Spanish practice which was great since the last time I took any Spanish course was four years ago. This course is not too intensive in its usage of Spanish so don't let the L5 designation scare you. You improve a lot and Profesora Adorno is extremely supportive and cares about your development of understanding of Latin America and Spanish.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of varipus Central and South American countries as well as the different types of cultural exchange between groups. The focus of the course was more on the culture and history content, although we were supported to improve on our Spanish writing skills.",
    "I learned so much about Latin American cultures through authors from different regions, from the wars endured to the cultures of certain countries.",
    "An excellent insight into the cultures and histories of Cuba, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, and more, as well as extensive practice of the spanish language.",
    "Learned how to read more complicated literature in Spanish and write essays in Spanish",
    "My cultural knowledge of various Latin American cultures was expanded. I was also able to improve my Spanish writing skills.",
    "I improved my Spanish vocabulary and learned how to better read, comprehend, and analyze Spanish. I also learned a great amount about culture and all of its variations and nuances."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Adorno and the texts are both incredible. She's truly knowledgeable and the materials are truly interesting. It doesn't really push you to talk, but you can practice speaking to the level which you want.",
    "Very good! Professor is very passionate and open to helping.",
    "The course really delves into a variety of topics that are interesting and pertinent. However, I believe the actual content was at times difficult to follow. The lectures in class depended entirely on the readings for homework and we essentially just reread the works in class. I would have enjoyed the lecture to be less of just reading the lecture out loud and more of a discussion.",
    "Professor Adorno was definitely one of the highs from this course. She was so supportive and engaging and I cannot thank her enough for running such a great class. One of the weaknesses of this class is that I felt like I never really got to know my classmates. We were always reading aloud and having large group discussions, but I think the class could benefit from small group activities as well since it is not a true seminar size.",
    "Prof. Adorno is definitely the main strength of this course! She's super enthusiastic, and so passionate about the content and it really comes through in her teaching. She also makes an immense effort to get to know and engage with every student, which is so lovely.",
    "Professor Adorno is a clear strength of this course. She is very knowledgeable and passionate about the field and has picked some of the best readings for us to look at. She does a phenomenal job of tying the course together and building connections across authors and countries. I loved analyzing a reading word by word and always had a much deeper understanding of the readings after class - the readings aren't the same as if you were reading them alone, and that's part of the magic of the class. The exams are fair and straight-forward (study guides before the exams), the essays are different and interesting, and plenty of notice is given before deadlines, ensuring you have enough time to think things through. I can't really think of a weakness, other than sometimes it's intimidating that she calls on people to speak in class (though that means that we all are engaged and participating in a 9am).",
    "Strengths: Structure, time, class size Weaknesses: The syllabus seemed to be very Euro-centric, talking about Latin American cultures as foreign and barbaric. Professor Adorno, although clearly caring and well-versed in Spanish, contributes to this confusion (she is an Italian-American, so her perspective will always be from that of an outsider and the bias is apparent)",
    "The two essays were tremendous experiences. I had never written a true paper in Spanish before, and Professor Adorno offered copious feedback in order to help us improve our writing and language usage.",
    "I felt that the content would have felt more relevant if we had in class discussions on the readings instead of reading paragraphs in class.",
    "Strength: Wide-range of readings from different cultures is very engaging and informative!",
    "I think in class participation needs to increase. So many people were unwilling to speak and so that sometimes made class dry. On the other hand, Profesora Adorno was a fantastic instructor and she often made class very engaging. I would also say her office hours are fantastic and she is very very approachable!",
    "The course is very strong in terms of the content, but I feel like it could have been stronger as a seminar rather than a lecture.",
    "I appreciate that this course used more than one genre to learn about certain countries. However, the first essay was poorly planned out.",
    "Strengths are the instructor and material taught.",
    "Strengths: Lots of resources, Prof. Adorno has office hours and is very responsive, and she also goes over everything in class and provides a very helpful study guide for the exam. Weaknesses: 9 am meeting time :(",
    "No weaknesses. The course was well structured and made easy to follow because the homework correlated with the class lectures of the day",
    "The course was well organized and the purpose of each lecture was clear. The readings were very interesting and useful. However, I would have liked more opportunities for student participation during class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely if they're looking for an interesting course that makes you think and offers a safe space to try out new ideas.",
    "Definitely! A very good class if you placed into L5 and are looking to complete your language requirement. Don't worry about not having sufficient language skills after only taking AP Spanish although the readings are somewhat difficult, they are not too time consuming and we pretty much read them all aloud each class to make sure we understand the main points. If you pay attention in class you will do fine!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are really dedicated to the subject and to learning Spanish. It would be hard to be engaged in this class if you are not passionate about the topic at hand.",
    "For sure! A great language credit with a super enthusiastic professor. Also, super interesting even if you don't need a language credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking for a better understanding of different Latin American cultures, as well as colonialism in Latin America in general.",
    "Take this course if you want to reflect on culture, both in general and in your own life. The class is as personal as you make it, meaning it has the ability to make a real change in your life if you let it. The readings are incredibly well-written and fascinating, the lectures make the readings even more magical, and the class itself is very fair in its structure. Even if you're not super confident in your ability to write essays, the class does build up to it, so go for it if you're interested in the topics!",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! A very approachable Spanish L5",
    "Absolutely. I'm a physics major, but I would regard this class as the best I've taken at Yale. I finished my language requirement with L4, and decided to take this class on a whim. I was truly enlightened by Professor Adorno's insight and passion about the course and its readings.",
    "I'm not sure. I liked the readings but wanted more help with my Spanish speaking and grammar and didn't felt like I got much help with either.",
    "Yes! Great way to improve your Spanish while engaging with texts that are important and insightful to Latin american cultures.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic course to review one's Spanish skills and gain an understanding of the Latin American canon. As a Cuban, I gained a deeper understanding of my own history both personal and national. If you have roots in Latin America or are simply interested in learning more then this course is definitely for you.",
    "Yes, Prof. Adorno takes a genuine interest in her students. The exams were incredibly fair. The readings were interesting.",
    "Yes! Definitely if they have the Spanish skills and interest in Latin American cultures. It is a pretty low-workload course and the readings are mostly very interesting. It would make a fun 5th course.",
    "If you want to learn about Latin American cultures from Latin American authors- whether the authors are magical realism writers, poets, revolutionaries, or all three- I would highly recommend this course. This course felt relatively easy but I believe it's because the professor makes sure that everyone grasps what's happening in the class and how to do the assignments. Office hours are incredibly helpful also.",
    "Absolutely: it is an well-taught interesting class with easier grades without requiring much spanish language proficiency.",
    "Absolutely! A great way to practice and get better at Spanish, and actually learn about Latin America",
    "Yes, you are able to gain such an expansive understanding of culture as a concept and how it applies to Latin American countries as well as your own background.",
    "Yes! You are basically being lectured in Spanish, and it is amazing to feel yourself understand more and more. It truly helps so much for your listening and reading skills. You also read some very interesting works and learn a lot about Latin American history and culture. It is a solid a,out of reading each night all in Spanish, and to get the most out of the class you have to do it, so if you are not willing to do that then maybe dont take it."
