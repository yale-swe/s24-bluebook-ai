    "I would summarize this course as absolutely imperative, in the best way, for anyone planning to do any work with manuscripts ever, and I would recommend it for anyone who might ever have to work with medieval documents.",
    "It's an introduction to Latin paleography that will familiarize you with a variety of scripts, teach you what to look for as you examine a new manuscript, and give you the chance to practice these skills with your class project. Highly recommended!",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to any Latinist who is looking for more autonomy as a reader and editor. The time we spent on transcription (a majority of the time) was the best (and only) way to get acquainted with medieval scripts.",
    "An essential introduction to manuscript studies at the graduate level, as well as a more specific guide to Latin paleography (still very useful, also, for the vernacular)."
