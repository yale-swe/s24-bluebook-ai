   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Portuguese is an extremely useful language to have at your disposal and if you already speak a romance language, it comes fairly easily.",
    "Yes. It is a class that will help you improve your speaking and writing skills.",
    "Good continuation of L1-L2 for students wanting to master spoken portuguese.",
    "Decent class, take it to complete language reqs or if you wish to learn a new language. Portuguese is a great language to back up (and possibly hurt - like it did with me) your knowledge of Spanish or Italian or French. Just make sure it's offered at a reasonable time. It was offered 3:30 - 4:20 this semester, a big pain for clubs, master's teas, IMs, etc.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has a genuine interest in learning a new language. Beware, it is not the same as Spanish!",
    "Good class if you're looking to continue on with Portuguese - you write several essays, watch a film, have guest speakers, and learn about a wide variety of Lusophone countries.",
    "It's a relaxed, fun class that will keep up your Portuguese."
