    "Definitely take it if you like to play music!",
    "Awesome class, had a lot of fun while learning the materials. Definitely take it if you're interested in conduction\/improvisation in general. The readings were a bit irrelevant at times, but they're totally worth it.",
    "Absolutely. I know what you're thinkingthis is not a real class. You're not wrong, per se; it's so much more than a class! It's an EXPERIENCE. Yeah. Do it.",
    "Yes! Take this course--even if you don't read music! It's an awesome course for instrumentalists and vocalists as well--I learned a lot about this practice of conducted improvisation and I also learned a lot about the study of sound.",
    "Do it!",
    "The best music performance experience you will have at Yale",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! You will not only learn bits of theory and history behind improv and concept-based music creation, but you will learn about yourself and grow as a performer and person as you discover what comes out when you're working under very different (and liberating) parameters from the usual.",
    "For a unique experience that will change the way you think about and listen to music\/sound\/noise, take this class. Getting comfortable and finding the beauty in dissonance is also a great lesson for life."
