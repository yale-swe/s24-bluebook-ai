    "Interesting content, but not always presented in an engaging fashion. Presenting a different psychosocial concept each week seems like it would be interesting, but proved to be redundant. Most students in this course are not SBS students, so would be nice to see the material catered towards this population. For instance, if we discussed more current research or applied the concepts in a critical thinking manner, the lecture would be more engaging.I enjoyed listening to other students' prospectus presentations in section.",
    "Less time consuming that the first semester SBS course",
    "This course exceeded my expectations, I learned a lot more about psychosocial factors role on influencing health than I thought I would.",
    "This course has different forms, and all of them are great.",
    "Sort of boring topic. Didn't like to organization of the class. Student presentations weren't helpful and took too long of the class. Discussion sections weren't helpful either, lots of juvenile exercises and wasn't productive.",
    "Great course. Perhaps limiting the student-led presentations to 20-30 minutes may be better.",
    "Strengths: Encouraging class participation and discussion. Very clear expectations and professor's interest in students. Interesting subject matter, enjoyed the structure of the class.",
    "interesting topics but discussion sessin too long",
    "Strengths:1. Well crafted reading list2. Interesting course delivery3. Good assignment structureWeaknesses:Sections do not add much to lecture",
    "I would have liked to see more integration of the different pieces of the course. It did not seem to build as the semester progressed, but rather each lecture seemed independent. Furthermore, the discussion sessions could have been better utilized to pull in the themes of the course.",
    "Sections and classes were a bit redundant",
    "This is a good epidemiology class. The topics covered are important, although they could have been discussed more deeply or rigorously. The structure of the class and the topics covered feel a bit redundant towards the end.",
    "B",
    "The format was difficult and the discussion sections were utterly pointless. The Prof was passionate you could tell wanted to make the class a good one though."

    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Dr. Rozanova is very passionate about psychosocial epidemiology, and this is apparent in her lecture. She is very interested in what students have to say about the concepts, and she very respectfully asks for our input and waits to hear our answers. Her voice can be very soothing, which can make it difficult to stay engaged. I encourage Dr. Rosanova to \"spice up\" her lecture a bit more. For instance, when she posts a picture and asks the class about their thoughts, this keeps students engaged and thinking.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Lectures can be a little dry. The student-led discussion and her lectures were very repetitive so I didn't think we needed to meet twice a week for this course.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Very organized and accessible to students. She really is passionate about the subject.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0She is great! Clear in checkpoint, and rich in resources.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Good instructor, just needs to restructure the class.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Professor Rozanova is well-versed in and passionate about psychosocial epidemiology. I think she would make a phenomenal teacher with a little more practice and a more-rigorous and more-demanding curriculum.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Very knowledgeable and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Interest in students and knowledge of subject matter was appreciated, good at sparking interesting class discussions.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0knowledgeble and kind",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0The instructor delivered the lecture thoughtfully, was always approachable for questions, and used a very interesting assignment cadence. Considering that most of the class took it as a requirement rather than genuine interest, Julia's performance is particular remarkable.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0The instructor was knowledgeable and invested in the students' learning. I would like to have seen her push the class a little further in their thinking and discussion of the materialthough.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Very strong professor but could facilitate more engaging in-class discussions\/learning",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Professor Rozanova is a good instructor, who is clearly knowledgeable and cares about her discipline. Her powerpointsare informative, but could go even deeper into the material.",

This is a picky suggestion, but I think will be very helpful to Roza in her professional career.",

    "Milena and Roza were both excellent!",
    "Milena held a great section. She fostered an environment in which everyone felt comfortable contributing, which is both important and rare in sections.",
    "The TA's were not good. They were responsible for grading the majority of our work throughout the semester, which I find highly innaproriate considering that many of the students they were evaluating have more experience and knowledge than they did. Not good. They had far too much influence over our performance in the course.",
