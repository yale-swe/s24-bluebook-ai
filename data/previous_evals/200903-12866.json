    "Spanish 130 focuses on developing skills in speaking and writing Spanish with emphasis on use of the subjunctive. I would recommend it to any student interested in learning Spanish.",
    "If you need to fulfill a language requirement, it's not a bad course.",
    "very important who your professor is",
    "If you are really interested in spanish i don't think you will be taking a class with the majority of people having the same opinion as you but everyone still works hard and it does not bring the actual class down but the attitude that the majority of the class is being forced to take the class can be felt. This should not discourage those who are interested from taking the class because we do learn a lot and ever does still work hard.",
    "It is miserable and just a review. IF you want to learn something, take another class.",
    "basic language class. not a lo of work, but mainly for the reqirement"
