   "comments": [
    "Provides some strong background in how to quickly make maps and do basic spatial analysis. The lectures, however, felt kind of useless- everything of value was from the labs.",
    "The labs were very useful. Midterm should be replaced with another lab type assignment instead of an in-class exam.",
    "Learned a lot from the lab session.The lecture is very early in the moring,sometimes it is hard to concentrate this early.",
    "strengths: learn how to use ArcGIS.weaknesses: the course begins at 8:00a.m every Tuesday, it's too early.",
    "GIS is a very helpful software to learn, but this course was not well executed. The labs are too lengthy and the grading and feedback was not helpful.",
    "There was a long delay between submitting assignments and getting feedback such that all the assignments were submitted before we were given much feedback. We were unable, therefore, to apply the corrections from previous assignments in later labs.",
    "Excellent!",
    "I think the course was a good foundation for GIS. I think it would have been helpful to focus a bit more on interpretation of the maps in addition to focusing on how to make them, and also perhaps incorporating some more spatial statistics techniques.My biggest complaint about the course was that the lab assignments were, for the most part, not returned until the end of the course. This was extremely frustrating, as points were taken off in the early labs that could have been corrected in future labs; unfortunately, we could not learn from minor errors as they were not graded in a timely fashion.It also would have been helpful for me to not have the TAs walk through every step of the lab; while I can understand how this is helpful, it is a bit of a crutch.",
    "I really enjoyed doing the final project for this class, and the final presentations. I feel like I have a good basic understanding of GIS.",
    "- The course is a good introduction to GIS and the labs give good practice on using ArcGIS.- The final project was interesting and allowed us to integrate everything we learned.",
    "Very marketable skills.",
    "No comments please.",
    "The lab is really great. My biggest problem is that it was not always clear what the instructors were looking for as answers to the questions on the labs. It was also frustrating that the labs were not returned very quickly so it was hard to judge what I could improve.",
    "-good course, especially the labs-midterm wasn't quite like the practice midterm--a review session in the future may be helpful-may consider having student teams working on the final assess the work of their partner--found work to be very unevenly distributed-lectures didn't need to be 2 hours--maybe 1.5 instead-final project felt rushed--i.e. the help sessions on the same day\/day after printing deadline; could have been planned a little more carefully-found book to be unnecessary",
    "very heavy workload",
    "practical, interesting",
    "Lab class is good for learning the software.Class are less related to the skills and how to use the ArcGIS.Lectures starting at 8 am is too early.",
    "The strength of this course was the lab portion of the course. It was very useful to have the labs following what we learned in class and to get hands on experience in using ArcGIS software. The midterm assessment was good but I think it will be more helpful to have a midterm exam that is more practical and project based to give us more experience working with the ArcGIS software before the final project.The final project was a great way to get to know other students in the class and to work together. However, it would have helped if we had a bit of direction and if the TAs were available for extra office hours outside of the assigned lab times.",
    "The obvious strength is the lab component of the course that allows the students to practice the lecture material. The lab assignments were well connected with the lectures although there were a few lectures which could benefit from more comprehensive labs.",
    "Strength: Labs are really helpful and interesting.Weakness: Two hour long class beginning at 8 am does not help the monotonous lectures.",
    "This is a wonderful class in which you learn a very useful skill. The lab sessions and corresponding homework assignments are very helpful and useful as well in re-enforcing the class material. I feel that I have a working understanding of GIS now, a valuable gain. However, I think that knowledge of SAS would have greatly enhanced what I took away from the course. I would make SAS knowledge a pre-equisite.",
    "This is a very useful class. The lectures and lab sessions are combined perfectly. I benefit a lot from this class.",
    "I think it would help to have some extra help with the statistics component.",
    "Strengths include relevant lab assignments and final project.",
    "I consider the skills that I have learned in this course to be crucial to my career in academic medicine and public health. The pace was reasonable, the material was stimulating and the final project\/presentation was an important opportunity to practice my skills.A strength of this course was the laboratory sessions, which could have been improved by allowing more time in each session to finish the assigned material. Often times it felt like we were rushing too quickly though the material due to time constraints.",
    "Great at quickly teaching the important parts of a useful public health tool, but the labs can be a little bit too guided and structured at times, providing little room for individual experimentation and exploration.",
    "A good introduction to GIS. Chocked full of useful resources. Various areas designed to develop skills in ARCGIS. Good, albeit not entirely essential, supplementary materials. Course dynamic sometimes made it fun to learn, enjoyable to be challenged to learn.Difficult at times to connect to material; one lecture per week made it somewhat hard to revisit and apply lessons save for those focused on in labs.Midterm practice exam could have more aligned with actual exam.Final project should include peer review option."

    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford's lecture could benefit greatly if more recent examples were provided in his slides. Some of the examples are outdated and do not reflect the current GIS interface. Although this was not too much of problem, it would still be beneficial to see more precise examples.",

    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford is an expert in the field, and it was an honor to learn with him. His notes and lecture slides were extremely useful to have as resources after class and will be as I work with GIS in the future. The last few lectures were a little dense though, and I am not sure if I took away as much from them.",

I am not sure if they were given specific instructions to ignore certain email requests, or if they just did not care. I had a technical issue with one of my lab assignments and I was unable to set up a meeting or get an e-mail response from either of them.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Jane Skene \u00a0I had both TAs for lab. I felt it would have been more beneficial to have longer labs or shorter lab assignments, because I feel like we were rushed some weeks, which became stressful and meant we got less out of the lab. I appreciated them guiding us through the lab, but also wished lab assignments were posted earlier and graded sooner.",
