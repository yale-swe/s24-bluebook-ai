    "Don't take it. It will make you hate traditional Chinese literature and society. She picks the most weird, awkward, obscene topics to discuss while skimming over any useful information. Also she offers little to no real guidance on the twenty page paper, so you're just left to float or sink.",
    "I took this class because I really wanted to have read Dream of the Red Chamber and knew that I would never get through this multi-thousand page book without being in a class.I really enjoyed the book, as a piece of the Chinese canon. But it can drag at times. With that said, I'm not sure if I would take the class again, knowing what I do now. I don't really like the professor's teaching style.",
    "Read the novel in English, read it all semester, then write one paper on something you think about it. The last part is tricky because the material is so vast, but Prof Lu gives you a ton of support if you want it. She is a funny, totally approachable, and devastatingly down-to-earth teacher. Her knowledge of the topic is only exceeded by her passion for it. Even if you grow tired of the novel by Chapter 100, she keeps bringing issues of historical, social, etc context to the syllabus that can catch your interest again.",
    "Great class, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Tina's classes are fascinating. She has a way of speaking casually about highbrow thematic concerns, which really brings to life a novel written centuries ago.",
    "Yes. It gives a great overview to the probably greatest novel in Chinese history. Also, it tells a lot about what scholars in East Asian languages and literature are studying.",
    "I would recommend the course to any students who are interested in Chinese literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The book is excellent and so is the instruction.",
    "Great class. For those of us not good enough at Chinese to read Hongloumeng in the original Chinese, we still get to read and discuss a major Chinese classic. There is quite a bit of reading, but the novel goes by quickly (I probably spent 3 hours reading for each class), and you don't have to do all the outside readings to participate in class (but make sure you read at least some of it, because it will become painfully obvious when no one volunteers a summary of a really easy article). Also, Professor Lu is AWESOME. Not only is she smart and knowledgeable, but she has a great sense of humor and a wonderfully casual way of leading discussions. Plus she taught this class while pregnant and was due to give birth during finals week. What a baller.",
    "Be prepared to read, read, read. The workload of things you actually turn in is light, but if you want to get anything out of the seminar you have to keep up with the reading, and there is a lot. Professor Lu is funny and engaging, so don't feel intimidated about speaking up in seminar.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. We never came to any satisfactory conclusions about anything in class, instead focusing on complex and esoteric potential interpretations of a handful of scenes from the ten chapters of reading we were expected to do each week. The grad students, who mostly read the novel in Chinese, were clearly on a very different page than the undergrads and I never felt like we made progress towards understanding basics about the themes of the novel. The reading load was huge (although I did get away with skimming), and I found the plot rather repetitive about halfway through. I took this class wanting to read a Chinese classic, and left disappointed and discouraged. Look elsewhere for an EAST or EALL credit."
