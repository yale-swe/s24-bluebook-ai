   "comments": [
    "not really. i didnt learn much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in the law, but it is not very econ-intensive.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great seminar. Manageable workload. Excellent seminar to take as a senior. Prof Jaynes is, in addition to being extremely smart, a lot of fun to learn from.",
    "Yes. Great course.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class if Prof. Jaynes is teaching it.",
    "ECON 475 is a really interesting class. It is not incredibly economics heavy and the reading load is extremely manageable. All that is required is that you lead a seminar discussion with a partner and submit a short paper on your lesson and the final paper, which, at about 10 pages, is reasonable. The material, which focuses a lot on Supreme Court cases is interesting, the discussions were enticing, and I feel like I've learned a lot, but if you're looking for a completely economics-centered class, you should avoid this one.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone looking for an econ seminar that's more law than econ. However, a good seminar group truly interested in the material is key. Otherwise, the discussion can devolve into talking about discrimination in the job and college application process, which everyone is quite familiar with to begin with.",
    "Yes, it is a great class full of vivid discussion and is a breath of fresh air from most economics classes at Yale."
