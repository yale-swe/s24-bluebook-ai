   "comments": [
    "Dr. Brownell is at the forefront of his field and he is keen to share it with you. If food, or political policy surrounding food interests you, this course is a must.",
    "Interesting merging of different ways to look at food policy and research. Great guest lecturers, interesting discussions, cool opportunities for research.I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Take this course! There's no question. It's a multi-discplinary, whirlwind tour of food and nutrition policy as it relates to the obesity epidemic, taught by THE leader in this field. Just don't be disappointed if Brownell has to skip class for a meeting with Michelle Obama.",
    "The course is a good way to be introduced to and talk about food policy issues. The Rudd mini internship component is a great way to supplement the lectures.",
    "This is a seminar with a once weekly hour-long discussion section and an internship component at the Rudd Center (5-6 hours per week). Other than that there is not really any reading or written work. The internship is the most valuable aspect of the course because you will have a chance to get deeply engaged with a Rudd project on food policy. If you have an interest in food policy at all, I recommend taking this course. The class discussions were not helpful, but you will get valuable experience in public health interventions and food policy creation and implementation. The Rudd Center is a well-respected entity in the food policy world and the connections you make there could help you advance your career if you are interested in continuing your work on food policy after college.",
    "If you are interested in obesity prevention and food-related issues, I would highly recommend taking this course. Professor Brownell is so knowledgeable in this field and has so much to share with his students."
