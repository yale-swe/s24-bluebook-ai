   "comments": [
    "I developed a better understanding of the history of political journalism. As someone who reads a lot of political news now, it was beneficial to understand where certain standards and styles originated from.",
    "Understanding of political campaigns in 20th century and relation to presidential election this year.",
    "We read a wide variety of political journalism and developed insights into both political reporting and politics itself. I learnt a lot about the traditions of politics and campaigns of the past and this now greatly informs how I view and analyse politics today. The class was highly discussion based and we learned a lot from the guest lecturers who shared their experiences and political journalists in the field.",
    "As a result of this course, I know much more about the past fifty to sixty years of presidential elections, a knowledge which added to my understanding of the nation as a whole and the 2016 election in particular. Though the class very often veered away from discussions of the readings into debates about that week's news cycle, this was often unavoidable given the intensity of this year's election and offered me an opportunity to steadily arrive at\/communicate my political opinions in a respectful, considered manner. Professor Stoehr's curiosity is clear, and the guest speakers he brought in were varied, engaging, and ready to have a conversation rather than pontificate.",
    "Classics of Political Journalism gives a pretty broad overview of the presidential campaigns thought particularly focuses on the events of 1960-1972 races.",
    "I definitely gained a broad and detailed understanding of the development of media coverage of presidential elections, but also of the history of party politics and national political developments itself."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a major strength is the texts that we read, because they truly are classics and clearly build off each other. I think it was a bit disappointment that we didn't focus on the texts more. I know that in the midst of this presidential election it was easy and fruitful to step away from the reading, but oftentimes it felt like we didn't get to dissect the readings at all.",
    "The guest lecturers were a valuable addition that really set the scene for the rest of the course. The reading list was good and the topics covered always relevant and interesting. It could have been improved by more frequent and structured assessment. The class discussions often followed tangents, which can be good but often more direction in seminar style classes is useful.",
    "The course does a good job at drawing broader, generally applicable lessons from what are essentially case studies of past elections. I loved nearly every book we read, from Miami and the Siege of Chicago to \"Up, Simba,\" and was equally interested in the many supplemental readings for each week. The constant discussion of Vietnam and the civil rights movement sparking an ongoing anti-liberal backlash in American politics occasionally became a bit repetitive, but I still left the course with a fairly wide-ranging understanding of the political landscape (or, rather, with the important lesson that the political landscape can often be inscrutably complex).",
    "I tremendously enjoyed the guest speakers, but also appreciated that the seminar was split so that we also discussed the exceedingly well-chosen readings. The readings are a strength, as is Professor Stoehr's knowledge and enthusiasm for the past several decades of political journalism."

   "comments": [
    "yes.",
    "If you are interested in politics, journalism, or both then this course is for you. The guest lecturers are great and the readings really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only as a fifth class--classes consisted mostly of the professor talking, with very little engagement from the students.",
    "If you're at all interested in the weird and occasionally frightening world of American electoral politics, and ready to hear and challenge the insights of peers and professionals, then check this class out. I couldn't wait to attend it week after week. As a result of this course, I know much more about the past fifty to sixty years of presidential elections, a knowledge which added to my understanding of the nation as a whole and the 2016 election in particular. Though the class very often veered away from discussions of the readings into debates about that week's news cycle, this was often unavoidable given the intensity of this year's election and offered me an opportunity to steadily arrive at\/communicate my political opinions in a respectful, considered manner. Professor Stoehr's curiosity is clear, and the numerous guest speakers he brought in were varied, engaging, and ready to have a conversation rather than pontificate.",
    "Yes, for a student looking to enhance his understanding of the presidential campaigns and the way the presidents in the past have sold their image, this is an interesting class. It's a good combination of political psychology to a degree and political science.",
    "A great course if you're interested in political history (parties, electoral shifts, specific candidates), in the psychology of the electorate, in political communication and media theory, in good narrative political writing really enjoyed it."
