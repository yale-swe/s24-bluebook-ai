    "Great class, definitely take it. Reading is not at all difficult, even when you get to the books it's mildly more time-consuming but not bad at all.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in and with some background in the subject. Our class this semester was about half graduate students, who generally had more in-depth knowledge of at least some aspects of what we were talking about. As such, I personally at times felt out of my depth - but also as a result learned a lot; I imagine your experience will depend largely on your background. Professor Gorski does do a very good job moderating discussion to meld everyone's perspectives, ensure everyone's on the same page, and bring the important issues to the surface.",
    "Definitely -- but be forewarned that a lot of people in the class have significant religious studies backgrounds.",
    "Religious Nationalism explores the various aspects and roles of religion within the modern concept of the nation. Readings and discussion explore everything from Sri Lanka to Israel to the United States. The material is very intriguing.\u00c2\u00a0It was interesting to hear both professor Gorski's expertise and to hear from students about their life experiences that related so well to the course topics.\u00c2\u00a0Professor Gorski is very passionate about the subject of religious nationalism, and you can see his face light up when he listens to his students speak. He makes himself very accessible to his students - he is very quick to respond to email, and he is more than willing to meet students outside of class to answer questions and discuss paper topics.\u00c2\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the subject and is fond of seminars in which the majority of the discussion is student-driven.\u00c2",
    "A chance to explore religious nationalism through case studies."
