   "comments": [
    "I learned about what makes a play dramatic, what moments work and are emotionally powerful. I wrote a full play, which is a skill in itself. I learned to give constructive feedback.",
    "I learned about my own need to tell stories. I learned so many things that kind of just permeated my being as opposed to information I can relate. Great class.",
    "Advanced knowledge about how to write plays and scenes, both conceptually and technically.",
    "I LEARNED HOW TO WRITE A PLAY. It was insane. This class really taught me how to free myself up and produce a truly long piece of writing I can't help but feel so proud of. I learned how to write dramatic text.",
    "Debs playwriting class is about encouraging you to embrace your obsessions, to think deeply and from your heart, to be open to the miracles of the world.",
    "Playwriting -- structure, detail, and generation. How to give and receive feedback in a workshop setting.",
    "I gained the skills and confidence necessary to write a first draft of a full-length play",
    "This class gave me both the skills needed to write plays, and to understand the power of the form.",
    "Deb helps you find your voice. It is called production seminar because what is important is the product, what you put down on the page. Not that it is correct or even good, but that you put something down that is exploratory and speaks from your sincere curiosity as an artist."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class's biggest strength is that Deb cultivates an environment where students can tell vulnerable stories from their own lives, and thereby feel more comfortable in the vulnerable act of sharing their work. The class demystifies the process of playwriting and makes it accessible. However, this class does have its weaknesses. Work-sharing is poorly curated, such that students need to volunteer to read, which is fine, but some students read almost every week while others read maybe three times in the semester. I'm a student who finds it hard to advocate for myself and claim space in class so that was a real challenge. A strength and weakness is that Deb really trusts students' intuition on playwriting, such that there is little instruction on *how* to achieve the dramatic elements we discuss in class. So students who have a lot of writing experience write these moments well, whereas students with less experience don't know where to go with that information. Experience is not a prerequisite for the class, which is awesome, but lack of experience then needs to be accommodated.",
    "Strengths: really safe space to exist and create and learn and talk and be happy and sad and Deb Margolin is a great person. Weaknesses: need more time to workshop in class. I only got my scenes read twice the entire semester. I wanted to be able to hear my classmates' opinions more often.",
    "The class environment, thanks to the instructor's understanding and welcoming, was terrific, and exactly the kind of space one would want \/ need to be able to experiment with writing.",
    "I loved this class. I was honestly so sad when it ended. The class dynamic and the encouragement to share \/ open up to each other really helped me write. Deb really cares about cultivating a community fo writers and this happens -- the class is really pointed to facilitate a sense of community and sharing and that made it infinitely easier to let people read my work. I felt so open to feedback. In some ways it would have been good to have people read some of the scenes before class so that cold reads could have gone smoother at times, but actually I think the 'in the moment' reads could also be really productive and meant everyone was being honest and fresh. So it's a trade off. I thought this class was amazing.",
    "Deb creates an incredible culture for writing in her class. The comments from the class are constructive and open doors instead of closing them. The only possible weakness is the class size. Because we had such a large class, only a couple of scenes were able to be read per class meeting. This is not so much a weakness of the class as a byproduct of the demand!",
    "I loved this class. It was a joy to be in and I think its only weakness would be that writing a play is a daunting task. Really the only part I didn't enjoy was defeating my own expectations of the work I was going to complete.",
    "The course does not commit to teaching you a syllabus of plays, but that is a result of its often organic structure shaped by the students in the room. The strength of the course is in the vulnerable and inviting space created by Professor Margolin, one that is necessary for the craft of playwrighting. We are able to dive deep in the short course of the semester and it is much about the playwright themselves and less about the history of playwrighting and its expectations on the artist."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to write a play, take this class because you will have to do that. Writing a play is a huge challenge and this class will get you there.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone who wants to be a playwright. Deb Margolin is an understanding and wonderful person who easily pierces your psyche and understands what you want to say. She's great. Do it. Just take the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "YES. With my whole heart. This class literally made me want to be a playwright and also meant I finished this class with a full length play. I loved the people in it and Deb was incredible. She made me feel so cared for and supported. It was an incredibly caring environment (more so than basically any other creative class I've been in at Yale) and it really opened me up and made me feel capable to write. I loved this experience. I would do it again 10 times.",
    "Of course! Deb is the most underrated prof at Yale. This is the only writing class at Yale that I know of where there is a complete lack of pretension and full dedication to your soul. Deb knows we make creative communities through compassion. If you want to write a play, no matter your level, make sure to study with her. She is inimitable and she has changed my life.",
    "Yes. Amazing if you want to generate a full play.",
    "Yes! This class is especially great for those who are hesitant about taking a creative writing class. It is well facilitated for any level of writer.",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in theatre, writing, or the human experience, you must take a class with Deb, and this is a fabulous candidate -- truly, every class meeting is like a master class!",
    "This is the first class I would recommend. It was unbelievably inspiring",
    "Playwrights who are ready to be sincerely curious should take this course. It is not for the typical \"theater-nerd\" who needs to prove their knowledge of the cannon. If you are bold and ready to explore your soul, take the course and prepare to eat your heart out kid."
