   "comments": [
    "If you are ready to commit serious time to learning Chinese and improving specifically your reading and writing skills, then take this class. Xu laoshi does a wonderful job of teaching. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time on Chinese. Personally, I really enjoyed this course.",
    "This course is perfect for anyone who has a solid background in speaking or reading, but lacks writing skills.",
    "This is a very rigorous, fast-paced course. It requires a lot of dedication and steady studying, but then again, it is a 1.5 credit course. It is very difficult to get used to the nature of the course in the beginning of the semester, but students learn Chinese and improve very quickly. How much you learn in the class depends on how much effort you put in. I would recommend this course.",
    "It's a difficult course that's worth the work. I would recommend it if you're willing to put in the effort. I felt like my Chinese improved a lot after this semester, and that the progress was tangible.",
    "This class moves very quickly. We finished a chapter in 2 or 3 days with lots of vocabulary crammed in. Course had good natural progression and built off of previously learned topics.",
    "This class is a lot of work. More than 1.5 credits worth, I believe. Very stressful and fast paced. Your Chinese will have improvement after the semester, but at the expense of your other classes and your sanity. You can get an A if you just do ALL of the work and keep on top of your vocabulary and grammar, but it is by no means an EASY A. If you're looking for an easy A, take Spanish, but if you want to improve your skills as a heritage speaker, this is the class. Another thing to note: People enter this class at different skill levels because it is a heritage speakers class. Some will know more than others and find this class easy, others will struggle and fall behind. Even those of us who find the class easy will see that it is a LOT of exercises and vocabulary and work.",
    "The course is taught well, but don't expect it to be like a high school language course. Unlike Spanish, French, Latin, etc, Chinese has a different linguistics root and thus has many qualities that make it a hard language to learn. Because there is no verb tenses, everything is done by construction, and a lot of emphasis is placed on memorizing \"sentence patterns\". This is very different from most high school languages classes, where emphasis was placed on knowing the tenses and a few basic grammar rules. As someone who does well with logic-oriented material rather than memorization-based material, this definitely did not play to my strengths.Chinese 132 also caters to a wide variety of abilities. Since you can only test into three levels of native Chinese, students placed in 132 range from knowing only basic vocabulary to being native speakers with little written background.This makes the course very hard to teach, and makes it of various benefit to the students.The course however does do a good job of trying to cater to all the aspects of language. Grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, listening, and reading comprehension is covered throughout the course, and students with deficiency in an area is given extra help to catch up.",
    "Definitely take this. Depending on your language background, it might not even be that much work, and contrary to what you might think, it feels great to get back in touch with your \"ancestral roots\" or whatever. The class also had a nice dynamic because of our shared cultural background-- a bunch of us became friends and went to lunch together almost everyday.",
    "Good class if you're a native speaker and want to brush up on grammar, vocab, etc. But your speaking probably won't improve much because it's hard to incorporate all the new vocab and grammar structures you learn into daily conversation.",
    "I wasn't sure if I wanted to take Spanish or Chinese but I went with Chinese (partially to appease my mother, but also because I wanted to) and I'm glad I took Chinese. I didn't realize how lacking I was in Chinese even though I could speakpretty fluently. I still want to take Spanish, but I think this course was pretty rewarding. My reading and writing has improved dramatically and my speaking is getting better also. There aren't that many speaking opportunities in class because time is short, but if you practice outside, you'll see an improvement.",
    "Chinese 132 is a great course to take for heritage speakers with some (even if it's very little) background in Chinese reading\/writing. It moves at a rapid but reasonable pace and introduces concepts that are very helpful both in oral speaking and formal writing. Overall, I highly recommend the course, as it is both enjoyable and educational.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to dedicate some time every night for this class if you want to learn it well! Professor Xu is really great and nice, but she is tough. You'll learn loads, though!",
    "This class is really good if you want to improve your Chinese at an extremely fast pace. The professors were pretty clear and very nice. However, there is ALOT of work, so you have to be prepared for that. It is not an easy A by any stretch of the imagination, though the grading is fair and only 50% of your final grade is due to exams. The rest consists of a group oral (5 minutes for 4-5 people, so each person only has to say a few lines), homework, and participation.",
    "Yes, if you need to take three or more levels of heritage speaker Chinese and this is the third semester.",
    "This is a great class. The pace is really quick and you have to learn around 20-30 phrases a night, but it's really enjoyable and you learn a lot.",
    "Very fast paced. We do about 2 lessons per week more or less and tests every 4 weeks. The class itself goes very quickly and meets every day. There is not so much daily homework aside from memorizing characters, but when it comes, it's hard. That being said, your Chinese will improve drastically should you choose to take this course.",
    "Chinese 132 is a really really fast course that assumes a pretty solid Chinese background. I'd recommend it only if one's background can support a lot of material each day, and if one has the time to review the material.",
    "I have definitely noticed that I am much more comfortable speaking Chinese now. It simply provides a good way to practice speaking- a chance that you dont get anywhere else on Yale campus.",
    "Chinese is one of the hardest languages to learn at Yale, but it really does teach you the language by increasing your vocabulary and improving your grammar skills.",
    "It's a tough course and goes a a fast pace. It is best if you had basic Chinese background or spoke Chinese at home. Most students spoke some Chinese at home.",
    "Chinese skills greatly improve, especially reading and writing skills.",
    "It's a good Chinese class, starts slow but moves quickly and gets pretty hard by the end. The teachers are very fair and as far as grades go, you get what you deserve. Basically what you get out of the class depends on what you put in. I recommend taking this if you want to take the leap from learning everyday Chinese to acquiring higher-level language skills.",
    "This is a good class for providing a solid foundation for one's knowledge of the Chinese language. The emphasis on grammar is good for students who speak Chinese but never learned it in school, yet this is also the most challenging part of the course. I felt that learning the grammar was difficult, even with the tutorials. Nonetheless, I am glad I took this class, and I look forward to using what Ilearned in the future.",
    "This is a great place to start if you're a heritage speaker and want to get a better grasp of Chinese. The instructors are fantastic, and really do their best to make sure you come out of this course a better speaker than you did going into it. My only qualms about the course involve the terrible textbook (awful typos, though they're working on getting a new one) and, related to that, terribly archaic and useless language.",
    "For a very intensive class to learn Chinese, yes. Otherwise, if you just want to dabble and get a general idea - I would recommend a lower level class like Chinese 120.",
    "Excellent course if you are already fluent in colloquial Chinese but want to improve, especially on formal, written Chinese.",
    "This course is intense but well worth the time commitment and effort (for reference, I am a non-heritage speaker but have taken Mandarin in middle and high school; my parents speak a different dialect of Chinese, but I only speak English). Professor Xu is extremely adept at teaching the class. Her time management is impressive, and she maintains a brisk pace but is still flexible enough to allow for when the class needs to spend more time going over a particular concept or grammar pattern. Her weekly plans provide a helpful structure for class notes without removing the responsibility of the student for attentive note-taking. I have thoroughly enjoyed having her as my professor this semester and am thankful to have benefited from her expertise and dedication in class. Do not take this for an easy course. If you put in the necessary effort and time, however (which is not, by the way, an unreasonable amount either) then you will definitely benefit from it. Professor Xu can be tough, but realize that it's because she genuinely cares about her students and wants them to improve.",
    "An extremely rewarding experience. Although I definitely had my reservations about this class, it ended up being a blast. The first month or so is just a review of L1 and L2 Chinese, with just a few new vocab and patterns to be learned. The end of the semester definitely gets a bit tougher, but if you put in the effort to learn the material well, it's well worth it. After this class, I don't feel as though I can take on China by myself now, but I'm definitely more comfortable with conversational Chinese now. If you want to learn Chinese well, you can't go wrong with this course.",
    "This is a tough course, but if you are a heritage speaker who is weak in reading and writing, this is a good course to take. The emphasis of the entire course is on reading and writing, so there is a lot of homework every night. Most of the work is memorizing characters. Your writing will improve a lot, but there is very little work on speaking, and it's difficult to integrate newly learned words and grammatical structures into your spoken vocabulary. I am glad I took this course, though, because it did improve my overall Chinese skill.",
    "The course is difficult and requires a lot of work, and will eat up a lot of time for the semester.",
    "I was tentative about picking this course initially because I thought: \"why take a language course when you can take in its place something unique and irreplaceable post-yale e.g. a seminar or something; I'll take a language course after college.\" But then I realized I didn't have a choice because of the language requirement.But if I did, I still would've picked Chinese because in truth, I probably won't take a language course after college. And there's also that language critical period that ends when your 6, but there's also that intelligence critical period that ends at 25 or something.Anyway, this course is excellent. If you have any interest in preserving your heritage and feeling better that you haven't totally forsaken your culture, take Chinese.",
    "Emphasis on formal language. Good mix of grammar and vocab. A lot of vocab in the later units. Not too much formal writing -- only a few short essay assignments.",
    "This class is a very good introduction into more formal Chinese (if you alreadyhave a background.) I was really surprised at how much more work it was than L2 advanced Chinese, so just be forewarned that if you find L2 easy you might find L3 difficult. Xu Laoshi is also really awesome. She's a good teacher, and she has a sense of humour. I've never felt shy about making a mistake in class, which is really how you learn a language."
