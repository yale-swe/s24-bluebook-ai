   "comments": [
    "Really a whole new way of looking at thins in the world. First Anthropology class as a senior and this class really resonanted with me. I would tell anyone who wanted to learn not only about oil but also influence and power more generally in today's society to take this class.",
    "This course taught me to read political and technical text beyond it's surface meaning to investigate what the text actually is doing with regard to power relations. Where political science discourse instructs to examine policy assumptions, this course challenged me to examine the assumptions that those in power make about how the world really operates.",
    "Superior skills in evaluating accounts from different types of sources. Better skills for writing in anthropology and understanding nuances.",
    "So many! If you're looking for some better ways to approach important political-economic-social issues, and get to discuss really fascinating concepts with what turned out to be a very diverse, always engaged class, take this course! Doug is also so nice and will guide you through some at times uncomfortable or challenging ideas",
    "I got some knowledge from this, new modes of analysis, etc."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were great and so were class discussions. I think I would have benefited from one more assignment to fully understand the process of Anthropology writing before the final paper",
    "The course was very well facilitated and encouraged critical discussion about the implications of how people communicate in the world. But, I found that while the course was highly critical of technical language used by those in power to exclude those who might like to challenge their power, the language used in the texts and in class was highly theoretical and difficult for me to access. I would have liked the professor to break down some of the language used by anthropologists as well as oil execs.",
    "I think it could be improved with slightly less reading. At points it was overwhelming. Strengths were class discussion. Fantastic discussion.",
    "This is a very good course. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a bit large which was the only problem.",
    "The whole premise of the course is great - the topic is very interesting and inherently facilitated interesting discussion.",
    "too many people in the seminar.",
    "This course was such an excellent and deep investigation of an interdisciplinary yet anthropologically-rooted approach to oil that I don't even know where to start. The course is very strong. I would do little to change it this is the Yale seminar at its best."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially those interested in oil and those who have been steeped in the rationist disciplines of political science and Econ. That said, I would also strongly encourage students to take a more introductory anthropology course before this one as I sometimes felt overwhelmed by my lack of theoretical foundation.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.",
    "This course might be a bit overrated, but it is still well worth taking. If you haven't taken an anthropology course, definitely take this one before graduating.",
    "Absolutely. The reading are very interesting and Professor Rogers is a great instructor and discussion leader. I got alot out of this course.",
    "sure, it's fine.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Prof. Rogers really cares about students and is a skilled seminar leader. All of the classes and readings are carefully and thoughtfully chosen to be interesting and helpful in looking at the world in a different way. Students are from all majors so don't be intimidated by that. There is a lot to read each week but they are fun and interesting every week, I promise. Try it even if you're not an anthropology major, and if you're in the class, do the reading and participate in class because there is so much to learn from the subject material, Prof. Rogers, and your peers. This is why you go to Yale.",
    "This class is arguably the best class I have taken at Yale. Yes, absolutely take this class, particularly if you are interested in issues of fossil fuels, the anthropology of the economy, and complex understandings of power and culture. Professor Rogers is brilliant and the readings are incredible. The workload is to what is to be expected of a seminar, but you will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not give this class the attention it deserves."
