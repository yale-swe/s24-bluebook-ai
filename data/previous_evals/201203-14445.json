    "Experimental Methods is a course that teaches a basic understanding of the many techniques and tools used throughout the field of neuroscience. It's an excellent course for students interested in neuroscience or students just beginning their neuroscience careers.",
    "Yes.",
    "It is a great course if you are not very sure about what kind of technique you are going to engage yourself in. But even if you have already figured it out, it doesn't hurt to know more.",
    "A very good course with general introduction and discussion on almost all available methods in neuroscience."

    "It allows me to familiarize myself with different experimental methods which will certainly help me with my own research in the future."
