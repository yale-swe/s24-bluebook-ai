    "The course introduced me to some of the most interesting poetry that I never knew existed. Professor Campbell weaved the class together in such an incredible way and was very responsive to our interests and thoughts. I would highly recommend you take this course with her--or any class, actually, because she is so wonderful. She cares so much about her students, she is extremely thoughtful and kind, and she really pushes discussions in the ways they need to go. You absolutely must take a course with her.",
    "If you're interested in studying a wider range of 18th century writers than those typically included in the canon, including women writers, and having greater freedom to direct your research, take this class."
