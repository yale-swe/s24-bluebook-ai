    "Oh, so much! I came to this class feeling very uncomfortable in my abilities to analyze landscape paintings. I saw them as something beautiful, that often moved me, but not objects that I knew how to go about analyzing (my comfort zone is definitely figural art). But you managed to deconstruct my phobia, as I have left this class with a great toolkit of techniques\/tactics for tackling these paintings\/feel much more at ease.",
    "I've learned to think about landscape as beyond just a realistic rendering of nature or land, and how they express a complex dynamic of political power, memory, and history. I appreciated the opportunity to think about the various ways of thinking about \"perception\" -- both through the filters of imagination\/cognition, and more physical mediums like paint, photography, print, etc. This course helped me to think about how sight could be \"translated\" -- across cultures (from Europe to America and to other continents and other often marginalized peoples), across mediums (from poetry to literature to painting to photography), and across times (not just from a historical past to the present to the future, but also to an imagined narrative of a certain history). In this process of \"translation,\" I've had the chance to think about how the geographical aspect of landscape played a role -- in ways like locating, placing, or displacing. Although I came into this class with very little knowledge about landscapes (beyond just as background of \"travel literature\"), I found the readings and discussions helpful in understanding and rethinking my own research ideas.",
    "Familiarity and comfort with landscape as a method of representation\/seeing; introduction to classic and recent work in the field; ability to approach pieces from historical and art historical viewpoints.",
    "-how to look at landscape paintings in critical ways -more knowledge of 19th century art",
    "I gained a deep understanding of the landscape traditions in American and British art, including the cultural resonances of landscape, their political implications, and their important impact on the history of art. The assignments were challenging, yet rewarding, and my writing definitely improved."

    "I loved the field trip to Olana and to Cole's House--it was such a wonderful weekend, and brought both artists (and the Hudson River Valley) so much more alive in my imagination. The readings each week were fantastic--all really fascinating and helpful, and structured so well, thematically. Also, team-taught classes usually do not work very well (there feels like a power imbalance, or it becomes haphazard), but this class was such a well-oiled machine, and the class was so much the richer for having two professors. Both professors were extremely engaged in their students, and made themselves readily available to discuss any concerns or questions we had. They were both invested in making sure that we all gained as much as we could from this course. My only difficulty in this course was that during the object sessions, I often found myself at the back of the pack, and had difficulty seeing the works we were talking about--which, in turn, made me somewhat reticent to speak. But such is the nature of a large class, and I also need to learn to be a bit pushier.",
    "Really great course organization and teaching. I thought the seminars were very well led and I really enjoyed the time we spent at the museums. Some of the reading I would have liked to explore in more detail, but overall I learned so much in this course!",
    "Professors Raab and Barringer were great discussion leaders, encouraging everyone to participate, and creating a supportive and highly intellectual class atmosphere. They struck a perfect balance between lecture and discussion."

    "Absolutely, it was both challenging and interesting, while expanding knowledge. The instructors were excellent.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially to another undergraduate. Aside from the fascinating content, this was the perfect graduate-level course to take as a senior in the major. I not only learned a great deal about the landscape tradition and its various social, political, and artistic resonances, but I also was intellectually challenged in a unique way. The two assignments -- a catalogue entry and a longer research paper\/presentation -- necessitated two different kinds of writing, which was great practice for someone looking to go into the field of art history. Barringer and Raab are also great discussion leaders, and were extremely available for feedback, etc."
