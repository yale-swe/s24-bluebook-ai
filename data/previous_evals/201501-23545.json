   "comments": [
    "It helps me to design different plays in a short time, so that I can know the different feeling and emotion among plays. Also we did a lot american play which help me to understand american culture.",
    "I think seeing everyone else's work each week was extremely valuable. Jane was also very encouraging and had a keen eye.",
    "I like the lectures on costume history. I wish the history portion of the class could expand. It's very helpful.",
    "I appreciate the emphasis on learning the history of costume and how detailed is our review for our work.",
    "Being able to present our work across the room and see it from a distance is very helpful. The costume history slides were helpful in guiding my research for the assigned time period. Getting feedback from Jane and my peers has been the most helpful. Also when we discuss the play and our thoughts about it, I find that it helps inform how we critique each other's work."

   "comments": [
    "It will be very useful to get more experience if the professor talks more about his design process when he was designing the certain play. For example, the challenges to choose the material, how to communicate with other designers and director, and how to realize his design to really show.",
    "I think a little organization on the PowerPoint end could help a lot.",
    "I think we need more time for each project. Sometimes I feel my ideas were not fully developed but we had to move on to the next project. I wish Jane could connect us with designers who are out in the field, or bring us to see the shows she designed.",
    "I wish we could discuss little bit more about the play and the characters so our choices of design can become stronger related to the play and not so much just for learning the history of costume.",
    "To organize the timing of the slide shows so that it is in line with the time period and play we are working on. The slide shows were the most helpful when we saw them before doing research on our next assigned play. I would also love to have has the 2nd year directors and Ilona visit our class. Their feedback is incredibly helpful."

    "Jane is amazing teacher! I learned so much from her this year. She nurtures each student and tries to help them reach their full potential.",
    "Jane is a lovely and charing person. I really enjoyed her classes.",
    "Towards the end of the semester jane was specific with our design choices that we made. Initially at the start of the semester her feedback was not as specific and it made me really appreciate her direction at the end of the semester."
