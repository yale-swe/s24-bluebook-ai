   "comments": [
    "This course is phenomenal. Professor Frame is perhaps the most approachable, most prepared, and most caring teacher at Yale. I am really disappointed to hear that this course won't be taught next semester because of low participation. After taking Math 116 and Math 121, I learned a tremendous amount of information. Professor Frame makes math intriguing for math-lovers and enjoyable for math-haters.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning fundamental mathematical concepts on the backdrop of useful biological models.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've ever taken. The workload isn't very heavy, and Prof. Frame is really nice, but best of all, the material is really interesting. Population models, virus dynamics, just so many interesting applications of math.I didn't take 116, but I had no problem keeping up, so I'd recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting class but focuses on aspects of multivariable that is not as heavily focused on in the 121 class. It's a great class for those interested in biological systems and are interested in the intersection between math and science.",
    "You'll learn mathematical applications that you wouldn't learn in any other class. Many of the techniques are derived by Professor Frame himself.",
    "Math 121 is a great class for anyone interested in mathematical modeling in biology. It is much harder that 116, so on should not sign up for it thinking it will be similar. Unfortunately, I don't think it is going to be offered again though."
