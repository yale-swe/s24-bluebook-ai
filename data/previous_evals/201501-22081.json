   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student and hope that they can learn as much from Professor Kapustin as I did.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's one the classes I've enjoyed most at Yale.",
    "This is my third class with Professor Kapustin, and like the other two, I had an incredible experience. Its a shame Prof. Kapustin might be leaving Yale soon, because he is hands down the best seminar instructor I have taken a class with. Critique is great because its much more theoretical than Moral Choices - another seminar I took with him; be prepared for deep conversations on metaphysics, epistemology, ontology, theory of reason in addition to general political and moral philosophy. The course actually does a great job at bringing together many different perspectives and approaches to violence as well - and Prof. Kapustin is hands down the best synthesizer of content you will find. Take it if you get a chance - you won't regret it!",
    "I recommend this class to anyone with an interest in political theory.",
    "I would recommend this course's syllabus, but not the class. I was disappointed with the types of comments people felt entitled to make when they had done none of the reading. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the vast majority of students enrolled in this course were EP&E majors. Some students in this class spent much of class time on their laptops doing things un-related to the course. Spring-semester seniors showed up not having done most of the week's reading, yet felt entitled to espouse grand statements and gestures about political beliefs hardly even tangentially related to the week's readings. If you are really interested in philosophy and political theory, taking this class will disappoint you because it does not provide rigorous discussion. It's worth taking if you want to hear Professor Kapustin lecture on many of the readings and contextualize the central post-structuralist debates that this course focuses around.",
    "Absolutely. Kapustin may be the smartest prof at this University. His ability to connect what's happening in class to concepts put forth by philosophers throughout the western canon is amazing. He is amazingly helpful and willing to guide students through their exploration of these thinkers.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. However, one should take this course only if s\/he likes reading, writing, and can handle a theoretical, philosophical approach to analyzing issues. The class is not as focused on case studies as the theory behind violence.",
    "Highly recommend this class! Just be aware that it's a philosophy class, not an empirical study of violence. Must take for anyone interested in political philosophy, also for anyone with a DS background, or anyone interested in WGSS, Anthro, AfAm or other cultural studies.",
    "Definitely recommend!!"
