    "Learned how to use C and C++ pretty extensively. A small overview of basic functions in MATLAB.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course had many strengths, particularly its organization and the format of the assignments. The problem sets were exceptionally clear and understandable, yet still interesting and able to be done in a unique fashion. The only weakness was that lectures were occasionally dull and dragged on; this is probably a problem inherent to the format of teaching programming in a lecture format, however, and not the fault of the class.",
    "The psets are difficult but engaging because the end goal is something interesting that you'll feel good having completed, especially the last pset and final project. The material is taught very well and in great detail - if you go to class and listen the work should be very manageable.",
    "All lectures were uploaded to Canvas to reference, along with all sample codes used. Very good instruction, and very accessible resources for help learning and on problem sets",
    "Strengths- Beth is an absolute angel. She is polite, helpful and has lecture slides you can look into. You learn a lot from this class. Weaknesses- The course goes over stuff really fast. I guess that is to be expected since you learn 3 languages in a semester. Moreover the psets are very intense.",
    "The material provided was crystal clear, there was a ton of help both from professor Bennett and the TAs\/peer tutors, and the psets were really engaging.",
    "No weaknesses. Strength is the course was very well organized and the TA's were very helpful.",
    "The course is unnecessarily stressful - the TA's grade which such harshness that it feels like the grades you get are not proportional to the effort you put in.",
    "This was a really good course! The psets were well designed and Beth is a great teacher (if a little strict). Make sure you follow along on your own computer with the sample codes in lecture though, as lecture can get a little dry and if you're not careful you will get lost and have to re-learn the material on the pset. The grading on the psets is frustratingly harsh, but if it weren't everyone would get an A, since they are not overly difficult and the course is well taught.",
    "Very helpful professor and TAs, and many office hours and help sessions that were great opportunities for help."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, as someone who had zero coding experience prior to this course, I feel as though I learned a lot. After the third week or so, the learning curve evens out and everyone is sort of on the same playing field (prior experience or not). C++ and MATLAB are valuable skills for mechanical engineers and I would highly recommend this course if you're planning on any sort of Mech E concentration.",
    "Absolutely, this course was much better than I expected! The material is taught in the best possible way and is genuinely interesting. The course is super well organized, assignments are clear and posted on time, and the help schedule is well-defined. One of the best courses I've taken on campus, and Professor Bennett was marvelous.",
    "Yep",
    "Yes, coding is becoming a very relevant and in-demand skill, and this class uses the practical applications of coding to make learning efficient",
    "Yes definitely, to students wanting to learn how to program and they are engineers. However, be warned the psets are hard.",
    "Definitely. You will need to put in the work, but it will be worth it.",
    "Yes! Youll learn basic concepts of coding to keep on learning more.",
    "I definitely would. I had never taken a CS course and this has now piqued my interest in the field despite not being a CS major.",
    "No, probably not. The course is far too stressful compared to the amount of knowledge you learn. Take something else or learn the basic of programming yourself!",
    "Yes I would, if you have zero, or like me, limited experience with coding in general. The first few psets are easy even for someone who has never coded, and they ramp up in difficulty until you can do some pretty complex stuff by the end (the final project is a 3D graphics program)"
