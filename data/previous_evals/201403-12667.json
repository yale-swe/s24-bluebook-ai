    "Understanding how developmental assistance is used around the world and the pros and cons of specific cases.",
    "This was an okay course. The content is really cool for anyone interested in development, and true to its name in that it's largely about the politics of such decisions, which is both revealing and sad (comparing the U.S. to other donor countries, for instance), rather than about development itself, so keep that in mind if you're looking to study development more directly. I would recommend it to someone who is very interested in the topic, because you can get a lot out of it if you're self-motivated enough. Professor Simon is a nice guy and has had some really cool experiences in Africa that add significantly to the discussion, but this course, overall, I found significantly less than ideal. Simon is not good at conducting seminar discussions (at least compared to many other professors I've had the past three years), and there ends up being very little accountability in doing the class readings, which could be fine if you don't mind not learning as much. You need self-discipline to do it all because the reading isn't necessary for either the class sessions (Simon will pose a question, maybe a couple people talk, and then he goes on rambling, repeat) or the papers. But if you're taking the class for the content (which is the only reason I'd recommend it) then try to be as self-motivated as possible to get the most out of this class, because the content is, indeed, cool. And the papers offer a good chance to explore in depth a donor, a recipient, and then the final term paper is about anything you want. That, I found to be a great opportunity to really explore a development topic that I've been interested in for a while. However, Simon is also not great with comments on papers. Perhaps it's because I'm a senior, and perhaps it's because we're paying so much money to go to Yale, but I get very frustrated when professors don't put in the time to give actual beneficial feedback on papers. You don't learn much (beyond the content of the paper itself) from writing without getting feedback about what you're doing well, what you should do more of, what your weaknesses are, how your structure is, etc. I've had professors who blew me away with how detailed their feedback was, and this shows that they truly care about their students and want to see us improve. I got no such indicators from Professor Simon. He's kind of an easy grader, which again is fine if you're looking for an A- without much reason to believe you actually deserve it, but if you care more about the journey, then this class offers little beyond what you yourself put in. The papers were not difficult, perhaps because Simon doesn't give much indication of what he's looking for at all. Honestly, I don't love Simon as a professor, even though he is a really nice guy. He seems busy and less committed than others in the department. Also, this was a seminar but had like 22 people in it, including a few grad students, which just never makes for a good seminar.",
    "Do it if this is what you're interested in! Buckle down for lots of reading though!",
    "The syllabus and readings in this course are very interesting. However the seminar sessions were somewhat disappointing due to an emphasis on lecture and a lack of deep engagement with the readings. That said the workload is not particularly heavy, so if you're interested in the subject, it's probably worth taking.",
    "The readings are excellent - in fact, they prompted me to do considerably more background reading. They tend to be a balanced reflection on a number of differing and competing viewpoints on each topic.",
    "Great class. Well worth your time.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course. Readings, professor, discussions were all great. No complaints.",
    "This was an overview of development assistance with the flexibility to explore your own areas of interest.",
    "I think, all in all, I would recommend this course. Professor Simons definitely cares a lot about his students, and the topic is one that is critically important in international relations today. That being said, I wish that the topic of each week's discussion was a little bit more defined. Topics blurred together too often, and the class could have benefited from focusing more on particular country case studies in development assistance as a way to demonstrate larger themes in the arena. I also think Professor Simons sometimes lectured a bit too much during class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course if a student is interested in a clear introduction to aid politics. The course is not well organized and discussion do not pin point clear definitions so that future discussions can be more precise and rich. I feel like a good majority of students still couldnt tell you the difference between multilateral and bilateral aid by the end of the semester due to the professor's emphasis on broad, vague concepts rather than basic, fundamental concepts."
