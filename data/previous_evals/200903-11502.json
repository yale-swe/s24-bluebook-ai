    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "This class was fun and very interesting!!! I would absolutely recommend it to another student!!!!",
    "If you're interested in questions of women's studies in traditional China, gender roles in Chinese literature, femaleness vs. femininity in Chinese literature and culture, or female authorship across the dynasties, whether you know a lot about these topics already or are simply interested in an overview, this is a great course with a lot of general information that will expand both your reading of Chinese literature and knowledge of China's literary history and culture. And even if you're not particularly interested in a lot of the women's \/ gender studies questions (which I wasn't), it's still a great course from a literary perspective. One caveat, though, is that if you can already read literary Chinese, a lot of the translations are frustrating to deal with (as is the case with East Asian languages). You should almost always be able to find the texts in the original, though, and in most cases either references or photocopies of the original will be provided by Professor Chang, so you can basically approach the reading from whichever language you prefer.",
    "This class is amazing! Take it if you have the opportunity. There is a lot of reading and most of it is poetry. However, Professor Chang ties all the reading together very well in her lectures and the lecture is followed by a discussion in which you can pursue themes that were of particular interest. The work load, aside from reading, is not extremely heavy. There are two essays and two short response papers and you can write about whatever you like. if you know Chinese, Prof. Chang will sometimes provide you with untranslated poems to compare with the English version, however if you don't know Chinese the class is still accessible and interesting.",
    "This class is so fun. It's a broad review of Chinese literature from a gender persepctive. Strength---Professor Kang and how interesting and fun she makes every dicsusion. Weakneses--none! No background on Chinese necessary, but still interesting even if you have spent summers in China like me.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Chinese culture or literature. The subject of woman in China is unique and taught by the woman who first explored and developed the field. The coursework is very manageable and the teacher is always interested in your point of view.",
    "This course is as good as you decide to make it for yourself. Professor Zhang provides great resources, but there are no reading responses, no exams, and so it is very easy to slack off. It's true that there's no one who has researched more into the topic than Professor Zhang - she is a wonderful woman - but the general environment of the classroom is not a particularly rigorous one, and if your goal is to get deeply into the texts, this is probably not theclass for you. This is not to say, though, that I didn't enjoy myself. I certainly did.",
    "Highly recommend this class."
