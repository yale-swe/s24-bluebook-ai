    "I learned he basics of music theory in a very easy to understand format.",
    "I definitely developed a solid sense of basic music theory. I felt that after this class I was extremely comofortable composing simple music and enjoyed doing so.",
    "Great overview of basic classical music theory",
    "Learning music theory is a lot like learning a new language. Expect to commit about as much time as you would in a language course, and the payoff is probably just as much because I now start to notice more elements of music (even in pop music) after having taken this class.",
    "This course was a fantastic first look into music theory. I now feel prepared to analyze harmonic structure and chord progression in a meaningful and insightful way.",
    "I learned key components of music theory, basic chord work, musical and ear training, and that I might want to take more music classes.",
    "I learned the basics of music theory and the ability to create fun compositions that sound okay!",
    "Basic theory, rhythm, chords, intervals. All useful and fun."

   "comments": [
    "I can't think of any weaknesses for this course I really enjoyed it. It was taught at a great pace and was really enjoyable.",
    "It was great! I wish we had spent more time on applications oftheiry (i.e. More ear training) the days where we did dancing (rhythm application) or listened to music were awesome. Wish we had done more of that",
    "This is a really good introductory music theory course. It's pretty rigorous and covers a lot, which is good, but that also means that the first three weeks of the class are incredibly tough.",
    "The course does tend to move quickly after a certain point. For anyone starting with absolutely no background in music this might be a bit of a challenge. Other than that, I think the course progresses logically and in an engaging way.",
    "Strengths: dedicated and super fun professor who not only was passionate about what she taught but also enjoyed sharing it with us. Was incredibly kind and patient, and was also understanding of college student life. Very interesting material, not strenuous homework load, fun experience. Weakness: final was a more than I had expected based on the semester's material we had learned.",
    "It's great to have a smaller, intimate class for more individual attention and better learning.",
    "Kamala was amazing and made the experience fun and educational. Loved the small style class."

    "Yes. To get a solid understanding of music I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes I'd recommend this class to a. Student who has no music background or wants a refresher on basic music theory concepts",
    "Take this course if you're really interested in music theory. It requires a lot of practicing outside of class, so you have to be fairly committed to have a good time.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in better understanding music. I do caution anyone with no background in music to at least start with the class as cr\/d\/f and wait to see if you'd like to switch after the midterm.",
    "Yes because these musical skills are key to any musician or anyone interested in music. Incredibly fun and dedicated professor, super interesting material, and a fun and laid-back class room atmosphere.",
    "yes, especially if you have an interest in music and learning why music does or does not sound good. plus, you get to create your own music, which is a lot of fun.",
    "Absolutely take it, especially if it is with Kamala."
