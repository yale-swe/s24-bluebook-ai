   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class if you are interested in poetry or the English major. If neither applies to you, you could definitely find a better class. However, it is not too much work and will make you a better critical reader, especially of poetry. All the instructors of 125 are great, especially Manley. Pick a teacher who loves the subject, and is probably an expert in it, and you'll have a great class. It is readings for each class that are definitely manageable and six essays of varying lengths, no longer than 7 pages. It is a manageably class that will give you back what you put in.",
    "Three salient points: 1. Professor Manley is the man. He will make your writing better. He will be funny, thoughtful, kind, and everything a Yale professor should be. His grading is extremely fair (you get what you put in). He will show you how to take English poetry and apply it to your own life. 2. English poetry is amazing, and if you are even slightly interested in the English major, this is a must-take class. People will say the poems are boring. THIS IS NOT THE CASE!! English poetry will change your love life, make you a more interesting person, and change the way you think about writing poetry. 3. English 125 is like Directed Studies for people who aren't full of themselves and actually want to learn something in a single semester.",
    "The course material is enjoyable if intimidating at first site. I would recommend it (and have) to anyone interested in improving their analysis skills.",
    "Overall, 125 is just what you'd expect. A lot of reading and writing about poetry. It turned me away from being an English major, but I wasn't really invested in it to begin with. Prof. Manley knows a lot and is occasionally funny, but doesn't really seem to care about you as a person or welcome class discussion.",
    "It's quite challenging, but it will really work your writing in a good way. Take it if you like poetry and want to get better at close reading!",
    "English 125 will give you a general overview of four major poets in the English verse tradition. I would tell the student that if they are not an English major and do not have to take this course, they should understand that this is a writing intensive literature course and needs to be given a good amount of time. I would recommend the course if the student was interested in reading canonical English poets.",
    "You'll definitely learn to be a better close-reader\/writer. I wish I had taken better advantage of office hours, but Prof. Manley is incredibly accommodating about meeting and guiding you through the difficult materials.",
    "English 125 is interesting enough if you enjoy early modern English poetry, and it gives you an insight into the writers' techniques and styles. It's a required course for the English major, so it helps give you a sense whether you really want to be an English major or not."
