    "Interesting survey course of social inequality, everything from classical sociological texts to more recent studies of inequality. Cool in that the class emphasizes research methods in sociology, but definitely can be kind of overwhelming\/stressful if you haven't done anything like it before.",
    "A very worthwhile class that combines sociology, economics, and psychology for a multi-disciplinary perspective on issues that are incredibly salient in our day and age. Take it!",
    "An interesting class with a variety of readings, but I would have preferred to talk more about the theory behind the readings, and to have spent a more even amount of time on each topic.",
    "Overall a good class, but students interested should be aware that it is first and foremost a sociology class and should be prepared to seek additional help if they lack a sociology background."
