    "I'm really glad that I took this course because it gave me a good taste of what land-use planning is all about. At the same time, I wish that I could've delved deeper into some of the topics we were discussing. I actually ended up going back and looking at some of the online lectures just to clarify my understanding of the laws and policies and I found that particularly helpful for review and consolidating my thoughts and ideas. Because of the short length of the class sessions, and relying primarily on lecture, there isn't really a whole lot of time to dive into the complexity behind the topics we discuss. I think the readings to help to give more depth, and improve questions and discussions during class. I kind of wish we'd had a bit more time though each week. Maybe make it 1.5 credits, add in one more response paper and meet a bit longer? Just some thoughts."

    "This class provides a really great introduction into the planning and land use world. Jessica Bacher teaches the course in a very clear and straightforward manner. It covers a wide variety of planning topics in a short amount of time, but does so in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming or shallow. The field trip to Derby was also a great way to experience elements of the planning process first hand.",

   "comments": [
    "It would be better if there was more of a discussion component to the course. The lectures often ran long because there was a lot of material, but it would have been more helpful if the lectures were either 90 minutes (instead of 60) so that we were not rushed and we could apply the concepts we were learning to more real-world scenarios.",
    "I be great if there could be a bit less summary and instead more depth to each of the issues we examine. I liked the use of different examples of implementation in cities and towns used throughout the course. Again, wish we had more time to discuss more of the challenges.",
    "The class always ran late. While we were always interested in the topics and happy to stay longer, the timing of the lectures could be improved so they don't feel too rushed at the end.",
    "-There was minimal discussion\/interaction in this class. Instead of just moving through a powerpoint each session, I suggest incorporating small group assignments\/reports, more guest speakers, and creating more opportunities for student participation.",
    "I think the class might work a little more smoothly if a little less material was packed into each slide show presentation--with the disclaimer that the rest of the slide show material would be available online. Or perhaps getting 1.5 hours per week instead of 50 min? This latter solution would probably be better as the instructor had a lot of good material to cover, but was often rushed to get through it each week."

    "This class is an easy, one-credit course. It gives you a general understanding about the process of land planning in urban and suburban areas, integrating community involvement and policy. This course does not talk about more rural areas or wilderness, but it is a good start into the planning world.",
    "It is a really great introductory class that I highly recommend. The work commitment is relatively small though you do need to attend most of the classes. The land-use program is a really great part of FES and more people should be exposed to it. Jessica is a really knowledgeable and willing to answer all questions people have. I particularly like how well networked the land-use collaborative and the course are with the region in Connecticut. This is one of the few opportunities I had to really explore local areas during my time at FES, and I've been inspired to take more planning classes in my time here.",
    "If you have a planning background of any kind, you do not need to take this course. It is definitely just an introduction to the field and not meant to do a deep dive into any particular subject. However, if you are curious about what planning is, this is a great place to start and a very engaging class. I always looked forward to attending this class.",
    "Highly recommend as a launching off point for students interested in learning more about land use. This course builds a helpful framework and context of the field that will support further studies. Most helpful as a course for first year students or students with little background in the field. Also, great opportunity to get to know instructor Bacher who is great, very responsive to students, and does a lot of interesting work through the land use clinic."
