    "View cameras are so different and so much more flexible than any other way of shooting that it's worth it to take the class just to learn how to use them.",
    "Take this class! You get to use an old-style camera to take huge negatives. How you photograph will never be the same. Take this class just for Ben--he is great. I grew a lot during this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any photo student who wants to improve their technical skills and learn to see photography in a new light. I think people who have no background in photography can benefit from this course as well but having a background in photo can help foster a deeper understanding.",
    "Definitely take Photographic Techniques if you're interested in the subject! The camera you work with, a 4x5 analog viewfinder\/large format camera, is great, and for most this will be your only chance to use one. However, be prepared to work hard and dish out a lot of money for film and paper. I would strongly discourage taking it Credit\/D\/Fail--if you're taking it anyway, you should put in the time and effort to really do it well, since it's not one of those classes that you can do half-heartedly and still have a good experience. It's worth it. Also, don't be late! Ben is a great professor--funny, supportive, genuine--but he can also be intense, because he deeply cares about photography."
