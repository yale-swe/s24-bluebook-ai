   "comments": [
    "great over view of health care law for anyone without law background.",
    "This was a great class. Fairly self-directed due to the only grade being a final exam. Professor is fabulous, textbook really good, etc.",
    "The course grade is completely dependent on the final exam. It might be nice if there was at east one other assignment",
    "Great introduction to health law. Nice overview of the topics without too much law detail.",
    "Very informative and interesting course. The teacher is well informed and class discussions are lively and interesting.",
    "Interesting material and overview of health law principles. I think the material was extremely important to HMP and HPA students to gain a better understanding of legal topics and their implications on healthcare.",
    "THe lectures and book were both very good and informative. It may have helped to have a paper\/midterm\/project in the middle of the semester so that the entire grade is not based on a final.",
    "I really enjoyed Dr. Ruger's lectures. While there was a lot of content material, the information is very important and useful.",
    "It was interesting but not very structured and I felt I could have learned more. We only met once a week and the only grade was the final. More assignments\/projects would have enhanced the learning process.",
    "I wish that Professor Ruger would hand out an outline of key points from that classes lecture. I wish Professor Ruger would be better at reigning in tangential discussions\/questions that go way off topic. It is distracting for the rest of the students.Overall, the cases we read were interesting. I took a lot out of the class.",
    "Great course,strengths: very well structured course, strong lectures, no micromanagement, a fair grading method. Interesting and important material to learn for students interested in health policy.weaknesses: cover more strategies to affect and improve health policy through the legal framework. We want more lectures from professor Ruger.",
    "The course does a good job covering a wide array of material. I think retention of material would be helped by having a couple of assignments throughout the course rather than all grades depending on one final exam.",
    "The course was good. It did a good job of introducing and explaining some key concepts in health law. I now have a deeper understanding of the patient-physician relationship, malpractice, HIPPA, and EMTALA. Great course to take if interested in working in a health care organization, specifically in a hospital setting.",
    "This class was excellent. It provided us with material that was necessary, but something we hadn't received in any other coursework. I enjoyed going to this class, even though it was on a Friday afternoon.",
    "strength: gave a good picture about the health lawweakness: didn't have enough time to go details",
    "Strengths - course was organized well and provided good foundation on health law issues. Text selected for course was very good.",
    "the course is great--ruger is a very good instructor and makes law and policy interesting and compelling. more assignments throughout the semester would be preferable to one final at the end.",
    "Overall this was an interesting overview of ethics and health law. Sometimes lecture seemed a bit repetitive between sessions, but overall the format was informative and did not get bogged down by too much class discussion.",
    "It would be nice if there was more class discussion.",
    "The lectures in this class were extremely interesting.",
    "Great course; could have been a bit more rigorous and more like a law class. Part of the educational value of the course is for non-lawyers to get a taste of the law -- so things like the Socratic method, testing to see who's done the reading, etc. would be fun. Prof. Ruger promised this but didn't deliver!Would have liked if lectures had focused more on the cases themselves and the structure of the arguments, facts, etc. -- again, it's fun to muse about health policy, etc., but the main value of this course for MPH students is as a LAW class.Some reference to Connecticut law with regard to the topics each week would be very welcome and a good real-world education.Some up-front introduction to how to read cases, legal terms, how to use legal resources, etc. would also have been welcome, or at least reference to resources to learn on our own.I understand it's a balance between breadth and depth -- totally fine to focus on a few areas (MD-pt, research, malpractice) -- but it would be nice to have at least a sketch of health law overall and whether there are other areas, etc."

He knows what most of the people in the room don't know, so explains background information extremely well, and engages with students in an effective way. Overall, he is an extraordinary prof and we are lucky to have him.",

May have been nice to spend more time discussing the implications of cases or and spending a bit less time going over the same cases.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0He is a good teacher. But I felt he summarized the reading a bit more than necessary. Instead it would have been nice to have more discussion. The discussion was always the most interesting part of the class.",

   "comments": [
    "Excellent. Would highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "excellent intro to health law- you will actually learn a fair amount of law as well as a lot about how the law affects health care, insurance, and all sorts of really relevant issues.",
    "This course discusses the legal and ethical guidelines that surround healthcare issues. It;s definitely very informative and I enjoyed taking the class.",
    "Excellent class for any MPH student to take. Ted Ruger is one of the best instructors you will have at YSPH. Too bad he is only a visiting professor.",
    "Overview of legal topics within the health industry by examining cases and discussing their implications in healthcare.",
    "Good course, Interesting, a little stressful that the entire grade is based on final",
    "Pay attention early on the course so that information on the final won't be so overwhelming.",
    "It was okay, could have been better. I liked it but it was never a priority to me because there weren't any grades besides the final exam.",
    "Great course, I recommend it to all. Professor Ruger is great at covering and conveying legal materials in a concise manner. Playing the role of a lawyer on the final exam wasn't as painful as I expected.",
    "A helpful course for anyone going into healthcare administration.",
    "The course was good. It did a good job of introducing and explaining some key concepts in health law. I now have a deeper understanding of the patient-physician relationship, malpractice, HIPPA, and EMTALA. Great course to take if interested in working in a health care organization, specifically in a hospital setting.",
    "Although this is a required course, I still feel that anyone interested in Policy or Management should take it. It gave us a background of patient-doctor interactions\/laws, but also the greater scope of the role of government in healthcare.",
    "Recommendable course for a student who is interested in hospital related studies or career.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a good foundation on health law issues, but not in an intimidating law school course environment.",
    "this course is a survey of health law and ethics--you will be given the opportunity to attempt to think like a lawyer in teasing out the ethics of health care delivery and organization. the subject matter is very, very interesting and it is helpful to view it through a different lens.",
    "Overall this course was an interesting overview of health law and ethics...Ruger is anengaging professor with a lot of knowledge to share and I would recommend the course.",
    "It's an ok class. The book is very helpful and informative.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student",
    "Easy intro to what I imagine is basic health law. A bit confusing for students without contextual knowledge of the legal system, so could use some rigorous grounding there."
