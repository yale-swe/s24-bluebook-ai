    "Fantastic opportunity as always to do work in your lab for credit...but now, with your senior\/masters thesis firmly in mind. The integration of the course with the other reseach courses is actually helpful\/less of a burden than you might initially expect. Having the opportunity to present to, learn about the research of, and respond to other students is great. Finally, writing the final paper was a good exercise in that it forces you to plan experiments for next semester.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students who would like to pursue in-depth research through the BS\/MS. The course includes a research presentation as well as a final research paper.",
    "MCDB 595 is an immersion in scientific research for the purposes of working towards a master's thesis. I would recommend this course because of the depth of this research experience."
