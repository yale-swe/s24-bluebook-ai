   "comments": [
    "100% recommend. Just do it, you won't regret it.",
    "Take this class! It is such a fun class to take and I felt like I learnt a lot. Will never watch films passively again but its all for the best. Seriously enjoyable and you will look forward to going to class every week.",
    "Great class, even if you've never taken a film class before. Definitely take if you have any interest in Italy or film",
    "Take it! Great movies, not too much written work, fantastic professor!",
    "Low-stress WR. Opportunities to do well in course. Recommend.",
    "Among the best classes I have taken, ever. If you like movies, this is a class to take. Professor Marcus is wonderful, she leads great discussion-lectures and really takes the time to get to know her students. She so insightful and really teaches you so much about cinema as a whole and Italian history, as well as the specific films and directors. And man, they are so incredible films. This is your chance to watch all those Italian films youve heard about but never seen! The work is totally manageable; fairly light reading each week, and four short papers that the TAs are happy to advise you on. Unless movies make you ill, you should absolutely take this course!",
    "Wonderful class",
    "Definitely worth taking as a fun class, no prior knowledge of cinema required. This class is a hidden gem",
    "An absolutely wonderful class that will be one of the highlights of your semester.",
    "Really cool way to get a writing credit and learn a bit about Italian and Film on the way. Not a gut at all, quite time demanding and papers every 3 weeks",
    "A good class for those looking to broaden their experience in film.",
    "This is a fantastic course ! The professor, Millicent Marcus, and the T.As, Allison and Maria are simply wonderful. They will take you on a journey through Italian cinema and will delight your ears\/eyes with sumptuous movies and exquisite anecdotes. Take it ! And for the sake of liberal arts education, allow yourself some space in your packed schedule to fit this amazing course even if it has nothing to do with your major !",
    "Take this class! It is an incredibly thorough survey of Italian film with plenty of history and culture thrown in. Penny really cares about her students and takes the time to get to know each one. Most rewarding class I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a great course, and is accessible for everyone. No prior knowledge of cinema, Italian, or history is necessary, as the lectures and films are put into context very well and explained clearly and thoughtfully. The films that are incorporated into this course are excellent and cover a variety of genres and styles, even including classics such as \"Life is Beautiful.\" This course does not have a heavy workload; 5-6 page papers are due every 3 weeks along with mandatory movie screenings on Wednesday nights, but the additional reading assigned is not necessary. Professor Marcus is engaging and very passionate about Italian film, which shows in her lectures, both through the content and her presentation of it. Overall, this is a very interesting class that will teach you a lot about Italy, its history and film, and cinema in general, while not adding too much pressure and stress to your schedule.",
    "If you have not had any exposure to film before but are interested, this is a great way to gain some excellent exposure. Professor Marcus is such a treat and she makes this class beyond amazing. Love this class only wish it wasn't over.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this course, whether you are a film lover or just curious about the subject. This course opened my eyes to how I could analyze films beyond just passive watching, and the power of films to transform the individual. It is also an incredibly engaging class since the movies themselves are enjoyable, so it is also a great opportunity to gain a writing credit. The TAs and Professor Marcus are extremely helpful for every essay, and helped me improve my writing. Only in college will you have the opportunity to learn extensively about a niche topic completely unrelated to your memory, and I urge you to take this opportunity with this class.",
    "As a graduate student I audited the course for fun so cannot speak to the actual assignments. I participated in discussion and went to the screenings, and I had a great time. The lectures were always interesting and the screenings were consistently well chosen. That has not been the case with another film class I audited which was a disappointment. The difference with this class is the professor is top notch, which makes the class itself high quality."
