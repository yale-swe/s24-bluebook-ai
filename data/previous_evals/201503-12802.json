    "don't take it because the grading is extremely subjective",
    "WGSS 120 is an incredibly easy course that is a great gut. Easiest class I've had at Yale. Papers require basically no research (most are interview or personal response oriented).",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an introduction to the world of WGSS and the world of women, food and culture. I would also recommend this to anyone who desires reading emotion-provoking books and writing interesting essays.",
    "Not as gutty as you think.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course! While many students may not attend lecture each day, you will find how much you actually learn when you do.",
    "Great class, great professor, interesting material. Would totally recommend for a writing credit. Doing readings really helps with discussion participation, although a fair number of people didn't and still made their way through section. Lectures aren't tested on, nor are they used in your papers, so not many people show up, although they usually are very interesting so I'd still go and listen.",
    "Yes I would - great WR, great way to improve writing and very little work and stress",
    "A great course for anyone interested in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (the topic, not just the major), food studies, or even just an engaging class that offers a writing credit. Prof. Trumpler teaches a truly wonderful course; if the topics appeal to you, take it (and if you're not sure if the topics appeal to you, they will grow on you quickly)!",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in studying culture or gender studies through the lens of food. You might not cover any one topic as in-depth as you would like, but you do have a lot of freedom in choosing what to write about in your papers and you are exposed to a lot of different themes each week.",
    "If you need the writing credit, probably worth it. If you're taking it for the interesting lectures, also worth it. For an easy fifth class, where lecture is optional and there are only four papers, its fine. But really the lectures are the only interesting bit, section can be torture so pick your TA wisely. All in all, its fine if you're taking it fir a reason.",
    "Very interesting course, with really cool lectures and awesome paper assignments. The papers let you relate them to your own life, which I really enjoyed. If you are actually interested in these subjects, you will really enjoy this class.",
    "Gut. Take it for the writing credit, but don't go to any lectures. The papers are completely unrelated to the lectures and you'll be able to get A's or A-'s on all of them without going to any of them. Readings are long at times, but you can skim them or find summaries of them online and get by in section just fine.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone looking for a writing credit that involves an in depth look at women's gender studies.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student looking for a writing credit or just interested in learning about other cultures. The course helps educate about different cultures as well as improve writing skills.",
    "Easy class, some of the reading are actually pretty interesting",
    "A class within which you will discuss the role of women in the preparation, production and consumption of food, how society views this role, sexuality and gender. I would recommend to anyone who needs a writing credit.",
    "",
    "This is an interesting class and a good gateway to gender studies class.",
    "The class is one about the evolution of the role of women in society, an exploration of food and how it affects us, and the cultures that surround each of those. I would highly recommend this to someone who wants a doable and interesting writing credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was extremely interesting.",
    "Not an easy WR.",
    "Take it- especially if you need a WR credit or easy 5th\/6th class.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It was extremely interesting to look at the progress of women through the study of food. I found all the essays extremely enjoyable to write and the sources very interesting to read.",
    "It's not a very demanding class, but since the grade is based mostly only on your 4 papers, you have to do well on all of those papers to get a good grade in this class. It's the kind of class where if you are actually interested in the material, you'll love to just come to lecture and listen and not feel pressured to rush to take down any notes. And if you're actually interested in the topics taught in this class, the papers will actually be enjoyable for you to write. The readings are also all very engaging and easy to read if you like the material. Even if you don't think you'll like the material, the class actually presents a lot of concepts that are real and important in the world, so even if you're not sure, shop it and keep an open mind to these things. You'll learn a lot and feel good about it.",
    "Women, Food, and Culture is a really good introductory WGSS course that frames the study of culture and food through the lens of women. I would recommend this class because you do not need prior knowledge on the topic and it was super interesting. It also helps you think about using different kinds of sources in your research papers and other assignments.",
    "It's a cool class that teaches you things that you don't learn in many other classes at Yale.",
    "Definitely take this class.",
    "Yes, although I would advise him\/her to take more sessions at writing center",
    "Changes how you view food.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student; the professor is fantastic, the assignments are fun, and you begin to look at your surrounding environment differently.",
    "Take this class for a stupidly easy writing credit. We were supposed to write four five-page papers, but I ended up writing three because I wrote a one-page paper about ways to make Yale more inclusive, which was only an option this semester because of Prof. Trumpler's involvement on the Intercultural Affairs Committee and recent protests. None of the facts in any of the lectures were tested, since we were assessed on papers that focused on feelings and experiences and less on actual facts. Only a fraction of the students went to all of the lectures, and I know this because I was one of the few who did. I got away with and excelled in the sections by only reading a tiny amount of the required readings, because so much of the discussions were based on our responses to the material. If you are lucky like I was, you will have an amazing TF like Danya Pilgrim who will make all of the sections pleasant and enjoyable. The class itself seemed a little unorganized because it talked about so many things (food history, food systems, eating disorders, photography, nonprofits, dining halls, etc.) that had little to do with each other, all as Prof. Trumpler tried to tie in bits of sociology and anthropology. Be wary of Prof. Trumpler's mistrust of science and technology. She has a personal vendetta after getting a PhD in the history of science and the exclusion of women from involvement in science (she mentioned a few times how she used to teach the history of women in science but stopped when it made her upset that she mostly talked about women being excluded from entering a man's field). Everyone is entitled to her or his own opinion, but Prof. Trumpler seemed mistrustful of science when talking about pasteurization regulations and medical treatments for eating disorders. Nod your head and do not speak up. Overall, I am glad I took this class, because I did not know anything about women's studies before it, but I will not take a women's studies class again.",
    "I would recommend this class to fellow students because it was unlike any class I had ever taken before, it brought many new perspectives.",
    "I recommend the class. The work is manageable (only 5 page papers) and there are many opportunities to go to food related events (attending cool speaker events, baking flatbread at the Yale Farm, etc.). Each of the papers is a different style, which makes writing them more interesting than the norm. I think the grades on the papers depend on how tough your TA is. Some of the lectures were boring to me but others were really cool, so I would look over the syllabus to see if the topics are interesting to you.",
    "This is a good class, but if you're not actually interested in the material I wouldn't waste your time on it. It's fairly easy, very low workload and the paper grading is pretty generous. You do not really need to go to lecture, though the lectures are interesting. Professor Trumpler is great, and the readings are fun, so take it if you like what you see on the syllabus! Good fifth class."
