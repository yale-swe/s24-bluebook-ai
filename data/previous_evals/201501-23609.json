    "Question 1: the course is a discussion and explanation of the readings",
    "The course needs at least a few assignments to help bring the material together or otherwise help think about it. Reading a paper and then not really getting past the paper in class was not all that helpful. A different model (with a more stringent economics pre-req) could be a reading course with more readings and a directed and deep discussion as the class. This would serve more advanced students well, but at the expense of the intermediate students.",
    "Mendelsohn does not seem to care about this class. He never bothered to send the class one email or one classesV2 announcement. This was particularly frustrating when class was canceled on a snow day. He said he tried to send something a few times, but never bothered to figure out how to actually do it until after the very last day of class we got our first classesV2 announcement (to announce the final makeup location) He needs a TA if nothing else but to communicate with us. He gave very little direction on the final paper. I stopped reading half way through the class, and it didn't actually matter because the final exam ignored the entire second half of the class. Sometimes you need an easy class to balance the schedule - thats part of the reason I took this class. And it was a success by that valuation method. However, it would have been nice if Mendelsohn would have at least appeared to have cared.",
    "The professor should use slides for this class. This will give him structure and a backbone from which he can follow to stay on topic and speed.",
    "readings were interesting but a little outdated. need more regular assignments. would be helpful to do a brief intro and review of regression",
    "This is an interesting course with potential, but the lack of homework assignments and hands-on work with actual data made it difficult to really understand the material that was covered",
    "This course would have been more useful if it had assignments and hands-on activities."

   "comments": [
    "A more participatory aproach will greatly beenfit the class. It need to strike the right balance between a lecture and a seminar class.",
    "Use articles and methods that are more recent",
    "Assignments are needed without question. Particularly on the CV sections, they all seemed to run together and the nuances and purposes of the different study types were sometimes lost on me. Powerpoint could be very helpful for some of the supply\/demand curves and other graphical descriptions.",
    "See my response to question 13. -needs a TA -more clarity -more organization -come to class on time -come prepared -care",
    "Clarification of concepts in class, course structure",
    "need more regular assignments and problem sets. need to use real data in the regression equations to better understand how to do the valuation.",
    "Though I appreciated being introduced to different valuation techniques, the professor very abstractly went through the mechanics of carrying out the valuation and provided no opportunity for students to develop skills using the techniques. The only assignments for the class were a midterm and final, which had students explain each technique and the advantages and disadvantages of each, and a paper where we simply had to propose a technique to value an environmental resource. I was very surprised that this being a graduate level class never required students to develop a marginal benefit and cost curve, nor actually find data (or at the minimum use provided data) to carry out a valuation. For some students that don't have a background in stats or econ this may be a challenge. However, this being an upper level grad course there is the expectation that students already taken Intro to Stats and Intro to Environmental Econ. Further, we are in grad school and should be challenged and provided the opportunities to learn the skills that a client that wants to hire one to conduct a valuation should know. Opportunities also exist for practicing and cementing other skills in the class. For example, when talking about survey design for a willingness to pay survey, have students develop a short survey and have the professor or peers critique the way questions are worded and structured. I would find this to be more beneficial than abstractly discussing how to create a survey.",
    "Giving several assignments throughout the semester would have helped students better understand the material. Also, using power points or other visuals may have helped during lectures to keep students engaged. Lastly, having a TA weekly discussion section would have been a good forum for students to ask more in depth questions.",
    "I think this course needs to have more hands-on activities that use the techniques. These could culminate in a semester project or presentations at the end of each section. I really enjoyed the final paper and think that more activities such as this would be very helpful.",
    "Lacked structure. No TA no slides. Hard to follow the instructor sometimes. Don't feel like I took away anything from the course. There needed to be a technical component to the course - perhaps a group project or some econometric analysis.",
    "Course should be more dynamic; papers more recent; there should be assignments on how to apply the methods we see in class and read from the papers; the course should provide basic instructions on how to deal with econometrics, regression and other types of calculations that we deal with when read the papers; if it's not possible to cover some basics on regression, it might be helpful to have econometrics as a pre-requisite, as well as statistics.",
    "The course really needs more structure and thorough planning. Any, most importantly, it needs quantitative homework assignments. Without actually practicing the techniques discussed in class, I don't think we could ever really apply them effectively.",
    "Needs more hands-on activities, group-work etc"
