    "Absolutely. Marie is an inviting and understanding professor. Class is taught in a laid-back manner, but still provides a lot of room for students to gain skills. The two two-hour sessions per week are fun, and homework is one 2-3 hour drawing per week. Marie prefers charcoal as the class medium. Overall a very manageable, enjoyable course for anyone to take, regardless of talent.",
    "I loved the class. It was perfect in the balance between having the freedom to explore your own artistic expression and having focused and structured assignments. Marie Lorenz taught the class they way art should be taught: suggesting techniques and giving helpful and encouraging comments that helped each individual grow in his or her own way. She did a great job appreciating everyone's work and was very approachable and helpful in general. Having never taken art before and being a non-art major, I learned so much from just doing and observing the work of my peers. You really get what you put into it and I would do it all over again in a heart beat.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot about rendering objects in space. Being able to draw anything is a nice skill to have, and this class is a relaxing way to acquire or sharpen that skill.",
    "Art 114 was by far my favorite class of the semester. I'm far from an art major, and I hadn't taken an art class since freshman year of high school, but that didn't matter. The level of skill of the other kids in the class was intimidating at first, but you'll definitely get a lot better by looking at their work week after week.You have one drawing every week for homework, and it usually takes about 4 hours. The homework is usually relaxing (sometimes it's even kinda fun), and at the end you have a nice drawing! (which is much more satisfying than a math pset...)As long as you follow the instructions of the assignment and spend a good amount of time on it, you'll do well (even if the perspective is totally off or whatever).(P.S. For you engineers: it's a HUMANITIES CREDIT w\/o reading and essays!)",
    "Basic Drawing with Marie is a good introductory class for drawing. Time commitment is relatively low, so I recommend it for non-art students who want to experience what art class is like. For future Art major students, it is a bit too loose.",
    "YES. Definitely take is AS A FRESHMEN. You have the most time to experiment and enjoy the kind criticism of the intro teachers. Upperclassmen desiring to major in art, be warned that depending on the teacher, the curriculum may feel slow and restrictive (especially when the only medium you're allowed to use is newsprint and charcoal).",
    "The course doesn't deal with figure drawing but covers landscapes and perspective. You will struggle a bit if you don't already have perspective background, but chances are you'll learn it by the end of the course if you put in real effort.The homework assignments can be killer but they're important to your improvement and progress in this class. The time commitment is heavy but relate directly to your success in most cases."
