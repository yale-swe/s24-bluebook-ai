    "This course enables you to : understand a lot of concepts in behavioral economics : introduces you to a lot of papers that form the basis of the behavioral economics : learn presentation skills : understand the importance of being a truthful researcher",
    "Scientific paper literacy and the ability to criticize them intelligently. Insights into psychology, human behaviour and choices. Also a little bit of maths and stats.",
    "I learned how to examine economic concepts under the developing field of behavioral economics. This has been helpful to my public health education where we use policy and nudges to try to improve healthy behavior.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding as to how humans behave to different settings and how they can be influenced to act in certain ways. I specially learned on how humans behave as consumers and how there are certain factors that companies, sellers or producers can manipulate to push buyers and consumers to act in some way that will benefit the former."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - I really liked the course development part of the course as it forces you to revise the entire course towards the end of the class - I also liked the energy and passion that the Professor brings to the course. There's never a dull moment and it enables you to learn a lot. Weaknesses - Weirdly I feel it would be better if more behavioral concepts like nudges o anything at the frontier of behavioral economics can also be taught",
    "The last few weeks of material could be better organized \/ thought out.... but it is my impression that Shane is updates the material every year and so I imagine this will be smoothed out in the years to come.",
    "The course was overall very very good. I felt the presentation of lessons was super engaging as was the course content. I think the grading system is a little weird with so much emphasis on development slides but I would prefer those to a boilerplate midterm. The homework tasks can be super challenging but at the same time not very time consuming (you either get it or you don't) which can be frustrating. A couple of classes at the end are just the professor on his soapbox but for the most part he does his preaching while respecting other viewpoints and challenge which is more than can be said for some professors.",
    "Strengths: small size allowed for interactive education and discussion. Discussions of potential liberal biased in academia and how to analyze research for validity were something Ive never gotten at Yale before. Weakness: some course concepts are best portrayed through group surveys of opinions and how they are flawed in relation to economic concepts. With a small size of the class this experience was less robust.",
    "Strengths - professor Frederick is a very engaging and enthusiastic teacher. The material is very interesting and it is communicated well. Weakness - when it came to studying for the final, it was hard to work out what to study. A lot of the questions were probability questions, but very little of what we were actually taught in class involved such calculations."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as you'll learn a lot of interesting concepts and at the same time, you'll not be bored. This course isn't dry which is especially good if you've done Grad Econ courses.",
    "Yes, I have already recommended this class to several students. This is the kind of course that is so interesting and fun that it stands out from my whole Yale experience. Its intellectually stimulating, interesting and the professor is world class.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to grow their economic toolbox and explore exceptions to commonly accepted models for behavior and economics. If someone is just looking for an easy course in line with previous concepts then I would not suggest the challenging nature of this course."
