    "An exploration of the Tempest as it has been interpreted and re-used in later artistic works, from near-contemporary plays to modern novels. Film, literature, theater, and opera.",
    "SUCH A GOOD COURSE! If Prof. Manley teaches this again, you MUST take it. He is such an amazing professor and does such a great job of unraveling the play. The combination of text and film is perfect, and finding all these links to The Tempest was absolutely fascinating. By far one of the most interesting classes I've taken. And Prof. Manley is great about being super flexible with the syllabus, so if the class (a nice small one this year - only 6 people) wants to focus on something, he is more than happy to go along with it. I was really surprised at how much could be studied on this play. We read novels, plays, myths, poetry, and watched movies and opera. Seriously, take this class.",
    "Yes, if one is interested in the issues of the play."
