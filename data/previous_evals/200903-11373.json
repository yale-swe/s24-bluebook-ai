    "Chinese 170 is a fast-paced but fairly comprehensive introduction to Literary Chinese. The book we covered in one term is usually completed in two terms at most other schools. You will learn a lot and have a rudimentary ability to understand completely unfamiliar Wenyan texts after taking this class.",
    "I highly recommend CHNS 170 to any student interested in learning Classical Chinese. It's a lot of fun with Wang Laoshi, though be warned that she (unlike the other professor who sometimes teaches it) teaches the class in Modern Chinese, not English.",
    "Yes, a great class to improve your chinese and for those who want to read classical texts.",
    "This was a great course!The only critique I have is the fact that it is taught in Chinese. I don't know I feel about it:1) The fact that it was being taught in Chinese vernacular definitely improved my Chinese abilities.2) But, this also hampered what I guess the crux of the course is: the teaching of Classical Chinese. I felt like I could have gotten a better grasp of the material if I were learning it in a language I was fluent in.It's a trade-off.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any Chinese student who wants to move forward past a certain point in their language and reading ability. I think that Wang laoshi's approach justifies the course's utility even to a student only interested in modern Chinese, and as to students interested in reading classical literature, while I assume that the English version of the course is maybe better suited to their needs, it's definitely worth taking even in the Chinese.",
    "Somewhat arcane material. Not very demanding workload. Wang Laoshi is wonderful.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! If you wish to take your Chinese to the next level, take this class! One cannot grasp the beauty and the intricacies of the Chinese language without having a basic understanding of classical Chinese. It will make you look at Chinese different, more thoughtful, and appreciative of how the language has evolved."
