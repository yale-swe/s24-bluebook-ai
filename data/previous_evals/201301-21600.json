    "Definitely less work than cell bio and very interesting material (I was surprised), especially if you are interested in genetics \/ evolution. Very little work. Attend lecture and the night or two before a test. However, unfortunately, the lectures and tests are completely hit or miss, so you could get a randomly high or low grade...",
    "It is a hard course and grading is tough but interesting.",
    "NO..take reproductive biology. Or take it Credit D..you can study as much as you want but your grade will probably not reflect your effort if you are not a sciency pre-med overachiever. It will probably bore you too. Take repro..that was so much better.",
    "Strengths+ Vertebrate and plant lectures were extremely succinct and simplified PPTs with images that clearly explained major concepts. These PPTs were uploaded on v2 for later review, with complementary handouts.+ Vertebrate and plant lecture topics were accurately reflected in the weekly quizzes and the midterms. Midterm grading discrepancies for these questions were clearly explained.Weaknesses- Drosophila lecture slides were extremely difficult to navigate. Not all the slides were used, nor were they all legible, and often the lecturer flipped back and forth between links. He did not upload PDFs.- No amount of textbook reading would help if you missed lectures - KEEP UP WITH THE MATERIAL IN CLASS.- No section to review major course concepts.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this class as the workload is fairly light (no psets, just attend lectures) and the materials are pretty interesting. If you had trouble with devo material from the brief intro you may have gotten from genetics, don't fret, this class really isn't bad at all and the slides are posted for all of Professor Holley and Professor Irish's lectures that explain the material pretty well. The one problem I could see is if you don't attend professor Kankel's lectures, as he doesn't strictly follow slides and instead meanders through his website. As long as you attend lectures, you'll do fairly well on the exams. The exams are non-cumulative with three exams in all. Overall, I would definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Material isn't that hard to follow; the lecture information is pretty much the main focus. Honestly, this course wasn't the terrifying horror that some past reviewers made it out to be. While it's not the most well-taught or engaging course, it's also definitely not the worst science class I've taken and probably won't be that for you either since if you're reading this, you're probably MCDB or pre-med. Quizzes are simple enough but the exams are much harder.",
    "This is a well-taught and interesting class. However, I would only recommend taking it if you have a strong enough biology background to keep up with the material.",
    "Take Dev Bio if you do not want to take Cell Bio, but dont think it is easier than Cell Bio. The exam questions can be quite specific and require more than just memorization."
