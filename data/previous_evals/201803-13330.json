    "Strengths: gives a novice comprehension of Greek but enough to make your way through classical texts, meets every day to continuously engage the mind in the language, lots of online resources to help Weaknesses: moves extremely fast (ie. memorize an entirely new alphabet in a day fast), meets every day...at 9am, not friendly to those not proficient in other languages (a linguist picks up other languages easier than a non-linguist; if this is your first serious engagement with another language, it would be inexhaustibly difficult)",
    "Strengths: super engaging because of fast pace, productive but manageable classwork and homework, lots of assessments to ensure everyone was keeping up with the work"

    "I would recommend this course conditionally; You must know at least one other language to bypass learning grammatical constructions along with the Greek itself. Particularly I would recommend knowing Latin or having had some experience with Greek. The languages are close in grammar and even in vocabulary so that saved me so much time. Also, this is NOT an easy course. If you are not a natural linguist (I count myself in this group), you are going to have to study every day and devote large amounts of time to the class. Prepare to limit extra-curricular involvement to one or two things a week. The class itself, if you are interested in learning ancient Greek, is great and really teaches you the necessary fundamentals to mastering any of the classic texts. But, the \"L1 mentality\" or the \"class for beginners\" mentality are void despite what the Course Evaluation says.",
    "yes! feel like this course really helped me grasp not only the fundamentals of greek grammar, but also understand how fun and rewarding learning and translating greek can be"
