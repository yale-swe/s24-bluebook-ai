   "comments": [
    "The course is very much an introduction\/overview. It will introduce you to a lot of concepts but will likely be repetitive if you've studied Africa at all before. Also, the papers are graded kind of harshly.",
    "Very highly recommended",
    "I would recommend it to another student. It gets a little boring at times but overall is a good class.",
    "This is a wonderful survey course on Africa taught by an accomplished, kind, and insightful instructor. Ambassador Carson is really the draw of this class, as his encyclopedic knowledge of Africa and personal stories from his long career provide a well-rounded picture of the key issues in Africa today. This is not a challenging course in terms of assignments\/grading, but it is definitely one that enriched my understanding of the world as someone whose knowledge of contemporary African issues was largely based on the occasional article in the New York Times. If you know a lot about Africa (as many in the class did, with a few students from Africa and several who had spent a good amount of time there), maybe the material would not be as interesting for you, but the course would still be worthwhile in my mind if only to pick Ambassador Carson's brain.",
    "good class if you're interested in africa's challenges, histories, and relations with the world.",
    "This class is a chance to learn in a survey way about the challenges facing Africa from the State Department's top Africa \"hand,\" a guy who has had significant impact in shaping U.S. policy towards the continent. For understanding Global Affairs and how Africa fits into the international system, the class was just great."
