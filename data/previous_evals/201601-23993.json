    "Picture Writing was one of the most engaging and enjoyable classes I've taken at Yale! We had a good, small class and we got to know each other well by the end of the semester. I'm glad Professor Longmire taught it, and covered a wide range of genres, from photo books to children's books, to graphic novels. I would certainly recommend it to anybody interested in the subject.",
    "Great class with great trips and guest speakers: you'll get to learn how to bind books, use the letterpress outside the L&B room in Beinecke, and read some very interesting works on how pictures and texts relate in all sorts of genres, from children's books to memoir. The work for the class is weekly, but always very interesting and creative: I wanted to work on my projects. Professor Longmire is wonderful, and flexible on deadlines.",
    "To artists and writers, I would say: definitely shop this course. The assignments are very enjoyable and eye-opening, and Longmire is open to many levels of experimentation. Sometimes class-time seems to drag on, or Longmire holds students overtime, but he is, generally, a very caring and thoughtful individual who gives good critiques."
