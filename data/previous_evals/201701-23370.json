   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good for people want to learn SAS from beginning.",
    "I think that the course did a good job of requiring us to learn and apply SAS skills. I feel fairly confident in being able to conduct analyses using SAS now.",
    "The course is one of the best I have taken at YSPH and has taught me so many valuable SAS tools.",
    "Strengths: taking this in concert with Epi 2 allowed me to apply the theoretical concepts learned in Epi, programmatically in SAS. That context was very helpful. Weaknesses: It's really really really hard to learn to perform statistical analysis when you've never conducted research or performed analysis before, with an unfamiliar data set. It would be beneficial to provide students with a raw data file before starting any SAS instruction, and spend a week teaching us about the data and having us play around with it, look at it, think about it, get familiar with it. Then the second week when we go into the lab, it will more closely simulate a real-world scenario where we know our data. That would allow us to catch mistakes and generally care more about writing good, efficient code. In SAS, I think knowing the data is just as important as knowing how to write code. Also even though Dr. Desai tried to liven the lectures up, the material is extremely dry and I'm not sure how, but if only the lectures can be restructured somehow to teach the coding more effectively.",
    "Strength: You learn some SAS and you can now put it on your resume. Congrats. The TAs were also wonderfully helpful folks. Weakness: It's just an ill-taught class with a condescending professor.",
    "My overall assessment of this course is excellent. Dr. Desai made the content engaging and even entertaining at times (not easy with SAS). I feel like I gained maximum educational benefit with minimal effort and busy work, which is a great way to learn.",
    "It is an engaging course and the discussions each work really help solidify SAS knowledge.",
    "This course was a good way for me to be introduced to SAS, and I really appreciated that I was able to jump right into the course without ever having seen SAS before. However, it *really* does not feel like a statistics course; it is entirely focused on application of analyses. A little more math might have been useful for feeling like I understood why we were using the analyses we used. Also, I strongly feel like this course needs much less lecture time and more lab time. It is really hard to get anything out of a 2-hour lecture that's almost exclusively about SAS code. Either more theory needs to be incorporated into the lecture, or some of the lecture time needs to be turned into lab time. Another thing I might change about the course is that I feel like I have gotten really good at following Dr. Desai's lab instructions, but that I wouldn't necessarily know how to analyze data on my own. I would have liked to learn more about knowing when to apply concepts we've learned.",
    "AAMIE is a really excellent course. It teaches you tangible skills that allow you to conduct your own independent data analyses (and feel confident about doing it!). The one weakness I perceive is that two hours of lecture at a time is a lot to try to follow. I found the labs very useful for implementing what we learned.",
    "It was good. I didn't really like the lecture format for such a sas intensive course. i felt that we would have done better to be actually practicing the skills that we learned because learning them in that format was extremely difficult to concentrate. HOwever, i do feel as though i was able to refer to the notes if i got stuck on something so it was helpful in that way.",
    "I was really hesitant to take this course, because I didn't think that I would do well with learning the SAS program or enjoy coding. However, I was pleasantly surprised! Mayur made it so enjoyable and easy to understand. As someone who doesn't know much about SAS or codes in general going in, I really appreciated his \"cook book\" approach. It made it seem very systematic and approachable. I felt that the expectations were clear throughout the course. I wish for lab grades we got a grade for the code and a separate grade for the summary. The code seems to be a more important skill than the summary (because that is what we are actually learning in lecture), but one mistake on the summary or a poor choice of words can bring your mark down from a 3 to a 2, even if your code was perfect.",
    "Great course--learned so much about SAS. Did not like how we went through SAS code during the lectures--likely would have been better for a lab setting. But it was a well structured course, the labs made sense and reflected the material. The tests were fair and accurately assessed only what we covered.",
    "Great course, a must for application out in the real world.",
    "I really enjoy and feel lucky for taking this course. The course materials are very practical and the instructor and all the TFS are very helpful and intelligent.",
    "Good course for research method learning",
    "I don't think this class is best taught with slides of coding. I think students should bring computers to class and follow the steps to do coding during class. That way we get more practice with coding and can ask relevant questions during class and in labs",
    "I thought this course was outstanding, I am very busy and to have an instructor to walk me through the SAS code to achieve quick and practical results in a biomedical research project is fantastic",
    "Excellent SAS introductory course. All slides are very clear, and labs run without any concerns. For some portions of lectures, Dr. Desai could implement actual SAS coding during lecture, especially to answer questions regarding a procedure or if it could run under certain conditions.",
    "A computing language should not be learned in a lecture style course. I understand that was the purpose then of the labs, but having an instructor stand in the front of the room and read us code off slides for 2 hours a week is a waste of everyone's time.",
    "This class gives you a lot more knowledge of SAS than biostats! I think it will be very helpful.",
    "Extremely good course, that helped me figure my way around SAS",
    "good ways to apply epi knowledge into practice",
    "helpful in using SAS",
    "The strength is the content of the course. It is very much necessary for students pursuing careers in epidemiology.",
    "Great course. You really come out of it with concrete coding skills.",
    "The source was not particularly riveting, but I learned how to program in SAS. It made me realize that coding is not intimidating at all. Mayur was a great teacher, and my classmates had a great experience in their lab sections.",
    "This is a great course. It was so practical and made me feel like I could actually apply statistical analyses to problems I would be interested in researching. The slides were clearer and helpful. The assignments were totally fair. The course was overall just very well structured and taught.",
    "It's really helpful! Helps you practice real-world data analysis using SAS. Basic stats theory can overlap with Intro to stats thinking II. They're both helpful! But after the class, I still need to refer to the slide for many codings. Maybe the practice is not enough.",
    "Good, basic introduction to SAS. Some overlap from other classes but good review. Labs complimented the lectures very well.",
    "taught us the necessary skills to run SAS (stats\/data formatting) on our own",
    "I really liked this course! Each lecture is basically on how to code epidemiologic data -- really useful skill to have! I wish there was more details on how the grading works. Literally every student I talked to didn't know how they were doing in the course grade-wise. The grading scale is sort of ambiguous.",
    "This class was a great introduction to SAS data analysis. I had no prior SAS background before taking this course but Professor Desai started from the basics. Now, I feel I can use the program to conduct real-life public health data analysis.",
    "It was a relatively tough course but superb learning. It teaches analysis really well.",
    "This class is fantastic! The topic of could be completely boring, but Professor Desai makes lecture interesting and the labs are so useful for teaching the material. I really cannot think of any weaknesses, I only wish we had had more time to cover more topics.",
    "I felt that I learned a lot in this class about how best to use SAS in analyses, and especially how to manage data. I would have liked more lab focus - more active learning to really reinforce concepts that we discuss in lecture.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Both the lab and the lecture were great. The lecture was obviously a little dry when we're learning about SAS via ppt but Mayur makes it entertaining and worth it. The labs really were step by step and informative. Great class!! One thing about the power points that could be updated is to reflect how it looks like in SAS.",
    "Maybe the lecture can be more condensed, as sometimes there are repeated examples On 1 concepts. Strength: I like how Mayur explain the details of the examples. This really helped me in understanding the concepts.",
    "I think this is a good practical introduction to SAS. It will not make you an expert in SAS, but it could start you down that path.",
    "Useful to be some very comfortable with analysing large data sets.",
    "This course might be more effective if it were structured such that there were 2 labs and 1 short lecture.",
    "It is a skill building course",
    "I don't think SAS should be taught as a lecture. I think it should be all lab based. I did appreciate getting to work with data in SAS for the first time, but I wish that had been a more steady part of the course instead of being condensed into just a midterm or final. I also think that there should be more opportunity for collaboration. The labs were not particularly useful in how they were designed because everyone works through SAS at different paces.",
    "This course would have been very useful to me as a first-year student! As a second-year student, I feel as though I already had to learn a lot of the course material through trial and error or my own research.",
    "The course is perfect!",
    "Great class for learning SAS! Came away from it feeling that I could perform basic epidemiological analyses in SAS with a high degree of proficiency.",
    "I didn't go to any lecture because I hate sitting in Winslow. I learned all that I needed through lab.",
    "I learned a lot about SAS. I truly enjoyed the course, but I wish we had less lecture time and more lab time.",
    "Useful and good guidance, however the lectures could be overwhelming. It would help to have a little more narrative or intuition with the coding to really understand what everything we are writing means. It might help if we could use more lab time to practice coding as we learn it.",
    "Overall, I learned a lot from this class. The slides presented during lecture were very thorough and were helpful for completing lab assignments. Mayur used lots of examples in class, which I found helpful when I was referencing my slides to complete the labs. I also appreciated the diversity of examples used in class, as we talked about different kinds of analyses doing different kinds of data sets. This was helpful for keeping me engaged in the class, as other classes tend to focus on only one (or a small set) of examples, which is really great for people who care about those topics and not so great for everyone else. This class does not have that pitfall. One weakness is the way that lab sections are run. People are clearly at all different comfort and programming levels in the class, and since there was only one TA, if one person had a basic problem, the rest of us would have to sit around and wait until that was resolved before we could move on. I'm not sure what a feasible solution for that problem is, but would be worth exploring for the future.",
    "The professor was a great lecturer, but this material does not lend itself to a lecture format. The labs were generally useful, although my specific TA was not super helpful. The content of the class was good, and I do feel more proficient in SAS.",
    "Will learn SAS and how to learn basics in order to analyze data",
    "practical",
    "This course teaches you the basics of SAS. Labs are very helpful! The midterms and final really make you realize how much you have learned.",
    "This was the worst class I have taken at YSPH. The SAS code needed is found in lecture slides and is relevant to the types of analyses that would be applicable in the field, but the theory behind why you are coding in a particular way is not discussed. In addition, the professor is insensitive towards students and has a my-way or the high-way attitude with the course material. Students would likely benefit more if this course were taught by an actual biostatistician or someone with extensive coding background, not through strict memorization of inputs.",
    "Strengths: Actually learn how to use SAS. Weaknesses: None in terms of content. This class should be offered in the first semester however.",
    "Hated this class. Caused too much stress. Professor and TAs are unmerciful and too harsh on grading",
    "Strengths - it definitely teaches you SAS and the ins and outs of the computer program much more efficiently and much less painlessly than biostats. Weaknesses - the way it was taught seemed like it the lecture didn't always align with the lab.",
    "Very practical.",
    "The labs were the strongest part of this course and the class lectures were weakest part of this course.",
    "The most beneficial part of the course was in the lab where many of the methods mentioned in class were applied. Sometimes discusing the subject in lecture somewhat obscured its application in epidemiological data analysis. More examples would have helped.",
    "A very applied class with the result of learning and developing and actual skill, unlike many other classes at YSPH. Strengths: the professor is a natural teacher, he is very clear, his examples are very pertinent, he also keeps the class bright and funny which is impressive considering the class consists of slides with coding and tables for over 2 hours straight. Weaknesses: it takes a lot of content for granted. If you did not take EPI II, or are not taking it, it will be hard to follow. Room for improvement: It could be complemented with a little bit of theory (i.e. epi) just to reinforce\/refresh some contents and give context to what you are learning"

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Humorous",

I would be interested to see him in the context of a different class - one where the material is less dry. He is also fair and communicates his expectations upfront. This gave us direction and made following the assignments more straightforward.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I was very surprised that students from last year raved about Mayur as a professor. I actually found him to a lacking teacher and a condescending, control-hungry person. We are not your children, Mayur, and we don't owe you anything. We are fellow adults who pay thousands of dollars, a piece, for your class. You are the professor who is supplying the product (education) that we paid top-dollar for. The slides for the class were hard to read and comprehend; they were often walls of black and white text with three different ways to do something rather than solidly teaching us one way first, using colors and spacing, and then alternative ways. I recommend that YSPH refer this professor to the Center for Teaching and Learning at Yale, so the teaching methods and materials can be improved for future students.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Same as above. Dr. Desai is an excellent professor who manages to make content engaging, understandable, and even entertaining.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is sassy, engaging, and a good professor. He takes the time to answer questions during lecture and provides fair assessments of our knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a very entertaining lecturer, but again, it's really hard to pay attention to a 2-hour lecture that's about code. I appreciated that he really emphasized and repeated points that he wanted us to remember- I never felt like he was trying to trick us, and he was very approachable and helpful outside of class. Given the nature of this course, though, I didn't get tons out of the lectures.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0excellent professor, full of Humor",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0he is excellent, responsible and helpful",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a brilliant professor, and I do like how he explains why certain codes are certain ways. For example, creating data --- and set, and setting means bringing previous data in order to create a new data, which can be not as intuitive. Weakness is that the classes both in the beginning of the semester and at the end of the semester were canceled along with 2 classes that were shortened for happy hour. I did not like that as a student. I hope those classes can be used as earnest learning opportunities in the future.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is amazing. Somehow he made bio-statistical coding engaging and entertaining, while also being approachable and open to questions. I really loved this course.",

He takes a topic that could be painfully boring and makes it interesting. He teaches an incredibly useful and necessary skill in a very effective way. No weaknesses to mention! A truly great, skilled professor.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Amazing! I love how funny he makes his lectures and how clear he is in his lab assignments.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great job. Materials were well organized and I think he emphasized his key points well.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great lectures",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is very effective at conveying class material in a clear and engaging manner. He goes above and beyond his duty to help students outside of class time. The material can be very tedious and time consuming to grasp for those who are not computer savvy or with limited prior knowledge of SAS, but he does a great job of breaking down the material into easy to understand chunks of info.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent professor",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor is good at explaining things in the way that he knows know how to do things, which sometimes was really helpful\/useful and sometimes felt frustrating. If you wanted to understand how or why SAS functioned a certain way, this was not the best class for that. The instructor says insensitive things. I think it's important to be careful about what you choose to code as binary variables, and what you describe as \"good\" and \"bad\" in coding. For instance, presenting HIV status as HIV negative=good and HIV positive=bad is very stigmatizing, and this is just one example where this came up in class. Being more sensitive to topics like this could be useful. The way race and gender\/sex were coded throughout this class was also problematic. I felt uncomfortable that I was required to code things in way that I had ethical issues with.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I really enjoyed Mayur's candor and sense of humor while teaching. I also liked that he frequently used examples of research from previous students and how methods we were learning about could be applied to our thesis work--this was great for keeping the class in context. He was also very skilled at breaking down complicated concepts into tangible packets of information that were useful for our assignments. I think I'm probably still an SPSS user at heart, but his style gave me a great appreciation for the uses of SAS.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I had an unpleasant experience with this professor, personally, and through what I experienced as a student as part of the audience within lectures. This professor has no respect for students and is very condescending. Rather than having a civil conversation where there was clarification being asked for, the professor had a very defensive and accusatory tone when speaking to me. It was offensive and didn't make me feel welcome or that my questions were beneath him. Major concerns I have about this professor are with regard to diversity and inclusion, cultural competency, and teaching contextualized material without stigmatizing certain populations nor perpetuating cultural insensitivities. 2 primary examples include but are not limited to: 1) when presenting a recoding example, professor labeled HIV seropositives as \"bad\" and seronegatives as \"good.\" This was an awful way to lecture and was an inappropriate way to refer to individuals with a disease. 2) Referring to the back of the classroom as the \"ghetto.\" These instances are unacceptable and it is important for administration to address these violations. It made a lot of students, including myself, feel very uncomfortable.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent, informative, entertaining.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Not receptive to students. Extremely condescending. Too harsh on grading and behaves in a way that stresses atufents",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths - Dr. Desai is a great instructor who engages his students and teaches SAS in a very straightforward manner. Weaknesses - the method of teaching SAS, while straightforward, doesn't lend itself to creativity or learning different methods of doing programming.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Approachable. Student and learning oriented.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai's grading structure was very unpredictable.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai clearly knows his topic but at times could hand wave some of the reasoning behind his methods. It was difficult to understand why some method were preferred over others or if they would apply in other circumstances.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very practical, keeps you engaged, very knowledgeable a natural pedagogue. Could be more accessible, he does not seem to be very flexible and therefore approachable with any legitimate problems and request you might have. He can also be a bit patronising in his lectures."

   "comments": [
    "good",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in acquiring SAS skills. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it, especially since it's a required course :-P If nothing else, having the code I wrote for all the assignments with commentary one what I used it for is going to help me immensely in my internship this summer where I will be conducting analysis (admittedly in R but it shouldn't be too hard to translate my skills) on an existing data set.",
    "You will learn some SAS so you can put it on your resume. However, you may learn SAS better on your own with online resources than this class. The professor is not a good teacher, the TAs will be your main source of learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I wish I had taken it earlier in my studies.",
    "If you want to learn and practice SAS in an engaging manner, this course is for you. It is a great course to build the basis for your future in SAS.",
    "This course was basically an introduction to SAS and a little bit of analysis, but not much beyond that. As someone with a background in math and no previous experience with SAS, this was fine for me, but don't expect to learn a lot about the math behind what you're doing in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend AAMIE to other students. This is applied -- it's in the name -- so don't expect too much theory. But when push comes to shove and you need to be competent with SAS, AAMIE will get you where you need to be. I left this class feeling quite confident in my coding\/analysis skills despite having never had SAS exposure before.",
    "Its a good class to learn sas. no other way around it.",
    "I think this course is a must take for anyone who will be analyzing data at YSPH or in a future career. I'm glad that I took it as a first year student, as I think the skills from it will be instrumental in doing my thesis work next year. The midterm and final (both take home) take time, but the week to week work is fairly low and there are plenty of opportunities for help. Even if you're afraid of SAS, you might find that you enjoy this class more than you thought!",
    "Would definitely recommend",
    "Absolutely",
    "Good course, recommend",
    "I recommend it though it would make more sense to have this course in the fall semester and learn basic sas earlier on. Also I recommend the format of lecuteue to be changed to coding and teaching at the same time rather than reading codes on slides",
    "I stress the practicality of this course, the teaching is outstanding but most valuable is the applied aspect of the course, you can analyze your data at the end of the semester",
    "Excellent introductory course to SAS, it would be highly beneficial for APMPH students to have this in summer on top of applied biostats and epidemiology.",
    "Interesting and important material",
    "Would not recommend. Grading is strange and irrelevant to actual student knowledge.",
    "Would highly recommend!!",
    "Yes! very useful",
    "interesting class and also help you learn how to use SAS. Recommended",
    "Overall, this class was very necessary and I highly recommend if to the incoming MPH students",
    "I would definitely recommend AAMIE. It is very practical, and you learn how to code in SAS. While it might not be the most interesting class, AAMIE is incredibly rewarding. I really think every MPH student should take it, because knowing how to code is so important in public health, for any concentration or discipline. There is not too much out of class\/lab work, and the midterm\/final is fair and very rewarding to do.",
    "Great course. So helpful for figuring out how to apply statistics in a practical way. Useful for those outside of public health too.",
    "It's a must-have course if you're entry-level SAS user hoping to do data analysis for epidemiology.",
    "Must take essential course for all MPHers",
    "Useful course if you will be using SAS to do the primary analysis on data. Not as useful in learning how to analyze data generated from SAS.",
    "If you're interested in learning how to use code epi data and learn how to use SAS, take this course! A really useful skill I gained this semester!",
    "This class is so useful! I had no prior SAS data analysis background before taking this course, but Professor Desai started with the basics of the program. At the end of the class, I feel much better about using SAS to conduct real-life public health data analysis. Although some labs can be long and the midterm\/final are time-consuming, I learned so much in this class. I would highly recommend this course for students wishing to learn how to use SAS.",
    "Yes, absolutely, great course to get the basics of analysis, using SAS and actually creating data for paper writing.",
    "This is a great course. You will learn SAS and important statistical methods and concepts. Professor Desai makes lecture engaging and interesting. He is very kind and willing to answer all your questions. The labs are where the real learning happens. They are wonderful tools for learning the material presented in lecture. Overall, a great class, great professor and a super important topic. A must take!",
    "Very useful course that will make you feel comfortable using SAS.",
    "Pretty much the first class you need to take to function as an epidemiologist after YSPH. Definitely take it - you need to learn how to use SAS.",
    "This is an fantastic course in understanding SAS coding, and what type of approach we should take when facing the raw data.",
    "Recommend for those seeking a basic understanding of \/ introduction to SAS.",
    "Yes",
    "Recommended",
    "The course is the option at YSPH for an intro to AAMIE. I enjoyed doing the midterm and getting more comfortable with SAS, but the design of the class is not the best for learning a stats program.",
    "AAMIE will give you a good working knowledge of SAS. There are weekly labs which take between 1 and 4 hours of outside work to complete if you go to section and get the example code. The labs are well-designed and will help you think about how to analyze and present your own datasets. The take-home midterm and final exam are manageable but do take quite a bit of time. Prof. Desai is wonderful. I would highly recommend this course to all first-year students.",
    "This course is a must for those interested in applying analytical methods to any public health projects.",
    "Great class if you want to gain proficiency in SAS and basic epi\/statistical analyses using the software.",
    "It is useful and I liked learning more about SAS. I don't think going to lecture is necessary. I didn't go to a single one because I learned everything through lab. If you want to know how to use SAS, take it.",
    "This class will teach you SAS. Great class!",
    "How to use SAS.",
    "I learned a lot from this class, and I would recommend it to others since everyone has something to learn from this class. The assignments and exams are very reasonable if you pay attention in class, ask questions in lab and take time to do your homework correctly. I really feel like taking this class will pay off in the long run!",
    "I would recommend it because it provided a lot of practical SAS skills that I will definitely use going forward.",
    "I would definitely recommend if you want to learn SAS",
    "good",
    "A class in which you learn what you need to know to be effective in SAS. I definitely would recommend this class to other students.",
    "This class should definitely be taken and is the building blocks for thesis work.",
    "If this professor still teaches it, try to not take this course. I think the material is important and relevant, but would recommend taking coding courses at the School of Forestry if possible.",
    "The basics of data manipulation and analysis in SAS. A must take course.",
    "No",
    "It's definitely a useful class and teaches you a lot of the bare analytical skills you will need in the future. A lot of the work of condensing the code or making it elegant will need to be done by yourself later since as Dr. Desai states - he teaches the brute force way of coding.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class since it is required, but I would let the student know that he or she will learn most in the labs.",
    "Great course if you want to understand the basics of data analysis. However, if you are searching for the theory behind some of these tools then you may need to do some additional investigation on your own. Both the professor and the TAs are great and I'm sure would be more than willing to help though."
