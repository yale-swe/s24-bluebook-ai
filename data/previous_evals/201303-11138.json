   "comments": [
    "Good introductory course to Latin at the advanced (L5) college level. Readings were generally interesting and not too onerous-- maybe averaging 30-40 lines per class meeting (tough to say because we read a fair amount of prose.) Most everyone in the class had taken Latin at the AP level in high school so you probably want to be at that level to succeed. Workload was not too awful: readings for every class (took me about an hour to prepare), plus two short polished translations, two 2000word essays, and the two exams. Solodow is a fairly discriminating grader on translations and essays but seems to be more lenient on exams and quizzes. If you're looking for a L5 Latin class and the readings on the syllabus look interesting, I'd say go for it.",
    "This course was heavily translation intensive, which wasn't my strong suit and didn't leave much time for discussion and interpretation, but I feel that it was a great transitional course. My least favorite part of the course would have to be the quizzes, but luckily they were only worth 10%. The lectures were sometimes dry, but I was taking this course purely to fulfill the language requirement, so it was probably more enjoyable for a prospective major. The only times when the work was a little too heavy was when there was a paper due, because the normal homework volume was the same.",
    "I would definitely recommend LAT 450 to another student, especially to an incoming freshman who took AP Vergil and Caesar. High school Latin may be intense, but L5 Latin is a whole new level of intense, and Roman Food and Drink was a great gateway course into more intense studies.",
    "It is not particularly interesting but it is a good way too fulfill your language requirement and not too hard if you have taken ap latin in high school.",
    "This \"bridge class\" between L4 and L5 has many students simply looking to discharge their language credit, but that does not detract from the quality of the class. If you fit this description, you will find the class an enjoyable and stimulating way of achieving this end. If you do not, you will find that you not alone, and there are some of your peers who are quite passionate as well.",
    "Roman Food and Drink was advertised as a \"bridge course\" between grammar-focused courses and interpretation-fueled ones, and in this respect, the class was an unqualified success. As a student who was anxious about making the transition from high school to college Latin, I very much appreciated the amount of time Professor Solodow set aside during class to answer whatever questions we had about the material, even if such questions slowed the overall pace of progression through the material. Such attention was particularly helpful when it came to specific or rare grammatical occurrences, which Professor Solodow pushed us to master as we reviewed the readings in class. The subject matter itself was esoteric, but the readings, for the most part, were well selected and sequenced, enabling us to make the interpretative connections between authors that higher level Latin courses demand.",
    "I'd recommend the class. It was a pretty easier L5 Latin Class. You have to do the reading every night and be prepared for Quizzes, but if you do those two things, the class isn't that bad.",
    "If you're looking to sharpen your Latin a little bit, read pieces of Rome's great writers, and think about an interesting part of Roman culture, then this is a good class. Perhaps more time was spent on grammar than on interpretation, but this is the price to pay for a so-called bridge course. Be aware that some of the assignments are untraditional - including a piece of fiction. Overall, good course.",
    "Assuming you've taken a Latin course before, this class is no different in terms of grading and expected knowledge. Do the translations, prepare for pop quizzes (only one unannounced quiz the entire semester, though), and be attentive in the lectures for the midterm and final. The grading is incredibly fair and unbiased, and it seems as though professor was very eager to see his students improve. I cannot stress this enough - you should really seize the opportunity to get to know Professor Solodow and take one of his classes if you can. He is truly inspirational.",
    "Latin 450 looks at different authors writings on the Roman dinner, many in a satirical form. It's a mix of translation and talk about the culture around dining. The number of lines per night is reasonable, and the readings are well-chosen. I'd especially recommend the course to freshman who took Latin in high school and are looking to finish the language requirement with an interesting class.",
    "This course offered study and translation of a wide variety of Latin texts, all centered around the concept of food and eating. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to continue Latin in college - it was both interesting and a good start to my potential Classics major.",
    "Latin 450 is an ideal course for a student with a rigorous high school Latin background without Advanced Placement teaching. The genuinely interesting course material furthers a prospective student's knowledge of Roman culture, literature, and, of course, food. For anyone interested in gaining a greater understanding of the classical tradition, Latin 450 is an excellent course.",
    "A great class, definitely take it!"
