   "comments": [
    "A good introduction to Chinese in business concepts; take this class if you want to improve your Chinese to be able to communicate in technical aspects, but not a class if you want a mind-stimulating discussion into China's economics every lesson. Effort has to be put in and work needs to be done, but not too much if you already have a good grasp of Chinese.",
    "Great class, you'll learn a lot. Definitely one of the more difficult advanced Chinese courses. Lots of new vocabulary, unless you've studied macro econ in Chinese before.",
    "Chinese for Global Enterprises is a great course to introduce you to the vocabulary and grammar surrounding Chinese economics. The course is heavy on reading and grammar as it is applicable to general Chinese. That being said, there are many redeeming qualities of the course due to the fact that every week there is a \"case study\" which covers interesting topics like Baidu, Three Gorges River Project, and Haier Co. I would recommend this course to students who want to keep up their Chinese at a high level and have just come back from a study abroad where they believe they need to preserve their Chinese ability. It might be a bore to native Chinese speakers or people who are already very fluent. It is a demanding course and requires you to spend at least one or two hours a day to work on essays, memorization of vocab terms, and preparation for listening, speaking, and daily exams.",
    "This class is worth taking for anyone interested in business Chinese or for anyone merely interested in developing their vocabulary. The structure of the class is fair but there are times when there is little work and times when work suddenly floods in over the course of a week.",
    "Pretty interesting class, good summary of a lot of aspects of business that are particularly relevant today for China. We covered things from the banking system and reform to the environmental dangers of their rapid development to their stock exchange. We also did some case studies which were examples of what we had just learned about. It was good to see them in action in China today.",
    "Overall, it is a great class to be a part of.",
    "Chinese 168 is an introductory look into business and legal language. The structure isn't too different from your usual Chinese class, with lots of homework, exams, listening exercises and other activities. Sometimes the workload is completely excessive and pointless, too difficult for students or unrelated to what we are studying. The material can be quite dry but Zhang Laoshi, who is an extremely dynamic and engaging presenter and moderator, keeps things interesting. You will leave the class able to discuss economic, business, trade and legal concepts at a pretty confident level, which is great."
