   "comments": [
    "This is a great overview of how the body is portrayed in law and literature. The class dives into so many issues that might be uncomfortable for some. That is why everyone must take it!!",
    "Take it! It's an interesting set of readings, and Dean L is a wonderful professor. Logistics may be a bit rocky because her schedule as a Dean is insane, but she's super accommodating and communicative. Dean L cultivates a really fun atmosphere in her seminar, and you'll have some great discussions throughout the semester.",
    "This was an unbelievably compelling and interesting course. There is substantial reading involved, but all of the texts are page turners. The work is fun, and the class is more like a conversation. The class is two hours, but it went by faster than some 50 minute classes I have taken. I learned a lot about topics that are often too taboo to discuss. It was a safe space.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. It is alarming how much I think about zombies and cannibalism now, which is so cool! I learned alot from this class, and I really enjoyed writing papers, because the focus was on learning to write well and enjoying the process, as opposed to slogging through work to get a grade.",
    "It's an awesome way to look at the human body and how we've never figured out what we think of it. It also brings out opinions in your fellow classmates that I don't think you'd see anywhere else.",
    "A very enjoyable and chill class, in which you have lots of intellectual discussion and readings are not too burdensome. Take it! Dean L is awesome!",
    "It's a very fun class, though with quite a bit of reading. The discussions were also very enlightening, though the topics covered in the class are very unique.",
    "I would look at the syllabus to see whether or not the readings appeal to you. Some of them are medical, some of them are pop culture, some of them are current events. Also, if your learning style is less discussion based and more lecture based or you like seminars that are very regimented, this probably isn't the class for you.",
    "Eye-opening course that does not fear graphic material. Fun and enjoyable WR credit. Do the readings! They are interesting.",
    "Amazing course. Take it. You talk about reproductive rights, zombies, canibalism and how the body is defined in the law. I thought and learned about things I had never thought of before. Amazing, amazing, amazing!",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS. The material is so interesting, yet forces you to rethink conceptions of the body. The readings are fun to do because they're just so interesting. The discussions in class are so open and free, it's a joy to be in class. Also, you get to discuss zombies. Who doesn't love zombies?"
