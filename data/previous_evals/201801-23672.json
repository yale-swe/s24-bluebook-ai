    "Good foundation, videos in homework weren't super useful, but goes over basics and I felt like it was effective",
    "I wish there was a bit more discussion\/spoken practice.",
    "I enjoyed the course - good foundation to Spanish! Covered a lot of vocabulary. I thought there could have been more of an emphasis on reviewing past material instead of just doing one new topic every day, because it's easier to forget stuff by the end of the semester.",
    "Teaching first level language is always going to be challenging and at times boring. I think the texbook was pretty good, I liked the speed of the course and the order in which we approached various skills\/topics. My professor's level of engagement, unfortunately, was pretty low, as was that of many of my classmates. It was hard to keep the class engaging five days a week."

    "I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to start a new language. I took this with a background in French, so many of the concepts were familiar to me which did make it easier. Prof. Garca is really knowledgeable and accessible, and the course can be fast-paced at times but other than that it's a very manageable fifth course.",
    "Yes!! Great class to learn Spanish.",
    "Yes, it's important to know Spanish! And the class is not that challenging but gives you good building blocks for future study."
