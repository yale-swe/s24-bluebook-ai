    "If you are looking for a fun class that will expose you to many different types of creative writing, then this class is great. But, if you're looking to seriously improve on either fiction, poetry, or drama writing, then this might not be the most helpful. Each unit is too rushed for you to make any real progress in any area. But, you read a lot of great things and have fun assignments, so its very good overall.",
    "Take it! ENGL 123 is an excellent class everyone should take regardless of your graduation class! - especially with Professor Chapman if she's teaching it. (Don't even hesitate!) The class goes through three genres of creative writing, fiction, poetry and drama, and you get talks from the one of the best people in each genre whenever you start a new one. The course generally involves various readings which are almost always interesting and the exercises involve imitating, to a certain extent, the techniques used by the works read that week. Major works by the students (which you'll eventually use for your portfolio) are work-shopped, and this is a great way for you to get the elaborate opinion of your peers and significantly improve your work. I believe that my writing skills have changed dramatically - pun intended. Working with Professor Chapman is a priceless experience. She's wise and her comments on my humble work pushed me to strive for the best I can present . Class discussions were always lively under her guidance. As in many other courses, your work will be better received the more time you spend on it. Finally, spots are limited, so don't forget to preregister.",
    "This course is good if you want to try writing in multiple forms in a low pressure environment. If you have any interest in creative writing, it's a great place to explore it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in creative writing-- it would perhaps not be good to those not interested in creative writing simply because you do have to do quite a lot of creative writing in the course. It's a broad overview of different types of writing, but is still able to be somewhat in depth within each unit. There's a lot of reading and writing, discussions are great, and you come out of the course a much better writer. Quite a good class.",
    "Overall this class was a strong introduction to creative writing at Yale. If you have experience in any of the different types of writing, it may be a bit repetitive but it's still worth taking.",
    "I highly recommend this class.",
    "English 123 is definitely an enjoyable course. The class really makes it, and it definitely draws a diverse crowd. If there are any drawbacks to the course itself, it's that the variety of experience makes the curriculum difficult -- those new to writing might find the task of writing an 8-page short story without a prompt daunting, whereas those with more experience might find some of the instruction tedious. Overall, though, it's a great course to just get you writing -- you'll definitelt walk away with a solid amount of work.",
    "Highly recommended. Light workload but you'll learn a lot. I took this class with Professor Chapman, and would definitely recommend trying to get into her section. The lectures where all three classes combine can get tedious, but this class is still well worth taking.",
    "Take this if you're at all interested in creative writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, but it is indeed difficult. If you haven't done creative writing, you can be at a disadvantage because many students already have a fair amount of experience with creative writing. However, the class is enjoyable and well taught. The assignments can be difficult but are worth it.",
    "I would summarise it as a course which allows students to explore narrative writing, poetry and drama and provides them with an opportunity to compose a basic creative writing portfolio. I would recommend it if they are interested in practising creative writing, but I would caution against taking it if they have no prior experience in writing, because there isn't much focus on basic writing techniques."
