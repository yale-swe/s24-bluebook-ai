    "It was a lot of information in a very short period of time. I felt that this would have been helpful prior to choosing our first rotation or broken up into smaller chunks.",
    "The 5 minute flash talks are a perfect way to present the labs that are available for rotation students.",
    "Strengths: Talks limited to 5 mins, many different professors talk about their research. It's helpful to know which professors are actively seeking grad students. Weaknesses: Might be a bit better to have them a little earlier on in the semester, and to have more."
