    "I learned how to effectively develop a new way of thinking in order to memorize new vocab and grammar of a new language.",
    "I learned an introduction to the italian language.",
    "I learned the basics of the Italian language, as well as some of the common traditions in Italy.",
    "Through this course, I developed base level ability in the Italian language. I learned to speak, write, read, and comprehend Italian at a beginner level.",
    "Basic Italian conversational skills, speaking confidence, writing ability.",
    "Speaking, listening, and writing in Italian as well as learning aspects of the Italian culture.",
    "Great for grammar and cultural knowledge!",
    "I learned basic Italian",
    "I am now able to communicate in Italian. I am far from fluent, but it is very impressive how much they teach (and you actually learn) im one semester.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was very systematic. All of the units were taught along the same lines. Thus, the course felt very predictable and there were never any surprises. This consistency was comforting. I will say, if you get behind, it is difficult to catch up. Not because of the professor but just because the class is fast-moving.",
    "The course moves a bit fast and some students are more ahead of others at the start.",
    "Simona is a sweetheart! I enjoyed our projects. The textbook is very good but also expensive.",
    "It is very interactive which is good for learning a language. You can't fall behind because there are constant tests and lessons everyday which can punish you if you are not up to date with content.",
    "A big strength of this course was the fact that it met everyday. This allowed much more time to speak and work with the language beyond just worksheets.",
    "Strengths: Simona was amazing, the course was well organized and hard enough to push you without stressing you out too much. Weaknesses: not enough spoken Italian. I don't feel very confident speaking at this point.",
    "Meeting everyday of the week was helpful, for it was constant practice. However, the course was taught at a very fast pace compared to other languages.",
    "Great course!!",
    "Very active, very effective. Not too much work, you actually learn in class. No weaknesses, just perfect.",
    "Tests were much more frequent than expected but I liked the class and how it was taught."

    "Yes absolutely. Simona is great and the structure of the course was quite strong.",
    "Yes. Italian was hard but fun to learn.",
    "Yes! Simona is wonderful. I thought the course was interesting and the exams were totally fair.",
    "If you want to learn Italian I think that this is the best way to do it, but don't take it if you aren't willing to put in the commitment to learning a new language.",
    "I would recommend this course, it was a very enjoyable course and there is a big community of Italian speakers to connect with on campus.",
    "Yes! Italian is wonderful, the department is so caring and lovely, and the subject is engaging without being stressful.",
    "Yes I would because not only does it fulfill the language requirement, it also is a really interesting language surrounded by great culture.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes! It's a lot of fun and you learn so much without suffering.",
    "no",
    "Yes, it was challenging but enjoyable and I learned a lot"
