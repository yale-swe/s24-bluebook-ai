    "German L2 is still very much like L1. You are using the same text and the lessons are an extension of first semester. It is a very in-depth look at the grammar, vocabulary, and cultural context of German and the text is very thorough: providing students with resources throughout the chapters. I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "This a great class if you have the L1 German skills. It is basically an extension of the same class. There's not much else to say about it.",
    "Yes, take it if you would like to learn German. I have taken several languages at yale and I must say, German is my favourite. Such a great language."
