    "ENGL 126 is a requirement for any English majors, so most of us have to take it. That said, it's a great foundation for future study in poetry, and in English in general--the close study of poetry and the highlights of its history allows us to really hone in on the mechanics of the English language in a way that allows for more productive reading and writing in the future. I would reccomend it with Prof. Reed, as he is knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches.",
    "The better half of the poetry series.",
    "Yes, Professor read takes a different angle from a lot of the other professors (and includes Omeros, which is fantastic) but I'd make sure to check in on the class during shopping week to see if you like his teaching style.",
    "If you're planning on majoring in English, you don't really have a choice. If you're not, this is probably more interesting then 125. Be ready for a lot of reading. You have 5 papers and a final, which are manageable but not incredibly easy. I would look around to see what professors have a background in to figure out what they might focus on. For instance, Professor Reed teachers Omeros every time, which none of the other professors teach.",
    "Take it if you like the works, don't take it if you don't. Take it if you like hearing kids talk, don't like it if you'd prefer to hear more of the professor's opinion. It's a solid amount of reading and work like all the other major English classes and it's not worth taking the class if you don't plan on investing yourself in the readings and work.",
    "A worthwhile course to take, but I didn't particularly enjoy taking it with Professor Reed. Professor Reed is good at leading discussions, but he felt somewhat condescending. Even though he started out the semester by saying the class was going to be about discussion, not learning the accepted scholarly views on the works, he didn't really take our own opinions seriously. But at the same time, Reed was reluctant to provide the contextual information that is important in understanding a work. So I ended up neither feeling secure in the conclusions reached in class, nor feeling secure in the historical importance and context of these works. For example, Paradise Lost had a lot of political purpose to it, but Professor Reed ignored that completely.In the writing component, he grades with a specific rubric, so that proper formatting is worth 5 points, an original thesis is worth 5 points, and so on. So rather than assigning a grade on the essay overall, we got a specific numeric calculation (You could get, say, an 85.5 on a paper.) He kept getting hung up about the passive voice, and I truly didn't understand what I could do to make my papers better. I never knew what to expect from a grade. It made me feel that the entire process of literary analysis is sort of haphazard, and it discouraged me from becoming an English major, as I had planned.",
    "Slightly better than I imagined it would be. Professor Reed really tries to make the readings relevant and interesting so that you don't come away from the class thinking it's just a dumb prereq. His selections are really thoughtful: for instance, it was nice to be able to read Omeros at the end to get a living, non-white poet into the curriculum while still maintaining the proper tone of the course. However, realize that if you take this class with Reed, you'll have a LOT more reading than some of the other sections, especially in the beginning and end of the semester.",
    "A good introduction to these poets; lively and engaging, even if you don't love English poetry and are only taking this course to fulfill the major; the introduction of Walcott gives a welcome different perspective of a non-white, non-British poet and \"Omeros\" is well-worth studying, even if \"The Waste Land\" is more well known.",
    "This is an absolutely wonderful class. If you aren't an English major, like me, it is more work than you would normally do for a non-major course. But if you're really passionate about the material, you'll love it. Your writing skills will improve immensely--seriously, I've improved so much this semester. If you take it, do it with Professor Reed. He's awesome and will give insightful, attentive, and informative feedback on every assignment.",
    "English 126 07 is an overview of English poets. You read four poets: Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Walcott. Each poet is very different so you get an interesting overview of themes, styles, and techniques. I would definitely recommend this class- it is a prerequisite for the English Major, but even for non-majors it is interesting."
