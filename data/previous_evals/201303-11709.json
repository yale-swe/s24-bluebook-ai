    "I am so glad to have learned Econ in a seminar rather than a lecture, and I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a more personal learning experience.",
    "Yes. It's a great introduction to economics and interesting too.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Yes! Take the class! It's not a lot of work and you learn just as much, if not more than the other Econ sections.",
    "Yes I definitely would. Great class that will give you the basics you need for higher level econ classes or just if you're interested in the material and have never taken an econ class before.",
    "If you do the work and keep up with class and the psets it isn't a difficult class. but if you fall behind, it becomes very hard very fast",
    "Loved the small class size. Work load is manageable. Learn a lot. If Tolga keeps teaching then it is definitely the best introductory Econ class available.",
    "Take it! This course is so important for understanding how money works in the world.",
    "IF YOU CAN, DO IT!Tolga is the best professor at Yale, so whether you think you'll love econ or hate it, you will adore this class.",
    "If you are nervous about taking the intro to micro lecture I would 100% recommend this class. My peers were kind of jerks but tolgq is amazing and it is a very good way to learn the introductory economic concepts",
    "Take this class. Tolga is an amazing professor that will quickly have you praising his teaching methods and overall personality. He makes a boring topic like Economics interesting and applicable to real life. It is also pretty easy to get a good grade in this class if you show up to office hours. I feel pretty transformed after taking this class.",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "I would definitely recommend Economics 108."
