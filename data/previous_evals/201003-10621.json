   "comments": [
    "A moderately technical, highly comparativist and quite academic discussion of welfare policies in developing countries.I would recommend the course only if the student had an identified interest in the subject matter.",
    "It's fascinating but it's really expansive. To get the most out of this course, take good notes while you're reading and during class, then read them again after class to remember what you just discussed. The discussions are an interesting blend of abstract concepts and practical country details, which really pushes your mind to think about a lot at once. I recommend this course if you're interested in public policy, not as a way to learn about the mechanics of policy creation but to understand the broader context that leads to a certain type of policy. Also for students interested in development, this is an important topic for understanding the provision of social services and disparity in human development rooted in macro level government decisions.",
    "This is a good class if you are interested in the theories of social welfare and the historical progression of welfare systems in latin america and east asia. If a student was interested exclusively in the practical implications of welfare systems and not in theory, I would dissuade them from taking this course. Also if they want to focus on welfare policies in Africa I would dissuade them from taking the course. However, I would recommend Prof. Seekings in general, and I would strongly encourage anyone interested in the theories of social welfare policies to take the course."

   "comments": [
    "The course seemed somewhat divorced from other disciplinary conversations about, for example, post-colonial politics, security and reconstruction. As a result, it did not materially contribute to my thesis preparation.",
    "This was immensely relevant in teaching me how social policy develops in poor countries. I think I'd have gotten a little more out of it with a more focused study of a few countries. It's also a helpful overview of what all \"social policy\" entails. I'm not going to be able to use what I learned in this course in a job interview or directly in a job probably, but it gives me interesting background about the sector I plan to work in.",
    "This course helped me to understand the theoretical principles of welfare systems and understand the general global differences in types and histories of welfare policy implementation. Specifically, the final paper that I wrote allowed me to utilize this information to better understand my academic and professional area of interest (development in southern Africa), which helps to support my graduate concentration."
