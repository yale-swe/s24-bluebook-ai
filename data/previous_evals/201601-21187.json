    "good course, would recommend to a friend. but beware: packed with Yale's most obnoxious freshmen",
    "Physics 261 is the counterpart of Physics 260 in the intensive introductory physics sequence, and many of the basic traits of 260 carry over to 261. Professor Baltay is clearly quite knowledgeable and has a wonderful sense of humor. The workload is quite manageable - weekly problem sets plus one midterm and the final exam. The midterm was somewhat challenging but definitely doable, and the final was rather more straightforward. Anna Kashkanova's weekly problem sessions are extremely helpful and cover some interesting problems not discussed in class. 261 picks up more or less where 260 - which covered classical mechanics and electromagnetism as well as special relativity - left off, starting with a discussion of electromagnetic radiation. The remainder of the first half of the course is occupied by an introduction to quantum mechanics, which progresses more or less in the same manner as the theory was initially developed. The formalism of quantum mechanics is mostly left for later courses that focus solely on that subject. In the second half of the course, Professor Baltay presents an introduction to general relativity, formulated more as a field theory than as a purely geometric one. To that end, he starts by developing the covariant formulation of electromagnetism, and then follows a similar procedure to 'motivate' the Einstein field equations without much use of Riemannian geometry. While I feel that I would likely much better understood general relativity if I had more knowledge of Riemannian geometry, 261's field-theoretic introduction definitely made me want to learn more. Overall, I would recommend Physics 261 to another student as it gives you a taste of what could be summarized as \"modern physics.\"",
    "A really really tough class. You need to be prepared to work hard to make sure that you do well in the class. I would recommend the class for a student really interested in physics with a good chunk of time to devote to it. Otherwise, the step down to 181 might be the move.",
    "Do it for the tensors. The math needed is covered within the course, and you get an intro, slightly less hand-wavy than before explanation of wave equations, the Bohr model, and gen relativity, among lots of other material that got covered. And derivations of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, gravitational waves (+ LIGO experiment design), and Hubble's law are thrown in as a bonus!",
    "If you took 260 definitely take it but be prepared to struggle",
    "Don't expect this class to be fulfilling. Expect to understand bits and pieces of general relativity and kind of understand the hundreds of phenomenon related to quantum mechanics. It kills me to say this for a physics class, but I would not recommend this class if you are trying to understand general relativity, but if the fragment of discussion concerning cosmology is worth it to you, by all means take the class.",
    "Good course, but a little bit of a letdown after 260. The workload and difficulty are pretty much exactly the same as 260 however, Prof Baltay tries to cover too much advanced physics material (you do the basics of both quantum mechanics and general relativity including tensor analysis) in too little time, leading to hand-wavy explanations and confusing gaps in the content. I could plug the right numbers in and do the right derivatives on the homework\/exam problems, but feel like I walked away with little to no conceptual understanding of what general relativity is. It's still an enjoyable class, but seems scattered at times.",
    "Phys 261 covers advanced topics that you normally wouldn't find in an intro class, and they are very interesting. If you have taken AP Physics and did well, I strongly recommend this class. General relativity is pretty confusing though.",
    "This class was a lot different from PHYS 260, because we really dont have the math to dive that deeply into quantum mechanics or general relativity. Instead, there was a lot of memorization involved of proofs from the quantum mechanics textbook and Baltays Notes on General Relativity. The final exam was really fair if you memorized the important proofs from his GR notes, but the midterm had two question parts that you could only answer if you attended lecture. The QM was pretty fun, and I have a better understanding of what things like quantum tunneling actually are because of solving Schrodingers equation. The GR content is impossible and no one understood any of it, but thats okay because, again, he only ever asks you to rewrite proofs from the textbook.",
    "Physics 261 is an interesting, though somewhat cursory, physics \"topics\" course. It goes over several fields of modern physics such as Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity in minimal detail, but for me at least it succeeded in making physics appear like an interesting and ever-changing field. I would recommend it to a student with a strong interest in physics and a good background (at least both class in AP Physics C, and ideally Multivariable Calculus as well).",
    "PHYS 261 01 is an advanced physics course for students who want to have physics (or anything related) as a major or simply want the most comprehensive review of physical phenomena. The course is split between quantum mechanics and General Relativity, with the latter accompanied by an complete set of notes by the professor himself toward the subject. The course goes way beyond what is learned in high school physics, teaching new topics such as Fourier Series, solving differential equations through the Schrodinger Equation, Tensor Theory, and waves, and the theories of relativity. This course, in my opinion, should be taken with Differential Equations and possibly with Chemistry to obtain the strongest grasp of the material. That said, this course provides a complete and widely applied review of physics that can support ANY STEM student pursuing the physical or biological sciences, mathematics, or engineering.",
    "Physics 261 is an... interesting course. I would recommend it for a physics major or someone with a strong interest in physics, but I don't think it's worth if you aren't in one of those two categories. We cover QM and GR, both of which are discussed semi-legitimately, but also relatively perfunctorily (because c'mon, how much advanced physics can you do in one semester of a freshman course.) It's not a lot of work, though--I spent about 1-2 hours per week on the psets, except for before the midterm and final, when I spent a lot of time cramming.",
    "I would; it's such a mind-blowing course!",
    "PHYS 261 is significantly harder than 260. The concepts are very interesting but can be difficult to understand, so prepare to put in a fair amount of work out of class into reviewing them. I would recommend 261 to any physics majors, but if you're not interested in physics it would be hard to recommend a class so difficult.",
    "So as far as difficulty goes, PHYS 260 is a cakewalk in comparison to PHYS 261. However, the information covered in PHYS 261 starts to make sense (slowly) over the course of the semester, and the realization comes that the information is actually really cool. The learning curve is certainly higher, but if you're interested in becoming a physics major, then this is definitely the course for you to take, especially if you took PHYS 260 in the first semester.",
    "You get a quick review of a lot of modern physics you already know, plus 261 actually teaches new things, which is what 260 didn't. Electromagnetic radiation, quantum mechanics, general relativity - that last one really shouldn't be here, since it requires tensor analysis and much more patience for bad notation than any freshman ought to have. Take the class anyway, since it's part of the requirements for the physics track you're presumably taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 261. Professor Baltay is a great lecturer, and the subject matter is very interesting. Since it was my first time seeing many of the topics, it definitely takes a little more time on your own to gain a conceptual understanding of the material. It is a great course and office hours and problem sessions are very useful resources.",
    "The general relativity is very interesting if you diligently follow along with Baltay as he scribbles slew after slew of seemingly meaningless symbols on the board for the second half of the semester. The GR is still interesting but much less fun if you learn it all 24 hours before the final exam instead. You have been warned.",
    "If you took 260, you will probably take 261. Baltay's lectures don't change much, so be prepared for the pace to stay rapid even as you move into non-review material. I had seen quantum in high school so that part wasn't too big of a deal for me, but it could be challenging if it's brand new to you. The general relativity unit is very cool, but also very inaccessible. Baltay moves quickly through tensor analysis and into concepts without looking back. I enjoyed the lectures but found it very difficult to draw enough from them to feel really confident for the final. The discussions of cosmology are a lot of fun and I think the class is a good introduction to the physics track. Take it! It's hard but fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to get more than the usual Electricity and Magnetism plus a tiny bit of quantum introduction that you get in other courses, and who really wants to and has time to put in the work. You will have to do a lot of self teaching, but you can get a lot out of it.",
    "Now that you've gotten mechanics and E&M out of the way in 260, Prof. Baltay is free to do whatever he wants in 261. He starts with a tiny bit more E&M - he continues from where you left off in 260 and derives magnetism from Coulomb's Law and special relativity. I loved that section, and it's very meaningful. According to Prof. Baltay, the fact that you can do that is a good argument against magnetic monopoles - since electrically charged particles are sufficient to explain magnetism. The class then moves on to quantum mechanics. There's some interesting material in this section, but the textbook (Krane, Modern Physics) is absolutely awful. Go to class, because there's some relevant stuff (separation of variables in the time-dependent Schrdinger equation) that is not covered in the textbook. You still need it, though, because he assigns problems in it. Most of those problems are kind of annoying. The final section is covariant electromagnetism and general relativity. Teaching general relativity to freshman without a strong math background is completely unheard of, so Prof. Baltay wrote his own \"textbook\" (unpublished), which he gives you for free. He follows the textbook very closely in class. I would STRONGLY recommend bringing it to class, and taking notes in it instead of in a notebook - it makes it much easier to follow what he's doing, and much easier to figure it out again when you're looking through the textbook after class. This section is really interesting - especially the first part, where he shows you how to combine the electric potential and the magnetic vector potential A into a single vector with 4 components. He uses that vector to create a tensor that represents the electromagnetic field. Oh yeah, tensors. These guys are probably the weak link of the GR section. They're sort of like a 2-dimensional matrix, but they have different \"indices\" (which define the dimensions), and the indices can be \"upper\" (superscript) or \"lower\" (subscript). Basically the type of index tells you how to perform certain operations, like summing. He tries to teach you this in 2 classes, and you probably won't understand it 100%. Also, sometimes his \"textbook\" switches upper and lower indices by accident. Just try your best, and ask the smart math people for help if you get confused. Also, protip: if you see any tensors with more than 2 indices, you will probably not understand that material and you probably don't need to worry about it too much for exams. Try your best anyway though. I'd recommend this class if you took 260, but I think 260 was superior. The material in this class makes somewhat less sense (most of it really requires more math\/physics background than you have) and it's harder to follow him. The material, by the way, is definitely harder than 260 (especially if you'd taken AP physics before 260). If you thought 260 was easy, that doesn't mean you should slack off or let your guard up in 261. The material was 100% new for me, and you have to work at it outside of class in order to understand it. I would also caution you that the difficulty of tests is unpredictable. In our year, the 260 midterm was very easy, and I didn't prepare adequately for the midterm in 261. The 261 midterm was incredibly hard and took me completely by surprise. The final, like the 260 final, was fair but not overly difficult. Don't assume that any of this will be the same next year. TL;DR although I preferred 260, I'd still recommend taking this course - as usual, the material is way more interesting than the other intro physics classes.",
    "The course provides a wide introduction to many interesting concepts of modern physics. I would recommend it for people who do not plan to pursue physics further, but I cannot strongly recommend this course for physics majors. The explanations of many concepts were not entirely satisfactory and will be covered later with appropriate detail. It is also not a bad idea to take the course but, consider taking another physics course or exploring a different area instead.",
    "Lots of derivations that I don't really know what to do with. They're cool and I like to know that I can write them down, but it felt that only GR was really practical. I liked it.",
    "This is a relatively easy class with only a few challenging moments. Expect to spend less than 6 hours per week on this class, including lecture time. Most of the time and effort you DO have to put into the class will be trying to compensate for incomprehensible explanations and understand apparently unmotivated jumps in logic. The TA in my year, Anna, was fantastic. Utilize her office hours -- they will give you a great representation of what midterms and finals will look like. If you are deciding between 200\/201 and 260\/261, expect in the 200s a much more fleshed-out experience, with a great deal more work. You will probably learn more in the 200s. The 260s, weirdly, might actually be easier. If you are clearly qualified for 260\/261 (all the relevant physics background, a comfort with multivariable and applying it to physics) then you should take 410. Skip the intro sequence all-together. No one will tell you can do so, but no one will stop you. Save yourself from wasting a year with poor teaching and useless pseudo-explanations of topics you will have to really understand at a later point anyways.",
    "261 has a bad rep -- and it shouldn't. People say that QM and GR shouldn't be taught because freshmen don't have the math to grasp these concepts in full, but that's not the point. Baltay's class gives an introductory overview to these subjects and does a fantastic job at that. Very enjoyable if you put the time into it that it deserves.",
    "A really great physics course! Very engaging material all throughout. PSets are (generally) easier than first semester, although tests are harder. General Relativity is hard to understand, but ask Anna a lot of questions - she is very helpful.",
    "Would recommend to any student interested in physics who would like a challenge. Goes pretty in depth in concepts beyound mechanics or E&M so likely to be new material.",
    "I would recommend physics 260-261 to students who have a strong background in physics and are interested in learning about modern physics and where research is being focused on right now. However physics 261 is really a survey course of quantum, general relativity and cosmology, so you won't gain an in depth understanding of the material rather you will just be introduced to a lot of material.",
    "Dr. Baltay's wild ride 2, quantum\/relativistic boogaloo. I found second semester to be harder and more confusing than the first. It is anyones guess what will be on any exams, many things will be proclaimed as \"obvious\", and sign errors will be had. In many ways the material was rewarding, but try to actually keep up with class (there was some stuff on the midterm not in Krane but in lecture). Krane is also significantly worse than Taylor or Griffith, and the psets feel more like busy work. Despite all of this, I'm still happy to have taken the class- you learn a lot on some pretty wild things, and I like Dr. Baltay a lot.",
    "You will learn about the most beautiful theories of our universe: quantum mechanics and general relativity. The midterm was probably the hardest test I've ever taken. Psets don't take too long. Have fun, and don't worry about the negative signs when doing tensor analysis.",
    "Physics 261 is a good follow up to physics 260. It introduces quantum mechanics and general relativity. If you expect an in depth treatment of both subjects, just remember that he is splitting the semester between the two. The quantum mechanics half of the term is pretty straightforward and out of the textbook. His general relativity lectures are definitely more difficult and he does not go into great detail, but that is because the subject is so vast and complex. Overall, it is a good course. The exams are a bit harder than those in 260.",
    "This is a really bad course. The quantum mechanics is perhaps oversimplified and poorly explained, conceptually. That, however, I can deal with. The really painful part of this course is the general relativity section. First of all tensors are explained poorly, and derivatives of tensors are not really defined clearly, partly because it's never explained (i.e. defined) how you take the derivative of something with respect to the component of a tensor anyway. Whatever, that sort of terrible abuse of\/to mathematics I can take. The real issue I have with the general relativity unit is that the whole unit is thoroughly broken because not once does it mention the idea of a manifold, or a tensor field. Both of which are vital to the concept of general relativity. Nor is a reference frame defined. What is a freely falling reference frame anyway? Presumably you begin with a time-like geodesic, but how do you expand the curve to a nhood with a homeomorphism\/diffeomorphism to an open subset of R^4 or even (hopefully) Minkowski space, R^{3+1} ideally preserving the metric tensor field in such a way as to make the original time-like curve the t axis, and every x,y,z plane a space-like hypersurface when pulled back into the original manifold. Now how exactly do we relate two different coordinate frames that are far enough apart that there's no coordinate frame that contains both of them? How do we measure long distances between objects? To be honest, I've actually got some reasonable guesses about the answers to these questions, because I ended up teaching myself a lot about Riemannian\/Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, covariant derivatives, and the curvature tensors. But honestly what I got out of this class was finding out what the stuff that I wasn't learning in the class was, and then teaching myself that stuff. It would be a better use of students' time to scrap this class and have the students take two classes, one in QM and another one in GR. One semester isn't enough time to cover both.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another if they found that the overall structure of PHYS 260 was a good fit for their learning style, or they have a strong desire to learn more about modern physics. The problem sets and exams on average are easier than in PHYS 260, but the material is harder to understand on a conceptual level, and it could be easy to become a matter of recognizing the equation needed rather than understanding a problem. The class teaches a lot of derivations, and the material for studying can feel a little extensive when trying to remember several derivations, but overall the class is doable if the time is put in, and the grading policy is fair."
