    "Absolutely. The topic sounds a little bit boring, but, for that reason, it ends up being a very small seminar and Prof. Huzzey is great. The workload is about the same as any history junior seminar, but, instead of one large paper, there are three smaller ones. Be warned, though, the papers are to be done in 1.5 spacing, which isn't stated on the syllabus.",
    "There is a lot of reading but it is manageable if you get a headstart over the weekend. There are only 3 papers which aren't bad. Don't expect to get a lot of help for the papers.",
    "Though the topic might seem mundane, the course is definitely worth taking. Professor Huzzey is fantastic, and you will have a better understanding of not just representation, but about politics as a whole.",
    "You should take the class\/",
    "I do recommend it, especially for students with some interest in British government or in representative government, but I don't think a background in either is necessary to enjoy or appreciate the class."
