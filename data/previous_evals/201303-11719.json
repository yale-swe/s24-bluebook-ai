   "comments": [
    "If you have a strong math background (i.e. you have already done 200 level math) and you are interested in the proof behind ideas in economics, then this class might be for you.The difficulty in this course is that the material can be very dry, and the material we learn in class is very different from what appears on the problem sets and exams. Never have I been in a class where I understand everything as we are moving through the material in lecture, but then have absolutely no idea how to approach problems on the problem set.",
    "The mathematical foundation of microeconomics finally makes sense (in contrast with Udry's unwillingness to take derivatives). I thought the first half of the course on consumer theory was well taught, but the second half was less focused\/more hand-wavy, in part because we skipped the section on game theory. The problem sets are harder than the midterm.",
    "Not a hard course - the math involved isn't really what is used in mathematical economics because most undergraduates haven't take real analysis. The class is curved generously as well and problem sets generally take less than 3 hours. It's definitely possible to take this course without any prior economics if you have a strong enough math background.",
    "I wish I could get paid thousands of dollars for standing in front of a group of people twice a week for 75 minutes and reading out of a book. I hope Zvika never comes back to teach at Yale; this class was a travesty.",
    "Solid groundwork for microeconomics but didn't like the fact that it skipped game theory and went straight to information economics. If you don't want to mix yourself with the typical intermediate micro crowd, then take it.",
    "This class was terrible. What Prof. Neeman taught during his lectures was very different from the actual material on the exams. He did not post any practice problems for the exams and when students asked him about additional practice materials he said that we should do more problems from otherTEXTBOOKS. How were we supposed to know what problems to solve from \"other\" textbooks (he did not offer textbook suggestions)?? I wasn't even able to check my answers for problems from 'other textbooks' because most textbooks don't even have solutions. Complete mess and chaos. Terrible. Don't take it with Neeman!",
    "Take intermediate micro.",
    "Econ 125 is a theoretical treatment of microeconomics. It approaches microeconomics in mathematical way, and covers a wide range of material from demand and utility to general equilibrium at a swift pace. Be prepared to work hard and spend several hours on psets in order to grasp the material. If you're thinking about taking this course know that the approach is rather rigorous and that you will need to work a lot of stuff out in your free time. If you aren't looking for that this course is not for you.",
    "Could have been an interesting class but the professor just stood at the board copying the book onto the white board. Not very helpful at all.",
    "Econ 125 was taught by a new professor this semester, and was significantly different than it has been in the past. Lectures often stayed very theoretical, leaving you to figure out how to actually apply concepts on psets. However psets were rarely too long, and graded pass\/fail, so that was never too stressful. While not as time-intensive as when it was taught the year before me, it should be noted that this meant a large portion of students' grade is determined by the midterm and final. These tests were not unreasonable, but be warned that while most of the people in my class studied by memorizing axioms and conditions and stuff like that, the tests ended up being not theoretical at all, instead testing out ability to do calculations.",
    "Since Neeman is a visiting professor, this evaluation is probably irrelevant. Nevertheless, if he is for whatever reason teaching it again, note that while the first half of the course is very manageable (though not so much the midterm exam), the second half takes off like an elephant on rocket skates. The general equilibrium is OK, but the asymmetric information lectures gradually made less and less sense, even though some interesting results did show through at times.",
    "This class is really hard, and the final is way too heavily weighted. Professor Neeman's lectures can feel choppy and not well thought out, and he didn't cover as much material as planned. Take it if you have to.",
    "Unless you are looking for a highly theoretical examination of economic theories that focus on minute details that tend to obscure larger applications, I would not recommend it.",
    "Econ 125 is no walk in the park. If you really want to learn what microeconomics is all about, how economists actually approach and treat the subject, then take this class. Note that the class will require you to think like a mathematician because the course builds the subject from the most basic mathematical constructs. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t super impressed with my intro courses, but this class has turned me into an econ major. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truly fascinating to see how we try to model human behavior with analytical tools.",
    "Attention: if you do not enjoy abstract thinking and much prefer application and calculation, then this course is not for you.Although not emphasized anywhere, it helps to know multivariate calculus and there are parts of the course where linear algebra would help.However, I took the course while taking Math 120 and before taking linear algebra and I was fine.",
    "This course requires a lot of critical thinking - intuition about fundamental economic principles is very important.",
    "It's a more mathematically rigorous intermediate microeconomics course, but someone with experience with linear algebra and multivariable calculus shouldn't find the math too difficult. I thought it was rewarding to build the (often complicated) principles of economics from very basic assumptions.",
    "I'm assuming Prof. Neeman won't be teaching this again, so some general advice instead of a rant: if you take this, make sure to consult some kind of intermediate textbook if you actually want to learn how to solve problems (especially with general equilibrium and information economics). Not a fun class. Ignore the proofs. You really won't be tested on them (or I guess, probably not?)",
    "Extremely hard but a useful introduction to the sort of math and rigor expected at econ grad schools. I liked Professor Neeman; he's funny and did a decent job of explaining the rather arcane material. Do not attempt without a strong math background."
