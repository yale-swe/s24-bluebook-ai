   "comments": [
    "I think that it is a generally good course, but I think that it should be longer than 50 minutes because I don't think that you can learn a language in only 50 minutes per day",
    "Strengths: Profesora Sab made the class enjoyable and interesting, improving students' capacity to learn. Weaknesses: Near the end of the class, students were required to read a novel in Spanish. While the novel was interesting and helpful, it was overwhelming to read 3-4 chapters a night and answers multiple comprehension questions. It made it easy to forget about the quality of reading the book but rather felt like a rushing job.",
    "I thought the syllabus had too many assignments, too much homework, and too many assessments.",
    "For the most part this course is extremely well-organized for learning. However, there are some days that have a very heavy workload and some that have nothing at all. This strategy of distribution is unhelpful to students and has no benefit in terms of learning. Also, when we got to the novel that we read, \"Relato de un Naufrago\", there was way too much to do every day. Every student in the class had to spend multiple hours every day reading and then answering an exorbitant amount of questions that we did not ever review in class. We also read the whole thing in five days, so it was easy to fall behind and then impossible to catch up. This week happened to land on tech week for my play, so I missed a day of reading and then was unable to get back to where I needed to be. They need to readjust the syllabus to improve all of this, but at the same time, much of the way the syllabus functions is a huge strength of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend it because I think that Spanish is a helpful language to learn",
    "Yes, Spanish is quintessential in the world, and Spanish L3 helps to improve fluidity in the language.",
    "I would. Although the course is likely required to fulfill a distributional requirement, it did help improve my conversational ability.",
    "Yes, most people have to take it for the requirement, so if you have to take L3, try your hardest to get Profe Sabe! She is a gem."
