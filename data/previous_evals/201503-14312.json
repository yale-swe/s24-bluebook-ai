   "comments": [
    "A great lecture that balances the history of Islam and its impact on contemporary issues. More than anything, you're going to have a great professor who is actually invested in what you get out of the class. She always made herself available, and was a very accommodating teacher. The benefit to work ratio is the highest I have had in any class at Yale.",
    "One of the most relevant classes I have ever taken. This course is a must-take given our geopolitical situation--it will make you a smarter person, and will get you more in-touch with a religion and culture that is often portrayed as homogenous. Take it!",
    "Overview of Islamic political history from the start until present day. Class goes over the earlier material in the first half of the course, then focuses more on the present political climate in the second half. Readings could be better, and the essays are a bit dry, but it's information that's great to help a student understand the an Islamic world that clearly has a major presence in everyday American life.",
    "An excellent course. You learn so much about the history of Islamic thought and the politics of the Islamic world, you should take it simply for the eye-opening experience. But on top of that Professor Stephens is so vivacious and enthusiastic, so youll have lots of fun even beyond the cool subject matter. Neither the readings nor the paper are too heavy, though you shouldnt neglect them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "This is one of the best history classes I have taken at Yale. Prof. Stephens is excited about the material and covers a lot of history by focusing thematically on the material.",
    "This class really helped me understand current events through a new lens. The workload was not too bad, and all the material was exciting to me. It has enabled me to have better informed discussions about Islam in politics today.",
    "Amazing course. Learned so much. It covers a lot of material in great breadth and depth while remaining fascinating and relevant all the way through. The course offers on top of all of this information a framework within which to understand not only the material, but also the different political and religious opinions and allegiances at stake in the topics discussed. As someone who was relatively foreign to the subject, I was impressed by the impartiality with which the texts and sources were treated and the freedom which the professor and TF gave to students to express their own views and opinions, even--and perhaps especially--those that diverged from the handful of analyses offered in lecture. Take the course. Just do it.",
    "You learn about everything regarding politics and Islam - you learn about all of the ancient empires and how Islam was once used in politics and you see the shifts over time on how it has been used in political systems up until today's times. I would highly recommend this class because while you learn so much in just a semester, everything you learn really helps you to truly understand Islam in politics and it is taught in such a fun and exciting way that it is definitely a must take class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It's a perfect survey of Islamic history that I think many students lack, and it provides incredible insight for anyone looking for a deeper understanding of the world we live in.",
    "Every Yale student should take this course. With its easy workload and approachable proffesor, this course is good for anyone wishing to decipher the variant images presented of Islam in the news. Because it does not require previous experience with Islam, it is a good course for Freshmen or any upper classman that wishes to become well versed in a unique subject without much academic pressure.",
    "Would recommend to anyone! Really relevant material presented in an interesting way",
    "Yes",
    "This class is a must take. It was interesting and relevant to now.",
    "Informative, engaging, and easy - take it.",
    "You are going to learn about the religion of Islam and the political, economic and social developments surrounding it since its inception. While this sounds like a daunting task, the course is taught in such a way that is light and incredibly interesting. There are only two papers and a final so the class is very do-able. For anybody looking for a very intriguing humanities credit like me, I give this class two thumbs up.",
    "Take this class!! Even if you don't like history, you will like this class. It's not as much history as it is about understanding the modern day, which is always important, and particularly with this subject.",
    "Overall, I would recommend the class to another student. If you not learned about Islam in other classes, this class will provide a good introductory background to history, theory and modern use by terrorist groups. If you have already learned about Islam, you could probably get away with not going to class. The professor and TA's are all very good and the workload (2 5-page papers and a final) is very manageable. Be careful about the grading though, it can be a bit arbitrary at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It provides a basic grounding for Islam for those who know little to nothing about it. It's been really fascinating to learn the material and in a easy-to-understand way. Great class overall.",
    "An introduction to Islamic law and political theory spanning from the beginning of the faith to the 21st century. It's a good class for getting an impressionistic understanding of the Middle East's history and how that impacts events today.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE NEWS AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU! Prof. Stephens is one of the sweetest people out there, and she puts in a ton of time and effort into her lectures\/teaching materials\/blog posts\/... what does this woman not do???? The class provides a very unbiased look at a complex concept\/topic that is often construed in a very biased and narrow manner.",
    "Great class, gives context to current global situations. The class is pretty pro-Islam, which is important for fighting Islamophobia, but don't expect much critique of Islam.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Not only because I really liked Professor Stephen's teaching, but because it is an extremely important topic for people to be educated on.",
    "Excellent, interesting class. It's probably better for freshmen, as it's not particularly difficult or challenging. The readings weren't always applicable, and the workload is light enough that older students may find themselves wanting a little bit more. While it starts off a little slow, this class is set up so people do well.",
    "Political Islam was a great class for people who do not have prior knowledge about Islam or in Middle Eastern history. It is a really interesting class, and Professor Stephens really makes an effort to get to know her students. The work load was not very heavy, and the lectures are quite interesting.",
    "Great, interesting class.",
    "Wholeheartedly",
    "Take it! You learn so much and Professor Stephens is really great!",
    "Political Islam was a great introduction to this religion and the region where it is predominantly found. The emphasis on past and present created great connections within the material. Professor Stephens is fantastic, and her lectures were always interesting. Definitely take this class if you have any interest in learning about Islam!",
    "Perfect class to take if you want to understand in a more nuanced way the dynamics within the Islamic world as well as interactions between the Islam and the rest of the world.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Definitely! It's for sure something that you don't know that much about and this is an overall amazing survey of the topic.",
    "Great class. I would definitely suggest this class if you want a more comprehensive understanding of how Islam and politics became involved and how current events are or aren't linked to history. It's not a gut, but the workload is manageable for a fifth class probably, although I didn't do that.",
    "Very engaging class, not too difficult but really makes you think. Great if you want a better understanding of the middle east, and I would recommend this class to any grade as a class to take before they graduate, especially in light of current events.",
    "Yes--a good MMES class that doesn't just focus on ISIS or violent extremism, which is a hot topic but not the sum total of what there is to learn about the MENA region. I also appreciated that Professor Stephens expanded the concept of \"Political Islam\" beyond Arab states and that she gave weight to culture and art as reflective of and a influencer of the body politic. The workload is pretty reasonable--two short papers and a final exam, plus section participation. Highly recommended.",
    "Highly recommend, learned a lot as a Muslim. Not biased for or against Islam and very insightful.",
    "A must take course during any student's time at Yale. It will change your perspective on the Middle East and challenge you to think about issues related to militant Islamism in a different way. I'm so glad that I took this course given the current issues unfolding in the Middle East.",
    "Take it! Stephens is a great lecturer. You'll look at a wide range of topics that fall under \"political Islam,\" from the writings of Islamist thinkers to Sufi rock bands. Really gave me a better understanding of current events.",
    "TAKE IT. This was an incredible class- Professor Stevens is an engaging teacher who goes out of her way to get to know each individual in the lecture and always makes herself available to meet with them. When I had to miss a number of lectures, Professor Stevens sat with me for an HOUR AND A HALF and went through each slide of each lecture, filling me in on what I had met. The material is fascinating and provides both a history of political Islam, as well as new perspectives on the study of Islam and politics. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone at all interested at all in Islam, politics, or both!",
    "Take it if you're interested in a solid overview of Islam's interaction with politics throughout history without too much stress. Key word- overview - it's not too in depth but you definitely walk away being able to debunk some of the pretty dumb misconceptions about Islam that are being thrown about these days. TLDR interesting, lots of video clips in lecture, not too much work",
    "Great overview of the development of Islam into the many different forms that it has taken on today. Easy to understand the roots and the reading, particularly the primary sources, are really fascinating. Professor Stephens has an incredible background with the material and is able to field any question on the matter. Her unique approach to teaching Political Islam may not help you understand all of the nuances in the Middle East today, but it will certainly help you trace the roots of how these views came to life. Worth taking for anyone who wishes to learn more about the Middle East without having a ton of terms and wars thrown at you.",
    "Great survey of the political and ideological movements in Islam, from Muhammad to present-day. It will change the way you view issues in the Middle East\/areas where Islam is the dominant religion. It will change your perception of Islam by actually giving you an accurate and fair representation of the religion from multiple perspectives.",
    "Phenomenal course. One of the best I have taken at Yale, if not THE best. The History department at Yale is incredible. Do not miss this extremely current and informative course.",
    "Great class, lectures are interesting and the teachers want to facilitate interesting discussion. Also, not very hard ;)",
    "A great survey course on Islam. Covered the basics of Sha'ria law, explained its historical and modern interactions with politics, gave a good survey of Islamic empires and governments, thoroughly explained the rise of Islamic and Islam-influenced politics today essentially, a huge body of material, presented well by Professor Stephens (engaging lecturer) and condensed well thematically by the time you get to the final exam.",
    "This class is a fun course, with lectures that are engaging and very interesting. The course is also very timely because of everything going on in the Middle East right now. For example, in the latter half of the class we focused extensively on the Islamic State, which continues to be brought up in the media more and more. Professor Stephens puts a lot of time and effort into trying to help people succeed. I would absolutely recommend this to everyone.",
    "With Political Islam, you get the best of both worlds: a comprehensive overview of Islam throughout the ages and a debate about its evolving and controversial role in modern society. I would highly recommend this course to any student at Yale University regardless of academic interest since its material is highly relevant to all global citizens of the 21st century."
