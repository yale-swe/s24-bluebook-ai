    "(On Question 1) I think the course is structured well and the topics covered are important for students focusing on coastal issues. I struggled a bit with some of the readings, which occasionally didn't feel especially related to the discussions we had in class. We were also assigned a lot of reading, which was manageable, but it sometimes seemed like there wasn't a clear connection between some of the readings and the general \"topic\" for the day.",
    "I thought there were way too many readings assigned for each class meeting. Also, many of the readings were relatively unnecessary for the conceptual goals of the course. I also think it would've been nice to have more guidance and how we were to lead the course on days where we were assigned to do so. Finally, I feel that despite the Ghana project be an interesting exercise, we probably could have done an even better job or we given a folder of resources to examine ourselves. Not just literature on Ghana but the many examples of CRC literature that we found relatively late in the process of writing our proposals and appendices.",

    "Great discussions, insight into policy process, small class group work",
    "I really enjoyed the discussions we had in class debating various policy approaches to problems in coastal management. Those were especially useful to me because I got to hear a lot of viewpoints from other students with diverse backgrounds\/experience.",
    "I just think the best part about this course is that we get to focus in on policy related to just water in coastal spaces. This is incredibly valuable in that it avoids the need to study lots of other things as well. That said, I feel the way in which we focused in on certain policies or not wasn't really made clear, and I'm not sure that the readings we had for each class oppose the right questions and analysis of these policies.",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps less readings per person for the purposes of presentation.",
    "Reading load each week is extremely heavy, often making it difficult to complete all of them. Would recommend paring down the readings to only the most significant or dividing readings into necessary and recommended.",
    "I think the class itself needs a little clearer structure in terms of the readings and what students are expected to bring to the table at each class meeting. I was sometimes frustrated that we were assigned a lot of reading, and some of the readings didn't seem to necessarily pertain that much to the overall policy discussions in class. I think the class could be improved by selecting readings that may provide a little more \"bang-for-buck\" so that students can complete the readings closely and come to class with substantive comments for discussion, rather than trying to complete a large amount of reading that touches on many different and only somewhat interrelated topics.",
    "Weekly class meetings: too many readings, not enough information on what to focus on... Often didn't feel like we were getting to where we're supposed to in class ends up being more circular discussion. This can be kind of frustrating a policy class. Ghana project: not really enough guidance or help with research to improve our final product",
    "Less readings. Final project should be decided individually depending on students interests"

I think generally I derived a lot of useful knowledge from this course that I will find valuable in my career.",

    "Advantages included drawing on knowledge from students with different areas of expertise and experience, and having individuals you could count on to provide feedback on your own contributions throughout the course of the project. Disadvantages included a general struggle with the directions that we had and the deliverables we were expected to produce, and the usual scheduling conflicts that inevitably crop up when students are working outside of class as part of a team.",
    "I liked working in a group for this project because it really made sense to split up the analyses. However, I feel that the final product of our efforts didn't completely reflect the work many of us put in. We had a limited amount of time and I think this and document creation could have benefited from more time. But we had little time available to spend on it by the time we were supposed to turn it in. I think by the end of the semester people were overwhelmed.",

    "Ask a lot of questions so that you can get a clearer sense of what is expected. The readings can be broad, so it's important that you work to derive your own lessons\/themes from them and determine how those themes pertain to the general topic for discussion.",
    "Just know what you're getting into. The professor of this course is super knowledgeable in coastal policy, but the course at least this year was very free-form without a lot of guidance. So just think if you're the type of person that likes or doesn't like this style of course. If the Ghana climate finance project continues I think this is a valuable exercise, but needs more work from the professors and providing guidance and support throughout the project.",
