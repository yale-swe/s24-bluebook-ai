    "This course does a great job of laying the foundations for reading, writing, and speaking Persian. The professor was very willing to answer questions and did a great job of providing feedback on our work.",
    "Yes! Depending on your reasons for learning the language. It is definitely not an easy class, but you learn extremely quickly and Prof. Shayesteh is great. I repeat, it is a lot of work, especially L2, but well worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning Persian.",
    "If you're serious about learning Persian, then take it. Just do so recognizing in advance that you have to log the hours and stay on top of your workload to get a decent grade."
