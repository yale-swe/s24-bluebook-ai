    "Summary - A thought-provoking view of the basics and applications of thermodynamics and transformation kinetics where you will get the opportunity to interact with classmates and enhance your technical presentation skills.Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Jan is an excellent instructor, and the nature of the course is suited to actually learning material well.",
    "This course is pretty useful and interesting for engineering and applied science students. It covers a lot of things which may be helpful for many researches. I would strongly recommend this course to the future students!",
    "Yes, if anyone is interested in this area.",
    "I highly recommend this class to any student that would like to obtain a good knowledge in the fundamentals of phase transitions with an engineering point ofview. The math is light and leaving room for discussions on the physical meaning of the concepts introduced. This class is coupled to 1 or 2 sessions in which prof. Schroers brings everybody in his own lab to show in live what we just learnt! As an overall assessment I would highly recommend this class to anybody interested in the material science part of the engineering department.",
    "definitely, I could learn some knowledge without so much workload."

    "This course is directly applicable to my research in terms of building a solid foundation in both fundamentals and existing research, and the technical presentations are the most real-world application that I have seen of any course at Yale thus far.",
    "Thiscourse deepened my understanding about thermodynamics and solidification behavior of metal alloys very well. All these make a considerable contribution to my research!",
    "This class as stated above has been very helpful for my dissertation. Furthermore, the point of view adopted in this class made us discover some of the major papers that built the field through the last decades.",
    "I now have some basic understanding of this phase transition."
