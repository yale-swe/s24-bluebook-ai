   "comments": [
    "I was exposed to lots of reading material that I have never read before. I gained a lot of knowledge about the historical remnants of slavery and the way that slaver, prisons, and ghettos have an incredibly intertwined and traceable history.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Over the course of the semester, I developed an understanding of an alternate narrative of American history. This understanding, based in the radical margins of society, is grounded in the experiences of black people in the three interwoven systems of oppression outlined in the class's title. The class moves from the rise of slave racial capitalism based on plantation cotton through to convict leasing, redlining, the prison industrial complex, and mass incarceration. It's a fantastic outline of the history of systematic oppression of black people in the U.S., and it's critical material to study for anyone interested in racial justice, education, housing, poverty, labor, or any other aspect of American society.",
    "I learned so much about the systems of power and punishment in the United States and the ways that the criminal justice system contributes to and even exacerbates the racial hierarchy in this country. This course is increasingly relevant in today's society, and it is incredibly vital to understand the ways the foundations of the carceral system, their development from slavery, and their role in modern society."

   "comments": [
    "I think a real strength is what we read. That said, I think the weekly reading amount was rather high. I think this meant that a lot of students in the class only did part of the reading, which left class discussion a little slow. I would recommend cutting down the reading a little bit.",
    "The readings are definitely the major strength of the course. Some were very dense, but for the most part they provoked critical thought and engagement with tough issues, sometimes even a questioning of long-held beliefs. The discussions helped to make sense of the readings and tie ideas together, and I often learned a lot from my classmates.",
    "I think this class is great the way it is. One of the best parts was how dynamic and flexible it was in incorporating new material and changing the syllabus.",
    "I think that it could be helpful to breakdown some more counter arguments to the authors that we read to help contextualize the readings. Overall, we read some very interesting pieces and had interesting conversation."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in a deeper historical understanding of America. The course material also ties in immensely with current discussions surrounding criminal justice, which may be of interest to students.",
    "If you want to begin to understand mass incarceration, police brutality, or urban educational and housing inequity, a background in the historical development of racial oppression is fundamental. This class demands not just intellectual but ideological engagement and likely a fundamental questioning of deeply held American beliefs. The rewards of this engagement are abundant, though, and I couldn't be more happy that I took the class. It was a period of constant critical thinking and one of the best learning experiences of my life.",
    "Definitely would recommend. A really great class if you want a survey of all 3 spaces and a greater understanding of their connections",
    "I would not recommend this course. I was really interested in the subject matter and while the readings were interesting the seminar itself was poorly run and largely un-engaging.",
    "I think that it could be helpful to breakdown some more counter arguments to the authors that we read to help contextualize the readings. Overall, we read some very interesting pieces and had interesting conversation.",
    "This class's readings and discussion blew my mind countless times and shattered what I had previously thought of the role of incarceration in the United States throughout history. This is an absolutely must-take course, I wish it was required for graduation. Don't miss it!"
