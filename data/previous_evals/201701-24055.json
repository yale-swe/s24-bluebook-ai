   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the current state of the American agricultural industry and how the government's subsidization of particular crops, such as industrial corn, have contributed to the rise of obesity in the country. I learned about different modes and techniques of documentary film making, as well as the styles I personally prefer to watch. I developed my creative writing skills through the paper assignments and Ian's leniency in letting me go off on a more creative trajectory.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze the food documentaries and academic sources about the food system. From seafood and land-based agriculture to food deserts and high fructose corn syrup, this class delved into topics that I had not studied before.",
    "I realized I only eat garbage :(",
    "This class helped me to critically evaluate modern issues in food systems. Apart from gaining a better understanding of documentaries, I learned the most effective ways to communicate messages via film.",
    "Very useful and interesting information about food systems is shared through documentaries.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the food system, sustainability, and agriculture, in a way that made me form stronger and more detailed opinions about issues in these fields. I also practiced sharing opinions and thoughts about these issues and discussing them in relation to broader themes."

   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was great, I learned a ton and enjoyed it thoroughly. The strengths: the material and Professor Cheney and guest conversations. Weaknesses: that it's over now :(",
    "Strengths: Great documentaries to watch and articles\/books to read (loved Michael Pollan's work). Not a heavy coarse load. Creative, diverse and fun essay assignments. Fair grading. Weaknesses: Class discussion wasn't particularly engaging. There wasn't any central questions to guide the discussion so consequently there were a lot of random tangents going on. While in some aspects it's nice how flexible and nonchalant Ian is, at other times I found myself wanting more feedback and more communication. I spent quite a lot of time on my papers and got very little feedback on them, which makes it hard to know what specifically I did well with and what I need to work on. For me as well, the class was way more focused on talking about the food issues in America, as opposed to specifically discussing the documentaries we watched from more of a film perspective. I'm really interested in documentary production and so I would have preferred to spend less time talking about the food issues and more about the way the films were constructed and how that affected the message being imparted. In addition, the title of the class shouldn't be food and documentary, because food suggests it could be an exploration of different types of foods and cuisines and restaurants and more cultural aspects around food and eating. When in fact it was all about food sustainability, which is a particular aspect to food but not all of it. So the title of the class should be more specific to give a better idea of what the class will actually be focused on.",
    "This class is kind of like a survey course on food and agriculture--really interesting if you don't know much about that stuff, but probably boring for someone who already knows a lot about it.",
    "Amazing course with really great diversity of course material",
    "The course was pretty focused around discussion. Even though that's pretty interesting I would rather hear more of Ian's opinions.",
    "This class is a gem. The class is only strong.",
    "It's only weakness is that the professor is not around more to teach more.",
    "I loved the format of this course. This is the only course I have taken at Yale that had weekly film screenings, which was a very different experience for me, but I loved exploring this different medium and found it a very powerful and interesting way to look at the topics we discussed. The weekly seminar discussion sections were very engaging and fun. No weaknesses in my opinion!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is a Yale gem!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class but with a number of caveats. If you are someone who enjoys a more fluid and relaxed class environment then Ian's style of leading discussion will suite you. However, if you prefer more structure and don't enjoy when the conversation is going off on tangents, constantly, then this might not be for you. I would also say that the title of the class could be misleading. If you're interested in food sustainability and the American food system, then you'll love the topics of the documentaries and focus of class discussion. However, this is not a class about food per say and there's very little discussion about the documentaries as pieces of film and art in their own right.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for something low-key. Ian is really laid back and the workload is super low. Pretty interesting material, but it does get a bit repetitive toward the end.",
    "Take this course! I didn't know much about food issues going into this course, but I know consider this the most important course I have taken at Yale. While it doesn't fit with the main focus of my academic studies, it has had the most impact on my daily life and how I conduct myself in the world.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. As a graduating senior, I would put it in my top five favorite classes at Yale, easily. Ian is such a wonderful instructor. Having been a Yale student, he showed a level of empathy and understanding through his teaching. He created a supportive and engaging environment where I was always excited to go to class. The assignments allowed each student to explore what subject matter captivated them. We also had skype calls with prominent figures in the documentary and food community. Food & Documentary is a great course if you want to learn more about the food systems that dominate our world today. I have changed my eating habits because of this class and will carry on the lessons I learned.",
    "If you can get in, take it!",
    "Amazing class. Ian is a hilarious, really intelligent and interesting person and professor. He's well-connected in the world the class interacts with which means that you get perspectives that only a handful of people can bring. I always looked forward to going to class and talking about the documentaries we watched and listening to Ian's jokes.",
    "This isn't really so much a documentary course, it's more of a food course. We didn't really talk about the intricacies of documentaries and even though there's a book assigned about that we never actually talk about the book in class. If you want to discuss pertinent food issues then sure take this course but if you're in it for the film aspect, either don't bother or specify that with the professor. The class is super super discussion heavy so if you hate your classmates it's going to be a longgggggggg semester. You do get to hear from some pretty cool filmmakes though (through skype) which is pretty rad.",
    "I highly recommend this to another student (and I already have.) This class was engaging and relaxed while still being very informative and interesting.",
    "Absolutely! This course should be required!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a fantastic chance to watch a bunch of food documentaries that you might not have the time or chance to watch otherwise, and they are a great way to explore these issues. Overall this class is a fun way to discuss issues in the food system.",
    "Yes! Take this course for stimulating conversation, a great professor, and exciting films."
