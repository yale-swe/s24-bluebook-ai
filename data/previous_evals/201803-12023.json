    "The course is great for people who want to learn a new language and are unsure of what exactly they'd like to take to fulfill they're language requirement. Bu Dinny and Pak Indriyo have both been awesome, interactive teachers. They make the class fun and love having athletes like myself in class. The course could use a bit more structure in terms of its order of taught topics, and clarity over which of these topics will appear on subsequent tests. But overall, the positives of this class surely outweigh the negatives. One of my favorite classes here at Yale.",
    "From my perspective, this class possess no weakness. By Dinny brought positive energy to class every day and was passionate about helping us learn and understand.",

    "Fun classes",
