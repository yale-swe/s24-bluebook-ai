    "I learned about using primary sources, connecting time periods and subjects, and a great deal about Yale's history.",
    "Interesting, quirky, informative course about Yale's history. I found myself telling friends about the little facts Prof. G chose to highlight. Thoughtful discussion about how Yale has affected American history (more significantly than I ever imagined) and vice versa.",
    "I learned a lot about Yale and its history, helping me feel more connected to the place.",
    "This course is an excellent examination of Yale's institutional history in the broader context of American history. We examined each national period from the colonial to the modern day and discusses how Yale influenced and was influenced by broader societal movements. Topics included colonization, the role of a university, the merit of a liberal arts education and revisionism.",
    "This course taught me the entire historical trajectory of Yale from its founding\/Elihu Yale to Yale students and the move to diversify today. The course spanned major phases of Yale history, and I learned about all the major figures and events that define Yale today. More importantly, the course expanded beyond Yale history and really taught me how to look at an institution as a historian, finding connections and greater themes in the world when analyzing an institution. Everything is connected!",
    "This course gave me a chance to improve my writing skills, as the final paper did not have any sort of set format. We were simply given the chance to choose a topic and write about it as we saw fit, which I appreciated.",
    "I learned so much about the history of Yale and the role the university and its graduates had on shaping American culture. It is amazing to now be able to walk around Yale and know the significance of the buildings, the impact many students have had during and after their Yale years, and how the relationships made at Yale last a lifetime and have been fundamental in many grand business\/government feats.",
    "I learned a ton about the way in which Yale has been affected by American history and how American history has been changed by Yalies. It was a great and very enjoyable learning experience."

    "This class was engaging, well taught, and overall a very enjoyable history seminar. It used a wide variety of sources and different types of interactive teaching from singing Yale songs to visiting the graveyard. The weaknesses are that there was so much course material so sometimes it was hard to pack everything in.",
    "Interesting, quirky, informative. Manageable workload.",
    "Amazing class! A must-take for everyone. I learned a lot about Yale and it made me feel more connected to the place. Professor Gitlin is super nice, like a grandpa who loves telling stories of his time at Yale. The readings are super entertaining and not incredibly necessary to follow along in class. Two students are chosen as interlocutors each week, so that's the only time when it is necessary for you to do all the readings. There are 2 group presentations (one about a person who got a residential college named after them and one about a topic from a list), a short paper about a primary source about one of the men the residential colleges were named after, and a final 15-20 page paper. Make sure you give yourself enough time to request things from Manuscripts and Archives and to go look at them for both papers, since I was unaware of how complicated the process was and left it until the last minute - making my life really hard. We went to Mory's after our last class, which we had in Woodbridge Hall. We also had a class in the YDN board room, and went to Manuscripts and Archives for another one.",
    "The strength of this class is Jay Gitlin: the ultimate storyteller. He seamlessly weaves tale after tale into a historical narrative that is both captivating and informative. He is a great professor that genuinely cares about helping students to learn from past Yale experiences to improve their own.",
    "This class is simply excellent. There was a wonderful mix of student presentations, professor lectures, interactive activities (like the Cole Porter song), and extracurricular events (like the Grove Street Cemetery tour). I genuinely looked forward to class every week and the time always flew by because the format kept students engaged. Professor Gitlin is really an inspiring teacher.",
    "I think the course was very well structured in that the semester was set up chronologically yet each week had a specific theme. It was nice to have some non traditional classes (e.x. Cole Porter performances, Grove Street Cemetery tour, class at the Yale Daily News) because many of the buildings around campus are named after people we discussed in class. Professor Gitlin also brought in Sam Chauncey, a Yale grad and administrator that has been at Yale since the 1950s. Sam Chauncey and Jay Gitlin told wonderful anecdotes about Yale in the mid 20th century that one could not learn from a textbook, which was really cool. One thing that could be improved is that there was so much to discuss each class that many of the student presentations had to be postponed many weeks. Also, for a seminar, Professor Gitlin spoke a great amount, which was beneficial to learn new facts, but at some points I think students would have preferred to have been able to talk more.",
    "Professor Gitlin is amazing and really makes the class what it is."

    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to seniors! It is a great way to connect Yale to American history and overall a lot of fun!",

    "Amazing class! A must-take for everyone. I learned a lot about Yale and it made me feel more connected to the place. Not too much work and super entertaining.",
    "The strength of this class is Jay Gitlin: the ultimate storyteller. He seamlessly weaves tale after tale into a historical narrative that is both captivating and informative. Take this class: you get to write and perform your own Cole Porter song, explore Manuscripts and Archives for long, lost treasures and participate in traditions over one hundred years old.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to all students because as Yale students we are branded with a label that comes with centuries of history and traditions that we ought to understand before we accept or reject them. I learned so much about my role in Yale history and the students who walked before me. It's also just such a fun and enjoyable class, especially because you get to know your classmates in the seminar setting. This is a MUST TAKE!",
    "A Yale classic. This course is about more than just history. Jay Gitlin's stories are the best, and he has an incredible gift of making the class feel like a family. Formal assignments during the semester were a short paper (2-3 pgs.) on a primary source of our choosing and a final paper (15-20 pgs.) on a Yale-related topic of our choosing. In terms of grading, just produce work of high quality, and the rest will take care of itself. There are few assignments, but he is very fair. If you take the class, there will be times when you and a group are supposed to present on a certain topic and then don't get a chance to for weeks because Gitlin talked so much and your presentation had to be delayed. This is ok. Enjoy the stories, don't stress too much over readings, enjoy the community, and enjoy singing for the class midway through the semester! Professor Gitlin held our last class at Woodbridge Hall, and then took us to Mory's afterwards. His wife joined us, and no one wanted to leave that dinner early.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to any Yale student, especially an upperclassman. This course really makes you appreciate Yale as an institution that has existed longer than the United States and also reminds you how lucky you are to go to this university. It was fascinating to learn about key moments in Yale's history that marked the transition from Old Yale to New Yale, whether that be Yale becoming a full fledged university, the introduction of the residential college system, or the beginning of coeducation. This has been one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken during my Yale career, if not my favorite, because you cannot take this class at any other college and you feel so much more proud to be a Yalie.",
    "Yes!!! This class deserves its reputation. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale."
