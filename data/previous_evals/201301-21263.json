    "I would summarize Microbiology 547 as a course that will give any student a firm grounding in the field of vaccination and provide them with tools to better understand current and future research. I would therefore recommend it to another student.",

    "I am interested in joining a lab that, among other things, works on antiviral immunity and is interested in developing new tools to immunize people against sexually transmitted diseases. As such, the course was very helpful for me to get a better grasp as to how to go about immunizing individuals against different infections (both in terms of the theoretical approach required and experimental tools to use).",
    "I haven't started my dissertation\/research because I'm a first year. However, learning about the different vaccination strategies will be helpful for my future research project."
