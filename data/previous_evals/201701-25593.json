   "comments": [
    "Good readings, the reading response made it so you actually had to do all of them, and the TF was great at inspiring discussion. The lectures were a bit rambly, though, and more basic narrative information about the region would have been really helpful putting things in context.",
    "Strengths: the book reviews were engaging ways of facilitating learning, the readings, though long, were interesting usually, the professor and TA were friendly and brilliant. What can be improved: lectures could have had more engaging visuals and other materials., more readings on Brazil (it is misleading to call the course \"Political Violence in Latin America\" with only one or two readings on Brazil!), readings were too long, more time spent learning about the historical contexts of our readings",
    "I liked the book review structure",
    "Strengths: interdiscplinary Weaknesses: more direction to lecture (e.g.; powerpoints might help?); more multi-media material.",
    "I think the course could really benefit from more structure and focus on historical background. While I understand that political theory is one of the course's focuses, I felt that I was unable to engage very deeply with many of the pieces that we read because I was so unfamiliar with the history of the country or time period, and they were often barely contextualized in lecture. A format that I've encountered in other classes that has worked well is using one of the week's lectures to analyze the historical context of a moment and the second to address the readings that pertain to that moment."

    "Yeah, but see strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Yes! This class was wonderful and engaging, Professor Echeverri is great!",
    "I would recommend it because of the interesting topics covered, especially those related to collective action. The book reviews are a wonderful way of better understanding Latin America. However, when they say Latin America, it must be understood that Brazil is unfortunately not accounted for sufficiently. As the largest country in Latin America, Brazil should have more than one reading out of fifty or so. Students had little background in that regard, too.",
    "Yes very interesting subject matter but could be better organized",
    "I loved this class! If you're interested in Latin American history at all, or in understanding the origins and consequences of political violence in general, take this course!",
    "This course was very valuable to closely examine the craft of historical writing, as we wrote several book reviews throughout the year and the weekly readings were challenging. However, if your goal is to gain a basic understanding of Latin American history, that's just not what this course is attempting to achieve."
