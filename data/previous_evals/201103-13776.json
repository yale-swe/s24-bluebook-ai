    "The group work required an immense amount of laser cutting time, which was hard to procure and undoubtedly compromised other studio\u0092s use of the machines during crunch times. The library frequently did not have books on the precedents we were looking for, so we often resorted to borrowing them from Colombia or Harvard through ILL.",
    "Given that we had to built very large models for this studio, storage and work space were an issue. As a studio we had to bring in tables from home and petition the school to allow us to set up an extra table in the studios designated work space."
