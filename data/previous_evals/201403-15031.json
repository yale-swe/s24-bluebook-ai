    "Great introduction to analysis of gender images in society, as well as why some preconceived notions of gender are reinforced through societal practices.",
    "Highly recommend! Will change how you view all images in the media, because basically everything is gendered. You will also get a chance to embark on your own project, which is very exciting (yet challenging) and a way to fulfill childhood dreams.",
    "Amazing class! If you are interested in gender studies, cultural studies, social history, and\/or psychology, this is a great choice. Professor LaFrance is outstanding, and the class strikes a wonderful balance of challenging and fun. It feels incredibly relevant, and you'll come away with honed research skills that will be useful in any field.",
    "A good overview of how images in the mass media are gendered, and some of the consequences of those images. The final project is a lot of work, and somewhat tedious, but you will feel accomplished when you finish.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "AMAZING CLASS!!! Lots of work, especially for the final paper. But if you are willing to put in the work it is an amazing class that you learn a lot of practical and academic knowledge from. Also -- LOVE Prof LaFrance!!! Take this!!!"
