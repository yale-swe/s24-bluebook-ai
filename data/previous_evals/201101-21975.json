    "Chinese 142 02 is an intense, rigorous Chinese class designed to improve your conversational and written Chinese and bring it to a more formal level.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese level 4 to another student, especially after taking Chinese level 3 in the previous semester. It's a coherent continuation, and the second semester of Chinese really enforces language skills. After Chinese level 4, your Chinese should be fairly proficient, and you might not find it necessary to take level 5. I don't think you can derive the same kind of language competency with level 3.",
    "Definitely take it! I felt like my Chinese got to a more advanced level than it did in L3",
    "yes i would recommend this class! You will a lot, and it won't just be memorizing characters because Xu Laoshi is very good at incorporating many different strategies into language study. Form a study group! It really helps you remember things when you just go over teh characters or sentence structures with friends.",
    "I highly recommend it to anyone considering the class. It will improve your Chinese abilities significantly. It is a lot of work and class five times a week but it is worth it.",
    "Chinese 142 is essential for someone who isn't completely proficient in Chinese. I would recommend it, just because you really learn a lot. And because the professor makes it very enjoyable.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in improving your chinese. Just make sure to keep up with all the work.",
    "Wonderful. Yes-you will have fun and learn a lot.",
    "Chinese 142 will teach you a lot of Chinese, but you won't necessarily enjoy going to class every day. The class is on a strict schedule and its repetitiveness makes it less interesting. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to learn Chinese.",
    "You'll learn a lot of Chinese, but you have to put a lot of time into this class; not an easy A at all. Focuses a lot on formal writing\/terms that you would use to discuss politics and economics, not so much on just daily conversation.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 142 02 (native\/heritage) to another student. The class helped me so much in improving my chinese conversation and comprehension, even though I had already been speaking chinese for years. The instructor was effective, efficient, and orderly in her teaching, as well as entertaining! The class is pretty engaging and you get to learn a lot about Chinese culture and history as well as the language, and the discussions can also get quite interesting. Overall, a great course."
