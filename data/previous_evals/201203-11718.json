    "BEST LANGUAGE COURSE EVER! \u00ec\u009d\u00b4\u00ec\u0084\u00a0\u00ec\u0083\u009d\u00eb\u008b\u0098 is the cutest professor! Never have I had a teacher that genuinely cares about the success of her students. She brings food for us to sample, teaches us Korean culture, and even has Skype Office Hours before exams in case we have last minute questions. You might be hesitant about taking this, especially if you have never had any experience with an East Asian Language, but take it from a Hispanic, non-asian student: it is definitely possible and it will be super interesting! Please take KRN110; you will not regret it!",
    "A fantastic, enjoyable introduction to Korean language and culture. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the study of Korean.",
    "Take this class if you're serious about learning Korean, but still want to have an enjoyable language-learning experience. You will learn quite a lot and it will be fun as well. Just be patient if everything doesn't come to you right away!",
    "Taking KREN 110 will make your life SO much happier. Even if you have no interest whatsoever in the language or the country, Professor Lee-Smith (Lee Seonsaengnim) is reason alone to take the class. I *cannot* speak highly enough of her. She's super friendly and funny and cares so so so much about her students. On students' birthdays (and several other days too) she brings Korean food and cake to class. She goes to student performances and extracurricular events - which some of my friends don't even do. And she's also a phenomenal teacher who's superb at answering questions and explaining grammar. I always looked forward to going to class, even at 9:25 in the morning. She is truly the most wonderful human being.That being said... Korean does have a reputation for being a gut language at Yale. We didn't get homework every night, and on nights when we did, it was rare for it to take more than 20 minutes. The pace of the class also seems a bit slow - for instance, we didn't learn our first verbs until about 5 weeks in, and we don't know any adjectives. If you're expecting to learn the language intensely, don't. Regardless, I think the class is 200% worth it.",
    "Absolutely. The workload for this course was very manageable, and it was the only morning class I've taken that I was genuinely happy to wake up for!",
    "This class is not a walk in the park. It's not unduly difficult either, but don't slack off, as with any new language. The Korean department, and Lee-sonsaengnim in particular, is really nice, really chill.",
    "If you're interested in the language, there's no reason you shouldn't take it. I had the 9:25 section and do not regret waking up early for it. Be prepared to do a lot of talking in class (which can only turn out fun, I promise!) and remember to practice listening outside of class through the audio CD's(since you're expected to understand speech that seemed pretty fast for a beginner like me",
    "This is a great course. Like other Yale language classes, workload can be heavy but it's part of learning a new language. Korean is very logical and uses a phonetic system. Therefore, it is quite easy to pick up but, of course, mastery and finesse is another matter altogether.",
    "It is a super funclass, but you really do have to be invested in it. The written language is phonetic, so it was easier in terms of reading and writing than some other languages. However, the class moves fairly quickly, so sometimes the great amount of grammar patterns and vocabulary learned can be overwhelming. You definitely have to put in a good amount of work everyday, and missing tons of classes really isn't an option. It's super fun, there's lots of food and conversation, but it is also alot of work.",
    "Great introduction to Korean with a great professor that takes the time to make sure everyone gives their best."
