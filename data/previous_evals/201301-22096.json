    "Don't take this class with Eric Weese. And don't make the freshman mistake of taking this class because everyone else takes it and because it \"teaches you how the world works\" or \"will help you get an internship at some prestigious place.\" Economics is a hard field and demands a very specific, logical, mathematical type thinking. By all means try it out, but don't go into it with any foolish presuppositions like the ones I mentioned above.",
    "I would recommend it because the information is so useful, but I wouldn't recommend a fellow student take it at 9 am or with this professor.",
    "If you want to be an econ major, go ahead.Otherwise, don't come near microeconomics. Don't even think about microeconomics. I've had friends lose their minds trying to figure out things like the Cournot Duopoly. Its not worth it. Run while you still can.",
    "Look at the professor -- it actually matters a lot.",
    "It's easy and boring. Take if you have to.",
    "Uninspiring. Dull. Painful.",
    "Do yourself a favor and take Econ in the fall. By far the worst class I've taken at Yale (or anywhere). I'm ashamed to have wasted a class on this.",
    "Boring but essential. I guess take it.",
    "Only take this course if you need to take it for the Economics major or if you are looking for a QR of medium difficulty. The information is useful for the future study of economics, but is not particularly interesting. And though Eric Weese is a wonderfully nice person, and does interesting research, he is not a good instructor. DO NOT take it with Weese, if you can avoid it. Find a good TF and go to their section. And you don't need to buy the textbook.",
    "You need to stay on top of the topics each week or else you will get lost like I did. The workload is fine though and it is completely manageable. Yes.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course to any other student unless he\/she wants to major in Economics or has studied it before. So dry, hard, do not be fooled by the \"no knowledge of calculus\" as ALL of it is Maths, equations etc.",
    "It's a basic summary of microeconomics. It's very boring. Don't take it if you don't have to, and if you do have to, get Amanda as your section leader.",
    "abstract",
    "It's kind of a class that you have to take. No one really likes it but its not horrible if you have some idea what you're doing.",
    "If you are a math-side student, Econ 115 is an easy A. The course refuses to acknowledge calculus, but if you make the connections between their definitions of marginalthis and marginal that and their respective derivatives, you essentially do not need to memorize ANYTHING - all the properties make intuitive mathematical sense. I was highly disappointed with the students taking Intro Econ; their questions often revealed a complete lack of understanding, which I found especially odd in light of the fact that Weese is somewhere between decent and good as a professor. The class is mind-numbingly dull for the first half of the semester. I'd never taken econ before, but I intuitively understood most of Weese's lecture before he'd even started. The idea that one does not produce when the cost of producing is more than the price does NOT require multiple lectures to discuss. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the course became quite interesting towards the end; I went from planning to never touch econ again to seriously considering taking Macro next semester.",
    "Take this with another professor or in the seminar (if that's available), as long as you can avoid Professor Weese. His examples don't make very much sense and his lectures aren't well put together. The information is there if you can glean it, but you have to do that quickly and make sense of it by yourself.",
    "Very useful class, light to medium workload. Take it if you're interested or have to for the major. It's a generally good experience\/knowledge to have.",
    "115 was lackluster. The concepts are interesting, the teaching and the slides dull its potential and make it confusing. The grading I've heard is generous, but not too generous. The problem sets are mainly graded for completion, and you get to drop the lowest two (at least in Spring 2013).All told: take this class if you are interested. It never hurts to learn these things, and the class is not THAT miserable. If you are an aspiring econ major, please please please give your other dreams a chance before you commit to this one. Econ can always be your fallback when it turns out MB&B is a little too tough.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have a burning desire to gain an introduction to economics. The course is boring and will not help you unless you are interested in being an economics major.",
    "Take it if you're an economics major, if you're interested in getting a basic grasp of economics, or if you need to fulfill a social science credit, but there are definitely better economics courses out there (and ones that are far better taught).",
    "It's really a love\/hate relationship. If you know how to learn stuff on your own, then it's not a bad idea. The problem is, the material isn't too difficult, but the way it's taught makes it confusing. If you do take the class, make sure to attend Amanda Gregg's section! I learned much more from her than from the lecture, which was sadly boring. The material is overall interesting, but you will learn nothing from going to lecture...you really only learn from going to Amanda's section.",
    "Econ 115 is a basic overview of micro economics. If you took AP microecon in high school, you'll have a good background for this class but you'll also learn more than in the AP course. All the tests are curved, but they are also very difficult; Professor Weese comes up with very creative tests\/problem sets. The weekly problem sets are fairly easy and definitely go to section every week. Office hours are also super helpful and the TAs will basically walk you through all the pset problems. I would recommend the course if you're looking to go into econ or want to get some economics knowledge, but don't expect an easy A.",
    "Not a particularly exciting class, but not a whole lot of work either. Curve wasn't terrible.",
    "It is not that hard to get a B because of the curve but pretty hard to get an A",
    "I would if you want to be an Econ major but do not be discouraged upper level ECON is much more interesting.",
    "Not unless you need it for an easy QR\/Global Affairs\/are an Econ major.",
    "Take it if you are interested in economics or if it is a prerequisite. Professor Weese's tests tend to be a bit more tricky than other ECON 115 tests. Definitely go to section, as they help a lot to supplement the lectures. Overall, solid class and I recommend it.",
    "A terrible class, only take this if you know you love economics already or you have no other choice but to subject yourself to several hours of pain and suffering each week.",
    "Do not take this class. Find another QR. It is not worth it. Unless you are a micro genius, you will be lost the entire time. Lectures are also incredibly boring and unfortunately not that helpful to understanding the material. If you decide you're going to take this class, make sure to go to the best TA for help.",
    "Not unless you need it for your major. Save yourself.",
    "Not a gut. Picks up pace toward the end of the semester. Exams can be tricky. Go to section.",
    "Intro Econ. You have to take it if you're even somewhat interested in doing something vaguely related. So do it.",
    "ECON 115 was a mediocre class: not terrible, but far from great. I do think it hit the standard microeconomics topics, but the lectures were never very engaging and seemed disjointed at times. A lot of proofs were explained in lecture which were not really applicable on the tests or problem sets. The TF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s were very helpful, but the class was generally not exciting and marginally informative. A pretty easy QR credit, but not one you will gain incredible insight from.",
    "Yes because it is very helpful to know in life",
    "Standard introduction to economics. Lectures are boring. Section is where most of the learning goes on. TAs are very clear, compared to the professor, who goes off on random tangents. Problem sets are not too time consuming; they are completely unrelated to lecture, though. Eric Weese is very unpredictable.",
    "Bad course, never went to lecture. Ever. And it still didn't matter. if you are a quantitative person this may be an easy way to get a Social Science credit (which was what I was doing this for) but DON\"T DO IT, there are better ways to get your social science credit. If you want to spend your entire year wasting your time doing useless stuff then take this course.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you really need it for your major.",
    "I would recommend to take Econ 115 if you need it as a prerequisite, of if you've never taken econ before, but not as a standalone class. The assignments and exams are manageable - my only advice would be to GO TO SECTION. Section is invaluable.",
    "would recommend only if you need to take micro",
    "It's a PreReg...so take it. But be prepared to self-study.",
    "Take it if is a requirement. Even if it is a requirement , please do not take it with Eric Weese.",
    "Although the course was an introductory microeconomics course at 9am, the professor could have tried to find a way to make the course more enjoyable. I did not enjoy taking the course at all. The only reason why I took it was to fulfill requirements, and I knew that everyone should have at least some understanding of economics. The professor was unclear about what he wanted on the midterms and finals, and it made the course not anenjoyable one at all. I would only recommend this course to economics majors because it was one of the worst classes I have had so far at Yale.",
    "Micro is straightforward, and it's good to know. I know I'm in the minority, but I actually did find Weese engaging and I liked his lecture style. Solid class overall.",
    "Eh. Can be boring, can be confusing, but if you go to lecture you'll do fine and maybe learn something along the way. No-one takes this class because they want to, it's the essence of a prerequisite, but it's not as terrible as everyone says (they probably slept through lecture every day)",
    "Econ 115 was not life changing, but not terrible. It gives a survey of basic ideas of microeconomics. Take it if you have to, but you can surely find a better QR or economics course to take if your major does not require this one. There is a strange discontinuity between the lectures and the problem sets and Weese often goes on tangents that aren't very relevant to the stuff you need to know from the course.",
    "Cattle drive.",
    "Microeconomics was much more interesting than I was expecting for an introductory lecture class. The class had a good pace and included a lot of references to society to make it engaging. In addition, the homework was definitely manageable, although the reading was often not helpful to the actual material and the professor sometimes deviated from the syllabus. In addition, it is an introductory class and some lectures seemed distant and dull. Non the less, I think microeconomics is an important topic and this was not a bad way to learn it, so I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Grading can be rough so its important you go to section and office hours (which most don't) to put you ahead of the game.",
    "I would say this course needed more effort than the rest of my other courses because problem sets were so much more difficult than the material covered in lecture. Overall, I felt that the course was effective and I learned a lot. Helpful that the teacher posted his powerpoint slides online.",
    "I would if they want to major in Econ or are interested in learning about it, but if not then no.",
    "This is a very standard econ class. If you like econ, you will probably like this class well enough. It's not exciting or anything, but it does a good job of teaching econ without being stressful or lots of work. A lot of people hate this class, but I think it's really because they hate economics - it can be a dry topic. Also, Prof Weese is great. He gives great explanations with lots of pertinent examples, speaks clearly, provides good notes, and is organized and dependable.There was definitely a wide range of quality within the TAs this year. I don't know who will be sticking around, but Amanda Gregg and Erica Blom were by far the best. If you aren't getting something, go to a good TA's office hours. The TAs are also great for getting the problem sets done.",
    "a requirement. Try and avoid if possible.",
    "Knowledge of economics is necessary for any field of study which one chooses to go into. That being said, if you're a math\/science type of person, you'd benefit more from Microeconomic Theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to any student who is interested in Economics however with a different instructor.",
    "Take ECON 115. It's a great class. Don't take it with Weese. He is not the best professor. Wait a semester.",
    "I would recommend it only if you know that your major requires it. I took it just out of curiosity, and because I figured it could teach me things that are valuable in the real world. But I found out that Econ is a dull and uninspiring subject, and it's not the best way to use an elective.",
    "Starts slow but gets interesting later. Not using calc is frustrating though",
    "Great introductory course! Be prepared for some math-heavy problem sets. Pay attention in lecture!",
    "Only take it if you need to.",
    "maybe. kind of boring",
    "It's necessary and a good experience. Knowing the foundations of economics is important for everyday life. So I would recommend it with a warning that this class can get boring.",
    "Only take the class if it is a requirement for your major. If you have the option, take it with a different professor in the fall (better yet, take the seminar, because those students seemed to have a much better experience than those in lecture.",
    "It's not too much work and a class that you probably should take at some point.",
    "Nice application of mathy things. Not difficult if you take the time to talk concepts through and be sure you understand them. Take for a more QR-ish So distributional.",
    "Don't take this class if you want an easy lecture where you can sit in the back and do nothing; there are a decent amount of problem sets. Also, Professor Weese gave a great lecture on political economy, but other than that I would recommend taking the class with another professor if you have to take it.",
    "Very good intro to microeconomics.",
    "Good stuff to know, but as a course it's pretty inapplicable to normal everyday life.",
    "It's pretty tough and alot of independent learning.",
    "The professor is not good. Do not take unless you want to go into Econ.",
    "It's not a horrible class, but if you don't plan on being an econ major, dont take it.",
    "Yes. As much as it might get tedious at times, overall you learn some very interesting material and it is an important backdrop for further econ courses.",
    "Don't take it unless you really enjoy Econ. I only took this to try it out, and it was a mistake to be honest. I hadn't ever taken Econ before, so it was particularly difficult for me.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Econ 115 in general. I feel like an introduction to microeconomics is necessary for anyone who wishes to see the world through a more analytical perspective. That being said, I do not think taking it with Professor Weese is necessarily the best idea.",
    "It starts off relatively easily and definitely gets harder towards the end of the course. Problem Sets can be somewhat confusing so I would recommend doing them with some friends.",
    "I found this course to be incredibly dissatisfying--I was looking to verse myself in an economic language. Having finished, I do not feel like I've grasped the material in any meaningful way.",
    "Econ 115 is the only way to get into Econ. It isn't the most engaging course, but it does offer insight into a new way of thinking that is quite interesting to pursue. For anyone looking for a practical application of simple math, this is a good subject to learn.",
    "If you can take it at a different time or with a different professor, I highly recommend it. Having this class at 9 AM led to me skipping all too often, and Professor Weese is pretty boring. Tests don't really judge how much you learned.",
    "Take this course but not with Weese and not at 9am",
    "Do not take this class unless you need it for your major!! Prof. Weese is very nice, but the class was miserable and no one enjoyed learning econ with him. You should take it if you're interested in Poli Sci, Global Affairs, or EPE but everyone else should save themselves the misery.",
    "You have to teach yourself. It is a gateway for other economics courses and if you are willing to slug through this one in order to take other courses than do it, but if you think that this course will teach you anything about \"real life\" economics, you have another thing coming.",
    "Absolutely brutal. Do not take unless you are planning on being an Econ major.",
    "If you can place out of Econ 115, try your hardest, because this class moves SO slowly. However, if you've never taken an econ, I would recommend it only because I think the material is useful and the textbook is actually interesting to read (consider just reading it and only attending lecture to keep yourself accountable.) The textbook goes so much more in depth than you need to know for class, but it's much better that way.",
    "ECON 115 provides an introduction to the rudimentary topics of economics, which will always be somewhat frustrating. Everyone will take this primarily as a prerequisite, rightly so, and it does not have to be difficult if one attends lecture or receives notes from a friend. Put in the effort to do the problem sets and go to office hours, as well, and you can really get a grasp on some important issues. On these: also take this course if you want to be able to understand and hold a basic conversation on the \"free market.\"",
    "A boring, but standard introduction to economics. I would recommend it for you to see what econ is like, and if you want an easy class to get started down the economics major with.",
    "Interesting, and a must take. It was much more interesting and much less dry than people told me. Overall, i enjoyed it. Go to Kota's section! He is wonderful, and much more helpful than the other TAs. Jeannette is good too.",
    "Good intro to economics. Recommended for a good overview of the intro to the field.",
    "A horrible class as a lecture. Would never recommend it. Would highly recommend a seminar.",
    "This is a useful course; I finally realized the significance of what I had learnt on the day before the final when I understood everything. It was very hard to get the big picture during classes, however. Eric Weese wasn't the most exciting lecturer.",
    "Mediocre class, not a lot of work, not very rewarding. The textbook is useless since Weese deviates from it and\/or expects us to know details not highlighted in it. No calculus means that the course is less intuitive than it could be.",
    "I took it C\/D\/F but still felt like I learnt some interesting stuff about microecon. Some of the simplest concepts were the most useful. I would recommend it, but only if you are willing to wake up at 9 AM for the lectures.",
    "Dry, but necessary.I would recommend it to students to help them decide if economics will be the path for them.",
    "It's an econ class.",
    "Again, I took it as a prereq so my recommendation wouldn't be so valuable. However, if you're considering taking it for fun I would highly recommend it because it teaches you the basics of economics--and is designed for students who may not be econ majors so it is taught at an appropriate level for econ majors as well as nonecon majors. What you'll learn in this course will be very valuable for all your studies as econ is related to everything in life.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in econ, but just be prepared to be bored in lecture. But the workload is not bad at all. Just study far in advance for the exams.",
    "Boring and dense, if you're not super interested in it. Macroeconomics is much more interesting.",
    "Lecture-based class on basic microeconomics. I personally think econ is worth learning for life, regardless of your area of study, and if you agree, I would recommend this course (even if the professor isn't great, the concepts are simple enoughfor you to figure out on your own). Otherwise, I would only recommend taking this class if the lecturer is decent.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. While the material is interesting and I think important, Professor Weese failed to convey it in an engaging way. The problem sets and the lectures were often completely unrelated, and sometimes the exam questions felt like they came out of nowhere. I talked to more than one person who said that they regretted taking the class.",
    "If you put in the effort, it should pay off. Beware that the exams are harder than the examples he gives. It 's a good introduction though - if you want to dip your toes into Microeconomics.",
    "Okay.",
    "Be prepared for boredom. Easy enough to pass though."
