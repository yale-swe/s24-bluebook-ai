    "An interdisciplinary examination of iconoclasm and visual controversies. I would recommend to another student, particularly for students in Art History, Religion.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. This course is worth taking if you are interested in doing a serious research paper on the visual and material cultures of religion and would like to develop some background knowledge on important episodes of the contestation of religious images in Europe and America.",
    "This is an incredible class that I would recommend to everyone! that spans many periods of time, and many cultures, places, etc. It speaks of iconoclasm is a way that is diverse, just like the coursework. There are many interpretations of what iconoclasm is\/was\/can be, and the instructors provide amazing reading material, and thoughts during class about this topic, and sometimes topics that diverge slightly but are still related. I appreciate the instructors enthusiasm and engagement with the students, and uplifting and positive attitudes. Thank you!!!"
