    "I would definitely recommend this H&P section. I don't have any other section to compare it to but I was very happy with the range of topics and figures we studied and felt that I learned an immense amount of material. Class discussion tended to stray away from the subject at hand fairly frequently but I felt that this kept me more engaged and wasn't an issue.",
    "Professor Freedman is a wonderful section leader, drawing broad parallels in texts among themeselves and to recent history. He makes Roman writers much more accessible, and his connections to easily understood concepts in modern business, economic, or political spheres reveals the timelessness of DS HP. I did not have exposure to Livy or the people mentioned in Tacitus, so I felt at a disadvantage to those who had read both in Latin, but between the lectures and Professor Freedman's semniars, I was not left behind. The grading is fair and will help you focus your content and arguments.",
    "DS Historical and Political Thought was a great introductory course that provided exposure to a broad range of historical thinkers but also discussed each one in depth. The format of two section meetings plus a lecture each week really helped facilitate this depth while the class moved at a very fast pace. The course was a lot of reading and work, but was a rewarding experience. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Prof. Freedman is amazing.",
    "This course covers a staggering amount if material over a brief period of time, and being able to experience this breadth of historical and political work is an accomplishment. Take it if you love books, at all. However, DS H&Ps ambitious survey of the western canon makes it less feasible for students to truly go in depth and translate their love of books\/history\/political thought into love of the class. It's difficult to fix the problem of superficial coverage of the text, when expansive coverage is inherent in the nature of DS H&P. However, Professor Freedman really makes H&P fun and interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend H&P - it has a great syllabus, and the lectures were some of the most consistently engaging.",
    "I think it is a very good and interesting class that looks at some very important works and their relations to historical and political thought. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "A lot of reading and writing, but overall engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. But come prepared to do the reading--there is a LOT of it, and Professor Freedman is very adept at noticing who's done the reading and who hasn't. But if you can get over the whirlwind of the first couple weeks and ease into the rhythm of the class, you'll become so engrossed in discussions that the hour and fifteen minutes of section will blaze by before you know it. Professor Freedman is brilliant, lovable, and approachable all at once, so don't be afraid of talking to him if you need help or advice. As long as you don't slack off, you're going to have a fantastic semester."
