   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think it's a great class especially for people interested in policy and law, and in criminal justice. The assignments aren't too demanding or overwhelming and you learn a lot. Be ready for a lot of quantitative research, and a good amount of cold-calling.",
    "This class is topical and taught by two great professors. Prof. Meares and Prof. Papachristos complement each other perfectly - she's slightly intimidating and he's hilarious, and the two of them just make every class so enjoyable. The workload is very doable, with four papers but all are short (3-5 pages). I'd definitely recommend it whether you have lots of gun knowledge or none at all.",
    "AWESOME class. Take it. Great class and non-biased overview of the convoluted and embedded issue of guns in america. Having gone into the class not knowing a thing about the topic, I am incredibly interested and feel fortunate to have been able to take the course. This should be offered every semester because it is an extremely important part of american politics and is pertinent to whats going on now in our country.",
    "I think that if you want a taste a law-school environment and are interested in guns or gun control that it is a good class to take.",
    "Guns. Fun. Don't read.",
    "Learn all about guns, the politics, \"the great gun debate,\" and the empirical research done on guns. Clearly a complicated, contentious topic. I left class better informed and with a lot more insight.",
    "This is an incredibly interesting course breaking down the great American gun debate and the current gun climate in the United States. Definitely take this course whether you are a gun expert, have no knowledge of guns, are pro gun, are anti gun, or really do not have an opinion. Regardless of your background, you will learn a great deal about guns in the United States from both a legal and sociological perspective. The assignments were all writing based, but I genuinely enjoyed writing all of the papers. I definitely recommend this to any student on campus; what you learn in this class will definitely be applicable to many real world conversations for the rest of your life about a topic that is very polarizing in this nation.",
    "I feel any student with interest in guns, policy, or sociology in America and abroad should take this class.",
    "If you want to learn what the conversation about guns is really about, take this class. You will learn a lot and the class is very low pressure, although there is a lot of reading.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I would take it again if I could. I will say that my concentration within my major is criminal justice, so I am much more interested in the subject material than the average student. But, I do believe that the course has something for everyone and that other students enjoyed it as well. This class is an overview on every aspect of Guns in the US history, gun ownership, attitudes toward guns, guns use in crime, and policy solutions to gun violence. Be forewarned that the class doesnt just focus on aspects of guns that are prominent, like mass shootings. It does get into the details of gun homicide, gangs, and crime, so make sure youre somewhat interested in that before taking it. The professors are amazing, both highly respected within the field. Their friendship made the class a much warmer environment. And, I think it worked very nicely that Professor Papachristos brought expertise from a sociological perspective, while Professor Meares was able to comment on legal matters, as we studied a good mix of both. Though the course is a lecture, class discussions are quite frequent, and the class felt smaller than it really was. The readings are not necessarily required to do well in the course, but they are helpful to be able to participate in the discussions.",
    "Yes, outstanding class. Very interesting, relevant, and fair. The work is interesting and not super time consuming. The papers were fun to write because we can make them what we want.",
    "If you can get into this class, take it for sure. Not too hard overall, but definitely forces you to actively consider differing opinions which is rare for Yale courses. You will definitely learn a lot in this course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Take it if you're a sociology major, take it if you want to go to law school, take it if you care about gun violence, take it if you're a pacifist, take it if you've never spent more that 3 minutes thinking about firearms in the U.S. Honestly the best class I have taken at Yale, with two incredible professors. Meares and Papachristos are both AMAZING.",
    "Great class",
    "Absolutely take it if you can!",
    "A class that doesn't focus on whether or not guns should be outlawed. Rather it's a class that focuses on guns empirically, in both a sociological and legal light. amazing class. Prof. Papchristos and Prof. Meares are both incredible, and you really feel like you're learning from two of the most amazing gun experts in the country (not to mention they are really fun and enjoyable to learn from). Not much work, just readings and a paper here and there.",
    "This class was awesome!! The professors are funny and led good discussions in class, I learned a lot about gun policy, and I loved doing the assignments. There was a lot of variety in the kinds of things we were assigned-- we wrote two more standard essays but also did an interview with a gun owner, made a plan for a sociological study, and wrote an op-ed. I thought the variety was fun and taught me much more than just doing essays. Take it if you get in!",
    "A good course, although somewhat overhyped (160+ people showed up on the first day for this 60-person class). Take it if you want to get an overview of research on guns and the policies based on them. Would recommend!",
    "This was a very solid course, incorporating legal, political, cultural, public, historical, and criminal aspects of guns in the united states. I think the most useful description of this class is basically an effort in busting each and every stupid misconception the public has on guns and then attempting to understand real policy and social scientific implications of the actual facts. I really enjoyed this course, and I think it benefitted enormously from being co taught by both a socy and law professor. Just a heads up: this isnt a purely criminology course nor is it a class where all the argumentation will be abstract and kinda up in the air. Readings need to be done, or the class will suffer",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Gun policy in America is so important, and our community knows so little about it. I went in thinking I knew a lot but I didn't have any idea. The workload is manageable, and you definitely don't have to do all of the readings. I liked the 5-paper structure - that way you're done before reading period!",
    "very well-run and well-organized class. i definitely enjoyed it, but please know that you will almost ENTIRELY be talking about guns and gun policy. almost every research paper you read will have to do with guns, and many of them are quite dry. the class sessions are great and the professors are fantastic, but make sure that you're ready to read, write, and argue almost entirely about guns for the next few months."
