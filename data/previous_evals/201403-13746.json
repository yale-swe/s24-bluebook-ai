    "Take this class if you want a solid understanding of chemistry related problems and more indepth knowledge than what the book has to offer. This class will give you a more solid foundation, and it will move at a good pace where you do have time to learn the material if you keep up. Not having studied Chemistry ever, it wasn't too bad catching up to those people in the class who had already taken Chemistry. The teaching fellows for this class are also great!! They have been the most helpful in any of my classes."
