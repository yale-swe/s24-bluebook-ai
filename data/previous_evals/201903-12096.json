    "I learned a lot about animals, their traits, when they arose, and the evolution of body systems. It was a survey course so we only touched on these topics but it was still informative",
    "I learned a significant amount about the diversity of animal life (from specific species and their biology, to the background behind certain evolutionary strategies and the different environments they live in). The course gives you a strong sense for how phylogenies are constructed and how animals relate to each other.",
    "A good overview of the phylogeny and characteristics of invertebrates.",
    "I learned everything there is to know about animals, evolution, and classification. I learned how to interpret phylogenetic trees, how to compare and contrast animal features, and how to make an animation!",

    "Overview of all living animals\/invertebrates. Phylogenetic thinking.",
    "A bunch of random facts about invertebrates.",

    "I learned new information about biology and invertebrates that I had never studied before.",
    "I learned a lot about animals I had never heard of, and I changed my perspective on the hierarchy of animals. I also learned a lot about phylogenetic trees.",
    "A detailed overview of ALL animal biodiversity (all animals are invertebrates actually)! Also a good introduction to phylogeny in general as well as some minor discussions of zoology, research methods and ecology as it pertains to the animals you learn about.",
    "I learned a lot about biology, genetics, biological relationships, and invertebrate zoology.",
    "Learned a very general overview of all types of animals. Cant say Id recommend it. Course material was pretty dry and required a massive amount of memorization of obscure terms.",

    "This course taught me pretty much every type of animal that humans know of.",
    "This course basically goes through each group\/clade of animal and its biological characteristics. There's a large emphasis on synapomorphies -- the shared traits in one clade, but also how different biological functions compare across clades (development, reproduction, feeding, locomotion, circulation, etc). It's A LOT of content. You learn a lot about animals you don't know--like ctenophores, lophophorates, tardigrades, and the list goes on and on.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures and lecturer are amazing and very engaging. I honestly wish the class had a little more work associated with it, and maybe an expanded lab section.",
    "This course is poorly organized. There was no substantive feedback given prior to the midterm date. There is way too much information in any single lecture. The lectures are poorly structured which makes review particularly cumbersome. For the midterm exam review, the TFs had no clue how to organize a review session and what would be important to know for the test. This course would be better if it required discussion section or had weekly homework assignments or quizzes to better facilitate review.",
    "This course packed in too much information in such little time. Communication between the professor and students was lacking. It felt as if the class was designed to trip us up, and that the professor and TAs did not want to help us understand how to succeed.",
    "Its too fast paced to keep up with it seems impossible to learn all of the material.",
    "The course is interesting and the animation is fun. There was optional homework to review for quizzes somewhat, but a full midterm\/final review would be helpful. The review sessions were all QA based, but I would have like a review where TA's cover key concepts and then take questions. This is just a personal preference.",
    "Casey is a very passionate and interesting lecturer. The lectures were rarely boring and they could be interactive. However, the grading structure was seriously flawed. We went into the final only knowing a quarter of our grades. The quizzes were on so much material and took hours of studying but were only worth 2% each. It is impossible to know how you are doing in the class. There were practice exercises at the beginning of the semester but they tapered off so it was difficult to get practice with the material since there is also no homework. It is a lot of information to memorize and it can get very specific. The grading structure can be changed and grading of the final project can be done faster so that you have a better sense of how you're doing before add\/drop, credit\/D, or withdrawl deadlines. The workload should also be distributed more evenly throughout the year, maybe with smaller quizzes or small homework assignments, instead of the final grade largely depending on 3 assignments.",
    "The lectures are clear and interesting, but paced on the reasonably faster side. Because course assigns little to no homework, the quizzes and tests hit hard for people who dont internalize the massive amounts of specific and general information as naturally. Even with all the knowledge spoken about at hand, understanding and then applying it to the highly specific questions on the test is another matter. If you take the course without a solid foundation in the material, the light workload is decieving!",
    "This course was a true lecture. There was very little class engagement, which was hard with such detailed and complicated material. I really liked how organized and neat all of the PowerPoints were, they were very easy to follow. I did not like how infrequent and ambiguous the material on the quizzes was. I feel like it would have been more helpful for true retention of the material to have a quiz after each major clade, with the quiz being entirely focused on that clade to make sure you have a good understanding of what each major group does. I think it would help you recall and separate them later, because especially with the worms for me they all ran together even though we talked about them at different times since there was no recall of the information in the form of a quiz or homework. I loved the final project options! Although it would've been nice to get a little bit more feedback on the project plan. And the midterm and final exam felt very fair.",
    "I love this class. I looked forward to lectures because I learned so much and loved learning about Invertebrates.",
    "Very well organised lectures and themes. Very interesting content. Individual project was a lot of fun.",
    "Very interesting and had great visuals",
    "Casey Dunn is such an amazing person\/lecturer, but unfortunately most students will take this thinking that it's a gut --> fail to appreciate the class as a result. Don't do that !",
    "Very interesting and engaging lectures - Casey explains concepts in a fun and organized way.",
    "There is almost no structure to the material. Studying for the tests is very difficult.",
    "This course is a broad overview of all invertebrates, which is incredibly interesting. The problem is the course does have a slight scope problem... there is so much content it's impossible to really learn it all in one semester, and I had trouble understanding what was important and what was just additional information, so planning for and studying for exams was extremely difficult. I think the professor could do a better job limiting the scope of the exams (not that we should teach to the lowest common denominator, but it is a 200 level course with no prerequisites) in a way that makes the content more attainable\/digestible to students, especially students that are not biology majors. Only a small portion of it ends up being tested, and I'm glad I know it all now at the end of the semester, but in preparation for exams, I often felt like I was drowning. Giving students guidance on what they should focus on and what is just additional interesting information would make this class more approachable.",
    "Strengths: excellent professor, fascinating material. Really well explained and good pacing. Weaknesses: sometimes too challenging, though overall worth it.",
    "This course just kind of throughs A TON of information at you and you're left to pick up what you can. There isn't any real structure to itit's just lists and lists of animals.",
    "Casey Dunn is a great lecturer, and presents the animals in an enthusiastic way. You will also certainly learn a lot in this class since it covers every type of animal. One weakness of the course is that the grades are weighted toward the second half of the semester. We only knew 4% of our grade before the drop deadline, and 30% by the withdraw deadline, so it was a little nerve-racking not being sure how our grades would end up. The final project is worth quite a bit, but luckily I found that it was graded pretty generously. It was great that we got to choose to do either an animation or paper for our project.",
    "A lot of information to memorize (not a gut, I repeat, this class is not a gut). But all in all, great survey class for the invertebrate phylogeny.",
    "Lots of information in the lectures, improved by having more practice available",
    "The weaknesses were definitely grade-related because we did not know how we were doing in the class until after finals, so a lot of people dropped out. It is also overly specific in some clades of animals and very vague in others. The quizzes were so specific, and you had to study every slide of every lecture to do well, and even then it was a maybe. The strengths were that I was always interested during lecture, and I enjoyed doing the animation project. Also Professor Dunn is very nice and a fun lecturer.",
    "Deeply fascinating course (at least for me), I felt like I was learning new cool things every lecture.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses this semester - I think the material was interesting and engaging.",
    "Course needs to focus more on interesting case studies of individual animals rather than a very broad and technical overview of phylogenies and families.",
    "Weakness: Too much material; No helpful study guidance",
    "Strengths: deeply thorough overview of animal diversity Weakness: youre gonna have to brute-force a preposterous amount of information into your newly-too-small brain",
    "I think the grading structure of the course needs some rethinking. I knew many people who were unsure of whether or not any kind of curve would be applied to the class. I also think it is uncomfortable when 70% of the final grade rests on a project and final exam.",
    "There is way too much that is covered within the confines of this course. There needs to be an emphasis on what is and is not important information. More links need to be made between the different animals and the irrelevant ones need to not be covered in so much depth.",
    "This course offers a lot of information on a lot of different animals, which can be very interesting and fun . However, it is a lot to memorize, especially if you aren't familiar with EEB outside of this course.",
    "Professor Dunn is an incredibly skilled lecturer. Every single class was interesting and engaging.",
    "Strengths: if you are looking for a chill class to learn about some cool and crazy invertebrates and with minimal effort on your part (honestly just go to lecture and write a paper and you'll be more than prepared for the exam). Also professor Dunn is such a great teacher, he definitely is passionate about his animals and also is super well known in his field Weaknesses: idk if u don't like memorizing things (which is all you need to do to pass). Definitely go to lecture, Dunn is great and not enough people go to lecture\/aren't engaged and its kinda sad.",
    "Strengths: Professor Dunn is hilarious and wonderful, TAs are great, material is AWESOME. You will learn so many cool facts and have a much better understanding of animal diversity! Weaknesses: So. Much. Memorizing. But that's par for the course for an organismal bio class.",
    "In order to be a good class, Invertebrates needs to be completely restructured. First of all, if you are going to keep the quizzes, make them a much bigger percentage of the grade. They are so short but take so much time to study for as literally anything we had learnt could be on them, and the questions are incredibly specific. Secondly, we need much more guidance and help for the final projects. Maybe include some examples, have better guidelines, or at least ask for a draft. Thirdly, there is so much material on the slides, that it would be useful if we had more guidance on what would actually be on the tests and finals. It takes so long to go through and memorize it all and the material is so specific and dense that there's really no other way to succeed in the class besides memorization. Fourthly, lectures are incredibly unengaging, because there is nothing that connects them all and it seems like we're just jumping around all the time. I also feel like lectures are useless because it's hard to understand what's going on as the things we're learning are incredibly specific and difficult, so it's hard to keep up with notes. Fifthly, the TAs were completely useless. The review sessions were a complete waste of time. The only time I actually ever needed help from a TA, she was uncommunicative, hard to get in touch with, didn't know anything, and was actually kind of rude. Also, the midterm, which is the first real assessment of the class, is right after the date for dropping the class, which means that it's impossible to know whether or not to drop it. Move it a few weeks earlier so people can see how they're doing before its too late. I feel like I could go on and on about all of the ways this class can be improved, and yet, I can barely think of any of the ways it is good. In order for this class to run again, it needs a complete re-haul and needs some serious work.",
    "Casey Dunn is a wonderful lecturer, but the class is extremely heavy on memorization. While there are some key themes, neither the course nor the exams focus on them. This is a good class if you are truly interested in anatomy and evolutionary relationships, but otherwise not worth taking.",
    "This course is great! I think the greatest strengths are the creative aspects of the course, with the inclusion of Creature Casts in the lectures and the creative final project option. The only improvement I can think of is to have a larger\/more available lab section, or maybe some lab activities in the lecture.",
    "The best part of this class is getting to learn about surprising and interesting new animals, like appendicularia. The course's major weakness is its structure. I think that two of the three major assignments (midterm and final project) should be moved up about a week. I say this because the midterm happened a few days after the date to withdraw without getting a \"W.\" This left some of my friends, who got less-than-stellar midterm grades, in a pickle. I also think the final project should be moved up about a week because that would give TFs and the professor the time to grade that assignment before the final. Going into the final, I realized that I only knew for certain what 26% of my grade was. There was still another 74% percent of my grade that hadn't been calculated (4% for participation, 35% for final project, and 35% for final exam). That's simply too much. Getting the final project grade to students before the final would be a big help.",
    "The lectures were fantastic, and the course material, while already very interesting, was presented in a very entertaining and engaging way. As a non-STEMS major, I found that all of the concepts were clear and accessible as well.",
    "SO. MANY. SLIDES. Only take this class if you're okay going through hundreds of slides.",
    "Lectures were absolutely fascinating. My peers in the class and I talked so much about it, our other friends began to pop into lectures and they too were extremely engaged with the material, and how Casey taught it.",
    "The strengths are the breadth of knowledge gained and the lecturing ability of Casey Dunn. The excitement and charisma he brought to the class made sometimes dry material more engaging. However, the class could be improved by taking a more comparative approach and clarifying what details are important throughout the lectures. By going through so much about all of the animal clades, it was very hard to tell what was important and how the features explored were relevant. Also, exams were extremely specific and grading was very tough given how much specific information was presented and expected to be known. If I did not have a background in biology, this class would have been overwhelming and often confusing.",
    "Strengths: the professor's enthusiasm for the subject definitely carried through. The lecture notes were in general pretty helpful. Having the option to do a video or paper as the final project was good. Weaknesses: the class felt too detailed, and instead I would have appreciated a more general view of broader themes.",
    "The teaching was too in depth and too quick to absorb all of the material.",
    "This course is definitely geared towards EE&B majors, as there was a lot of terminology that I was not familiar with, and the quizzes were super specific, meaning that much of the material had to be memorized.",
    "Very well-organised.",
    "My strengths in this class included being extremely invested and interested in the subject. I struggled however to be able to understand the material. There are many long, confusing scientific names that are easy to mix up.",
    "This course should not have a final project on top of the final exam. Most of the time making the animation video was extremely tedious, and very little of the project involved applying the knowledge I had gained in the class. Instead I spent hours cutting out paper puppets and shooting a stop motion video. Because there is so much information to be covered, and because animal diversity is such an enormous topic to approach in any kind of depth, the information we were expected to gain from lectures at times felt arbitrary\/random\/inconsistent. A more compelling story could have been told as to why we were expected to know the details of the morphologies of some animals vs. the sexuality of others."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, even if they are in a totally different track. I think it's just a fascinating topic and teaches you to engage with new and different things",
    "No. This class sucks.",
    "No. I was recommended this class by another humanities student who had taken it for a science credit last year. They informed me that it was a good class for someone with little interest in science, and that they were engaged the entire time. The class this year was not at all like this. I would only recommend this class to someone pursuing a degree in E&EB.",
    "No! Save yourself!",
    "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in the work. Casey is super passionate and super nice, and the class is fun because of it. The final project is super fun and I enjoyed making the animation. However, this is NOT A GUT. You will have to study for exams A LOT. I learned this the hard way after the midterm, but after studying harder for the final I think it went better. Just keep up with reviewing material and should be alright. Also, this class may be easier if your major relates to the course. Mine doesn't and I think this made it a little bit tougher.",
    "Unless the grading structure changes and there is more feedback, I wouldn't recommend this course. It was interesting and fun to be in and I wish I had a better time with the class but it was difficult knowing that the grading structure was set up so that it was impossible to know how I was doing. It seemed like the instructor and the TAs did not really care about the other things students have to take into consideration when taking a course. It is not an easy course and I didn't expect it to be, but I didn't expect it to be so time-intensive around exam times and so vague when it came to grades. The workload distribution should also be changed in order for me to recommend this course. Only take this course if you're seriously interested in this topic AND willing to put the work in without knowing that you'll do well.",
    "This is only an easy course if you are good at internalizing lots of information in a natural way, already have background in the material, or commit to detailed studying of the material on your own time. Otherwise, the content and structure is great, lectures informative and engaging. Go into lecture prepared to listen for specific kinds of information and study for the test.",
    "Yes, the material is fascinating! But I would recommend credit\/d\/failing it so you are not so stressed about the midterm and final. They can feel very overwhelming since there is sooo much information to review and very little guidance on what will be tested. Better to just enjoy the class and not worry as much about the grade.",
    "Yes!!! This is one of my favorite classes I've taken. More invertebrates!",
    "Definitely take this class! My favourite class at Yale and the most inspiring. Came out of it with a much better understanding of the biodiversity we all need to be trying to protect.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes ! But try to keep up with slides and don't save learning until the last minute. You'll suffer.",
    "Yes, great course even for a non-science major. I found the material very interesting. Science background not necessary but would help.",
    "Yes",
    "This is not a gut science course. If you're looking for a course just to fulfill a science requirement, this is not the one. Yes, the workload is low (in terms of actual daily take home work), but if you do not study regularly, go to every lecture, and engage with the content on a regular basis you will do poorly. By the end of the course, the scope of the exams and quizzes is extremely broad, and it's easy to get left behind. If you want to learn a lot of interesting content (and I mean a lot) this is the course for you. If you're just looking for a gut science credit, try something else.",
    "Yes! Know that it isnt necessarily easy though.",
    "No. There isn't any homework so it's easy during the semester, but then the tests are incredibly difficult to study for because you haven't been retaining any of the information you've been given. It's just rote memorization.",
    "I would recommend this class only if the student is genuinely interested in animal diversity. While the course seems exciting at first, it quickly becomes a huge amount of information that is not intuitive. Eventually we end up covering a lot of wormlike creatures and it is very difficult to keep track of them. If you are looking for a gut science class, there are easier options. Our quizzes and tests were actually quite difficult. If you are interested in learning about little-known animals though, the class will provide you with lots of interesting info about them. There are a lot of fun pictures and videos that you get to watch in class, and there is absolutely no homework other than the final project, which is great. The class does give you a different outlook about the diversity of life on earth, and Casey Dunn is a great lecturer and is very friendly.",
    "Yes, Id they are interested in the topic and willing to study",
    "I would take it if you like learning about marine animals (it is almost entirely marine) and are actually interested in invertebrates. It is not a gut class like a lot of people thought it was. You have to study and memorize a lot for quizzes and exams because they have very specific questions that could be about anything that you've learned. Also, even after the last day of classes we only knew the results of 26% of our grade (midterm is 20% plus the 3 quizzes each at 2%). This made it very difficult to know how you were doing in the class. I did enjoy the lectures and the project though, and I really like Professor Dunn. He is very knowledgeable and funny during lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. It was very interesting and very well taught.",
    "No. There are far better science classes in the same vein of this course available at Yale. This course is more of a phylogenies class. There is basically zero interaction with actual animals, even though there opportunity is there.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Invertebrates was my worst academic experience in 2+ years at Yale. I (like MANY others) took the class thinking that it would be an easy science credit. IT IS NOT. There is just way too much material covered in lectures. Our second to last slideshow was 115 slides! Another was 95 and yet another 87. Whats more (and what made the class truly disappointing), the professor and TAs do not give any meaningful guidance on how to distill the material or which topics\/animal groups should be paid close attention. I understand if you dont want to simplify your material, but at least be willing to help people new to the subject be successful. No student should feel like they cannot succeed in a class, even when trying their absolute best. That was how I felt. And I personally know five people who dropped the class, so I was not alone. To be clear, the professor knew people were struggling and having an extremely hard time in the class. I saw people speak with him time and again, and I myself did, too. The exchanges were pleasant, but we were all stonewalled when it came to any conversations about grades or curves. One last anecdote: A peer who was considering dropping the class requested that their final project be graded before the class drop deadline so that they could make a decision about whether to stay. The professor replied no because MULTIPLE PEOPLE had asked the same thing and he had to say no to them as well. Yes, its fair to treat everyone the same. But if numerous people are coming up to you considering dropping at the end of the term, you should know that something is wrong. And even with that knowledge, they gave the bare minimum guidance on preparing for the final. I thought it was standard practice for professors to throw out a hint or two as to what to study closely. We didnt get that. Even with slideshows of that magnitude! Lastly, there were at least two exam questions that were not explicitly mentioned in the slides. Its hard enough to memorize everything thats there. Even more upsetting when I run into a question that I never saw coming.",
    "Honestly no. Theres barely any work throughout the semester, but the amount of stress around that final exam almost makes it not worth it. Get your memorization muscles warmed up if you take this course",
    "If you really like Invertebrates, you'll find the course interesting. If you think you're getting a science gut, I would look elsewhere. The grading involves 35% final exam and 35% final project, so you'd need to put in a lot of studying for the final to do well.",
    "Not if you are looking for an easy science class. This class is not friendly for those who are uncomfortable with science, you need a basic understanding of biology to do well in this class. It's honestly not worth the effort if you are not that interested in the subject matter.",
    "No",
    "If you like learning about very cool animals then this class would be good for you . I took this as a non-stem major and I still liked it, and even made a short video at the end which was fun to make- the more effort you put into the course, the more you will enjoy it .",
    "This was hands down one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. If you have an interest in biology or animals, you will love this course. Every lecture, you will learn about fascinating creatures that have developed ingenious mechanisms to stay alive, reproduce and eat.",
    "Definitely! If you like invertebrates, want to know more about this field, have no clue what invertebrates even are (me) or just need a chill science credit (read: a gut), I highly suggest it!! Although it isn't useful for my major at all, I still really enjoyed this class. It was really relaxing, just sitting there and learning about the beauty of invertebrates and the marine world, and memorizing it come exam time. Also, everything you need to know for the exam is on the slides posted, so if you don't want to go to lecture (which I highly encourage going to lecture, Professor Dunn is so passionate and great!!!) you can still do well in the class.",
    "Totally! Fun science credit, great organismal class. Take it.",
    "DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. This was the absolute worst class I have taken at Yale, and I highly doubt there is a worse one. The quizzes, which are only worth 2% of the grade, take up sooo much time to study for, and they are really difficult. The lectures are completely unengaging and even though Casey seems like a nice guy, and isn't an absolutely terrible professor, there is very little redeeming about this class. The final project, which is worth 35% of the grade, is so open-ended and there is almost no guidance, so it's impossible to know if you are doing well on it. The TAs for this class were also completely useless. The review session that they held to prepare for the midterm was so incredibly unorganized and useless that I actually left halfway through, which I had never done before. It was so bad, in fact, that another student from the class who also left at the same time stopped me in the hallway to talk to me about how bad the review session, and class, were. Finally, what's even worse is that the material is honestly just not interesting. Going in, I thought the class was going to be fairly well-adapted to non-STEM students, and also was actually going to be interesting. Basically, it turned out to be 1000s of slides of pure memorization, that were mostly based on complicated terminology. There was no attempt to teach concepts, or anything that would actually be relevant, instead, it was just memorization, which made the exams even more difficult and pointless. By the time the class was over, almost half the students seemed to have either dropped it, credit-it-d'ed it or even withdrawn from it. Seriously, do yourself a favour and don't even bother shopping it.",
    "Take it if you love animals and their internal anatomy and are prepared for a lot of memorization. The class is not hard per se, but it is hard to do well in it.",
    "Yes, this is a course that I never had trouble going to since the lectures were all so engaging, and all the work required is important and interesting.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course unless you are an EEB major or are particularly interested in invertebrate zoology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any person, STEM or non-STEM, interested in learning more about animal diversity, or interested in biology in general. Do be aware of the fact that most of the majority of the grade in the class is determined near the end, however, as there is both a final project and a final exam. The final project was due soon after Thanksgiving break, however, which in my case did give me an appropriate amount of time to work on other final projects and study for other final exams.",
    "No, this class was poorly structured and had way too many slides.",
    "Absolutely. This gave me an incredible background about the complexities and breadth of the tree of life. It was also incredibly taught.",
    "Not unless the student is very interested in invertebrate zoology and is willing to put in a good amount of time to studying. This is not a class to be taken lightly and the interesting material does not make up for the difficulty of exams and risk of getting a poor grade.",
    "You essentially briefly go over every clade of animals (as all animals are invertebrates). It's pretty interesting at times and gives you an appreciation of the breadth of animal diversity. It also gets tedious though as you're learning about various worms and parasites. There's no day to day work per se, but the tests do cover a lot of content, and you can study and study for them and still be tested on something you neglected. It's a lot of memorization.",
    "No, its much too in depth and the information is generally irrelevant.",
    "Yes! It is important to examine our own way of looking at animals. Because that is gonna construct how we view ourselves.",
    "I personally would not recommend this class. With so many students taking it, it is difficult to get clear feedback from the professor and\/or TAs, and is an extremely difficult subject for someone without a strong background of biology.",
    "I would recommend it if you think you can find yourself fascinated by various aspects of animal diversity. I was able to pay attention in lecture and dig through some of the monotony because I found the animals really beautiful and exciting to learn about even if they weren't always dressed up as such (though they often were), but you have to be able to find that fascination within yourself, you can't always expect it from the lectures."
