   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are pre-med or like anthropology, or if you've never taken anthropology and want to try it out. Go to class and read the (good) books, and you'll be fine--there are no tricks!",
    "This course did a great job in introducing students to theme concepts in medical anthropology. The readings were interesting, although if you are not a fan of reading, it may be difficult to get through the weekly load. The topics were interesting, and professor Brotherton does a great job in outlining concepts. A weakness I found from the beginning of the term is an expectance by the course to already think and understand in the perspective of a medical anthropologist. Many of the terms and perspectives were personally new to me, and sometimes it was difficult to understand how to apply these terms towards examples and discussions.",
    "I would summarize it as a standard, intro course. very interesting because it makes you think about our society and our healthcare in new ways.I would recommend it",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. In fact, it was the best course I have taken in a few semesters! The concepts are IMPORTANT and something you should think about as a human being regardless of future career choices. That being said, as a Pre-Med, I think this course was tremendously helpful, learning about important aspects about local and global health issues, delivery of care, and morality in western medicine. It makes you question our obsession with Biomedicine and I believe will bring forward concepts that will make you a better physician. The reading is a lot at times, but think of it this way, you can just pull out knowledge of drug courts in New Mexico or Cuban health care policies at your med school interview!",
    "I found the material very interesting however the reading load is heavy.",
    "If you're interested in the cultural implications of medicine, don't have a problem with talking about theory and want a light work load this class is perfect! I took this with a 5.5 credit work load (3 credits of science and one language) and found it manageable. That being said, this is an introduction so be wary of how much you expect to get from it.",
    "It is a review of five different facets of medical anthropology and would be of interest to anyone looking for a more socially constructed view of medicine. There are two short essays, an in-class quiz\/exam and a take-home final that is non-cumulative. It was overall a very interesting course. I would recommend i!",
    "Yes, this class is very interesting and not too much work. The grading scale can be harsh since things are graded out of 30 and then converted to grades out of 100, so even if you do relatively well on the papers and tests you may not get an A, but it's a very good introduction to public and global health topics. I really enjoyed taking the class and the lectures never got boring. There is also mandatory section, but it's not bad at all and in fact can be quite fun!",
    "Examination of the medical realm, looking at the different types of medicines (biomedicine, traditional folk, chinese, etc). Looking at different systems of medical health in different regions in the world. Read different pieces on the approach to medicine from Foucault to Kleinman. Recommend this class to anyone that wants to know a little more about public health and the medical system",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a fellow student. As a premed who has mostly been interested in the pure science of medicine, I was initially unprepared for and later throughly enjoyed looking at medicine with the new perspectives anth 114 offers. It is quite a lot of reading, but it's fine to skim (though I personally found the topics really interesting and ended up reading through most of the material).",
    "Absolutely -- it gave a very thorough basis and introduction to medical anthropology (and the field of anthropology in general).",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the material because it is an incredible introduction to anthropology.",
    "This course is a very enlightening introduction to global health and domestic health issues. Anyone who is thinking of entering a health-related field should take medical anthropology in order to gain a different perspective on medicine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, at least with Brotherton teaching. Everything was logical, interesting, relevant, and eye opening. Be prepared to actually do the readings, and there are a lot of readings, but they're never too dense and I kindof enjoyed them. 1 quiz, 2 essays and a take home: totallydoable workload. This class gave me that satisfying feeling of learning about something and being able to have conversations about it in the future, not just rote memorization about a topic. Take it! Even if you're not premed! I was but I definitely don't think it was necessary.",
    "This is an amazing course. Professor Brotherton is a great teacher, and the course is designed to be useful for anyone. I took this class as a premed kid and it changed my view on medicine. What is medical anthropology? I had never heard of it before I took the class. The course is structured in modules that focus on different aspects of healthcare: what medicine is like in different cultures, how different biomedical healthcare systems work, drug trials, and other fields. This course's strongest point is the reading. The books are engaging and interesting to read and the supporting articles are carefully chosen to fit in with the anthropological theory broached in the books. The reading is never excessive, on average 100 pages a week. But some weeks it amounts to quite a bit more, some less (so the average isn't actually a great measure). Seriously, nothing to be worried about.The course is very relaxed. One \"quiz\" (midterm, really), two short \"papers\" (come on, 1000 words!), and a take home final. Section is enjoyable, for a change--the star TAs are to thank for that.In short, take this class if you have any interest in anthropology, and definitely if you're premed.",
    "it is what it is..an intro anth course. You'll learn a lot of relevant info. I'd take it credit d and not as a upperclassman.",
    "Think outside of the box. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Med Anthro had 2 3-4 page essays based off of class readings, a midterm, and a take home final. Grading was always fair and the topics were interesting and have given me a new perspective on health care also. It was a great class to take for people who are interested in global health and health studies.",
    "Insightful.",
    "This course offers a great introduction to Medical Anthropology. It's not just for students who are interested in medicine or public health...as someone primarily interested in an anthropological approach and less so in healthcare, I still loved the course and found the readings fascinating (with the exception of Petryna's \"When Experiments Travel\"). Professor Brotherton is a great lecturer and very approachable as a professor. Take this course!",
    "Anthropology 114 is an excellent introductory course for Medical Anthropology and also public health. I would highly recommend it to any other student, even if they don't plan on majoring in anthropology.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the kinds of issues that make the field of medicine complicated. The subject matter itself is very thought-provoking and it widens your perspective of what health is. I would recommend definitely recommend this class for people who are interested in public health and medicine because it's eye-opening stuff, but be prepared for a lot of reading if you want to get the most out of the class. (Also be prepared to write open-ended essays...)",
    "I would recommend it as a great survey course into some of the interesting ethical debates that you don't often think through surrounding healthcare and medicine.",
    "Medical Anthro is a very relaxed course. You get exposed to some aspects of medicine and the field that you may not havethought about in the past.There is a decent amount of reading, but I would not say that reading everything is required for the class. Even with the books, many of them can be understood after reading just an assortment of the chapters or few of the pages from each chapter. And the take home essays also aren't that difficult if you spend a little time planning out your response. (And reading what is necessary to make your argument)"
