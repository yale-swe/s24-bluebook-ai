    "The course itself is highly dependent on your advisor and your project, so make sure you like and are compatible with both of those things. Professor Casson is administrative. It would make more sense to evaluate my two advisors, Asher Auel and Dhruv Ranganathan. I enjoyed working with them very much; much of my success is due to their consistent support and guidance.",
