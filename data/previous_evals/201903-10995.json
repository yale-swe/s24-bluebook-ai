   "comments": [
    "I got really good at mass balances, and understanding derivations. General understanding of water\/wastewater treatment plants.",
    "Integrated understanding of the physics, chemistry, and design behind water treatment systems.",
    "I learnt how to break down large bits of information and apply problem solving skills to various questions. Professor Kim also did short presentations which he called mini-seminars where he talked about his research and other things relavant to the course that he didn't test which I think was the best part of the course.",
    "Mathematical and structural concepts behind water kinetics.",
    "We learned about drinking water & wastewater treatment facilities & how to solve the general calculations behind the operations.",
    "I learned about the process of water and wastewater treatment and how to set up and solve different mass balance equations by breaking them down into simpler parts. It was a good mix of both the quantitative and qualitative side of water quality.",
    "In this class you learn about water treatment processes as well as some newer technologies being developed for water treatment. You learn how to do mass balances for cstr and pfr reactors in different stages of water treatment.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about water and wastewater treatment, as well as mass balances. This class is 80% mass balances.",
    "One thing that was cool about this course is how at the end, when we went on a field trip to a treatment plant, all the things we had learned over the semester were being applied. This class does a super comprehensive analysis of all the different processes that go into water treatment. All the things that go into it are explained and modeled.",
    "This course taught me in greater depth the whole processes of drinking water and wastewater filtration, as well as addressing waste from the process through activated sludge. I also learned a great deal about membranes, nanoparticles, organic chemistry, LEDs, and beyond. Most important of all, Professor Kim teaches us how to approach problems methodically, by stating our assumptions and defining the system, and applying appropriate formulas (with awareness of units!) to solve it.",
    "I learned the fundamental of water treatment processes and how to quantitatively set up and solve mass balance problems.",
    "I developed the skills to understand a system, design a reactor, and perform mass balances on them. I gained the knowledge as to how each step of wastewater treatment works and how to approach reactor problems. I now thoroughly design the process of reactor design in terms of mass balances and volume computations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course can be a little bland for most of it is just doing derivations. The mini seminars and trip the the treatment plant were awesome and would have enjoyed more of the seminars.",
    "Helpful psets and interesting lectures, with anecdotes about related topics. I got lost during a lot of the long derivations, so it would be nice to get periodic summaries of what we have done up to that point, and reminders of what the variables mean.",
    "Professor Kim is genuinely interested in the success of his students and made an effort to know his students beyond the class. If you take this class please have at least one meal with him, go to his office hours or just set up a meeting to talk with him about anything really. The class however was quite fast paced. Also, don't judge the difficulty of the class based on classes during dropping period. It gets exponentially harder as time goes on and he makes note of this during shopping period. With regard to the content, to be quite honest, I rarely could keep up with him and had to relearn most of the content on my own which is quite hard since it's pretty difficult to find what he teaches any where else in similar detail. Also, all the exams are entirely based on the content in class which may or may not be available in the textbook or on the internet in simplified form. Sometimes you could take really good notes of what he says and writes in class but still have quite have a hard time understanding what you noted down if you didn't understand the basics of the content. Overall, I'm glad I took this class, I considered dropping it but Professor Kim is actually a very good grader and always finds opportunities to award his students as many points as possible on exams.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kim is a phenomenal lecturer who is not only extremely dedicated and talented but also very funny and attentive. None of the content is too hard, or Professor Kim just did a great job at breaking down the technicalities. Our TA, David, was also just incredibly helpful. Weaknesses: There is a distinguishable gap between the class content and the homework assignment, which was fine as David helped all of us, but could have been improved.",
    "The course was very well taught! The lectures were generally interesting & easy to follow & the homework was never too overwhelming. I do not see any weaknesses to this course!",
    "This was a great course! Professor Kim is wonderful--his lectures were super engaging, and he went step by step with the material so that we could understand how to approach complex problems. Our TF also helped a lot with the psets during office hours. I also liked the format of the class, with three big units and a non-cumulative final.",
    "This class is very well taught and it is obvious that Professor Kim has put a lot of thought and energy into the course. The exams and psets are manageable and interesting. Professor Kim is definitely the best part of this class!!",
    "The strengths are the organization of the lectures. It is very clear about what you need to know. One weakness is the lack of communication about final grades. There is a vague \"curve\" that is never once defined. My classmates agree that we could receive an A or a C for our final grades, and equally have no idea why, which makes it difficult to understand how you are doing in the class and improve.",
    "I think the biggest strength is the professor. Everyone loved him, he was super nice and was probably the best part of the course. He taught the material very well and made sure everyone understood it. If he felt he wasn't explaining it well, he would explain it in a different way until everyone was on the same page. I don't really think the class had any weaknesses, it was well structured and well taught.",
    "The course is incredibly strong, I see little ways in which it could be improved. Professor Kim places emphasis on solving problems and teaching us how to think, rather than piling on formulas we won't remember twenty years from now. I greatly appreciated his 'mini-seminars' that introduced us to cutting edge research and fun topics environmental engineering can address. I loved this course.",
    "Strengths: The teaching staff is great! Professor Kim and David organized the course well and were very happy to answer questions. The problem sets are reasonable in difficulty and length, especially if you go to office hours. Lectures are pretty clear and follow a logical flow. The mini seminars are an interesting way to learn about more modern water treatment and the water plant tour was really cool. Weaknesses: Sometimes exam problems were not similar to practice exam questions, which made the tests sometimes unpredictable. I also did not think the true\/false questions on the first exam were a good way to evaluate understanding.",
    "This course was very well organized and taught very well. The information was covered in such a way that it allowed students to digest the information being taught. A strength of this course were the homeworks as they allowed me to further explore and understand the concepts being covered. The professor did a fantastic job explaining the course content and started with very elementary concepts to give the students the necessary foundation to approach more complex situations. The one weakness lies in that the homework was usually quite lengthy and office hours for the course were only offered the night before the problem sets were due."

   "comments": [
    "It was interesting, but if you aren't required to take it for the major, I think you could find a more interesting course that isn't so derivation heavy dealing with environmental concerns.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in environmental engineering. I don't know if I will ever use the concrete knowledge from it again, but Prof Kim makes it very engaging. You probably need at least some background in physics\/chemistry.",
    "Yes! Its's a junior level class but as long as you did ENVE 120 in freshman year, you can take it as a sophomore. Professor Kim is a great grader, the psets are manageable especially if you go to office hours where the TA basically explains hints to get you started for each question which was very helpful.",
    "Yes, totally. Most people who even consider this class would be ENVE\/CENG\/other types of ABET students anyway, but it is totally recommended.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to others! It may be difficult if you do not have a strong calculus background, but the course is very interesting & Professor Kim is awesome!",
    "Yes, this class is engaging and Professor Kim cares so much about what his students.",
    "Yes! I think this course would be useful for any engineering major. It is manageable and very interesting.",
    "Absolutely! It is very important to understand how our water gets from the source to our taps and this course gives you a greater understanding of that process.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. However, if you are an engineering major past your first or second year, this course may be entirely to easy for you.",
    "I think that only environmental or chemical engineers would benefit from this course. Otherwise, I don't think water quality is a very interesting subject, so at times it makes you question why you're in the course. But again, the professor is amazing.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student interested in addressing water quality problems or being more aware about where our water comes from and how we accelerate natural processes through engineering to provide drinking water for the world. In addition, it gets students closer to thinking like engineers.",
    "If you're interested in water treatment, take it! It definitely helps to have a background in ENVE but not required as long as you go to office hours and ask questions. Prof. Kim is wonderful and structures the lectures well. The water treatment plant tour at the end of the class is also a fun way to cap off the semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It helped students reach a complete understanding of mass balances and was taught in an engaging manner. The professor and teaching fellow were willing to work with students to help improve their understanding. It was a very good course."
