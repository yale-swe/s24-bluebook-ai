    "Do it. It's a unique opportunity, here, to do this kind of interdisciplinary thinking, and with such an eclectic group of professors, and mentors. The students are wonderful, as are the texts -- as was the semester, for me.",
    "An introduction to the concept of Grand Strategy through works of theory and historical case studies.",
    "APPLY! You'll worry about the rest later.",
    "Take it - highly interesting in concept, great readings and great professors. A great deal of unparalleled opportunities and resources. Nothing else like it.",
    "An awesome and interesting way to immerse yourself in the history of Western strategic thought, and to absorb paradigms for the execution of deep and effective strategic thinking about complex problems."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Clarified my thinking on my thesis for the Humanities Major, and introduced me to a host of new professors and ideas who will guide me along the way.",
    "The course is somehow outside my usual coursework, but gives me a great grounding in masterful works of literature and political thought I would otherwise not learn about. I believe it contributes to my overall Yale experience in a positive way.",
    "It certainly makes me think more strategically about professions in general.",
    "Essay question 2 was horrific. It asked to make historical comparisons between a series of unrelated subjects. It needed to be focused or be vastly longer. In general, the class was very good at the start and grew increasingly confused as time went on. I've learnt a lot about classic strategists, and for that I am very thankful. Tooze and Gaddis really saved the class.",
    "It deepened my knowledge by introducing me to a range of seminal works and ideas in the discipline of grand strategy. The course will, over the next year, likely contribute to my fellowship research quite a bit, largely by giving me a frame of reference for what constitutes effective strategy and strategy formation."
