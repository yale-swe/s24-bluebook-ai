   "comments": [
    "Ever wondered by health care in America is so broken? Think it's the doctors' culture that has to do with it? Think again. Professor Swenson will demonstrate to you that it's ALL about politics, and will give you the history of the field that you won't really want to do the reading for initially, but will find fascinating at the end. Highly recommended for premeds (WHO NEED TO GET OUT OF THEIR SCIENE SHELL C'MON GUYS THIS STUFF IS COOL JOIN ME) and PLSC majors who are curious about health care. We have a problem in America. Problems.* Find out why. (Conveniently through the lecture version of this class in Fall 2013, where I'll be TAing!)",
    "A historical, stakeholder based approach to understanding the healthcare system.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to someone interested in the area of health policy. It is important to understand what this class really is. Much of the course is centered around understanding how the American health care system go to the point in which we find it today. There is a lot of history about the health sector and how interest groups kind of shaped the landscape. This course is very heavy on the political games played in the health care arena, but is easily understood by anyone with an interest in the field. Beyond the actual course material, Professor Swenson is an absolute delight.",
    "Was not a huge fan of this course. Discussions were painfully boring and the material was repetitive, and in many cases esoteric and irrelevant. I don't feel I've come out of this class with much. Prof. Swenson is a nice professor, but I would take another seminar if I had the choice.",
    "I would recommend it if you're really interested in the history of healthcare and health insurance.",
    "Take this class. It is interesting, eye-opening, and Prof. Swenson is a must-take at Yale.",
    "The readings were awesome, but the class and professor less so. I learned SO much for doing the readings even though they were quite repetitive. In class, Professor Swenson would speak for the first hour or so and then students would give presentations. I didn't feel as though I gained very much from either segment, although the class may be better in its lecture format in which there is no presentation component. Swenson is a nice guy even though it wasn't always clear what he was looking for in the papers--he wants clear and concise arguments, not just a summary of the readings.",
    "Take it for the readings if you're interested in the material",
    "Yes, if you're interested in healthcare and politics. It is really helpful if you have a background in economics, though, otherwise you will probably not get top grades on your essays. If you don't have a background in political science or econ, make sure to add some relevant theories to your papers to make the arguments tied to the themes of the course.Also, write you papers early so you have plenty of time to revise them. If you turn in a paper the last week, you won't be able to revise that one.",
    "Yes, take it if you're really interested in the subject, but don't if you have only a passing interest. The class is technical enough that it requires focus and engagement to find your bearings.",
    "It was interesting reading if you're interested in this topic, but the actual structure of the seminar and quality of discussions wasn't that great. But it wasn't too much work, so take it if you're interested in this topic and want a sometimes frustrating class.",
    "If you want a good overview of the issues the US is facing in it's healthcare system, then it is a good course. However, watch out if you are planning on pursuing medicine. There is some physician bashing.",
    "The strength of this course is its readings and its students. The readings are very interesting and the students in the seminar tend to be very engaging and knowledgeable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 almost intimidatingly so.The greatest weakness might have been the sheer amount of presentations we had to get through each week. Sometimes four people would present in one day and there would be very little time left to get deep into discussion. I would suggest having each person present just once instead of twice and outline more requirements for presentations (another problem was the variety in quality of presentations that were given: some students made powerpoints and others just recited their papers\u00e2\u0080\u0094 some more uniformity would be helpful.)Professor Swenson is very kind and knowledgeable. He could use some more visuals and some more concrete and fast paced lecturing. Overall, he did a good job of leading the seminar. Most of the issues with the class arose from the logistics of having way too many presentations.__I would say, take it if you are interested in the politics of health care and if you don't mind hearing just one side (the more liberal side) of this argument."
