   "comments": [
    "SO MUCH. I learned how to think about intersections of food with other topics. This course has forever changed my understanding of food, the kitchen table, and mealtimes.",
    "Discussion skills in small groups, thoughts on many facets of the food industry from consumer, to provider, to worker and insights into the history of food cultures (esp. in the USA).",
    "This class has completely changed the way I understand the value of educational methods and topics. The informal style was much more effective than my other seminars, as we were all extremely engaged with the subject matter. It also made me rethink what topics are valid to teach at the college level. The history of cooking, usually considered a domestic method that stays inside the house instead of in classrooms, was the perfect way to understand historical and cultural themes through different cultures and time periods. This is a great method of teaching a class, and should be done more!",
    "This course helped me to engage more thoughtfully with the food we eat and work with, and with people's relationships with food more broadly.",
    "I learned how to apply academic skills of analysis and synthesis to a topic not usually covered by academic courses. This allowed me to explore a topic I knew a lot about personally though a different lens. I also developed my interview and analysis paper skills.",
    "I learned how intrinsic food is to humanity. Beyond survival, food is interconnected to almost every aspect of life. Ive learned how to think critically about where the food I am consuming originates from and how it relates to my identity and desires. Ive also learned how to ask the right questions in this class as it relates to fully understanding the subject.",
    "How to phrase questions.",
    "During this course, I learned to think critically and analytically about the world around me when it comes to food. I didn't realize how food is such an integral part to our lives as human beings and in society. I learned about so many aspects of food and hunger, whether it is problems with industrialized food or the stigma behind certain food practices, and it taught me to truly be aware of where my food comes from and the world around me.",
    "This is one of the few courses I've taken at Yale that I have been able to consistently connect back to my life and the world outside of academia. The readings about the history of foods gave me a greater understanding of how our lives are shaped by what we can and decide to eat. Similarly, the readings on restaurants and the lives of the people who work in them opened my eyes to both the positives and negatives of the industry. This course is great for anyone with an interest in food or the intersection of cuisine and culture.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the important role food plays in our life. It is a means of control, a way to show social status, love, and so much more.",
    "I have gained so much insight to the variety of cultures, people, and backgrounds behind the foods I eat. I know so much more about a variety of ingredients, like types of whole wheat flours and amaranth, as well as a broader understanding of the way food impacts every facet of life. I have learned things in this class I will take with me for the rest of my life.",
    "I learned a lot about the food industry. I also learned to appreciate different aspects of it than before.",
    "I learned how to think more deeply about the world of food from in many capacities.",
    "I learned how to engage with the topics of food, identity, and desire in a much deeper and more thoughtful way. Suddenly, I am seeing trends that we talked about in class everywhere. I've learned how to think about how food impacts all aspects of an individual and a greater society. How does food drive us and how do we drive food trends?"

   "comments": [
    "I love how the structure of the class is more conducive to having open conversations. Each week, a small activity change kept my engagement with the course. Although reading an entire book per week seems daunting, it never felt like a burden because the reading selection was incredible and I always stepped away with a new perspective on food and identity. I also enjoyed that last part of the class where we got to learn from our peers about a topic they were interested in exploring.",
    "Best course I have ever taken at Yale. Strengths are everything! Professor Trumpler is amazing, assignments are the right level of work not too high but enough to be engaging, and the books are super interesting. Could not be improved. Professor Trumpler has put so much thought into this course and it shows so much.",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely the selections of readings which are very interesting and engaging. The other main strength was my peers because so much of the class is discussion based, it is heavily reliant on the quality and level of interest of the students.The final projects were very interesting to listen and engage with. The weakness is definitely the instruction of the class. I felt very disrespected by the instructor because she barely reads or pays attention to the assignments she asks for students to do. The number and depth of her comments on my papers and projects were few and said things like \"good,\" \"interesting,\" or \"could have done better.\" How is that helpful? It is just very FRUSTRATING when you put work into a class and there is NO CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT\/GUIDANCE. The papers and projects are extremely abstract and at the same time she seems to expect very specific results. I recognize that a big part of the class is coming to realizations on your own after talking through the questions she proposes in class but truly, this class is only good if the other students in your class are interesting people who ACTUALLY READ THE BOOKS because if you get stuck at a table with people who didn't read the assignment- boom, two hours wasted. The conversations do tend to be rather circular and emotional.",
    "This class is incredible. The format of discussions interspersed with interactive activities helped me stay focused and engaged through the entirety of seminar. Our readings were fascinating and digestible every week, and the essays were thoughtful and fun to write. The presentations were perhaps my favorite weeks of class it was so interesting to hear about a variety of topics that I had never considered but were on the forefront of the minds of my classmates. My only criticism is that sometimes discussions were rather surface level, stating the obvious more than taking a deep dive. Perhaps a bit more of an introduction into how to have good seminar discussions at the beginning of the semester could have helped with this, since most of the class were sophomores who didn't have much experience with seminar discussions.",
    "It is an excellent and well-structured course overall. My only objection is really that it went too fast for the material covered. For the middle part of the course, we read a book every week but only spent about an hour and a half discussing. I think that the readings should have been spread out over more classes, but I'm not sure how to manage that.",
    "I believe this course could be improved by greater guidance and possibly more time for presentations, but I thought the two paper assignments and the in-class discussions were wonderful.",
    "A strength is how the class was set up and how conversational it was. Class participation was made easy and fun. I was learning so much without even realizing it. I dont know of any profound weaknesses in the class.",
    "Nothing can be improved. This course is amazing.",
    "Very different and creative style of teaching - using kitchen tables instead of a usual lecture format. Very engaging and interactive!",
    "One strength of this course is how it fosters good conversations, and how all of the readings are very interesting and engaging. You can learn so much by listening to your classmates. One way it could be improved is if there were more activities, in addition to the embodied practices. I would rather spend a little time discussing and then do something more interactive rather than simply share our insights with the class.",
    "I thought that this course was amazing. I would change nothing about it.",
    "I cannot think of any weaknesses of this class. It was so engaging and interesting, and I have learned so much valuable information. Despite being almost 2 hours long, I was never bored; every activity and discussion was captivating and enriching.",
    "Strengths: Everything. The class was engaging and interesting. I feel like I learned a lot, and the professor was great.",
    "This course had very interesting material, but I wish that I had gotten to know the professor and the rest of the class better. Round table discussions in addition to the kitchen table discussions would've added to the class a lot.",
    "The readings are great and very unique -- some cook books, memoirs, podcasts etc. I wish the reading list would change a bit -- there are so many amazing food books out there and I didn't love all of them (there are better books on the food industry and famous chef memoirs than the ones we read). But overall the reading list was great! Discussions were good but maybe could have gone a teensy bit deeper. I loved the formal assignments we had to do. I wish we did even more cooking -- every single class!!!! There are so many other ways to integrate relevant foods into the class. People are up to spend more time cooking than we did (only like 15 minutes each day)."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I wish I had taken the class at the beginning of my undergraduate career because I would have been more open to exploring other WGSS courses.",
    "This was an amazing class. Extremely engaging, our readingsthough often long were probably the most engaging out of any other class I've ever taken. It is 'easy' in the sense that I literally got a 100 on all of my assignments (and I think this was common). But you have to do the readings which can often be a book a week. Because that can be a lot, I am not sure of how to rate the course's difficulty depends on how you look at it. BUT it was incredible, an important topic, and Trumpler is amazing.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST COURSE I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. I would recommend this course to absolutely any student who is respectful and openminded. Professor Trumpler creates such a positive, open minded classroom to encourage students to think critically, have fun.",
    "Ok yes, but it is a good amount of reading and you HAVE to do it to get anything out of the course. so commit! Food is a really fascinating topic and if you have not thought about it in depth, this course will be eyeopening to how intersectional food is in every facet of life.",
    "This was an amazing class! It was structured as an informal \"kitchen table\" discussion seminar, where we mostly discussed readings and other themes in small groups and then came together as a class. We did embodied practices most weeks, which consisted of cooking, tasting, or other forms of activity that were more interactive than just sitting and talking. I learned fascinating things and always looked forward to class time. This class was never a major stress in my life due to workload, which allowed me to really engage with the material and enjoy learning. Definitely take it!",
    "Highly recommend the class even if you are interested in the subject or not. You will get something out of it.",
    "This is an excellent course, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in food and identity of any sort.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in food as an academic subject. I enjoyed this course because I brought a lot of personal interest and energy to the classroom, but I think it may feel lackluster for a student without a lot of interest in the subject.",
    "Absolutely, but only to certain people",
    "YES",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as long as they like seminars and talking about their insights. Sometimes, if you do not feel comfortable sharing, it is not going to be enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this course to someone trying to learn more about the academic aspects of food culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material was interesting and the atmosphere of having a class in a cooking space was fun and different. Many weeks we prepared and tried food based on the readings which really helped solidify in our minds the concepts we had learned. At times there are a lot of readings, we read multiple books in their entirety, but all of the readings were engaging, informative, and were not challenging to read. Overall, this was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale and I would recommend it to anyone!",
    "Yes! You will find how under appreciated food is as an academic topic. It is an amazing portal to discuss issues of race, gender, class, gender identity, and so much more. You will never say \"it's just food\" ever again.",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in food, you will gain so much from this class. This has been the best class I have taken at Yale. The readings are things you actually want to read; they are fantastic pieces of literature you will learn so much from. Each class is so interesting and engaging, and you really think in new ways.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I feel like it was a very valuable experience. This was my first humanities class at Yale, and it really helped me think in a different way.",
    "I think that the content was very interesting, and for that reason you should take the course. The class itself was not very challenging, but prompts you to consider many issues surrounding the world of food that you will take beyond the classroom.",
    "yes! Super fun, low workload, and very engaging. Perfect for a great 5th class that you will actually be interested in."
