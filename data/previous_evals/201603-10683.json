   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "-Reading analysis -discussion skilles -strong writing skills",
    "This class changed my world view. Not only did I become a better reader and writer, but I also believe I became a better person. It opened my mind to new ideas about literary analysis and big ideas like race relations, empathy, and reconciliation.",
    "The course taught me how to write and think more analytically, write a more organized and well-researched paper, and engage actively in thought-provoking discussions over the intersections of social issues, politics, and, of course, the written word!",
    "The course provided a great introduction to the implementation of secondary research materials into literary analyses, and provided insight into the characteristics of literature from a particular region, including the influence of historical context, authorship, and translation.",
    "This course was a really great way to study literature focused in on one particular time period and place. I am a more history and social sciences oriented person, so getting to study literature by grounding it in a historical moment was really wonderful.",
    "I developed into a much more conscientious and articulate writer, and I discovered my own abilities as a writer. I've figured out how to look at literature with a more discerning eye, and how to really delve into the subject matter. Through outside research I learned the historical progression of the Apartheid system in South Africa through outside research for papers and assignments.",
    "This freshman seminar was imperative to my first semester at Yale. Week after week we read novels that made us question everything we knew about South Africa, and the discussion in class was some of the best I've ever had with peers. Steph gives fantastic feedback on discussion and your writing, and I feel that my analysis abilities improved drastically over just four essays.",
    "I learned a lot about South Africa and its history with apartheid.",
    "I was pushed to think more carefully about the construction of my essays, ensuring that the scope of my essays were clearly defined and that my points worked together cohesively. Furthermore, I think the scope of books selected for this course was very useful in understanding the entire body of South African post-apartheid fiction. By the end of the course, when I was reading academic articles about South African fiction, I found that I had read and understood the references academics were making to various pieces of literature.",
    "Wow. This course opened my eyes to the possibilities of literature and the avenues you can take with it. My creative horizons were broadened and I was definitely challenged in trying to get my writing up to par. I learned a lot about my writing style and even more about South Africa as a country.",
    "I gained a new understanding of the historical situation both under and after apartheid in South Africa, and an appreciation of the ways in which literature has been and continues to be used to fight not only racism but also sexism, homophobia, and class-based discrimination in that country. Crucially, I believe the literature I read has also given me new insight into social problems in the United States and their possible solutions."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: great material, allowed students creativity in discussion and writing Weakness: wished the writing came from more POC authors (would enjoy reading about the Asian experience), it could become boring having the same pattern of discussion",
    "We were able to delve into the material at a very atomic level because the class was small and we met twice a week for over an hour. The class format worked well for me. We discussed the literature in a socratic-seminar style, which I found engaging as well as challenging. I enjoyed learning from my classmates just as much as I enjoyed learning from our professor.",
    "Strengths: Steph is fantastic; the discussions were fun and often stimulating; the books were fascinating and each clearly served a particular purpose; the papers gave us enough leeway as students to explore something of particular interest while also retaining the academic quality and standard expected of us; the teacher also gave us clear feedback on each of our papers on how to improve it for the next one. Suggestion for improvement: I really liked how during one of the few final classes, we had discussion questions. Maybe in the future students could lead\/moderate some discussions by proffering questions? That way, it doesn't feel like always the same routine. Otherwise, it was a fantastic course.",
    "The facilitation of class discussion was very strong, inviting all students to participate. The texts themselves were also quite varied and representative of different perspectives, which made the class incredibly interesting. The only downside to such an expansive catalogue is that with more dense novels, readings were difficult to complete when they coincided with assignments from the class itself or those from other classes.",
    "I gained a lot from reading secondary materials, which helped ground our class discussions in broader dialogues about South African literature. I wish that this class were organized such that we had more black South African authors earlier.",
    "Strengths: fantastic professor, small class size facilitates open conversation, interesting paper topics really probe students into thinking critically about the literature and class discussion, good class meeting time, interesting literature, followed the syllabus, how the discussion progressed was left mostly up to the students, through outside research also end up understanding more about history of Apartheid and South Africa, art tour was amazing. Weaknesses: small syllabus mishap, readings were sometimes hard to keep up with.",
    "Steph chooses some of the most engaging novels, short stories, and scholarly readings with which to facilitate deep thought on some important topics--namely race, class, and gender in South Africa. Though it is A LOT of reading for a slow reader like me (at least one novel per week; it's not DS), you will not want to put down these materials for a second. There wasn't a single dry piece of writing. The open\/roundtable discussion format is perfect for the types of topics we excavated, and our class grew very close over the semester. Furthermore, it is a very manageable amount of writing (4 essays) for a WR credit freshman seminar; it's not too daunting, as more than that can often affect the quality and time spent on writing.",
    "Strength: Small group discussion and intimate setting to listen to everyone's opinion Weakness: The books and material are very long, so it's hard to keep up with the syllabus.",
    "Strengths were the small classroom environment, the wonderful and engaging professor, and open\/interesting class discussions. Weakness would be that although I loved a lot of the texts we read, we read mostly white South African authors which was problematic. I think course could be improved by making sure we split between reading white and black South African authors in order to get both perspectives of the country post-apartheid.",
    "I really enjoyed the discussions that we had in class - Stephanie was great at leading the discussions and always had something really valuable to add to our comments on the novels. Students in class also actively contributed to discussions. However, I did feel like by the end of the course comments tended to get repetitive and we didn't seem to be engaging with the latter novels as much as we had with the first few.",
    "Strengths: Steph is amazing and leads class discussions flawlessly. The material is interesting and even if you don't understand what's happening in the book (I usually didn't), having a seminar setting allows for lot of exploration and analysis. Weakness: None really. Unless you dislike reading. Then this is probably a bad course.",
    "I think the texts were in general well selected and provided a good overview of South African literature; however, I might have liked to see a few more recent (last five to ten years) books that could have provided a different perspective for evaluating the successes and failures of the post-apartheid transformation. I felt that the structure of the assignments for this course, with four essays each giving a fair amount of freedom for students to choose topics, was very appropriate and allowed us to compare different works we were reading. My favorite parts of the course were the often very spirited discussions we would have during classes, which regularly provided opportunities for highlighting and analyzing ongoing social and political situations in the United States."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "The material is incredibly engaging, the discussions are eyeopening, the papers allow for a lot of freedom.",
    "Take this class. It was my favorite class of the semester. It was incredibly rewarding and so interesting, albeit challenging. If you can, take it.",
    "Yes! Steph is amazing!",
    "Absolutely 100% recommend it if you can take it. Steph is a fantastic teacher whose classes are thoroughly engaging. She often lets you have leeway on your papers in the way that she will usually permit you to tackle of your choosing so long as it's still a literary analysis. The discussions were stimulating, the books were amazing, and all those in the class were present because they clearly wanted to be there. Steph also provided feedback on each of our papers on how to improve it for the next one. Don't take this class if you think it'll just be a gut it's not, you read a book per week but do take it if you're the slightest bit interested in South African intersectional writing and social justice. It's such a fulfilling and well-designed course.",
    "Due to the heavy workload, I would recommend the course most to somebody who is truly interested in South African literature, or loves reading and researching itself. The course is sufficiently interesting and engaging however, for those without a specific draw to it, becasue it is lead and organized incredibly well.",
    "Absolutely! Especially for more history-oriented students, it is a nice way to study literature while still feeling grounded in history. And of course people who already like studying literature would love it! Secondary materials helped to place our class discussions in broader dialogues happening among scholars. The literature we read allowed us to explore myriad issues of race, gender, sexuality, etc.",
    "I can't recommend this class enough! Not only was Steph engaging, passionate, and a great source of feedback, she clearly held a vested interest in our enjoyment of the course and emotional welfare. The course itself was incredible, and I found the literature we read to be not only interesting but very informational. I learned so much about myself as a writer and a scholar of literature.",
    "100% recommend. A true gem. This course made my semester, and it's a brilliant set of topics to examine during the beginning of freshman year in today's America. You will love the reading materials, and this class attracts a certain type of person--your classmates should be amazing. Steph is hands-down one of the best professors Yale has to offer; please take this class with her!",
    "Definitely! It's a great small class that show cases the one side of the liberal arts curriculum that Yale preaches about so much. The material is also very engaging and intriguing.",
    "Most definitely!!! Felt like my writing improved, my critical thinking was challenged, etc. Was a great experience and Steph is the BEST!!!",
    "Yes!",
    "I loved the course. Steph was an amazing professor and she allowed us to steer the class toward the topics that we as students wanted to discuss.",
    "YES! This class has been my favorite so far (granted I've been here for a semester). The writing workload is manageable and the feedback is great. The novels are interesting although hard reads, you'll learn a lot about a different culture and be able to explore it's culture and history freely through your writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I feels that even students not primarily interested in literature are likely to appreciate the thorough investigation of apartheid and, crucially, its ongoing after-effects afforded by the selected texts. This course gave me an understanding of the complexity and pervasiveness of apartheid and its underlying ideologies that I would have never otherwise had, and I think it would be extraordinarily interesting for anyone with even a remote interest in political and social sciences. Steph is also a great person to have as a professor!"
