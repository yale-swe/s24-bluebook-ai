    "If you're looking for a writing credit, there are probably easier courses you could take, but as an English major it was great to read a wide variety of high and \"low\" literature. The reading was actually very enjoyable and really easy...it was not hard to get through the work for this class.",
    "Take it. It's a fun class taught by a really wonderful professor from whom you will learn a lot. All the assignments are quite open-ended, and you get to discuss images and engravings in addition to the texts you read, which is really refreshing. We went to the Prints and Drawings room of the BAC for class one day. That never happens!",
    "An engaging, interesting, fun course. The reading list was excellent, and very fitting for the aims of the course. It was also very manageable, especially because so many of the novels didn't feel like work at all to read. Professor Carlisle ran a great discussion, and was always very interested in everything the students had to say. Her focus on improving our writing was extremely helpful and made this one of the better WR classes I've taken, in terms of actually focusing on the writing process.",
    "It is a good course, a bit more of an art history\/sociology course than a pure English course, but it draws from many disciplines and does that very well.",
    "This is a highly multidisciplinary approach to Victorian Crime. You end up examining paintings, contemporary newspaper and magazine reports, photographs, songs, scientific journal articles, and, of course, literature. If your chief interest is in reading a lot Victorian Crime fiction, you may be disappointed, because that is only a small part of the class. If you're interested in investigating a Victorian society's approach to the problem of crime through all of the different media of the era, artistic and realistic, then this is definitely the class for you.",
    "Well structured class; amazing reading list; I especially enjoyed the mix of engravings, novels, and contemporary news and journal articles. This course deepened my appreciation for the insight gained from combining historical and literary perspectives. The mix of small writing\/research assignments and the few larger papers was a refreshing way of engaging with the material and preparing for discussion. Professor Carlisle is extremely knowledgeable, approachable, organized, and funny. Her enthusiasm for the subject is simply infectious. Her ability to guide discussion and synthesize student comments consistently amazed me, and her respect for the opinions of all her students is evident. She provides very helpful suggestions for improving writing, and encouraged us to strive for proper grammar usage and concision without belaboring the point, discounting our personal writing styles, or setting unrealistic (or unclear) expectations.",
    "This class is interesting, but I wouldn't take it if I had the chance again. You will not read all the books on the syllabus and you spend a lot of time looking at pictures. I don't recommend it. There are a lot more interesting classes, especially within the English department.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, both to English majors and to non-majors. It's a fun mixture of English and other subjects, and the reading list is full of books that are both total classics and fun and interesting to read -- what's better than Victorian mysteries? Pretty much nothing. The workload is basically a five-pager, a final paper, and some very short reading responses."
