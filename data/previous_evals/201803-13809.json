   "comments": [
    "Problem sets are good for thinking through concepts. Some questions could be reworked because they are not solvable without TA intervention or prior knowledge of what the solution should look like (or are simply not solvable).",
    "This course provided broad and deep instruction of key concepts in political economy. The problem sets were a fun challenge.",
    "I would have appreciated more political science applications, as well as concrete examples of how we could used the models we were learning about to build our own (even very simple) models. I know the micro foundations are necessary, but more time on how to use those tools to build political science models would have been appreciated - and would have been a good incentive to engage with the maths parts. We got a deep introduction to some political science models (voting competition, distributive justice), but I would have enjoyed a broader introduction to the possibilities of formal models. Classes spent going through existing textbooks or notes were very hard to follow (it was much easier when the Professor was working on the white board). As an example, the class on Nash Bargaining was the best one we had, it was clear and well-structured. Other classes (the marriage example) were much harder to follow.",
    "Problem sets were great at making us apply class concepts. And tests followed well (with some tweaks) from problem sets. The class was quite strong overall, though class was sometimes confusing, so the TA sessions were necessary to understand the concepts."

    "Great foundation to intro political economy. Make sure to collaborate with your classmates for the most fruitful learning experience.",

    "Definitely. Requires some time and thought but not a ton. And great intro to formal modeling of various economic and political concepts.",
    "I still feel weird about the Nash bargaining proof. I wish we had delved deeper in the 1st theorem of welfare economics and its justification for capitalism."
