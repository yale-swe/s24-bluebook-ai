    "It is required but ultimately is a useful method to know for evaluating survey results, potentially for senior thesis. Stata is an important program to know if serious about sociology.",
    "The course is broken up into two main parts: (1) questionnaire construction and (2) data analysis using a statistical program (this year, STATA). Though the first part can be pretty intuitive at times, this class is useful in helping you think about how to design surveys and interpret results(and has small, manageable assignments that allow you to practice what you learn in class).",
    "This is a very useful social science course. It goes through the social science aspects of survey methods, and then teaches students how to analyze data from surveys. This is definitely one of the most practical courses I have taken at Yale."
