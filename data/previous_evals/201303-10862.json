   "comments": [
    "It's a beautiful language and, yes, it's gonna be hard. IT's gonna be tough and there's a hell of a lot of vocabulary. Really, focus more on who your teacher is not on the class. I'd definitely recommend the class. The professor? Depends.",
    "Italian is difficult but Mr. Farina made it enjoyable and helped me along the way, as far as languages go I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes - anyone who is even thinking about taking italian, this is the course for you. It moves quickly, but it's a lot of fun and gives you a really solid foundation of grammar that will allow your speaking ability to grow in the future. The equivalent of three years of a language in high school, I would say.",
    "I loved Italian 110. The teachers are all nice and amazing (especially Michael). There is lots of grammar, but you learn a lot over the course of the semester, and it is a fun and low stress department.",
    "L1 with Michael is great! He's really, really enthusiastic and does a lot to make sure everyone in the class is engaged and learning all the time. Also, he was always very willing to work with people outside of class, do extra review, consider extensions...and he bought us coffee once, which wasso nice. He gives almost-daily quizzes, something I'm not sure the other L1 professors do. Some people might appreciate these (since they're given to make sure everyone is keeping up every day, yaknow), but I found them overwhelming because I wasn't really prepared to dedicate that much time every night. Obviously that's kind of a personal problem, but just note that if the daily quiz thing is going to stress you out maybe consider a different section. Michael's wonderful, though, so definitely shop it and see what you think. ciaoooo ragazzi!!",
    "Italian is a wonderful language to learn. Michael brings great enthusiasm, and his humor means every class period is full of laughter. The open atmosphere inspires great class discussions in which everyone contributes. Daily quizzes were vital in keeping students on top of the workload. Nonetheless, I would question the plethora of information covered over the semester. We were responsible for two-thirds of the book, leaving one-third for the following semester. This unbalanced ratio proved a little too much to handle, as, at the end of the semester, we were simultaneously reviewing and learning new material. There was also a problem in the lack of returned work over the semester, causing confusion over grades at the very end of the term. In addition, this made it difficult to understand your progress and mastery of the language over the course of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian 110. Professor Farina was a great professor and it have students a great introduction to the Italian language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to learn a new language, especially those who are uncertain which one to take. It is so much fun to learn, and especially with Farina."
