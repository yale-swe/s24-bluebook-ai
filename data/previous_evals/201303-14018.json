   "comments": [
    "This was a really interesting course, though some of the readings were really dense and so it took till the middle of the semester when case studies were studied in depth for it to all to come together. Overall, you'll definitely learn a lot if you keep up with the class and the readings.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who has an interest in global politics\/IR",
    "Professor Seekings was engaging, funny, and pretty laid-back. He's not the most lenient grader, but he goes out of his way to make sure students are on the right track early, which was a huge breath of fresh air on papers. Follow his lead and do things early and you'll be fine. I'd recommend taking his course if you're interesting in understanding not only developing countries' welfare systems, but also how real politics work within specific countries. I learned a lot about health programs in Brazil, for example. But I also gained extremely practical knowledge about issues like the poverty debate, which was useful in making sense of recent unrest in the country and of the ways Brazil's \"political culture\" is shaping the lead-up to the World Cup and the Olympics.",
    "It is an interesting class about the theory and politics of welfare state building. We first analyze the theories of welfare policy and then analyze through case studies, how these apply in the global south. It was insightful and revealed a new area of political science studies.",
    "This was the best course I took this semester, and definitely one of the better courses I have taken at Yale. Seekings is very smart, helpful, and one of the top scholars in a relatively new field. It's also unique because its a great introduction to using quantitative methods of analysis.",
    "Good course about welfare typology. Can get repetitive towards the end of the class, but overall a good course if you want to know more about the different types of welfare regimes that exist in the Global South."
