    "YOU THINK ABOUT WHETHER GOD EXISTS AND LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS FOR WHETHER GOD DOES OR DOES NOT.",
    "This course was an excellent opportunity to have your ideas challenged. Generally a pretty low week to week workload but worthwhile readings and interesting topics discussed in class.",
    "Recommended if you want something interesting that really requires minimal work (12-15 page paper at the end).",
    "This is a pretty chill class. As an atheist, I found our readings to be unbearable. I thought they were overly dense and really boring to be completely honest. So I'm not sure that I learned what I thought I was going to learn but it's worth confronting these topics every once in a while. It would have been nice if class had been a little more discussion oriented - I thought people probably had really interesting perspectives to contribute, but I didn't get to hear any of them... :( Professor Turner is really cool though and I enjoyed hearing what he had to say!!",
    "If Professor Turner is teaching this class again you have to take it. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. We spent enough time reasoning through and discussing the readings, rather than rushing though too many authors. Professor Turner is very knowledgeable and humorous, and he knows how to make the dense material understandable and relatable. He is always willing to answer questions after class. There isn't that much work in the course, only a final paper, which you get to explore a topic related to the course you are truly interested (very flexible). Going to the lectures has been my favorite thing throughout the semester.",
    "I very much enjoyed the course; highly engaging material but taught in a very low stress environment. There is plenty of engaging with major texts, but I loved it because Prof Turner encourages you to think outside the texts, and there is no major reliance on them for writing papers. I was able to enjoy the coursework more because of this. It's a minimal work, highly intriguing class and Prof Turner is awesome, like very funny and awesome.",
    "The lectures are small and there aren't terribly many. To get the most out of this class, ask the questions you want answered.",
    "This course pursues the exposition of several basic types of atheisms, each of which arises historically and culturally as a critique of Christian theism. Through a close reading of Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche, and Derridaas well as the less sophisticated but very influential New Atheists in the style of Dawkinsstudents will learn to grasp what is really at stake in a critique of Christian theism, in terms both of what answer the atheism gives to the particular \"God\" that is being denied by it, as well as what evaluative weight ought be put on the question of whether God exists at all. I would recommend the course to other students without reservation, as it will improve critical thinking, knowledge of religious thought in the modern West, and appreciation for different ways of treating questions central to human life."
