    "This course is great if you want to learn about classical chinese from Confucius through to Zhuangzi. It is a continuation of the previous semester's class. The material can sometimes be dry though!",
    "Overall not a bad course. Interesting material, and I have always been curious about the Eastern philosophies. Tho, sometimes it became a bit overly tedious to the extent that I felt it was totally unnecessary. Still, came away having learned important life lessons and overall glad I took the course.",
    "As taught by Kang Laoshi, this class was informative but not the best. It's taught in Modern Chinese, which is good for your listening and reading practice, but there's almost no speaking practice involved. The tests are difficult, but the homework is on the heavy side of reasonable; you definitely have to work to do well. If you're not already familiar with Kang Laoshi's teaching style, be aware that it's not for everyone, though he's very knowledgeable and has a really interesting personal background.",
    "Fantastic course!",
    "The class covers readings from Confucius, Mencius, Laozi and Zhuangzi. It's a great class and taught very well by Prof. Kang in Chinese. However, he is retiring this year and I have doubt that the replacement will be as great as Kang Laoshi."
