   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of memorization and very little application until the end of class. It would have been easier to understand terms if cases were spread throughout the semester instead of solely at the end.",
    "It was a very interesting class. Sometimes it was difficult to see the forest amongst the trees, but the last section of the class really tied everything together.",
    "It is a good class and teaches you some basic idea in risk assessment.",
    "informative",
    "This course provides a strong introduction to cancer and noncancer risk assessment, and applies these principles in several small discussions, leading up to a final debate. The debate is a critical component of the course, testing students' abilities to adequately synthesize and articulate concepts learned.",
    "In the beginning, I wasn't sure how I felt about the class or where it was going. However, by the end of the class, looking back, I thought that the class made sense and came together for me. I think I might have preferred to get some reading earlier on that was lighter. Maybe if there is a beginner textbook for Risk assessment? I'm not sure what I'm looking for, but something to help guide the first half of the semester. In the end though, I did feel that I got a lot out of the class, and I enjoyed the MTBE debate. I'm definitely glad that I took the course.",
    "Confusing at times. Lectures and expectations of course were very confusing and hard to figure out what the professor expects.",
    "The two quizzes in the early part of the semester emphasize rote memorization instead of comprehension of concepts. Overall the course was worth it. Some of the assignments felt out of place though unfortunately. Course would be enhanced by the presence of a textbook.",
    "It was a challenging class and more difficult than expected.",
    "I did not enjoy this course because I felt like so much material was thrown at us in the beginning (which I understand was necessary in order to do what came later) and then all the work for the course was given to us at the end, which was a little overwhelming. I wish we were given examples of risk assessmentswhen we were learning the material so that we could better visualize what he was talking about. I felt very lost throughout the entire semester, and I know I am not alone in feeling that way.",
    "This was undoubtedly the most poorly executed course I have taken at Yale, possibly including my undergraduate education. Dr. Borak immediately alerted the students that the course relied heavily on the understanding of jargon yet made no efforts to help students become accustomed to the jargon. And when the students were not able to keep up, as revealed from the classwide poor performance on the first quiz, Dr. Borak was vocally upset with us and proceeded ahead with no change in methods. Furthermore, it is ridiculous to assign students to prepare for and conduct a debate during reading week as well as prepare for a final exam. While the course requires minimal work throughout the semester, the amount of \"rushed\" project he forces on us at the end is not appropriate. Additionally, Dr. Borak almost refused to clarify what it was he wanted us to debate or understand for the final exam. None of us were certain if we was being intentionally difficult to understand when asked the question, \"what is the topic of the debate\" or if he really is incapable of answering a simple question.",
    "A lot of the information provided and the cases we studied seemed isolated and unrelated until the end. Perhaps the class could emphasize better why we were studying specific cases and what underlying principle is important to the professor.",
    "A very comprehensive look at Risk Assessment, both conceptually and practically.Not intuitive in the first few weeks.Concepts and sub-topics do come together well (PLUS)However the subject can be quite heavy when combined (NOT-SO-PLUS).Vocab quizzes are good for helping to encourage understanding (PLUS)But do not entirely prepare persons for theory challenge in final (NOT-SO-PLUS).",
    "I left the class feeling like I didn't learn much. I was confused most of the semester and every other student I spoke with was in the same boat. Probably the most frustrating thing was the fact that we had to conduct a 'debate' during our reading week at the end of the semester. I think it should have been done prior to the reading week if at all, because all it did was add much more stress than there should have been. Rather than using the reading week to prepare for my other finals, I had to spend it with my group preparing for this debate which then left me a whole day and a half to study for 3 finals. The only benefit was that it did help sum up the semester of information to the point where I felt I finally almost understood the concepts. Although I wish this would have been a bit sooner in the semester so I wasn't having an \"aha\" moment right before the test, it at least helped me with the final.",
    "This class taught concepts used in other classes and was very beneficial for occ med students."

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0informative, interesting, enthusiastic",

His lectures are very engaging, and he presents the information in a succinct fashion that is understandable for both physicians and public health students outside the realm of healthcare. Dr. Borak is always open to visits for questions or concerns at his office.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan is a very knowledgeable instructor. He makes a LOT of effort to meet with his students and speak with them . My one wish is that he would go through and try to explain the concepts FIRST simply, and then to use the more elevated definitions. I often felt that I wasn't sure what was being said. In reflection though, I feel very positively about the instruction. As aprofessor, Jonathan is very eager to provide feedback, and responded well to questions and encouraged class discussion and student participation with the material.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very understanding and enthusiastic professor!",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Good instructor, flexible and passionate about his students learning course concepts.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very kind and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Although I enjoyed having Dr. Borak as a professor, he could have been much clearer about what he wanted us to do when it came to assignments and projects. I felt like I never truly understood what was expected of us.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor provided a wealth of real world experience and provided a lot of examples and cases where he had some involvement in. The only thing I would change is to somehow emphasize more class participation. Professor Borak did encourage discussion, but understand that this is the first risk assessment class of a lot of students, and this lack of experience is going to make us hesitate to answer some of the questions for fear of being utterly wrong.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very knowledgeable. Eloquent. Passionate. Humorous. Very inviting and approachable. Tries much to be available and willing to share supplementary materials.A bit intimidating though not quite insisting; could find more ways and\/or means to encourage participation, given his lecture style.P.S.His TA is very engaging and fair\/diplomaticin providing feedback when interacting.More interaction during actual lectures would be a plus.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He was very enthusiastic about the material, that was clear. I just never felt like I got a clear answer when I or anyone else would ask a question. It was almost like his answers were like a politician's in that they were very vague and didn't seem to get to the point or bottom line. This made it very difficult to understand.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0I liked his teaching style. He was very methodical, easy to approach, and did a good job of recapping the concepts learned in prior classes. I felt at times that his instructions for assignments needed further clarification. It was helpfulto visit him at his office."

    "I would not recommend this course, since its confusing what is going on and what is expected. Although the course material itself is not that bad though.",

    "The course information didn't seem to finally come together until the very end of the semester after the debate.

However, the concepts are very important to understanding all aspects of environmental health sciences in a practical sense.",
