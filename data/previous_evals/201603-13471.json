   "comments": [
    "I gained a new perspective on the meaning of womanhood across cultures and greater understanding of history as a whole. It made me realize just how incomplete our understanding of the world is. I gained the confidence that I need to properly engage in meaningful discussion during seminars, improved my research skills, and learned how to analyze history for deeper meaning.",
    "This course was amazing! We covered a very large time period, and I learned a lot about the evolution of the role of the women. The class discussions were extremely engaging, and this class was very thought-provoking, eye-opening and downright perspective changing. I learned how to analyze changes in societal structures more critically, how to compare women's status across place and time, and the course also improved my writing quite a lot!",
    "During this course, I learned how to write an effective argument and thesis using historical documents as justification. I learned a lot about women's history and the ever growing spectrum of \"gray\" within politics.",
    "I learned how to take the most valuable information from longer readings instead of trying to take in all of the information",
    "Immense knowledge about the history of women and how their role has changed over time and space.",
    "I just gained a general knowledge about the last few century's of women's history and how that relates to feminism and women's rights. I learned to analyze documents from several time periods as well as write thoughtfully about women's issues.",
    "Better understanding of issues for women around the world",
    "I learned a lot about various difficulties women face across the world, and how different feminisms aim to address these different issues.",
    "This seminar taught me about various different cultures and religions and the ways in which women have experienced them over a large amount of time. I learned about the nuance and complexity of women's issues and the women's rights movements and how to have a meaningful discussion about them.",
    "My writing skills really grew in this course, along with my ability to do research,",
    "This course taught me how to apply and follow past concepts and ideas into present circumstances. It also helped me make connections between similarities between time and space in the world.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of women, as the title of the course indicates. The course was based on class discussions, so I acquired more skills in discussing with other students."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great reading, amazing professor, amazing students, fantastic (well-led) discussions, engaging subject material Weaknesses: it only lasts a semester",
    "The readings were great, the class discussion was great, Professor Tannenbaum was an excellent professor.",
    "I really enjoyed the in class discussions. I also really appreciated going to the art galleries to analyze primary sources that were other than documents. However, I wish we had written more 5-6 page papers for more practice.",
    "-It goes chronologically so it is very interesting to see the changes or stagnation in progress for women throughout history",
    "Strengths: Great professor, engaging, interesting course material, great discussions. weaknesses: none.",
    "The strength is that we covered a lot of material and we had a lot of good discussions, but we had so many readings and so little time to discuss all of them that I felt like there was no synthesis of our material. Also since this was a writing credit, I thought that I would have more time to discuss the writing component and my writing skills than I actually did.",
    "Very interesting readings and great activities (visits to art museums)",
    "I enjoyed the discussion-based seminar where we can bring up our thoughts and questions openly.",
    "The other classmates made this class very strong in its discussion. Every class was engaging and insightful and students were excited about the information. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "The strengths include the material and the diversity of woman in the class itself. There were no weaknesses.",
    "A strength of this course is the small size, which is very useful for interesting discussions and enables interaction between the participants. Each lesson there were highly informative readings, which were discussed in class. On the other hand, because the topic is so broad, there sometimes was a lack of organisation and direction."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course is wonderful. The reading is well contained and always interesting, the class discussions are vibrant, the professor is organized and thoughtful and just plain inspiring, and the knowledge gained is powerful. It's also just plain fun, with great trips to art museums and the Beinecke!",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING! if you are lucky enough to get a place, you should take it! Professor Tannenbaum is an extremely knowledgable, helpful and passionate professor. I have so many memories from this class, and I loved its atmosphere, the readings, the class discussions... The syllabus is very well organized, with smooth transitions from topic to topic, and by the end of the class you'd feel like you have a much better understanding about the history of women and a much greater appreciation of the feminist movement.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The professor was magnificent and gave good feedback (constructive criticism, responded promptly to emails, was available for extra outside help, etc.). We also read a variety of sources regarding women -- many from outside of the U.S. -- which was very helpful in gaining perspective.",
    "Yes, Professor Tannenbaum is an awesome professor and I thought the class helped me learn a lot of history about women and also men in history that I did not previously know.",
    "Yes. I think this course was a perfect way to begin my freshman year at yale. The environment was welcoming, discussions were interesting and thoughtful.",
    "Absolutely. I came away from this course with a much greater understanding of women and how they have shaped history. I feel my entire perspective has been altered in the most positive, revolutionary way.",
    "It really depends on how interested you are in the readings. A lot of people in the class already had a lot of background, and so I felt that a lot of the themes that we discussed I was already aware of. I think that the class could have been more constructive towards my writing, so don't take this if you want help with that. There are definitely better writing credit courses and the material can get repetitive.",
    "Yes amazing class",
    "Yes. I think every srudent should learn about women's history as world history.",
    "I would recommend this to any other students. Especially those who are interested in history and women's studies. I would recommend it to students of all concentrations though because I believe the information is vital for all to understand an issue that is so prevalent and pervasive today.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes absolutely. It is a really well-rounded education of the subject and allows students to cultivate their own thoughts and contribute them to the conversation.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other freshen students. Freshmen seminars are a great environment for learning, as there are small groups and students with the same amount of experience at college. For anyone who is interested in women's history it is an informative, even if not very organised, course to take."
