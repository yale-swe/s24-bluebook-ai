    "Fine course, Prof. Simon is very knowledgeable and hearing him talk about various examples was great. Computers need to be banned from the seminar though, that really hurt discussion. I liked the format of being assigned a country and following it throughout the semester.",
    "I learned a lot about various civil conflicts throughout history and the world. It was incredible to get that breadth of knowledge.",
    "I was pushed to view conflicts and post-conflicts enviroments in their complexity. We learnt various approaches to peace-building and gained a deep knowledge of case countries through out the semester.",
    "My analytical skills, as well as my love for fruitful debate both grew throughout the course. What I loved most about the course was the fact that Professor Simon spent the first part of each seminar talking about relevant current affairs or his views on the readings. This allowed us to learn a great deal beyond the readings and grasp a very deep understanding of the themes' importance in today's political arena."

   "comments": [
    "No computers!!! Having computers opened really hurt the level of engagement and discussion.",
    "Very engaging discussions that were superbly moderated by Professor Simon. Thoughprovoking analyses of the assigned texts.",
    "Good and informative class discussions that covered a wide range of topics.",
    "The most amazing part of this class is the aspect of choice. Each student chooses one post-conflict country to focus on, and is able to apply each week's readings to his or her country of study. The presentations that each student gives to the class on their country are invaluable an supplement to an already engaging class.",
    "I think the strengths are the case studies of conflicts around the world. I wish we had gone more in depth for each conflict so that we knew all the basics for each one. It would be great if in addition to the student presentations, Professor Simon also gave a summary of each of the conflicts.",
    "Strength : Very focused and well planned",
    "As I mentioned previously, Professor SImon spent the beginning of the Seminar talking before he gave the floor to the students. This put the debate on track and widened the students' horizons on the themes that were discussed in the latter part of the seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I feel that it gave me an excellent introduction to the field of post-conflict politics around the world. We studied a variety of case studies and analyzed them using key theories taught in the class. Additionally, I liked that we were assigned a specific country on which we focused throughout the semester. It really enabled me to learn a lot about a part of the world I had been quite unfamiliar with previously. Additionally, Professor David Simon is an expert in this field and taught the class very well using a mix of lecturing and class discussions.",
    "Fine course, Prof. Simon is very knowledgeable and hearing him talk about various examples was great. Computers need to be banned from the seminar though, that really hurt discussion. I liked the format of being assigned a country and following it throughout the semester.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Good class!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in the topic of Post-Conflict Politics (for example, most of the topics in the syllabus), and had a specific country that they were especially interested in looking at for a whole semester.",
    "Absolutely, you get a survey of various post-conflict political set ups and situations while also being able to delve more deeply into a case study of your choice.",
    "I would because you get to study a number of different conflicts around the world that a lot people talk about but do not really understand.",
    "Yes, needed in a world with so much conflict.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. Professor Simon is one of the best polisci professors I have ever taken a class with, and the fact that this class is a seminar makes learning from him a lot greater. Professor Simon takes the time to tell the students exactly what he thinks about their views, ideas, and performance, which is exactly what I look for in a seminar\/ seminar professor. The fact that we discussed current affairs during class (the election, Lebanon's presidential election, Columboa..) also made it a lot more enjoyable and useful outside the class."
