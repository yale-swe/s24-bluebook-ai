   "comments": [
    "Great course and very interesting. Nuno is a great lecturer and you'll learn to love his painfully bad jokes. However, the workload is intense; I don't see how anyone could possibly do all the readings (which are often quite interesting). Definitely a good candidate to be taken CR\/D",
    "Take this if you have a Credit\/D to spare. The lectures are fantastic if you have any interest in military history, and Nuno is always engaging. The readings, however, are excessive and repetitive at times. Moreover, there are no graded assignments other than the two exams, which due to a mixture of absurd time constraints and Hitleresque grading will often result in an unexpected grade. With that in mind, credit\/D'ing this class will give you an exciting, low-workload, worry-free class that will provide a great insight into the Mearsheimer-strain of IR thought.",
    "Take it! The professor is great. Only complaint- there's a fair amount of reading.",
    "Fascinating lectures. The perfect Cr\/D class.",
    "This class is incredible- if there is any way you can fit in into your schedule, take it. Professor Monteiro is great, and now I really want to take another class with him. Be careful, though- the grading is difficult, and you can easily do poorly on the midterm even if you understand the material, so it's a very good idea to sign up for this class credit\/d. If you switch back to a letter grade later, that's fine, but start the semester credit\/d.",
    "Take a course with professor Monteiro anytime you can. He is definitely one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS! Know before you go in though that it is a polisci class, not a history class. Most of second semester is current affairs.",
    "Take the class, it's like a cross between a history course and understanding the power plays and international relations from WWI to present day.Nuno is a great lecturer, he sticks to the point and goes over the major ideas in class. He sometimes cracks jokes. Take notes in lecture and compare them with the readings to get the major study points for exams.There is a decent amount of reading to be done, but it's incredibly helpful and prepares you well for the exams. Lectures are great, be sure to take notes, and sections are mandatory. The TA's are really nice and helpful.It's not a very hard class, just be sure to do the readings and attend lecture + section and you'll be fine.",
    "NOT A GUT. Take it if you want to learn, but this is definitely not a gut.",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale. An extremely interesting look at realist international grand strategy, particularly how it relates to US foreign policy and history. It's got a bit of military history, a bit of theory, and a bit of diplomatic history all woven into one masterful lecture. I know Prof. Monteiro is going on leave next year, but if he teaches this class again, a MUST TAKE for those interested in US foreign policy and strategy. Lots and lots and lots of readings though-- about 300-400 pages per week.",
    "Yes take it if you are even just remotely interested in the topic. Great readings.",
    "GREAT CLASS. Will totally change the way you learned about military history in a fantastic way. You'll feel ten times more knowledgable about the world after taking this class.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in the 20th and 21st century! The workload is a bit much, but if you're good with picking and choosing, you'll be fine. Plus, the majority of the class knowledge is located in the lectures, so make sure you don't miss any. Professor Monteiro is great - lectures will feel like seconds!",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. Nuno is just amazing!",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in international politics and US preponderence of power. If the military bores you, this isn't a class for you. You will learn a lot about US power history as well as current issues that we face.",
    "It has a lot of reading, some of which is relevant neither to the class nor the exams. But then some of the readings are. But their so long! The lectures are more interesting towards the beginning, with examples of balance of power from WWI and the like, but then the hypothetical \"What should we do about China\/Iran\/North Korea?\" becomes the focus of the class--and is less interesting. If you want to learn about how powers deal with threats from other powers throughout history and how to apply your knowledge it to such threatening powers as China and Iran, do this class. If you only care about history (like me) and not political theory, look elsewhere.",
    "If you're looking for a low-stress history-slash-poli-sci class on war, take it! I don't think anyone would really regret taking it regardless of their major.",
    "This is a course that everyone at Yale should take.",
    "Definitely take this class! A lot of readings (that you might not have to necessarily do) but definitely a great class. I learned a huge deal and am very happy I took it.",
    "I would recommend the class. I was taking it as a 5th class that I didn't put much work into, but it definitely was a good review of important topics. It kind of was the military history of the 20th century though.",
    "Take. This. Class. (but do it Credit\/D unless you're willing to put a LOT of time into the reading, because the reading is essential to do well)",
    "A good introduction into realist IR theory. You'll cover the major wars of the 20th Century and US strategy up to today. Monteiro's a good lecturer, very entertaining and comprehensive. Once in a while a week will have some long readings, but overall not a heavy course load.",
    "I think that this is a great fifth class for anyone interested in learning about the world wars, cold war and post cold war periods. The course covers each of these topics not too much in depth. The material covered on the first two world wars covers a lot of history while the post world wars material covers a lot of strategies.It's also a good class to take Credit\/D\/Fail since there's only one midterm and a final. You may just have to scheme through the readings before every section though. But this is not necessary either if you attend the lectures and if you don't really care about the grades much in case you're taking it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "not being offered again. but it was a great class, probably the best lecture ive taken thus far, or at least one of them",
    "This is a fantastic class! Nuno is an amazing lecturer who made class thoroughly enjoyable and I was physically excited to go listen to him speak. The readings though are rather ridiculous and I barely know anyone in the class who was able to keep up with them. Having said this, the workload is not too bad, just a midterm and a final, both of which are explained very clearly and there are no surprises. A lot of people in the class had knowledge from previous classes, or from being from the regions studied, and therefore coming into the class with no history background in either the world wars or the cold war can prove to be slightly challenging at first. Regardless of all this, I highly recommend this class!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Only if they're willing to do the massive readings, or want to take it Cr\/D.",
    "Good cred\/d",
    "I would definitely recommend it. A class that covers fascinating material with a top-quality lecturer. Much of the first half of the course if going over 1st and 2nd World War history that many have covered before, but the course devotes a lot of time to the post-Cold War world that no other course I have taken before has covered.",
    "Take this class! very relevant",
    "A wonderful class that involves a lot of reading, but an excellent professor. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but advise them to take it at least initially credit - d, as there is a lot of reading. Later in the course, if the student is feeling up for it, he or she can change it to a letter grade, but definitely initially take it credit - d.",
    "Overall, BOP is a class that I would recommend to everyone. Professor Monteiro teaches it extremely well, the material is interesting and pertinent, and the class itself (outside of the readings) isn't too much work. There is a lot of reading to do, so I would highly recommend keeping on top of it; otherwise, you'll feel extremely swamped. Excellent class. Take it.",
    "great intro class to realism",
    "The study of 20th century warfare and conflict in the context of modern balance of power theories. It was an excellent course and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes. You'll learn a lot from Prof Monteiro",
    "Lectures cover very interesting topics, and the professor is just as engaging. The weekly reading load is pretty heavy, unless you take the class credit d then just go to lecture, sit back and enjoy the class.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but most of it is worth it. If you're interested in how nations balance each other (the \"balance of power\") and in military history, you should definitely take this course! If you're not sure, just try it! You'll have a good time anyway.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The balance of power is a concept that isn't really talked about but is extremely relevant and expanded my understanding of world events and international relations significantly.",
    "In Political Science 126 students learn about the evolution of the balance of power from WWI to the present day. Though there are a lot of readings, they are engaging. The lectures are also very interesting. There is one midterm and one final exam. Both the midterm and final have ID questions as well as essays. There is also a mandatory discussion section, which provides a great forum in which students can ask questions. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "I really enjoyed this class for the most part. With only a few exceptions, the lectures were quite interesting and the professor was an engaging lecturer. The format of this class was nice as a credit\/d\/fail choice because there were only two major evaluations, the midterm and the final, but a final worth 50% was intimidating. I really enjoyed the material of this course, not having any background in military history, and it was great to learn about events that I have some familiarity with through a new lens.",
    "I loved the class - the material was fascinating and the lectures even more interesting. The readings were great too but I really enjoyed how the lectures were so closely tied to the readings. A lot of readings but you don't have to do them!",
    "If Monteiro offers this class again, you should absolutely take it, and if he doesn't, you should take whatever course he does teach. He's an amazing professor, and the perspective on war offered in this class is entirely unique and completely changes the way you think. The tests were hard, but very fair, and definitely manageable. I cannot recommend the class enough.",
    "It was a great class primarily because of Nuno, but often times the readings, the class, and the exams seemed disconnected.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that teaches you the fundamentals of political science (how to analyze historic events, what theories to keep in mind, sources to use, etc)and a thorough history of WW1 WW2 and the cold war. It also teaches you to appreciate foreign policy decisions today and how to understand current international issues in the news as well.",
    "Yes if you like political science and want to learn about some theories and general political history of the world.",
    "Take this course if you are at all interested in better understanding the evolution of international relations in the 20th century. However, be prepared for the readings which are time consuming but which also greatly enhance the course.",
    "I loved BOP. Nuno is the greatest professor (one of the best I have had at Yale). His lectures are highly engaging, and sometimes even funny, and you will definitely learn a lot. The material is interesting and important to know. The sections are fun and not stressful in the least. The actual work load is low (midterm, final) but try and do some of the readings before the tests so that you don't have to scramble - the tests are not a breeze and to do well you should have a command of the material. Overall I HIGHLY recommend this course - I loved it!"
