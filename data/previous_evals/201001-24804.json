   "comments": [
    "I would take this class because there are surprising concepts that you cannot glean from just taking any introductory international relations class.",
    "solid if you are interested in stuff in the international arena.",
    "Take this class. Very interesting and well structured.",
    "I think this is definitely an important class to take if you're interested in IS. When I started it, I thought it would be about the specifics of individual IOs, like the UN or IMF; it turns out the first half is mostly the philosophies of IOs and why they work or not, and then you apply these theories to IOs. This is much better than simply learning about IOs; the 'why' really makes the class much more interesting and informative. The reading is intensive, but Prof Hyde goes over most of it in class so you don't need to read every single word. The exams are straightforward (you get study guides with all potential questions).",
    "Yes! This is a really fun class, the material isn't too complicated, and it provides a lot of useful knowledge about international organizations. Professor Hyde is really nice and engaging, and the class involves a lot of really interesting discussions.",
    "The course provides a comprehensive survey of international organizations (from the well-known UN, IMF, OAS to the more obscure) over the environment, human rights, democracy promotion, international finance, etc. Equal emphasis on theoretical (why IOs exist, what gives them power) and practical (looking at the effectiveness of a particular IO\/issue area). Readings are understandable and while they can be a bit dense or plentiful at times, class lectures effectively review relevant material. While the class material consistently corresponded very closely to the readings, I thought that this was appropriate for an intro course. The readings were very informative and provided a strong, diverse foundation with viewpoints from many schools of thought, which may explain why little deviation was observed in class lectures. The course was very informative and has both equipped me to better understand international organizations and changed how I view my other subjects as well.The workload is quite manageable, major assignments being only a midterm, short paper, and final exam. It is necessary to do the readings, though, as participation is also important. However, don't be intimidated if you have not studied this previously. I found this to be a very informative introductory class that was not excessively difficult. It's also pretty neat to be hearing about election fraud or democracy promotion from someone who has worked for the OSCE or The Carter Center as an election monitor.",
    "Very interesting material and good focuses in the course (International Organizations and the environment, human rights, interactions between different types of organizations). I learned a lot and really took from this course. Good professor and well structure course. Interesting lectures.",
    "Unfortunately, this was not my favorite Political Science course. The course focused too heavily on meaningless international relations theory and I don't feel I gained much from it. Also, class started at 9am, meaning the interactive discussions were not interactive. Additionally, there is an unnecessarily large amount of reading to be done for this course most of which is not fully covered in class. This class would have been much better if it were a lecture and if the readings were more historically based, rather than focused on theory. If you want a more meaningful political science course, look elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend the class because I think that the material covered is interesting and I actually left the class knowing that I learned things that could be applied in the future. Professor Hyde tried to elicit class participation which worked on the whole, but this might only be due to the small-ish class size. There was a fair amount of reading though. The exams are straight forwardif you use the study guides she provides.",
    "Eh. It was interesting material, but not such an interesting class. I mostly enjoyed the readings, but class was just sitting there while Professor Hyde talked about what you had read, and then asking simple questions every so often.",
    "a general survey course of different international orgs and IO theory. sometimes too basic but at other times helpful if it's the first time you're learning about something. prof hyde does a good job lecturing. she expects class participation though, which can sometimes be hard at 9am. overall, a more introductory level polisci class but lots of helpful info as a foundation.",
    "International Organization is an analysis of the situations in which international organizations can have an effect on the international system in which they operate, what effects they might have, and the complications of powerful organizations.I would recommend this course. If you have an interest in international relations or prospects for cooperation, take this class. The papers and ideas presented can also help to understand a wide variety of phenomena we observe.",
    "It's a relatively easy class and professor Hyde is accessible and understanding. Also, if you're going to take it, pay special attention to the texts read in the first month because the theory you read in that time resurfaces throughout the semester."
