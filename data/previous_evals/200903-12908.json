    "Math 115 isn't terribly difficult, but it has challenging exams, so you definitely need a helpful instructor. Wai was a very good teacher, and you can do fine in this course.",
    "Math 115 was a very straightforward and solid course. I appreciated that the problem sets were not ridiculously long and not busy work, but just enough to make sure we got some practice in and learned the material. Shop the sections to make sure you like the teaching style of the lecturer.",
    "It's just your standard Calc 2 class. Take it if you need to. Midterms and problem sets are reasonable, but the final will destroy your soul.On the bright side, Wai Kong is a god among men. He once proved Euler's identity using nothing but toothpicks and marshmallows. I kid you not. You should ask him to show you.",
    "you need to really know and be interested in calculus to take this class. teaching was not very good and the tests were hard.",
    "I would take it only if you have to. It starts off fine but by the end is challenging. Do the extra practice problems for sure and make use of the math department tutors if you need to.",
    "Its pretty hard. you need to do a lot of work by yourself. tests are also pretty hard. but... once your finished you'll have a relatively strong grasp of calculus",
    "If you've already taken calc bc, please don't take this class. if you do, most of your classmates will also have taken calc bc, making the class exceedingly difficult for those who have only taken calc ab, and due to the poor teaching of the class you will probably do poorly, not even earning the easy A you assume will come along with it. If you need this class as a prereq, take it."
