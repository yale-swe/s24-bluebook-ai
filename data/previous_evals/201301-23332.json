   "comments": [
    "I didn't know if I would like having so much reading to do, but I loved it. The books may appear daunting, but the only time I felt remotely overwhelmed was when we were reading Ulysses, and I don't know how anyone could pick up Ulysses and not feel overwhelmed, so this is understandable. It's also incredibly exciting to have an excuse to read such amazing literature! I felt like I was getting indoctrinated into a special club exclusive for committed readers. I would absolutely take this class again and I'm devastated that next semester I won't have my bi-weekly section to talk over the amazing writing found in the reading list. TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Take it with Stefan. It will be one of the best things you do here.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in epics. The books are great, the class is well taught, and the writing the essays is an interesting challenge.",
    "A lot of reading - a little unorganized in discussion because it's primarily based on students, but still fun. Take it if you really enjoy your epics :), but not if you need a writing credit - this class is more about the reading.",
    "This is a great class inwhich to study a lot of really great texts: the Odyssey, Aeneid, Inferno, Don Quixote, Ulysses (actually it's questionable how great this one really is - more like vomit-inducing), and in our case, the Road by Cormac McCarthy. However, it's a LOT of reading, and you spend the same amount of time (2 weeks) on each book. This means that some texts are really glossed over, which is a pity. The class might definitely be improved by spending a week on the Inferno and\/or the Aeneid and more time on some of the other texts.It's great that the due dates for each paper are spread out throughout the term and you can choose which papers to write (short 4-6 page essays).",
    "Take this class. If there is any possibility to take it with Stefan Esposito, do everything in your power to make that happen.",
    "The texts covered in this class are long and covered very quickly (about one large book every week and a half), so expect to struggle with keeping up on reading. However, they are all interesting works that provide a strong foundation for the study of a lot of other literature. Professor Esposito makes this class really enjoyable!"
