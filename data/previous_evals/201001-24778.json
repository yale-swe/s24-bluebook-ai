   "comments": [
    "I think this class could be reworked a lot, but if you look at the syllabus and are still interested, take it. I wasn't crazy about it, but I'm glad I attempted the material.",
    "Yes, if you want to think about time in a way that the super-analytic philosophy department will never allow you to. Just don't expect it to be one of the greatest classes ever, and try to get help with the more difficult authors on the syllabus.",
    "A very interesting approach to some very interesting texts. Very reasonable course load.",
    "You should be aware that this course on time focuses on philosophy, not physics. We had one or two physics students who had some neat contributions to the discussion, but it is not a class on the theory of relativity. Despite that, I would recommend this course to people from pretty much any major. The way Professor North centers the discussions makes them relevant to most areas of study. Definitely a great class, and one that I looked forward to, even though it was at 5:20 on Thursdays when all I wanted to do was take a nap.",
    "Definitely take it. The reading list is incredible and Prof. North is fantastic (and hilarious). There were one or two administrative issues with the course this year, but I imagine they'll be rectified in the future. The final paper is a blast.",
    "Take this class, it's one of my favorite seminars at Yale. In the end, Theories of Time turned out to be more of a lecture, but Professor North has so many insightful comments that you will likely be content to hear him speak for the 2 hours of class. Most of the time, very few people actually did the readings, so our contributions were not usually significant or helpful. No other class allows you to muse at length on the topics covered in Theories of Time, such as the relationship between consciousness and temporality, the issue of not being able to talk about time because it takes time to talk about it, how to define \"now\", time as it relates to the body, etc. Professor North has a great sense of humor and the right (if there is a right) attitude towards learning. He doesn't try to prescribe a certain method or approach. He would rather you daydream than be distracted by surfing the web during class, is always open to questions, and spends a lot of time trying to help students understand the topics from their own point of view.",
    "A very cool course. Professor North creates a space for thinking, musing, and getting distracted in the best possible way. Upon leaving (and often during the course) it feels like we've been all over the place without going or being anywhere at all. But whatever it was: it was a pleasure and a privilege."
