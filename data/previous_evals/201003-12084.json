   "comments": [
    "A very interesting class on how economics can be applied to our world's natural resources and pollution in general. Great class to take if you're interested.",
    "Yes, a great class. very interesting material",
    "I would recommend Econ 330 to another student for sure. It was a great course to learn about some topics that are very relevant in todays world. It also is not that difficult of a class and i'm hoping fairly easy to get a decent grade.",
    "If you're an econ major or have any interest in the topic, take it!",
    "I'd recommend it. Econ majors and non econ majors - interesting, not too hard",
    "Yes - easy and usually interesting. If you're good at Econ or an Econ major and looking for a 5th class, take this. Watch out for the curve though, since ppl tend to do really well.",
    "An overview of many topics in environmental economics, including nonrenewable resources, cap and trade\/carbon taxes, forestry, fisheries, and water resources. It is all fascinating and well worth knowing as a citizen of the world. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "I found this class a really interesting way to look at environmental issues today. It is not too hard and very manageable. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes if you're looking for a class with little work. The problem sets don't take that long and reading isn't necessary, but you have to be sure to pay attention in class and section so you don't feel like you have a whole semester to catch up on before the final (like me right now). Class is easy to zone out in because its so disorganized. Sit towards the front and don't bring anything that can distract you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! I took it on the words of my friend: \"take it, it will change the way you think about a lot of things,\" and I will pass on the same words of advice to any students who are considering taking this course!",
    "I would strongly recommend Economics of Natural Resources to another student.Economics of Natural Resources is a great course, divided in part among pollution (and it's solutions) and resource (non-renewable and renewable) economics.The workload is very manageable (weekly problem set, weekly section, midterm, final). It's definitely not a gut, but is probably one of the easier economics courses.The course definitely one of the better-taught within the major. Professor Mendelsohn is one of the best economics lecturers in the department. He is very dynamic and holds attention well while being sure that he clearly delineates the most important points of the lecture.The course's strengths are the clarity with which important ideas are taught: not only do students learn the economic theory (and mathematical solutions) behind pollution and resource economics, we understand the real-world application of the theories from an environmental, economic, and sometimes historical perspective.The only weakness of the course (and of Professor Mendelsohn's lectures) are that they can become a tad repetitive. However, any student would prefer repetition and clarity to a rushed lesson that leads to confusion.I'd recommend David Keiser as a TA if you take the course.",
    "I say take it if you're an Econ major or if you have an interest in the environment.",
    "This is a great class to take if you are or aren't an econ major. The material is interesting and the work load is not too much.",
    "This is a doable economics course, especially for non-econ\/non-math majors. You learn about issues of social importance, but also how they are related to numbers and values. If you'd like to be able to put a price tag on clean air, this is a good class for you.",
    "Its a great class. The topic is obviously very relevant. It gives you a better grasp on whats going on in the world from an economic perspective and how economics applies to the real world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, as long as you have taken Intro Micro. It builds on a lot of thoseconcepts. The lectures are fun, the problem sets are easy, and the tests are very reasonable. Whether you take it for a grade or not, you're probably going to find this class interesting and a piece of cake.",
    "Yes, its great course. Very informative about a growing field within economics.",
    "Econ330 was a good course. Informative, not too difficult, etc. I'd suggest it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Interesting and relevant material, very accessible to non-majors and Mendelsohn is an engaging lecturer. Take Lint Barrage's section if she teaches the course; she is wonderful.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "Overall mediocre class, the exams didn't really test students' understanding which was disappointing.",
    "Midterm final and problem sets. Problem sets are straight forward and the answers are discussed in section. A nice class to take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend Econ 330 both to economics students looking for additional economics class to take, and other students looking for a QR credit. If you've taken introductory microeconomics (I think its required, but the TA's also offered review sessions of intro micro during the first week, so if you're a little rusty or haven't taken it since high school you might be fine). As an economics student, I found the material interesting and the math not too difficult. If you aren't an economics major, it's a good and interesting QR that isn't actually that heavy on the QR. The problem sets were not difficult and the exams focused mostly on policy and theoretical questions, not on math.",
    "Super easy.",
    "If you're looking for a class that isn't too much work but still interesting, then you should take this class. The material takes information from economics and other fields and applies it to issues in the environment. The concepts you learn are very applicable to policy and environmental issues today.",
    "I cannot recommend this course, which is too bad because the subject matter is quite interesting. In theory it covers a lot of material, but only very superficially. You are not expected to read or understand any of the posted articles. If you have the time, though, I would. Otherwise you won't get anything out of the class. Prof. Mendelsohn is very important in the field of natural resource economics, but he never appeared prepared for lecture.",
    "Great econ elective course. Very simple micro and the problem sets aren't very rigorous. Mendelsohn is a great lecturer. I definitely recommend it.",
    "If you are looking for an easy econ class, take it. If you have thought about this stuff much though, you won't learn much.Most of this is just a pretty easy extension of intro micro.",
    "Yes one of the more approachable econ classes at yale",
    "Great econ course where you will be able to apply concepts to a very real part of the economy. Take it if you're an econ major.",
    "I would highly recommend Econ 330 to any person interested in the environment. It gives you a good framework to approach environmental problems and deals with some of today's most crucial topics in a very realistic and practical manner. Professor Mendelsohn is great and, if you go to lecture and section, it should not be a hard course. Readings are interesting but not essential to understand the material.",
    "This is a pretty good, low-work class. Only complaint was that sometimes we would spend 50 minutes talking about some relatively easy concept, and I found myself wishing we could move faster or be challenged more (problem sets were pretty elementary). But if you want something interesting and not too difficult, take this.",
    "Interesting lecture. Mostly focused on economic processes as opposed to the big picture environmental ideas. A little disillusioning from an environmentalist's perspective, but probably in a useful way. The material isn't hard at all, even for a non-economics person, but you can get a lot more out of it if you go to lecture.",
    "Take it. It's a pretty good course.",
    "A good course that looks at some interesting applications of economic tools to the problems facing the use of natural resources. It will change the way you think about environmentalism.",
    "An easy econ credit. Lectures aren't amazing; Mendelsohn doesn't explain the intuition behind the ideas he presents, which I found annoying. Once you realize you just need to understand it superficially, it becomes pretty easy, though. Problem sets take 45 minutes, concepts aren't hard, and the reading is certainly optional. You learn a few cool applications of econ, which is fun, but if you're looking for a full semester's worth of material, this might not be the one. Note: Mendelsohn takes a hard-line economist stand to the environment.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommmend ECON 330.",
    "i would recommend this class as a fairly easy econ credit for econ majors or as a good introduction to both economics and basic problems of pollution and resource use for students who don't have much experience with these topics.",
    "Gain an economic framework for thinking about natural resource use. No textbook, and readings are not mandatory really because you are never evaluated on them at all. Prof only knows econ, and is completely condescending towards science, so it's frustrating because he simplifies and biases every issue by how he talks about them.",
    "Easy econ class. Take it and you'll learn a lot about resourse and pollution economics."
