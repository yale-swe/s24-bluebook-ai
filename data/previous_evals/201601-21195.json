    "Research for credit; pretty standard presentation and report at the end of the semester, some minor work in the beginning and middle of the semester (other than the actual research, which obviously varies person to person).",
    "Great opportunity to get a chance to do independent research in physics. The work and work schedule throughout the semester is very much up to the advisor and student, but I thought the few assignments for the course itself were very reasonable.",
    "Why are you looking at the reviews for research for credit? Clearly you need it to graduate, and in any case, it doesn't meet ever so you can't really rate it. Maybe you were a lonely person, so lost in the search for classes that these reviews seemed to be your only solace. Well, you will find no answers in these desolate wastes. It's like the 2nd page of google results. https:\/\/xkcd.com\/1334\/ Anyway, make sure you find a good adviser and have a good time. Your future is only determined by yourself. And a bunch of factors not under your control. I guess \"the parts of your future determined by your actions are determined by your actions.\" So welcome to the tautology club. https:\/\/xkcd.com\/703\/",
    "I would absolutely recommend doing research.",
    "The workload highly depends on your PI. I know some people who had research as one of their main commitments during the semester and others who barely showed up in lab. I think that one thing that should be changed is that we should have 5 to 6 people presenting in the morning and 5 to 6 after lunch, and not 11 to 12 people throughout the afternoon. Watching presentations for 4 hours straight during a reading period afternoon was absolutely awful, because I lost my day not only up to the dinnertime, but I was also so mentally and physically exhausted afterwards that I couldn't study for my other finals that day. People who were supposed to present in the end of the session were also jeopardized, because people weren't paying attention anymore and they were already pretty tired to present anything. Otherwise, I think I had a good experience with the class.",
    "This is an amazing opportunity to get first-hand experience with what doing research can look like. Your experience will of course greatly depend on who you work for, and which postdoc\/grad student the professor designates you. Advice is to try and understand the large picture and motivation behind why you are being asked to do something, before you get bogged down into details. This way you can work more independently and perhaps even come up with your own solution to the problem at hand."
