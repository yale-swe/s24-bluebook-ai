    "Yes, it is a good introduction to various ways of problem solving or creating art.",
    "I would recommend the course because there are a lot of elementary concepts that are learned that are usually missed as an artist.",
    "I would recommend this course to an art student (albeit a requirement for the major); Anoka made the theory fun and interesting to learn. Furthermore the projects and assignments would force any artist to use mediums they had never used before and may not use in their chosen area of artistic study.",
    "It is a great course that will help you develop your understanding and developing arts skills."
