   "comments": [
    "The course was very enjoyable. Because I am an undergraduate, many of the topics were new and interesting to me. I found the group project to be pretty enjoyable as well. I would recommend this to a student who as a moderate background in environmental studies\/engineering and is willing to put in a good amount of work outside of class towards the semester-long design project.",
    "A good and simple course, but the group project as a very bad experience. You think this course is easy and interesting ... but what you don't know is that you will be assigned a group project. That is okay in itself. But you will also be assigned a group project team. You have no control over your teammates, who may or may not be taking the course for a grade and care at all about how it comes out, but they have control over your grade...",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Professor Anastas offered a unique perspective on the class and the in class exercises made the topics engaging. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It is really a small seminar taught in something similar to a lecture format. However, the varied material and the creative group activities are really memorable experiences. The class will expose you not just to sustainability problems and how to solve them, but also to the ways in which solving these problems has benefits for the person implementing them, and the wider society. There are plenty of opportunities to learn about how sustainability can be incorporated into engineering design, and to develop creativity.",
    "By far my favo course at Yale. Must take. Great teaching, everything was PERFECT. Cannot say anything more positive about this class. Absolutely incredible.",
    "If you are somewhat interested in design and environmental issues, take this class. It will challenge you but you will learn so much and actually enjoy going to lecture. A huge portion of your grade is the group project. While it's hard coordinating with people for a whole semester it can be a lot of fun to invent a product or service",
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in design, or just want to take a class where you get to be creative. It's great."
