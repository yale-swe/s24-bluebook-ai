    "Engaged with texts in a very different way than I was used to -- a lot of jumping between sources -- and in a way that was very useful for analysis.",
    "I was exposed to a lot of new literature which I had never read before. Became acquainted with the themes of 20th century german literature.",
    "Professor Sussman introduced us to a wide range of German literature, each of which was enjoyable in its own way. I also learned a lot about German culture and history.",
    "GMAN 376 opened my eyes to the fascinating world of 20th Century German fiction. This class taught me how to reconcile the themes presented in the novels with their respective historical periods. Furthermore, it taught me how to compare a novel's original interpretation with its other media adaptations.",
    "I was afforded the opportunity to engage with the selected texts in German, so my reading, comprehension, and writing skills in the language drastically improved. I gained a solid understanding of not just 20th century German fiction, but of literature as a whole."

    "Yes I would recommend it! Professor Sussman is incredibly kind and makes class very enagaging.",
    "Yes, definitely! Professor Sussman is an amazing instructor and you will learn a lot.",
    "Although the topic may seem a bit niche to those not focused on a major in German, I would certainly recommend 20th Century German Literature to anyone who wants to learn anything more about fascinating prose in a fascinating part of the world. Definitely take this, regardless of what grade you're in, as it's a good way to either build a literary foundation or expand upon an already strong foundation.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation to anyone interested in German or Literature. The class discussions were always interesting and engaging but tended to be a bit intricate, so I would recommend having at least some literary background."
