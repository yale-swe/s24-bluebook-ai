   "comments": [
    "Discussed theories of colonization, migration, labor and production on an individual and world systems level as well as within identity contexts.",
    "I learned a lot more about the intersection between race, capitalism and imperialism, about the history of plantations and commodities and about indigenous movements to resist.",
    "I learned to think expansively across time and space. The way empire shapes production and consumption across the world, produces desires (the taste for sugar, etc.), and meets resistance.",
    "I developed an understanding of power dynamics and cash crop production in history.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of ideas like colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, labor exploitation, etc. as they relate to the relationship between the tropics and temperate regions over the past several centuries. Not only did our readings and discussions cover significant empirical ground; they also gave us some of the theoretical and analytical tools to understand various historical processes at work.",
    "I learned about a lot of different theories through case studies of different regions in the world impacted by imperial practices.",
    "Ways to look at history high lighting the perspectives that traditionally are neglected. Learned how to critique current structures around which our society is organized.",
    "This course is kind of like a survey course in which we learn about different aspects of empires and their respective \"fruits.\" Readings are very interesting, but dense, and some overlap with Third World Studies.",
    "A lot of people told me that this was a follow-up of third world studies; however, I feel like the classes were fundamentally different. Sure they both talk discuss theory and are taught by Professor Okihiro, but they really cover different areas.",
    "This was my first ER&M class, and the curriculum and students really pushed me to rethink a lot of my perspectives and even the way I approach my major (history). I've mainly taken courses on race and ethnicity within the history major, but this class was the first one in which I really saw students and the professor being sensitive about racialized topics.",
    "This course exercises critical thinking abilities regarding the course subject and introduces a plethora of sources to learn and discuss these topics. In addition to learning how to participate in a group seminar, this course also helped me tackle long research projects.",
    "I gained many skills through the readings and discussions on colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism in discourse with today's world and the implications of past world history on the third world and its ramifications."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Smaller class",
    "Strengths: readings and professor Weaknesses: this class was far too big to facilitate a discussion and students could easily zone out for an entire period. I think Professor Okihiro said he would cap future iterations which would change the nature of the class",
    "I think the course has a lot of potential and I'm happy that we read a wide range of texts but I wish Gary had helped us piece it all together into one cohesive course of study a little more.",
    "Strengths: The course was very interesting and engaging. The readings were really good, and Professor Okihiro was good at facilitating discussion. Weaknesses: There were a lot of people in the class, which made it hard for a seminar-based discussion. It was hard to answer questions without the topic changing every so often.",
    "The course was organized thematically and was fairly theoretical. Thus, it was good for students who already had some experience thinking about the issues discussed in class, enabling us to add further depth to the ways in which we think about the world. The reading load was fairly intense, but I appreciated having only one or two readings in which to ground discussion each week, rather than having multiple shorter readings. In the long run, focusing on fewer, more analytically rich readings allowed me to absorb the ideas from class better than I would have otherwise. Perhaps to make the reading load more manageable, I would have appreciated having a reading guide with a couple key terms or ideas to focus on from each text.",
    "strengths: cool material! jacinda is a great ta, and she was a good moderator of discussion. weaknesses: the structure by far. for the entirety of the second half of the semester, the course is spent listening to other students present their final paper topics. it's pretty chill, but it just ends up being incredibly rote and takes so much time. for 2 hours each week, for 3-4 weeks, this is the procedure. people present pretty cool topics, but it's hard to focus for that long. also, the class is 30 people -- the discussion suffers for it, since everybody just tries to get their comment in, or people just don't comment at all. gary is really sweet and doesn't want to cut people, but he really needs to, because having good discussion is just *hard* with that many people.",
    "Too many people to have real comfortable discussion this semester. Having group discussions before expanding to the rest of the class was nice but not a substitute for a seminar.",
    "It was a fairly large seminar so everyone didnt really get to speak as much as they wanted to, but Jacinda was really accommodating.",
    "Professor Okihiro and Jacinda definitely care about providing a space for students to think of their subject position in relation to how capital and labor flows to inform the current system. While the foundation of the course is solid, our seminar suffered as a result of having a large group of people take the course. In the future, Fruits would benefit from a little bit more structure and more feedback from the instructors as to whether we were contributing enough to the seminar. The right subject matter and the right professor teaches this course, it is just a matter of making it easier for conversation to flow and make it easier for group discussion to build upon itself.",
    "Strengths: great professor, very profound readings. Weaknesses: too many readings, class was too large for productive discussion to take place, lecture and readings felt disjointed",
    "The course is fantastic with riveting lectures, insightful discussions, and freedom to pursue our own academic interests! The only downside is the class size (around 30 people) is too large to have an effective seminar where people have enough time to think and to talk.",
    "too many people in the class for a seminar",
    "Professor Okihiro and Jacinda are both wonderful and so full of knowledge! The course is best for those who are self-directed and who may already have a research topic in mind for the final paper. I'm not sure that the course and its content are best suited for a seminar class size was large, which made discussion difficult. Whenever we did have discussion at the end of class, it was to split up into groups and go over definitions and terms from the readings. Many of these terms were also difficult, so it felt like I wasn't learning or analyzing as much as I was just memorizing what the authors were trying to say.",
    "The readings could be a little random, but I also worked as a strength of the class.",
    "Our class was a discussion seminar with over 30 students, so I think discussions definitely suffered and faltered. However, the readings were excellent, and I love that Prof. Okihiro started each class with a lecture on some relevant topic or school of thought.",
    "I think the group discussion aspect of the course made it engaging and the structuring of work so that everything builds on itself made synthesizing and writing the final paper better as the source bank was ample. However, I feel as if one of the weakness was the lack of participation in these discussions which I felt could have been stronger and made the class more active.",
    "It had really amazing readings and Prof. Okihiro was able to draw in his expertise to add to the discussion which gave me a new lens in which to see the world.",
    "Prof. Okihiro is an incredibly sweet man and Jacinda Tran (our TF) was a very competent discussion leader. However, the class failed to add up to anything consistent or feel super insightful, beyond a broad critique of imperialism and related issues. I think the biggest issue was that there were WAY too many kids in the class; if it was smaller we might have had more productive discussions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a great course - especially if you want to consider imperial structures in a critical context.",
    "Yes -- Professor Okihiro is a brilliant scholar and kind mentor. Any chance to learn from him is a gift.",
    "I would, I think getting to learn with Gary is a wonderful opportunity.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who may have already thought through some of the ideas in this class in a different context, such as in another ER&M class.",
    "yes, but shop and see. if the class is still large, i would avoid it. but if gary and the ta cut it down to 15ish people, i think it'll be pretty dope.",
    "Sure. To be honest the inaccessibility through the constant use of jargon and names of theories that I'd already forgotten was pretty frustrating. I felt like it matched certain nooks of twitter. This aside, it's a very informative and interesting class with great readings and a lot of material that can appeal to you.",
    "Yes! definitely take every opportunity to take a class with Prof okihiro",
    "Yes! I absolutely recommend this course to other students because the subject material is interesting and challenging. The class functioned as half lecture and half seminar. Professor Okihiro would give thought-provoking lectures where he interacted with the class and our questions. Next, our TA Jacinda Tran would lead amazing discussions about capitalism, empire, imperialism, and knowledge production. But, some of the readings were quite long and dense so we would never been able to fully discuss them. The majority of our classes relied on typical readings and class discussions while the last third focused on our individual research projects. It was really helpful to get to workshop our presentations with one another in class. Additionally, Professor Okihiro and Jacinda are extremely kind and eager to facilitate our learning and our class projects! Please take this class!",
    "Interesting reading materials, Prof Okihiro is very kind and an amazing scholar. There was only one paper which was very open ended. I liked the diversity of assigned reading, which spanned history, theory, and present day writing.",
    "Yes, if you already have an interest in colonialism & empires this course will be a pretty comprehensive and wide-spread survey on these topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially if they are interested in labor or have yet to take an ER&M class.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because the topic of the course does provoke questioning about ones material realities and livelihood and I think that this topic along with the readings are applicable to other classes and majors.",
    "YES.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. You could probably take much better courses on the same subject."
