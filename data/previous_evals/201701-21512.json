   "comments": [
    "Musi 211 was vastly more interesting and engaging for me than Music 210, I think in large part because Dr. Harrison is a wonderful teacher. My part-writing skills definitely improved thanks to all of our modulations of the week. The listening quizzes were sometimes a bit challenging but I ultimately enjoyed getting a grade for something I do anyway in my spare time. My composition skills also improved thanks to our study of master works and practice writing our own compositions. I also strengthened my ear training and listening abilities.",
    "Technicalities of music and how they are used by the greats of the past. How tools are manipulated for expressive purposes, which was new insight for me, with the preconception that music theory was cold and just a means of explaining.",
    "Music from late 18th to mid-19th century (approx. Mozart - Brahms). Modulatory techniques beginning with basic modulations (diatonic w\/ pivot) to those with increasingly chromatic\/constructed chords. Stylistic practices and compositional exercises as well as full compositions in the style of different composers from the above period. Also, musical form was a focus of this course, with a particular emphasis on sonata form and the structures leading up to it. The course's study of chromatic harmony greatly expanded and more clearly defined my perception of \"classical\" music, and I consider the knowledge I gained also very valuable in performance.",
    "New knowledge of tools for music analysis and composition, and new devices that I can use in my future musical persuits.",
    "This class builds off the foundations of harmony and form that you learn in Musi 210 and gets into much more complicated material. It also gets your feet wet with academic musical writing and more serious musical composition.",
    "MUSI 211 taught me the importance of analysis in classical music. The techniques and skills learned varied from phrase analysis to, primarily, chord analysis, to effective internalization of musical excerpts to recount\/identify them upon hearing them again. With the prolonged listening of musical excerpts the ability to listen for phrasing, major\/minor modes and chords, and the overall colors, became clearer and easier. The course provided extensive opportunity to analysis via text and ones own composition. The ability to write and analyze cogent works of music in terms of their structure, phrase, and chords became inherent in our learning. Of all our analyses, a special skill that was learned was modulation, a technique that acts as a turning point between two keys in music. Additionally, the usage of special chords and intervals, as well as their orthography\/spelling allowed for improved compositions and analysis of music."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the integration of listening and analysis of the master works is a brilliant idea. It really helped me understand the music to be exposed to it both on paper and by listening. If you have Dr. Harrison, the workload of 211 is solid but not excessive. Having an allotted number of assignment freebies for the semester helps tremendously.",
    "Strength is obviously the stellar teaching and wealth of information offered. Grading of assignments can get harsh at times, but it reflects standards expected from students rather than unfairness.",
    "I thought the course, and its material, was both very well-taught and well-organized. I also really enjoyed being able to learn with Prof. Harrison, who is incredibly knowledgeable on music history\/theory. The homework, however, is often quite difficult, and we (the class) had to consult w\/ each other on most assignments. The homework load is sometimes EXTREMELY high, especially near the beginning of the year\/midterms\/finals, while at other times it wasn't too bad. I would recommend condensing the homework assignments at least slightly.",
    "I think some of the grading was a little subjective and harsh, like taking off points for opinionated music faux pas, not for actual incorrect usage of techniques. Other than that, I think the class was engaging and fun.",
    "Strengths: Amazing lectures; very detailed feedback on homework. Weakness (specific to Prof. Harrison's section): Homeworks sometimes felt excessive to a counterproductive extent. For instance, why were 14 part-writing prompts necessary on the first assignment when 10 could have imparted the same lessons and yielded higher-quality submissions? Another example - why did we need to know 3.5 hours worth of Mozart symphonies when other sections had a more manageable Mozart listening quiz (and probably knew the symphonies they were assigned in greater detail)?",
    "MUSI 211 is strong because of the consistent work that pushes students toward a better understanding of chord relations, modulations, and musical analyses. It also gives students the chance to listen to famous works throughout classical music, meanwhile testing their skills previously learned from the basics. This encourages more meaningful listening in musical programs or at home, which is important for everyone to understand in classical genres. Though the coursework was substantial, I believe that it is always for the betterment of the student, simply due to the amount of resources that one must put to reap analytical comfort and skill. There was a lot to this course and I dont believe there is any need to improve it."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking 211 with Dr. Harrison if you want to take it seriously and learn a lot. Take one of the other sections for a more gut -ish experience.",
    "Yes, take it with Professor Harrison to be challenged.",
    "Professor Harrison is incredibly knowledgeable and experienced with teaching, and was a wonderful resource in helping us to understand the theoretical concepts behind chromatic harmony as well as interesting (and extremely detailed) music history anecdotes. That said, the workload of the course was sometimes overwhelming. Friends in other sections (with TFs) said that their instructors had greatly reduced the workload; we, however, were not so lucky. In picking a section of this course, evaluate your objectives carefully. If you wish to gain the most out of this course and don't mind a lot of work, especially in composing, take the class with Harrison, as he really is a great professor. If not, you've been warned.",
    "I would recommend Musi 211 to ANY musician interested in Western music of the late 18th and 19th centuries. However, I'd recommend Prof. Harrison's section of this class if and only if you are SERIOUSLY invested the study of music theory. Prof. Harrison is a really great professor, but he's also pretty tough. Each lecture was beautifully planned, and there were times that I wanted to give him a standing ovation at the of class (but didn't so I wouldn't seem to be sucking up!). But he definitely expects you to care as much about this class as he does. He truly wants everyone to leave his course understanding the material at a deep level. As a result, the homework for his class is very extensive and time-consuming, and none of it is graded generously. All of this is to say that if you're not fervently into music theory and you're taking this class to satisfy the lessons-for-credit co-requisite or to get a nice music-oriented HU credit, do not take Prof. Harrison's section - go with a PhD student. On the other hand, if you're a serious musician who wants to learn music theory fundamentals rigorously and has the time to do so, take Prof. Harrison's section no matter what!!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, given s\/he is prepared for a rigorous course load, albeit a good time in the exploration of musical analysis and intensive listening to musical works. The class should be emphasized for musicologists and composers however can apply to anyone really looking forward to classical music analysis."
