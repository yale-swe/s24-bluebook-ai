    "It is a good course to take, since it provides you a big picture of the economy.",
    "concepts are easy to grasp. Neutral recommendation",
    "I would advise against it in its current form.",
    "Good to study intermediate level Macroeconomics.",
    "yeah, a interesting course but should deepen the concept",
    "Average course.",
    "perhaps no if the student is interested in learning implications and applications of macroeconomics",
    "A helpful class that helps you understand the economy.",
    "No. I don't feel much different from undergrad level of macroeconomics. Only the employment search model part was new to me.",
    "No, the course material was over simplified for those coming into graduate level work in Economics, it is at most second year undergraduate level, if that.",
    "Neutral",
    "I would recommend Econ 546 for a student that is looking for an intermediate level course that provides good coverage of all important models. In general the course workload is average, could be a little more challenging. Lectures are just ok, could be improved.",
    "Yes I do. The topic covered in the class was necessary for us to study about the application of economics for analyzing real policy issues etc.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it to another student. As I said before, the course covers a variety of topics and explains them clearly, it stimulates your interest towards Macroeconomics and the workload and difficulty level are just right.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It was an incredibly frustrating experience.",
    "Economics 546 01 exposes you to a wide ranges of macroeconomic theories, models and current issues. It is a great course for students without any macroeconomic background to gain a foothold on the topic. I would definitely recommend the course to another student\uff0cbecause I found this course enjoyable and helps me understand how the world economy operates from a macro level."

    "It was good to review intermediate level macroeconomics but I wanted to study more advanced level.",
    "no contribution for research but relatively know more about the applied part.",
    "It was a repitition of what I've done before",
    "it taught me models that are available out therein fields of macroeconomics.. but not so much into its applications..",
    "I like the growth theory part. It will help me deepen my profession in development economics.",

    "It offers me a chance to expose myself to new models like the cash in advance model that are good intellectual exercises.",
    "This course was not directly related to my research but was very important to prepare me for a few more applied classes that use some of the macroeconomics models that we learned in ECON 546. I think it is very important to have an intermediate level class like ECON 546.",
    "I gained more precise understanding about the short-run analysis and the role of money in the macro economy thanks to this lecture.",
    "Very good. The topics were carefully selected and very helpful. The last chapter was linked to the current financial crisis. The difficulty level was just right. This course stimulated my interest towards Macroeconomics.",
    "Served as a good review of what I did as an undergrad., but compared to the level of our other courses this was not adequate.",
    "It didn't feel like a graduate course."
