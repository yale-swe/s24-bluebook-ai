   "comments": [
    "SPAN140 was exactly what you would expect. It is everyday, which is never fun, but the course is not incredibly time consuming. Professor Cividanes is great, I would definitely recommend you take her section.",
    "It's a standard language course. I'd recommend taking it, even if you have already finished L1 through L3.",
    "lots of discussions and grammer, if youre trying to get fluent take it",
    "It's a lot of work, but I'm glad I took it. It was interesting, fun and my spanish really improved. Take it with Ame",
    "This was a fantastic class. The first half was learning grammar and vocabulary. The second half was reading a short novel and student presentations. The work is spread out so you have about an hour every day, but this makes it seem like there is a lot less. This class was a great opportunity to meet people outside your college because a large part of the class is talking in pairs. I feel like a really got better at speaking and writing Spanish, and I had a lot of fun. I looked forward to going to class each day.",
    "Good continuation of Spanish at Yale; you'll review everything you did in L3 and you'll go a little further with grammar (plus different vocab, readings, videos, etc.). Ame Cividanes is excellent.",
    "Yes, take this class if you want to continue learning Spanish! It's interesting and well-structured, and the grading is very fair--do the work and study for tests and you can get an A. Also, Cividanes is fantastic. Take her if you can.",
    "It's a good textbook. Again, no surprises to anyone who's taken 130. Just your average Spanish textbook.",
    "Spanish L4 is a good continuation of L3. You will become much better versed in basic conversation, and ideally, this will carry out of the classroom for greater use. Be prepared for some tedious assignments and videos. Also, if you can, take it with Prof. Cividanes. She was always a delight, and is perhaps the most encouraging language instructor I have had at Yale.",
    "It's the second semester of Intermediate Spanish. I'd recommend it, it's easier than L3 in my opinion. Definitely take with Professor Cividanes, she's wonderful!",
    "Spanish 140 is a good course for those looking to fulfill their language requirement and practice their spoken language."
