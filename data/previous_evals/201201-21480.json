    "This class can be challenging but the material is extremely interesting and applicable to life. Brenda Bradley is a wonderful professor.",
    "ANTH 212 is an introduction to molecular methods involved in primate ecology and evolution. I would highly recommend this course to anyone considering Anthro as a major, as it explores topics in non-human primates, evolution, and the technologies used by biological anthropologists. There is a solid amount of general and specific information so the course is always interesting. The flow of topics also works well for the semester. Even if you aren't considering Anthro as a major, this is a great science credit as the course is interesting and a manageable workload.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in primates at all. The information is not too heavy, but still somewhat challenging. You will learn a lot from it.",
    "This class is all about reading case studies on genetic analysis of primates. I would recommend it if you're interested in genetics and ideally have some previous experience with the subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend Anthropology 212 to any student interested in primate behavior, applied genetics\/genomics, primatology research techniques, or just monkeys in general! This class covered a very interesting range of topics, and made me appreciate the genetic information and lab techniques learned in earlier biology courses. We had interesting readings, and class time was evenly split between lecture and class discussion. Attending class is definitely recommended, not only because the material is interesting, but also because the information learned during class is really helpful when reading the assigned articles. If you go to class and take notes, tests are pretty painless. Take Anth 212! You won't regret it!",
    "I would recommend ANTH 212 for anyone interested in evolutionary genetics. Although the focus of the course is on primate molecular ecology\/evolution, the material we learn is very broadly applicable and very interesting for anyone studying mammalian evolution, human origins, archaeology, etc.",
    "Yes, it's a GREAT course because it is seminar style and you get to delve deeper into the issues (we read many case studies and scientific papers) and you get to know a BALLER professor really well, but it's still pretty basic and manageable for people without science backgrounds (I had never taken bio in my life before this). It's also super interesting and fun and the discussions are not stressful at all- Professor Bradley doesn't count how many times you speak or call on you, unlike other professors, and people just talk if they have something to say (and people are usually pretty engaged and contribute a lot). This class is the best.",
    "ANTH 212 is an excellent survey of how molecular tools can be used to study the ecology and evolution of an animal species. Professor Bradley is enthusiastic and engaging in her teaching and makes what would otherwise be complex topics in genetics easy to understand. Also, you get to learn some pretty neat things about primates."
