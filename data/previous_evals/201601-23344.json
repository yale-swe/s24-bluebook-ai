   "comments": [
    "I would actually encourage more assignments (if even credit\/no credit) throughout the semester. It's easy to put things to the side without weekly or biweekly pushes, and this material is really best-learned through hands on experience.",
    "I think weekly non-graded or graded-on-attendance lab sessions playing around with the techniques in R would be extremely helpful.",
    "For the material that Tim teaches, I think it would be helpful to focus less on giving us the references for further information during lectures (this could easily be provided via email), and to spend time on the material that you are teaching. While I appreciate when Tim acknowledges he is less familiar with a certain subject than what he is an expert it, if the instructor feels like they can't expand on a topic more than just a sentence or two about it, I dont think more time in class needs to be spent on it, as it may confuse others. Also, I really liked it at the end when we used the computers in the CSSSI during class. I think it would be helpful to use these more often throughout the semester to become more comfortable with the techniques. Finally, I think some sort of additional session at the beginning of the semester--either as part of the class or a separate session--on how to read geospatial data into R would be SUPER helpful. A lot of time was spent trying to understand the differences between classes of spatial data and which types worked with what packages. Some more guidance on the topic would be much appreciated!",
    "I think it would be helpful to have some more class \"lab\" time in the CSSSI computer class room, like we had that one day at the end of the semester. I also think having some more concrete problem sets to work on (even if they are ungraded) would be helpful in learning R and applying the methods from lecture.",
    "More hands-on classwork, more structure",
    "I think having 1-2 short problem sets would have been valuable. In addition, I'm still not completely sure which tools we studied are used in practice in academic articles, perhaps it depends on the field.",
    "more assignments would be helpful to help us learn about applying techniques in this course",
    "The course needs a way for students to complete periodic work and then check it or have it checked to know if one is doing the work correctly. The course probably goes too rapidly. This is a hard call, since one also wants to garner as much information as possible.",

The professors are both very responsive to student needs, very approachable, very knowledgeable in their fields, very good lecturers -- if on the faster side.

It would be helpful if you already know what project do you want to work since the beginning of the course and find your data as soon as possible. then you can set up regular meetings with the lecturers and TA to consult the project."
