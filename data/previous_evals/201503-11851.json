    "I wouldn't recommend it if you're truly looking to learn to write a paper. I you're looking to learn how to participate in a seminar and analyze text orally, then yes. Also, the grading was arbitrary. Very across the board. C for first paper, B for second, A for third, still waiting on grade for fourth. Definitely not a true reflection of my improvement though, as there was very little focus on actual paper writing and teaching how to improve and a great focus on discussion and spoken analysis of other written works.",
    "Challenging but worth the time you put into it. Make sure to get a writing tutor!",
    "Great English 114 for STEM majors, great professor (who throws a lot of shade) and makes the class enjoyable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. While many of the readings are difficult, they are extremely rewarding and lead to fascinating conversations and ideas.",
    "If you are looking for a good English 114 section, this is it. Even if you have no interest in the course topic (as I did) you will still gain a lot. My writing has improved by miles and professor Templanza is a excellent teacher. He genuinely cares about your growth as a writer and is a fun, engaging discussion leader.",
    "Don't take this if you're looking for an easy writing credit. But do take it if you're looking for an interesting course that will make you reflect on what science really is and improve your writing skills. If you take it, definitely do the readings, or class won't be very meaningful. As a forewarning, don't be worried if your grade on the first essay is bad.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning more about the philosophy of science and the cultural aspects of science. This course is definitely difficult, and the essays are tough, but in the end you will improve your writing and reading skills a lot, so it is worth it in the end,",
    "Take this course it's amazing. Seriously.",
    "It's a great seminar-style class with extremely interesting discussion if you're into the nature of science and what is classified as \"real science\" and what isn't, and it all goes very deep. Some topics were a bit difficult to understand at first, but our professor always helped guide us through the material when we needed it so that we understood it by the end of a class or two! He was also very relatable so we enjoyed talking to him in class anyway. Almost our entire class consisted of possible STEM majors. The professor and us all got along and he put up with our shenanigans- it was really a great class and the material was extremely interesting! The professor did not directly teach us much about essay writing itself (there was a book we had to purchase for that), but what he did tell us was invaluable. My essays are much improved and I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking to get a Writing requirement done and also want to further your essay skills in whatever field you're doing (especially if you're thinking STEM because the class-focus is clearly about science...though it does get very philosophical.) All in all, amazing class!"
