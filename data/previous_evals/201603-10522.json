    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Advice from a senior CS major: do not take any elective course taught by Slade (458: Automated Decision Systems), Gelernter (451: The User Interface), Rokhlin (440: Numerical Computation), Silberschatz (423: Principles of Operating Systems and 437: Introduction to Databases), Fischer (427: Object-Oriented Programming) or Petersen (431: Algorithmic Computer Music). These courses are a complete waste of time (although they consume very little of it) and a huge waste of a Yale education. You will literally learn nothing from these courses except that half of the Yale computer science faculty is abysmal (the other half ranges from decent to stellar). By all means, major in computer science, as it is a fascinating field and we have some great professors (Rushmeier, Spielman, Abadi, Shao, etc). But do yourself a favor and limit yourself to taking only the rigorous, well-regarded CS courses (be sure to read evaluations), even if that means a BA degree (10 courses) instead of a BS (12). Courses every CS major should take: 421: Compilers and Interpreters (Shao), 422: Operating System Design and Implementation (Shao), 438\/638: Database Systems (Abadi), and 478: Computer Graphics (Rushmeier). These electives are all practical and well-taught and will help round out your general knowledge of computer science. Together with 201, 202\/244, 223, 323, 365, and 490, all of which are required for the major, this will get you 10 credits, which completes the BA. Quite honestly, that's sufficient. When you're applying to jobs, you can say you're planning to complete a BS, and then switch in your final semester (by which point you'll have already accepted a job offer). If you're planning to apply to grad school you should consider 480: Directed Reading. If you need a gut that is still practical, consider 426: Building Distributed Systems (Balakrishnan). If you're feeling masochistic, consider 433: Computer Networks (Yang), but beware that it is a LOT of work. Godspeed.",
    "No."
