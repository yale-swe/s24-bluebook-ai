    "It's the senior thesis. Marc is an incredible resource, but be aware that it's really what you make of it! If you push yourself it'll hurt but you'll be really proud of what you accomplish......a feature film'",
    "I would recommend this class if you're serious about learning how to write a screenplay, I can't overestimate how much I learned over the course of this year (and especially second semester) both about work ethic and screenplay mechanics, for that I owe Marc thanks, and what's really cool about this class is that right now I've got a screenplay I can show people, especially valuable because I'm about to head into the industry. If you're seriously thinking about taking this class, you probably should.",
