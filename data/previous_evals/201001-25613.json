    "For an \"advanced\" industrial ecology course the material and discussion was still pretty basic. The students in the class were capable of engaging in a much higher level discussion and would have benefited more from the class if challenged a bit more.",
    "This course could be incredibly valuable for students wishing to pursue careers at the intersection of business and the environment. However, how these two concepts fit together was not well developed or articulated.",
    "Instead of doing one big paper for the class, I would break the deliverables up into case studies or problem sets so the students can reinforce what they learn periodically throughout the semester. Paper felt too academic for the material in the course.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. The guest speakers were all very interesting and insightful. I didn't think the weakly reading responses were necessary - with such a small class, everyone will want to read so they can participate in the discussion.",
    "This is a great class to merge the concepts of industrial ecology with business and strategy. The classes were well thought and provided a comprehensive overview of various areas. The project was flexible enough to go deeper into a particular aspect of the class.The visiting lecturers made us think of real case applications of the concepts discussed in class. Prof Chertow, made a great job in giving depth and continuity to the discussion. It was a great idea to have a discussion board on the readings previous to the seminar (it sort of forced us to come prepared to class and make the most of the seminar time).Fantastic class, highly recommended!"
