   "comments": [
    "It's a great class about the Rwandan genocide, though it's less comparative then it sounds. I would recommend it if you're interested in learning about this conflict and the impact it's had on other similar conflicts.",
    "Easy seminar. Manageable workload, interesting discussions.",
    "Take it great class!!!!",
    "I enjoyed this seminar a lot. Though the class felt a little unstructured at times, particularly for such a specific topic the readings were interesting, the classes fairly diverse in content, and as one of the few classes on African conflict, well worth your time if that fits your interests. It's an important event to study on a larger scale, particularly in the context of ethnic violence and international intervention, and Professor Simon is great.",
    "Fascinating subject with an expert in African politics. However, be aware that apart from initial discussions about the meaning of genocide, there is very little consideration of the Rwandan genocide \"in a comparative context.\" Though seminar turned into lecture more than a few times, if you stay engaged and keep nudging Simon (and your classmates) towards the thornier issues rather than mere explanation of historical facts, there is potential for great discussion. Lots of reading (not all of it necessary), several shorter papers and a final paper -- very manageable for an upper-level seminar. If you are genuinely interested in the subject and can get in, take it.",
    "I would recommend it to a student interested in genocide studies and modern African political history. However, if you do not already have an interest in these areas, the class will soon become unbearable."
