    "Language, Sex and Gender is a fun class that looks at preconceptions and stereotypes of 'women's language' and 'gay language.' It's engaging and fast-paced, although if thinking about how the word 'slut' evolved, altered, and was reclaimed doesn't sound interesting to you then this class probably isn't your thing!",
    "this class is so fun!!!!!",
    "It was an excellent, informative course that honestly changed my worldview. Prof Horn can be a dry lecturer at times, but the material is fascinating and he is extremely knowledgable and funny. Do take it.",
    "This course was very interesting and really affected how I see the world. It was pretty repetitive, but definitely still worth taking. Prof. Horn is also an extremely nice person and was always very helpful.",
    "You have to have a personal interest in the subject but if you do you'll love it.",
    "This was a great class covering things that are very relevant to everyday life, and are rarely discussed in other classes. I highly recommend it. It was fascinating and engaging, and not that much work.",
    "Yes, its interesting and important enough material.",
    "If you look at the title and think \"ooh, this is for me,\" then shop it and see if you like it! I loved every second, and Prof Horn is really knowledgeable and fun to be in class with.",
    "I would recommend this class because it teaches you a lot of interesting trivia about words and language, especially in relation to gender, which I find very interesting. I greatly enjoyed learning about the power of language to reflect and reinforce societal sexism.",
    "This course was okay--a really interesting subject but a somewhat boring class. It ended up being a survey of different existing conditions with less discussion and analysis. Prof Horn is a really kind, understanding and helpful professor. However, in class, his lectures can get monotonous and boring, despite the interesting subject matter. If you actually do the readings and manage to pay attention in class, it might be more interesting of a course than it was for me, but it's sometimes hard to stay engaged. Some fun projects\/essays though, lots of freedom in what you write about which is really nice.",
    "It provides valuable insights of the society we live in. I would highly recommend this course to other students who have not taken this course."
