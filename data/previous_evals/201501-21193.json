    "Half-semester crash course in protein x-ray crystallography. It will require that you put in a lot of time on your own because the lectures are very confusing, but Yong's slides are great resources. Also, I'd definitely recommend getting the suggested books out of the library and reading through them for clear explanations of any topics that you think need clarification.",
