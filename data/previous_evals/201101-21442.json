   "comments": [
    "Awesome, one of the most fascinating courses I've taken in four years at Yale.",
    "I definitely recommend the course. Prof. Eire is great, the exams and paper are very manageable and going to lecture is actually worthwhile.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Great subject material and great professor. In terms of a summary: Scholastism, Monastism, Mysticism, Age of Doubt, Faith and Science, Vatican II, and much more. It really does come up all the way to the present.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the role religion plays in shaping society, and how theology shapes our intellectual tradition.",
    "An interesting and exciting survey of the second millennium from the perspective of the Church. Eire is a great lecturer and although some weeks the reading getsheavy, definitely worth the time. I greatly enjoyed the course as a non-history major, and felt that I learned a lot. I also think that this course would be relevant to students of any religious background.",
    "It's a really good survey course of Catholicism in the last millennium. Professor Eire is awesome. There's a lot of reading, but generally it's very good.",
    "YES DO IT. especially if you're a Catholic\/you're someone who has always scoffed at Catholicism. It's a fascinating and beautiful religion and this class is a great survey of its latter history.",
    "Its a wonderful class, you leave with a general idea about catholicism and its complicated history and professor eire is very knowledgable. I would recommend taking this class credit d because the exams can be pretty tough and that way you can enjoy the lectures more freely.",
    "This course will give you a very comprehensive understanding of Catholicism in the medieval to modern era, and it touches on a lot of other important phenomena as well that Catholicism was a part of, like the Reformation and the Enlightenment. The lectures are great and Professor Eire is a champ, BUT the readings can be really tedious. Most of the reading for this course is primary reading, which you will engage in a very minimal way during your sections and most of which makes no sense without extensive background and discussion. For that reason, I found a lot of the reading to be unnecessary\/ not well suited to a survey lecture course. If this was a seminar, the reading would be fine, but there is simply too much primary and obscure stuff and too little discussion. Also, and this is important, the tests in this course are VERY stressful. There is way too much writing to do in too short a period of time (four IDs, two reading IDs with about a paragraph, and an essay with very broad scope, all within a 50-minute exam). I lost a lot of points on tests because I simply couldn't finish the test on time, and this is a common complaint that the professor continually refuses to address no matter how much students ask for a change. Basically, the tests evaluate your ability to write fast better than your knowledge and preparation of the material for exams.My conclusion is this: audit the course for the awesome lectures, but don't take it for a grade or maybe take it Cr\/D. The tedious readings and bad tests makethis otherwise amazing course kind of a hassle, and while I would very enthusiastically recommend the lectures as things everyone in the West should know, the course itself has too many serious flaws for me to be able to recommend it with any enthusiasm.",
    "This is a great history class. Professor Eire is a great speaker, and he makes the course really fresh and interesting. The exams are HARD - they ask for a lot in a really short amount of time. That being said, I still think the class is totally worth it if you have any interest in the history of religion. It's a great topic and a great professor.",
    "Great class. Eire really brings to life what at first glance at the course catalog may seem a dry or monotonous topic. Whether you're Catholic or not, expect to gain deep insight into one of the most far-reaching institutions in the world. Especially if you are Christian, there will be ample opportunities to learn and grow in your own faith.",
    "Great class. The three 50 minute exam and a paper structure was actually rather stress free. Eire is awesome.",
    "This class was a great overview of the past thousand years of Catholicism. The history of this religion is fascinating and filled with all sorts of interesting people and stories, and it is really so important to the overall history of the world to understand this vital religion. Professor Eire always had great stories and a great way of teaching the material. Probably my favorite lecture I've taken at Yale. If you're interested in history, religion, or even if you don't think you're interested in either, take this class (though I don't think he'll be teaching it again for a while- but I'd take another class with him for sure)",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The reading is very interesting, but you don't have to do all of it.",
    "Yes, definitely! This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm a pre-med science major. Carlos Eire cares very deeply about the material he is teaching, and if you're Catholic and care at least a little bit about the history of your faith, this class is for you. The course is well-taught, the lectures provide a great balance of factual information\/dates and anecdotal stories, pictures, and primary texts. The course is manageable: three non-cumulative exams, and a book review. However, be warned that the amount of reading for this class is unbelievable: it's something like 13 books plus a 1.5-inch thick course packet from Tyco. It's impossible to do all the reading every week, but if you skim the reading and take good notes in lecture, you'll do fine on the exams."
