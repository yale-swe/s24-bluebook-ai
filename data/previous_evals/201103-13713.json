    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0The resources provided were great. My only suggestions would be to better consider printing. It would be much better if there was a printer that was committed to printing on mylar. Not just for Eisenman's class, but for studio as well. Also it would be better if the school coordinated with Hull's or itself provided Mylar that was acceptable to be used in the printers in the school.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Great.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I think I can speak for the entire first year class and say that we never had any issues with the available resources of the school.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Resources were great, funds for site model were definitely appreciated. Facilities and technologies are top notch.",
    "Instructor: Brennan Buck \u00a0At the beginning of the semester, I met with Brennan to review my portfolio and to discuss my interests \u0096 this helped communicate what I was interested in pursuing, and he helped to foster that pursuit.I had few expectations for this course \u0096 but one of my main interests was using this as an opportunity to experiment and explore the limits of architecture, working with contemporary ideas on architecture and responding to these current trends with my own authorship.I think that the course work was a little prescribed and that it could be a little looser to allow the studio instructor to get a reading on their specific section and tailor some of therequirements to them. Some of the requirements, as in project two with the inclusion of case studies, were less relevant to some studio sections than others.One major disappointment was the conflict of studio with Formal Analysis. Peter\u0092s class met on the same day as studio (Thursday) and required a considerable amount of work. I think that many students struggled to balance the two classes, and as Formal Analysis has an assignment due weekly, would default to that class rather than studio. As a result, Thursday could be a lost day for development of ideas. One thing to consider in the future is to move Visualization II to Friday, thus freeing Tuesday and Wednesday (minus History) for Studio and Formal Analysis. This would help balance the week.",
    "Instructor: Brennan Buck \u00a0In most situations, the resources available to us were adequate, especially in the software variety. However, printer downtime was quite high, especially with the manual feed printers. These would always seem to go down right before a review or deadline. Laser cutters were also generally sufficient to cover one year\u0092s needs before a final review. However, on weekends before two years were scheduled to present, this was not the case, and excessive overbooking of laser cutter time led to scheduling difficulties for others. The desktop PCs on the 6th floors were mostly adequate, but were also prone to crashing when more than 3 programs were being used simultaneously. Photoshop and Illustrator were notoriously prone to failure, a problem made more painful due to their lack of any auto-save function. Desk space was largely sufficient, but additional drawers, shelving or storage space would be ideal. The studio itself was largely in good shape, but on weekends (especially prior to reviews) nearly all bathroom supplies would run out by sundays, which makes working in the building quite miserable. Everyone would benefit if the custodians crew could leave backup supplies of soap, paper towels and toilet paper before weekends. Lastly, the midnight dimming of overhead lighting seems arbitrary--it doesn\u0092t encourage anyone to go home, but is demoralizing and makes it harder to work (while keeping them on all day is largely redundant given the great natural light we get).",
    "Instructor: Brennan Buck \u00a0Resources were adequate.",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0yes",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0Yes, I was satisfied with the resources provided.",
    "Instructor: Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen \u00a0yes",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Even if you gave us five desks each, there still would not be enough space.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0All was present. No changes needed.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Yes."
