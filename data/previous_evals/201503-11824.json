   "comments": [
    "Can be useful and interesting if really interested in using coding\/Matlab to solve math problems. Very practical class, but must be willing to put the work in for the problems sets each week.",
    "I would recommend as a good class with moderate work and relatively easy grading. If you do the work and understand math (basic algebra) generally, the material is fair, consistent and clear. Exams are very similar to the psets. The professor is extremely helpful",
    "MENG 440 is a great class if you are interested in coding \/ math. Professor Bennett is incredibly knowledge and accessible, and genuinely wants students to enjoy the class and subject matter. You will learn a lot of material, and the workload is fairly heavy, but if you start psets early and visit office hours you will do fine. She rewards hard work, and I highly recommend taking a class with her.",
    "ENAS 440 is a excellent introduction to numerical methods. The lectures are absolutely fantastic, as Professor Bennett is not only well prepared, but also eager to address any questions about the material that you may have in order to help you understand things. Be warned though, the problem sets take a very long time to complete and you will need to think hard on the problem sets in order to optimize the numerical methods that you implement in order to minimize computational cost and storage. The exams are also relatively difficult, but fair."
