   "comments": [
    "Spanish 140 is a great class! Not much more difficult than 130. Be prepared to put in the effort, but the payoff is huge. Definitely recommend.",
    "Great introduction to the completion of Spanish grammar topics, but expect to need to hone these in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who genuinely wants to improve their language ability, or, obviously, needs to fulfill the requirement. The work load is very manageable on a nightly basis, but it does become tedious to have 15-30 minutes a night, EVERY night.",
    "Great class! I learned so much. Seora Leon is an amazing professor and really cares about her students. However, she does grade harder than many of the other professors. But she teaches very well and I loved her activities. Great professor!",
    "SPAN 140 starts slow, but becomes a very large time commitment, with 1-2 hours of work each night or more. However, your Spanish vocabulary and grammar skills will improve exponentially. The passages used in homeworks were thought-provoking and relevant, and although it still has the structure and grammar of SPAN 130, it feels much more analytical -- like an english class, that just happens to be analyzing Spanish texts in Spanish.",
    "Take it if you have to. Yes, it's five days a week, and no, language study isn't for everyone, but you might as well get it over with. It'll really improve your speaking ability, you're able to have substantive conversations and give nuanced presentations in something other than your native language, and you might even make a few friends after seeing the same 15 people every day for a semester. And if you enjoy studying languages, definitely go for itthe class lets you explore a lot of interesting topics all while strengthening your speaking and listening skills.",
    "It is a difficult, but engaging course. You will have to work very hard, but you will learn a lot."
