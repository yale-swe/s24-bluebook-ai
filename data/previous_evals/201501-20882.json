   "comments": [
    "This class provided a thorough overview of topics in biosocial science, and would be very helpful background for anyone looking to combine these fields in their studies. I found the epigenetic discussions particularly helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the conversation between the biological and the social. A great class for anyone interested in science and the social sciences!",
    "Take the class if the subject matter is interesting to you.",
    "Wonderful opportunity to engage in some fascinating research bridging the biological and social sciences. Each student seemed to have a different background and motivation for taking the class, so it was nice to see all of the material processed through their eyes each seminar session.",
    "It's a great break from hardcore science that is so intellectually librating. A must take for anyone with a brain.",
    "A beautiful, wonderful, mind-expanding class.",
    "I recommende the course for a fellow student. It is not only fruitful and thought-provoking, but also fun."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided important background information for my research, especially in regards to epigenetics and the role of the social environment. I also appreciated the topics from a variety of fields, as I was previously unfamiliar with the work discussed in anthropology and animal biology, and this helped me to broaden my understanding and knowledge base.",
    "I learned more about the literature on genes vs. the environment than I knew was out there before. It was so helpful!",
    "Yes, it definitely expanded on what I learned in SOCY 126, Christakis's lecture. It helps how you think about science in a social light",
    "I am an undergraduate student, but the course definitely served as a very engaging introduction the field of biosocial science. I am very interested in seeking future opportunities that explore the intersection of ostensibly different fields because many of the papers we read took advantage of these intersections to find some very interesting things.",
    "Taught me ways to think about studies outside of basic science.",
    "This is, in a way, a survey course that explores different themes per week and links them to an overall structure. This is not meant to specifically narrowly address a field or niche within a field, though it could very easily spark someone's sociology thesis.",
    "Throught the course, I was considering the new biological aspect of my research topics. This course suggested me how to deepen my research topic to influence several area. I learned the concrete examples about interdisciplinary research, which is very beneficial for me in proceeding my study."
