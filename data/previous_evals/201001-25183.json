    "If you want to learn portuguese, you have to take it.",
    "Looking back one year of Portuguese instruction, I had so much fun learning this beautiful language that I even decided to go to Brazil next semester for further studies. Tania is an amazing teacher. She is knowledgeable, creative minded, energetic, and most of all, full of love for Portuguese and her students. Although I was a L1, L2 student, I felt really comfortable reading novels, columns, movie scripts, etc, thanks to Tania's efforts to make them easily accessible. I'm just lamenting the fact that Tania is leaving, and this course is not going to be offered anymore. What a loss!",
    "Yes. You'll love Brazil, Portguese... even if you don't already...",
    "highly recommend -- best way to learn a language.",
    "I would definitely recommend Portuguese 122 if you want to learn more Portuguese. I came into the class after taking PORT 110, so it was a bit of a struggle for me in the beginning but it ended up being a whole lot of fun. This semester is much more interesting than L1. You finish up grammar in L2 and you get to move onto reading chronicles, poetry, and lots of literature.Tania makes this class fun and exciting.",
    "It is a class where you do a great deal of development in terms of internalizing the language and not having to think too much before you speak. Things begin to become more natural and you being to move away from the romance language you are proficient in and truly speaking concisely in Portuguese.",
    "This is a fast-paced portuguese course for romance language speakers. I would recommend the course to someone who is good with language and already has some understanding of the grammar of romance languages. People who do not feel comfortable learning language in a classroom, or who have never taken a romance language, might struggle.",
    "Learn Portuguese! Sing, read, do voice recordings! Fun. Buy a dictionary and a book of verbs.",
    "Continuation of first semester of portuguese for romance language speakers. You should expect to finish this semester in essence knowing ALL of the basic grammatical rules and tenses. You will have a great level of comprehension. Going forward, the task will be to improve fluency, command of what you have learned, and vocabulary."
