    "This is essentially senior thesis group therapy - it's a wonderful and constructive way to get feedback from other students in the major (not to mention get to know them) and draw inspiration from hearing about their own projects. I always enjoy going to this class.",
    "If you're a Religious Studies major, you need to take the class. That being said, it's pretty fun and you get to bond with the other people in the major. Good stuff.",
    "The senior essay. A required, character-building experience. One of many good reasons to be a RLST major."
