   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this. This was my first L5 class, after spending the summer in Ecuador, and I learned a lot. My writing ability improved significantly. There is homework for every class, but it's only twice a week. There's a midterm, a presentation, and a final essay. It's a great fifth class.",
    "Legal Spanish is a great course that I would recommend to anyone at the L5 level. A fair percentage of students are native speakers but don't let this intimidate you, because Profesor Carreras encourages everyone to take part in discussions and your Spanish will improve immenseley during the semester. There are written assignments due for every class which are a great way to reflect on course material and their real world applications and improve your written Spanish. You will learn basic legal vocabulary, structure and applications, especially covering Spain and differences to the States. Also, an emphasis is placed on current real world applications of what is covered in class. Mercedes Carreras makes the class fun, interesting and very rewarding. So in short, take this class!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is truly fluent in Spanish, even if you are not that interested in Law. But, if your not fluent, it will be hard to get anything out of this class.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about the Spanish Law while continuing to work on your spanish language development. Through discussions in class and written assignments you will be able to work on your writing, reading and speaking skills.",
    "Good L5 class.",
    "Absolutely! Great class. Great opportunity to improve your academic writing in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Legal Spanish consists of learning about the basics of the law, as well as examining current legal issues in Spain and Latin America, as well as the US from time to time. This isn't a class in which you memorize Spanish legal terms, but is more like a normal introductory class on the law that happens to be taught in Spanish. I would recommend the course to another student because it is usually interesting enough, and it is VERY low-stress. Just two one-page reading responses a week is all the homework you're assigned, and sometimes the articles you read are even in English. Furthermore, Carreras really wants each of her students to do well, and is a friendly, approachable professor.",
    "I enjoyed the course a lot -- you improve different areas of your Spanish (vocabulary, writing, listening and speaking) while in a chill and supportive environment. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in improving their Spanish while learning some cool things, but only if they have a pretty solid foundation to begin with. Otherwise the course might be a little tricky.",
    "Legal Spanish is a basic overview of a bunch of legal concepts. I would recommend it because the workload is manageable and the material is interesting, but it can be difficult to participate since it's a very lecture-focused course. That said, I would take it again because it is interesting and informative.",
    "This is a great L5 spanish class. You get to practice your spanish and learn about law without getting lost in too much legal jargon. The workload isn't too bad, just one page of writing for every class and Profesora Carreras is great! I definitely recommend this class."
