   "comments": [
    "Take this course!",
    "You would take this because this is a requirement for the major. Even if you are not Econ and Math major, do take this if you are interested in pursuing game theory at a deeper level than the one offered in the fall semester.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "A required class for the Math Econ major. Problem sets and exams can be really challenging. You need to devote a lot of your time and energy in this class but you get a lot out of it, namely a great understanding of different aspects of game theory, auctions, Bayesian Nash Equilibria, repeated games and the concept of subgame perfection.",
    "Strengths: Null setok, a slight joke. at the beginning the class was cool and all.Weaknesses:This classes material is probably the least useful stuff you will learn in your time at Yale. You will walk away from most lectures thinking \"un huh...now how the f#$k does that help anything?\" Truth is, this class is great intellectually, but its overly pedantic and overly rigorous definition-wise. No one needs to define knowledge in terms of fixed points. Useless. Also, Professor Horner is too smart for his own good. He's a bit of a smart ass quite often frequently a lot. And some of his proofs are about as clear as that last sentence.",
    "Unless it is required for your major (Economics& Mathematics), I am not sure I would recommend this class. The topic can be interesting, but it requires a lot of extra-work in finding sources, readings and exercises to gain a firm understanding of what is being studied.At the end of the semester I do not find myself inthe position of knowing what I learnt during these months, and although it is definitely largely my fault, I believe that if the class was organized differently and we had more references and notes, I could have learn better and retained more.",
    "Econ 351 was a difficult and rigorous class on game theory. The lectures were hard to understand, and the psets were more difficult than the lecture. However, the class was incredibly interesting, and if you want to learn game theory and are willing to work at it, I would definitely recommend Econ 351. It was my favorite class of the year.",
    "Required class for the Econ\/math major, so most people in the class have to take it. It's a pretty difficult and theoretical class, but I did feel like I learned a lot. The psets are sometimes very hard, so don't worry if you can't always get all of them. Professor Horner is a pretty good instructor, and don't be afraid to ask questions because the material gets pretty confusing at times. Overall a good class, but I'd definitely recommend reading the notes he posts to stay on top of the material.",
    "This is a tough course, take it if you want the challenge or have to for your major.",
    "Economics 351 is an advanced undergraduate course in game theory that covers a wide range of topics beginning with the basics of how to describe games mathematically and heuristically and continues through a wide variety of topics emphasizing both theory and applications. What sets this course apart from other undergraduate game theory courses at Yale is the mathematical rigor required as part of the exposition. For example, Professor Horner proves the existence of Nash equilibrium rather than simply stating the theorem. Further, he emphasizes the theory behind each of the subjects studied including auctions, static and dynamic games of incomplete information, zero-sum games, repeated games, and game theoretic models of economic competition. The homework assignments in this class are quite challenging and are a good mix of theory and problem solving to wet the student\u0092s appetite for game theory and allow the student to think critically about the mathematics and reasoning behind the concepts taught. The midterm and final are also quite challenging, but fair, given the amount of time in which to complete them. Although I did not take Economics 159, from what I have heard, this class is much more rigorous in terms of both mathematical depth and game theoretic breadth, but as a result is a lot more rewarding. Professor Horner is a really great instructor. He has a keen understanding of the needs of his students and their abilities and has tailored the course around this. He does expect a lot from his students, but ultimately, his goal is for students to learn and appreciate game theory and he makes many tools available to his students to see this through. What more can you ask for in an instructor? Ultimately, I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in game theory who wants to deepen his understanding of the subject matter and is not afraid of a little bit of math. Additionally, a student with no background in economics should not be discouraged from taking this class; the mathematics prerequisite is far more important than the economics prerequisite.",
    "This Mathematical version of Game Theory gets very abstract from the very beginning. You may find it very helpful to take Econ159 first. Regarding the professor's notes, sometimes you will lose sight of what they say because you have to swim through an ocean of mathematical notations. Look up online on the topics first to get an idea and simple examples of the concept before dive in his notes."
