    "Russian is a difficult language, but if you have made it to L3 then you already know that. This class definitely makes all the hard work seem worth it. Irina is a phenomenal guide through the complexities of the Russian language.",
    "Irina was wonderful! She really wants students to learn. You learn a lot of Russian, and you catch up and review Russian 1 and 2. The textbook isn't very good, and the grammar is very confusing, and it isn't taught very clearly. However, there is a lot of support and Irina will always spend time to help you understand. It's an unbelievable amount of work.",
    "Lots of work, but you probably know that if you've taken L1 and L2. It is not that much more work than l2, and you probably have to take it anyways.",
    "If you plan to continue studying the Russian language, then definitely take this class."
