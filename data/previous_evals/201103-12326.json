    "I think this class is fantastic. It is very small so it is basically like a seminar and you get a lot of attention in class. Also you learn a lot in one semester. I would absolutely recommend it to any student interested in taking an African language.",
    "Great introductory course to the language.",
    "A good way to fulfill the language requirement. Yoruba itself is not an easy language, but the professor tries his best to make it easy. A little messy sometimes though!",
    "Take Yoruba if you can. You won't regret it."
