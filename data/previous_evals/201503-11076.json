   "comments": [
    "This class is so good - Jane's insight is invaluable and she's so specifically involved in looking at each student's work and tailoring her critiques to each person. It's so good when we have had different perspectives from Ilona and another visiting designer - their critiques were so great, and hearing from an outside designer and being able to ask him questions was amazing, and I wish it could be a regular thing.",
    "Jane is fabulous- she's encouraging, informative and really inspiring. She knows how to give constructive criticism without making anyone feel there is a right or wrong answer. The fact that she's still very active in the industry is great and she really does share her knowledge and experiences with us. Going to Eric winterling was fantastic- helped to contextualise what we are doing and an added bonus to go to Janes house for lunch! She is full of stories that are interesting and useful. Most of all, she really encourages us to look at the world and to experience costume design from all angles. Even if she doesn't massively support the format of work we present (ie photoshop) it's always accepted and critiqued fairly. She's offered us tickets to shows before which is a gift- seeing work onstage is one of the most important things you can do and she really helps make this possible. Classes are relaxed, welcoming and interesting and it's so lovely to be part of her class. Really building up historical knowledge that will serve as a great tool.",
    "Students, no matter what level they may be at, are able to get real insight into the design process when have critiques with Jane. She always urges us to take a closer look at the periods and characters that we need to design for. Not only that but she shows us what to look for and what really makes the costume suit the purpose it was meant for.",
    "Being in this class has been such a great experience. Jane critiques everyone based on their experience and skill level, and this creates such a great atmosphere in the classroom. Everyone feels safe to speak up and ask questions. The amount of costume history we go through in this class is amazing, and it's been very eye-opening to hear Jane go into detail about some of the research. It's also been so helpful to see the movies and TV shows she has brought into class. I'm very excited for our second semester.",
    "Jane is one of the most loving teachers I've met at YSD. She is welcoming and patient. She is willing to listen to the ideas that I have and offer suggestions based on the context I'm in. Great atmosphere in the class, everyone feels safe to present his\/her ideas.",
    "This course really works on many levels. It is gratefully, not just a dry exposition of period clothing information. The demands of reading a script, analyzing character needs, doing period research and then following through with an analysis of what we have found and created, is a very satisfying whole. I enjoy this class immensely and look forward to it each week. That said, it is also a massive undertaking . I wish every week that we had more time to not only get the' hang' of the period, but to do the equally important work of rumination about character and how to reflect it with our costume choices. I do understand that an important skill is being honed with in this process. I just long at moments for time to sit with a character and let their words really sink in to inform choices. I so appreciate all of Jane's wonderful pieces of insight, her wisdom and her humor. I love that we are a combined class of all design students. Even those whose discipline is very different have intriguing things to bring to the table. The visit to Eric W's shop was great fun as were the times when we watched movies and analyzed the costume choices made. I say, bravo.",
    "1. Starting with a discussion of the play before going through everyone's work 2. Doing a different show every 2 weeks to help work through time periods 3. Very open and constructive feedback of work 4. involving Directors in our class has been great, I love to hear different perspectives and questions we (as designers) might not think of",
    "I don't think I have ever learned so much about myself or my art before. Jane is an incredible mentor in the classroom. She is present, engaged, and you really get a sense she wants you to be as successful as you can be. She asks questions to help strengthen your design choices, and to help unpack how you came to those decisions. The application of learning about the period of clothing by designing a show in that period is incredibly helpful and informative. The very immediate application of that knowledge gained in class and research into the show is incredibly helpful. The process is simple and direct.",
    "This has been a great class! It has been very instructive through the different periods we studied. The focus on research and how to look at and process the information for our work is fantastic. The assignments are challenging and through them I have improved my skills in drawing and painting. The feedback is useful and encouraging. The times we have explored hands on time with fabrics and three dimensionally explored how costumes are made have helped so much in clarifying the material being studied.",
    "Jane is so great and motivating teacher. Always finds something nice to say about the work but also is very critical and expects lot from the students. Bringing is to the costume shop in NY was so useful and unforgettable experience. I'm very thankful and can say only good things about her class!"

   "comments": [
    "Would be great to look more at current designers so that we keep up to date with the industry and get to see different approaches to all periods. Personally I would love to gain more technic skills in making costume as this can be so useful in communicating to a shop or working on lower budget shows. The hat making class was great for this- I don't know if there is room for this in class but if it was possible somewhere within the program it would be incredibly helpful!",
    "The trips we take to New York to the costume shops are highly insightful. I would like to see more opportunities for this, maybe even Broadway shows or museum visits with Jane to be able to see first hand the ways that costume designers research and produce work.",
    "It would be great to occasionally have professional guest designers come in with Jane and critique our work. And if possible, it would be amazing to have the directors come in more often for critiques as well.",
    "A creative design process could be offered besides the periodic research",
    "More time on task. And that may not be practical, but it would be great.",
    "I enjoyed the day we had a recent costume design graduate talk with us, let us ask questions, and look at our work. It would be nice to do something like that again.",
    "I would have loved more in depth knowledge of the periods. I understand that for the context of an introduction class that there is not the time for such, but would really love if a separate Costume History class was added to the course load of the costume designers. I would love the opportunity to continue to unpack the choices made in clothing and fashion throughout history.",
    "It would be interesting to try a more formalized method of critique that could potentially activate the entire class through out the entire period of looking at the work that everyone produces. The historical canon we are looking at primarily is heavily biased on northern hemisphere western culture. It would be great to have a broader variation on this study. More hands on time with costumes and real examples of projects that have been completed. The active participation of making and looking at a real thing beyond paper have added so much to the course. I would love to see more of that."
