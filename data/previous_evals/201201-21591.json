   "comments": [
    "This is really great intro to psychology class. The material is really interesting but the only problem is that there's a lot of it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it for anyone interested in psychology.",
    "Yes! Take this class!! Olsen is great, don't wait for Chun or Bloom to teach this class if she's teaching it. I was told to wait but I didnt and I really enjoyed my experience. Really fair tests and reading amount not bad.",
    "I'd say take it while you're at Yale! Psychology 110 is one of those courses where you feel like you bettered yourself for taking it. It was interesting and very applicable to everyday life. Even if you aren't a psych major, take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend it for those who have any interest in psychology or how people work, which is basically everyone.",
    "I would recommend it, yes. I think you definitely have to be interested in it and invested in reading the book because this is the way to be successful in her class.",
    "I took this Credit\/D. This was harder than I expected and the tests were unnecessarily hard but it was interesting.",
    "Would definitely recommend it - interesting material, not too overwhelming of a workload.",
    "Great materials are covered. This was my favorite class of the semester. Not only do you learn about the ways psychologists and psychiatrists evaluate the mind, but you are able to apply a certain level of introspection.",
    "Pscy 110 is a great course. Do it with Professor Olson, I personally loved being in the class- it is a pretty amazing ride. The grading is a little ambiguous though. It's hard to figure out the curve, etc.",
    "This is one of those courses that everyone should take in college. There are so many interesting things in psychology and it's great to learn about them, regardless of your major or areas of interest. Take this course, I recommend it highly!",
    "This is a great course for anyone looking to fulfill a So credit. The material is something that everyone at Yale has the capacity to understand to its fullest; your grade will be entirely determined by the amount of effort that you put in to the course. That said, it really does not take that much effort to succeed. Keep up with the readings, and make sure to study all of the nitty-gritty details for the midterms, and you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a fun course with not too much work, and the content is very interesting.",
    "Covers a broad range of topics pertinent to psychology, great course to take whether or not you're interested in becoming a psychology major.",
    "A basic summary of foundational psychology. Don't take if you've already taken Intro CogSci or Moralities of Everyday Life because there's an incredible amount of overlap, which made the class easy but boring at times.But if you're a psych major and have to take this class definitely take it with Olson. Bloom's and Chun's classes are more gimmick-oriented for the non-psych majors looking for a gut. And since there's less people in Olson's class, you get a lot more class-interaction and can always see Professor Olson personally.",
    "I definitely recommend taking Intro Psych. You will learn about so many fascinating things and start to see the world in a different way. Bloom and Chun are the superstar teachers for this course, but if you have to take it with Olson you will also have a great experience. She is a really good lecturer- it's just hard to compete with the other two. Be aware that the class isn't a walk in the park and it does require a good deal of outside work. Also, the tests often ask you to recall minor details from studies from lecture so be ready for that. Overall though, I had a great time in this class!",
    "Interesting, broad class. Be warned that it has alot of work though, and curve is hard.",
    "It was an average course that wasn't terribly interesting but that did give me a lot of good take-aways (aka life lessons) that I could apply to my own life. That being said, the more psycholoogy you know the more conscientious you become of your thoughts, actions, behavior and those of others and this can lead to an increased level of neuroticism so watch out for this and don't take anything you leaern too seriously or try to analyze yourself. Most of the evidence that is presented for theories simply isn't very good . . . so you're often left questioning whether anything you learn is actually real or just some made up hypothesis. If you've taken AP psych, don't take this course, you will be bored out of your mind and hate the entire semester.",
    "I don't recommend this course because it's not a gut.",
    "Definitely! It's a great introduction to psychology and its fields. The course also provides useful, empirically-driven insights into the inner workings of the human psyche, which are very interesting.",
    "Introduction to Psychology is a basic survey course in psychology. For anyone remotely interested in the field, I would recommend taking this course. Despite my initial reservations, Professor Olson turned out to be a good instructor.",
    "This class is really hard because there is no final that you can use to pull up your grade.",
    "I would recommend it, it is very interesting.",
    "A good class if you are looking for a social science! Pretty easy and interesting.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a lot of work, but SO INTERESTING. Professor Olson is great, and better than all the others! YOU WILL NOT REGRET TAKING IT!",
    "this class is an overview of psychological principles and experiments. you learn alot of things that are relevant to everyday life which is great. nothing is too in depth or technical so it is not too difficult. i would recommend this class to any student as an interesting, not too stressful class.",
    "Awesome class. If you have a spare Credit\/D or simply want to know about Psych, take it.",
    "Psych 110 was a good introduction to the field of psychology. I feel as though I have learned a great deal about the different aspects of the field, and many interesting research was presented, including that which has been and is currently being conducted at Yale. Its strength was that different material was presented in the lecture, readings, and essay assignments, which made each separate component a valuable part of the course. Its weakness was that the lectures were often a long stream of recalling studies, and not enough interaction with the students. Also, towards the end Professor Olsen seemed to have been totally burned out, which was reflected in a lack of energy and too many videos being shown.I would recommend Psych 110 to any other student because it is fairly easy (though more work than you might realize), has interesting material, and has reasonably fair grading (except for maybe the papers).",
    "The material is interesting but you can take this online. It is nice though because it is a prerequisite for many other courses. Take it Credit\/D.",
    "Yes I would. It's very interesting, maybe even a must-take.",
    "I totally recommend this class. All professors are great from what I hear.",
    "Introduction to Psychology is a class that all Yale students should take. It is an interesting course that provides information about day-to-day life that will make you look things from a new perspective.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other students. Found it interesting and insightful. Would say it has to be taken before graduation.",
    "it is an interesting class that you should definitely take some time. I'd recommend it. Also, not too overwhelming of a workload.",
    "Very standard intro psych class. If you're interested in this stuff, you'll like it (but also be prepared to learn a lot of things that seem common sense \/ everyday concepts). A solid base for psych and gives a good idea of what it would mean to continue - if you think psych might be something for you, taking this will tell you if that's true.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - it seemed like a really basic intro psych course and was exactly what I expected.",
    "It was interesting to know the exact procedures behind the some-what \"common sense\" psychological notions we are familiar with. I think this is a difficult but rewarding class.",
    "Take it with Bloom rather than professor Olson, but be aware of the annoying curve. The information is easy for most people who tend to have had psychology before, so grading will be frustrating.",
    "Psychology is a great class to take. It is interesting and also challenging. As long as you keep up with the readings and go to lecture you will do well.",
    "Yes, if they are looking for a fun course, but not a serious course.",
    "Intro class to psychology. Interesting and not too much work. Exams require considerable studying though. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "This course is a basic overview of Psychology that touches briefly on various fields. I would recommend this course to anyone looking for width of knowledge but not depth.",
    "The best intro course at Yale. I would definitely recommend it. Interesting topics and engaging lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material was really interesting, no matter what your major. There were several guest lectures, which were also very good. The tests were not too bad, as long as you read the textbook and paid attention in class.",
    "It is full of interesting facts and perspectives. It is useful even to get an understanding of how psychology works as a study, and to learn where the discipline is headed.",
    "It's an awesome way to learn about the basics of psychology and see if you are interested in the subject matter. It is a very challenging course, but worth it if you're passionate about it.",
    "This is a great course that everyone should take at some point, whether in high school or college. Professor Olson does a great job making herself accessible. I rarely found myself getting distracted during lecture (but then again, I am taking this class for my major). MAKE SURE TO ATTEND EVERY CLASS, it will make studying for the exams that much easier. The tests are actually fairly simple, but you must know all the material. I didn't do particularly well, but for the slightly more motivated, this class can be especially enjoyable if you're willing to put in the effort.",
    "Take it with professor Olson! She was very nice, the workload was easy, and its overall a very interesting course.",
    "I would totally recommend this course for others, regardless of who is teaching (though Marvin Chun would be a huge plus). The material is good, the textbook is interesting. The workload is light and the tests are not difficult as long as you have good notes and read the textbook.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course because I feel like it has influenced the way I approach certain situations.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is one of those classes that you cannot leave Yale without having taken. The material is super interesting, even if you have never taken a class in psychology. I thought it was a fantastic experience and has made me consider majoring in psychology. Also, the grading is three midterms and two short (easy) papers. It makes a lot easier to handle and reduces your workload around finals!",
    "Not with Prof Olson, but I did like the class",
    "Great class, you should definitely take it either if you are a prospective major or if you are just interested in psych topics and their implications on everyday life.",
    "Recommended if interested in basic psychology topics, good Credit\/D course, better to take with Bloom or Chun",
    "Basic intro to psych class. Interesting topics so lecture is fun. Not too much work besides a chapter of reading each week, 3 midterms (no final) and two very short papers",
    "I enjoyed it! I'm planning on possibly majoring in psych or a related field, but even as just a course for fun, I think it was very interesting and taught well. It covered many different topics and made me interested in future classes in psychology. I see no reason not to take the class. :)",
    "the class does exactly what the title is: introduce you to psychology. not much work and interesting material.",
    "Yes! This class was so much fun and you learn so much about all sorts of things that people usually just kind of wonder about. There are lots of interesting experiments and theories and studies being done. There isn't too much work at all, and the material is so interesting that it doesn't even feel like learning.",
    "Your typical intro course. Nothing special. EVERYBODY takes it.",
    "I would recommend it. Really illuminates a lot about humanity, and makes you think and analyze both yourself and others. I think it made me a better person, to be perfectly honest.",
    "If you want to take it purely out of interest, take it for credit unless you are thinking of majoring in Psy. You have to prepare to work hard for this class.",
    "You should definitely take it if you haven't had any academic exposure to the study of psychology. You will learn a lot. It's a great class to take Credit\/D, because your grade is based on three non-cumulative exams , two short papers, and class attendance that is checked by answering discussion questions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it introduces very vital concepts not only to physiology but the world in general. Just understand that although it is an intro course, you need to study hard, because the tests may get you.",
    "Intro Psych provides a solid foundation for further study in many areas of psychology. The three tests require a lot of preparation if you want to do well, but besides those assessments the course demands little more than two short papers.",
    "Psych 110 with Kristina Olson is an interesting survey course that does its best to cover a LOT of material in a short amount of time. Prof. Olson generally does a great job of presenting the material clearly, and does her best to make her lectures interesting. She's really approachable if you have questions, or just want to discuss the material, and her assessments are really fair. This course won't offer you depth with any topic in psychology, but exposes you to a wide range of topics that will certainly pique your interest if you're at all considering pursuing any branch of psychology. Overall, not the most exciting course in the world, but a really well-developed, informative, interesting one that I'm glad to have taken at Yale. Regardless of who your professor is, this course IS a must-takeat Yale.",
    "Intro Psych is amazing! Kristina Olson is also amazing - lots of people will tell you to wait and take Intro Psych with Paul Bloomor Marvin Chun, but that's totally unnecessary. Kristina Olson was a great lecturer - really engaging and clear. You learn lots of fun, interesting stuff, and it's easy to succeed as long as you just do the work. Take this class!",
    "This is a great course to take if you need an extra with not much work that you will find interesting and useful. The lectures were great and I found the majority of the material that was presented very interested. This course is a must take class! It is very fun and not difficult to do well in at all.",
    "Intro to Psych is pretty interesting and not a ton of work. The tests can be deceptively tricky, so be certain to study up. If you find the material engaging when you shop the class, I'd say that you should go ahead and take it - it's something everybody should take an intro course in in college.",
    "Its interesting and applicable to daily life, which is cool, but they grade pretty hard and theres a lot of material. That, combined with the grade distribution and a room full of freshmen who read every word in the book makes it a bit difficult to get an A",
    "I would recommend Psychology 110 to other students. It is a comprehensive introduction to the field of psychology, and even though it is a challenging course, it is a rewarding experience. Professor Olson is a fantastic professor, and from what I've heard from classmates, Professor Chun and Professor Bloom are also great Psychology 110 lecturers.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student who has even a slight interest in psychology."
