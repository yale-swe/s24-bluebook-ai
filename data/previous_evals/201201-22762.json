    "A wonderful overview of the Reformations in Europe, with a great professor and a great TA! What more could you ask for?",
    "I would not recommend it because even though the information is interesting the lectures were fairly uninspiring.",
    "Reformation Europe is an excellent history lecture that does a good job in covering both the theological and the strictu sensu historical aspects of the Reformation.",
    "It was a good course if you are genuinely interested in the material covered.",
    "The class covers a lot of ground so if you're interested in getting a good overall knowledge of the Reformation then the class is great. If you're really interested in a specific aspect of it, or a specific country, the class is only going to talk about it for a week or two. Still, it's interesting and Professor Gordon is great.",
    "I enjoyed this course very much. Prof. Gordon is truly inspired when he lectures and given that I had not studied the Reformation since high school, his passion definitely boosted my interest in the subject. The course requirements are manageable: midterm, final, section participation and reading, and a final 5-page paper. The readings are not terribly long and generally accessible. I would recommend this class to someone looking for an informative, but laid-back class about the different reformations across Europe and their effects on the political, economic, and social aspects of the times.",
    "Take this class if you want a laid back but still really interesting pre-industrial history class. Not very much work, but I still felt like I learned a lot. Also, while professor Gordon has a very interesting lecture style, his lectures do a great job synthesizing all the material.",
    "yes, it lets you understand europe's current identity a bit better.",
    "Only recommend if you are very interested in the material because the lectures are very boring. There is not too much reading for this being a history course.",
    "This is a very good and interesting introduction to the Protestant Reformation, perhaps the most important cultural shiftin modern history. You'll learn a ton about it--why it started, who the key leaders were, what the major ideas were, etc. That said, you may end up learning about the Reformation in greater detail than you really wanted to, as the class focuses more on Reformation theology than history in general.",
    "Take it. Its an in-depth study of the reformation, not a ton of reading like other history courses and engaging section discussions.",
    "Yes! This was an extremely interesting survey of the Reformation. The engaged student will find many connections from this period of history with modern life and other histroical periods. Great for those interested in the social aspects of religion, but perhaps not so much for those interested in the theological."
