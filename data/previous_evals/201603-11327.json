   "comments": [
    "I learned how to do brain homogenization, sacrifice a mouse, and protein prep.",
    "Through my research, I developed my ability to plan and design experiments and analyze data.",
    "How to work in the lab and maintain a work and school schedule.",
    "I have been able to get a lot of hands-on experience in this course. I have also been able to do a lot of independent work which is great for my skill set.",
    "Gained technical skills in lab...really delved into scientific grant writing.",
    "I have continued to develop my skills as a researcher and as a scientific writer over the last semester. However that has more to do with the guidance and collaboration of my PI and the grad students in my lab than it does with being enrolled in this course. The course is merely assigning course credit to work I was already doing.",
    "Learning how to work in a lab and be able to carry out tasks on my own and understand why I am doing them. Beginning to understand how to set up my own experiments.",
    "I made progress on my senior thesis research project.",
    "Although I have conducted individual projects in the past, this is the first time I was responsible for a major project while balancing the responsibilities of school work and extracurriculars. One of the most important skills I learned was how to maintain a healthy research-school-life balance.",
    "By taking MCDB485: Senior Research, I have been able to spend more of my time dedicated to my lab work and therefore have developed many new and useful skills for my senior research and future projects as well as a way to improve my scientific writing skills.",
    "This semester I learned everything from fly husbandry to correctly operating the experimental apparatus. We were able to identify adjustments that we will make for future experiments.",
    "To be honest, I don't know. I guess writing a grant proposal, if you want to call it that, was a worthwhile experience. Otherwise, this class isn't really a class. Just work in your lab and attend lab meetings. You'll be fine.",
    "Learned to be more independent working in a lab. At the start, following protocols and completing experiments can be difficult but you get used to it and realize that many experiments actually fail in real life and you have to repeat sometimes many times to get the results you want.",
    "Interesting research",
    "I developed quantitative reasoning, critical reasoning and data analysis skills in this course. I started an independent hypothesis-driven research project and learned how to generate experiments by myself.",
    "The course is a continuation of my research from previous years, where I continue to develop new skills as a professional scientist."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "None. You make it your own experience.",
    "This course is a valuable chance to do extended research in a lab (if you aren't doing that already). The written assignments for this course are manageable and helped my clarify the aims of my project.",
    "Strengths: direct engagement with a PI, work on individual project was cool Weaknesses: there should have been a meeting in the beginning of the semester to show students what needed to be done over the course of the semester, decentralized information, no one for advise etc",
    "I wish there was a way to prepare you more for senior research. In particular, I think there should be more guidance junior year for those MCDB students that have not been able to fit in a lot of research prior to senior year. It would be great to get help with finding a senior project that fits with your schedule and that also has a higher probability of success since one year is a short time to find results. I had difficulty fitting in lab into my schedule and coordinating with my postdoc mentor because the experiments that I needed to run involved cell culture which was time-sensitive and time-intensive. It was hard since I would have to come in every free time I had and skip classes to complete experiments since I also have to balance varsity athletic practice and meets. I also am doing a relatively new procedure, so it is frustrated not getting results.",
    "There could be a little more direction and help for students to find a lab to work in because not everyone has experience finding them.",
    "Very few points for check-in and feedback. Assignment due dates and requirements were changed at the last-minute.",
    "Some clearer guidance and expectations surrounding the written work would be nice. As well as receiving some feedback on those assignments even if they were satisfactory (it's my understanding that if they weren't, students receive feedback on what needed to be improved). The ambiguity surrounding assignments makes it difficult to know where you stand grade-wise, and since you don't find out your first semester grade until the end of the second semester, it would be kind of nice to know where you stand so that you know if you need to make changes going into the second semester. I know exactly where I stand with my PI in terms of the quality of my work, but have absolutely no idea of the course director's assessment of my work, and it is somewhat vague in the course information who exactly will be giving me a final grade. The strengths of this course are entirely dependent on your PI and lab and have next to nothing to do with the actual layout of the course. My experience has been nothing but positive, however, I do have friends that are in lab situations that are not. I was speaking with a fellow MCDB senior about how other majors have weekly small group senior meetings where they get together and discuss what their senior thesis\/research\/project is about and provide updates on their progress. We were thinking that might be a nice addition to 485, because outside of our friends in the major, we have no idea what anyone else is doing their research on until the presentations in the spring. We just thought it might be cool to have a more informal opportunity to discuss\/share our work with our classmates.",
    "Having students conduct individual research under a mentor is a wonderful opportunity for them to obtain a thorough understanding of the scientific research lifestyle.",
    "I think the course is well-organized in that 10-12 hours of laboratory work per week in addition to workload from other classes was very manageable, and the first two assignments were great ways to practice writing skills for the final research report due next semester.",
    "Hopefully spending more time in lab next semester will help improve understanding of my preliminary results.",
    "Honestly, there are no strengths and weaknesses. Choose your lab wisely and do research. This class is just a label on your transcript for research.",
    "There is not any guidance from the professors but a lot from your mentors",
    "The course is designed to allow for a lab experience. The format is well founded that begins with a research proposal and culminates in a final research report."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "If you're an MCDB major, I highly recommend doing the B.S. Even if you don't end up doing research as a career, it is worth giving it an extended test run to see whether you really like it or not. Your experience in this course will be very dependent on the lab you are in and your PI. If you don't already have a lab, I recommend joining one where people will give you honest feedback and advice about your project. It's much better to get feedback throughout the semester and know where you stand. The written work for this course is minimal (2-page proposal at the beginning of the semester, 5-page grant proposal at the end), so it's up to you to make sure you are making progress on your research.",
    "Find a good lab and plan well with your mentor far ahead of time to find a project that works with your schedule and has a high chance of yielding results.",
    "It is a great experience as you get to conduct your own research with guidance from a PI.",
    "You don't have a choice if you want a BS in MCDB...",
    "It's research. All 485 does is add a few external requirements. For some people, 10 hours a week in lab is a lot, and for others they've already been doing more than that so they don't even think about the hour requirement, your interpretation of the \"workload\" for 485 depends on which category you fall into. Your opinion of the course depends almost entirely on your opinion of your lab and PI, so hopefully you like them.",
    "I spent like every waking hour doing research, but your level of commitment is however much you choose\/ whatever your research dictates",
    "This course is required for the MCDB BS degree. Find a good mentor and you'll be just fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in pursuing research within the MCDB major senior year but does not have enough time to dedicate to the intensive research option.",
    "Yes",
    "A wonderful chance to get experience in research, learn problem-solving skills in the lab, and take ownership over an independent project. I had a wonderful PI who really pushed me and was very supportive. This was a great experience!",
    "Yes! If you are a MCDB senior and don't have enough time to do the extensive research thesis this is a great course to take.",
    "Of the required courses for the MCDB major, I believe it is the best option as it allows you to commit to a full research year, but also with a flexible schedule"
