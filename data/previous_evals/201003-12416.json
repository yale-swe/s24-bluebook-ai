   "comments": [
    "If you are serious about learning spanish, take this class. If you are not serious about the language, the work load may be a bit much.",
    "Take this class. Spanish is really important in the U.S. and in the global community. And this class will give you some basic knowledge that will allow you to have some Spanish under your belt.",
    "I would recommend it because it really took the language passed memorizing words. You learn how spanish speakers structure their thoughts and communicate concepts.",
    "I would recommend this class",
    "Yes. Although it was a lot of tedious work, the product did strengthen my spanish grammar overall. This level of spanish is particularly focused on improving grammar which was a weakness in my spanish.",
    "This course requires a great deal of time, but does a good job improving writing skills. There is definitely a written emphasis that transitions to a speaking late in the semester. I highly recommend Professor Elena Pellus-Perez for the course. She was a fair grader and did a good job explaining concepts. I recommend this course if you wish to enhance your Spanish speaking and writing skills.",
    "Annoying when looked at as a requirement, but more enjoyable and worthwhile when looked at as an opportunity.",
    "Yes. Spanish 120 is one of the stepping stones you'll take to get to fluency. Spanish 120 is an enjoyable must.",
    "Yes, learning spanish is very helpful.",
    "Its Spanish. Take it if you want to learn Spanish. That's really all there is to say. The syllabus is so tight that all the sections are quite interchangeable."
