    "Professor Cleaver is a very interesting person with a lot to say and teach about the Black Freedom Movement. If you are interested in African American Studies and don't know who she is I recommend searching her name in Google. But otherwise the course consists of readings for every week and 3 essays for your grade. However, I do warn you that if you are not a good writer you should beware, I don't know how our final grades will turn out but so far I'd hate to get the grades I've been getting on my papers for my final grade (B range).",
    "If you are interested in social history, do not miss the opportunity to take this course with Kathleen Cleaver. She provides additional analysis and in-class videos, you just have to make sure you uphold your part by doing the reading (not often more than one book a week). The class discussions are what you make them, and Professor Cleaver will always provide a good foundation for debate.",
    "AFAM 414 is a great course. We learn about women who have been ignored throughout history, but were seminal to the civil rights movement. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This class is decent. The professor is really interesting, and the readings are GREAT, and obviously the subject is really compelling. But the class is not very well taught: you don't really analyze the readings much in class, and the writing assignments are pretty vaguely defined and you can get away with just about anything. Take it if you are so inclined.",
    "Yes!! I would recommend it. Kathleen Cleaver is a wonderful teacher who knows what she is talking about because she lived through it."
