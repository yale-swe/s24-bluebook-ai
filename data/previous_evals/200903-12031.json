    "This course would probably best suit someone who was very interested in reading a lot of Greek literature in translation, but already had some background in it. Professor Bers tends to focus on more minute details, rather than the general gist of the text, and this is very interesting, but it can leave you feeling a little lost if you don't already have your bearings.",
    "You must take it for the major. Hopefully this changes. Take a Greek course with Victor instead, should you have the opportunity.",
    "If it's still required for the major, take it -- depending on the professor, it might be awful or it might be okay. Do the readings and try to go to class and it'll be a breeze. No other reason to take it though but for the major.",
    "This is a survey of ancient greek literature. I found it useful as a classics major to have this survey to fill in the gaps in my background in the literature. It is designed to be completely accessible to non-majors, but most of the people in this class will probably be classics majors (but there's no curve and it's basically just a literature class so you shouldn't be afraid to take it).I would not recommend it with Bers. I like him on a personal level, and I can tell he knows his stuff, but his lectures were muddled, his grading is too hard, and i didn't feel like i learned very much. I've heard the class is fun\/easy with Bakker, so i would recommend shopping it with him if he teaches it again (and i assume he will in future semesters, but he was on leave this semester).",
    "A course with some potential that suffered from being really badly taught this past year. I would strongly advise not taking it with Professor Bers, though other professors may do a good job with the material. If you\u0092re a classics major who\u0092s required to take this, do so sooner rather than later; it\u0092s better as an introduction than as a survey. If you\u0092re not a classics major, be aware that a lot of people in the class will be majors, which may not be a bad thing.",
    "Take it if you need to."
