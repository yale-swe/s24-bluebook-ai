    "Rigorous, tough, and very worthwhile for someone who is particularly interested in public finance (particularly in health economics).",
    "I would recommend this course to other students even if you aren't overly interested in public finance. Unlike the other field courses, the reading quantity and pace is not so intense that you would struggle to keep up and there is a lot of time devoted to recognizing high quality research. You also have the opportunity to think about your own research because you aren't busy with a bunch of requirements for the course (the requirement is that you think about your own research and present something at the end of the course).",
    "It is a useful class. I would recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "I thought that the final project was incredibly helpful in prepping me for dissertation and research. Really excellent project.",
    "This course is the best course I have taken as a graduate student in terms of preparation for doing research. There was an excellent balance between providing information and evaluating papers in terms of things you would aim to do in your own research and those you would avoid. There was also an opportunity to start developing your own research idea for the assessment, rather than studying for an exam."
