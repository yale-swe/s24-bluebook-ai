    "Absolutely. It is a fun course and you learn quite a bit of German, all the way to subjunctive tenses. I also really liked the regularity of having class everyday, and even though there is probably technically more time required for German (as a language) than for other courses, it is so spaced out that you never feel really overwhelmed with a major, unusual assignment to do. Also, unlike what I hear about a lot of other language classes, there was no regular final, which was great. I would really recommend shopping around the different sections offered though, because each teacher has his\/her own style, and each class its own vibe, and that will obviously have an impact on your learning experience in a class that meets everyday.",
    "You learn a lot of grammar and get more practice speaking. I'd say that even though it's only Level 2, it's more than twice as hard as L1 - but that's not a bad thing. By the end, you feel like you know enough grammar that you would be able to write fairly complex sentences in German. It definitely gets more fun to take German when you learn how to say sentences you might actually say in English.",
    "Take German! It is a lot of fun. German is one of the coolest language to speak.",
    "This was a very good introduction to the language for a complete beginner. I would definitely recommend it to others in my position.",
    "Definitely take this if you're looking for a foreign language. The department is laid back, and the assignments are not hard at all and sometimes very fun (like the end-of-year skit).",
    "I would not recommend it to any grad students: I would prefer to study in smaller groups, with a de-emphasis on testing or grammar assignments. I would prefer longer classes in which we work on the homework together and understand the grammar that way, in English. I would get help on memorizing vocab and grammatic tables in the classes, rather than being expected to do more homework outside of class. On my own I like to read and speak in German, but in class I prefer to have lots of help with my weaknesses."
