    "Taking good photographs, editing them",

    "The ability to technically operate a camera, to \"see\" through the perspective of a photographer, and to discuss photography as an art.",
    "I learned how to use my camera! And a lot about the history of cameras!",
    "Developed a critical eye for critiquing and developing digital photographs",
    "I learned how to operate my DSLR manually, adjusting shutter speed, ISO, and aperture to create high-quality images. I also was connected to a lot of different photographic traditions\/histories and learned about the portfolios, visual languages, and shooting styles of many talented photographers. Finally, I learned a lot about my own visual style and how to productively grow and develop my image-making.",
    "Understand how to use digital camera, print, and use photoshop",
    "I gained a new perspective on artistic expression through this class. Creating art, while perhaps still difficult for me, was a terrific way to be adventurous in the classroom.",
    "I learned how to look at the world through a camera and capture the beauty that I see in the world"

    "Engaging, well structured. It would be better if more help outside classroom could be provided.",
    "There is little to no structure in the course. We quickly strayed from the curriculum and it seemed as though we were making up our path as we went.",
    "No weaknesses! It was just such a good and fun course. Anna is amazing. Take it if you can get in!",
    "Strengths: I liked the informal, but enthused class dynamic and felt like I grew a lot in my ability to take photographs and make prints. Weaknesses: A bit of disconnect between written assignments and photographic assignments. Wish that we had more crits with fewer images in each crit (we ended up combining two crits at the beginning due to timing issues).",
    "strengths: artistic freedom, good and evenly spaced assignments weaknesses: sometimes difficult to navigate technology. Maybe create certain handouts\/cheatsheets for photoshop and printing processes instead of a verbal explanation that is more elusive",
    "The strengths of this course are the subject matters. Photography itself was something I had little experience with previously, so gaining a foothold in that was very special.",
    "strengths: this is exactly what I was looking for in a photography course for beginners, I loved it areas for improvement: more structure surrounding critiques with professor and learning more about editing techniques"

    "yes, awesome into to photo",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It definitely takes time to shoot and edit, but it is very rewarding in the end.",
