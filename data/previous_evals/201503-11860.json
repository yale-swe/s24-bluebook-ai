    "The reading list and critical essays studied in this class are absolutely amazing but were unfortunately skimmed over as is the case for a lot of literature classes. I definitely learned to think about these works in a new light but the lectures were a little disappointing and most of the study of the work is expected to be done by the student. Take this class if you already have a strong background in analyzing literature. It has not really taught be how to be a better writer but was interesting. This could be a great class if the professor clearly prepared and structured the class.",
    "This course covers a lot of interesting material, though it might not be seen that way by everyone. It is good for people with a serious interest in christian mythology, or a very open mind. It is also a very independent class, which requires most of the writing development and understanding of literature to be done outside of class. I would not recommend taking this class if you are looking for a class that will help to develop your writing, though it definitely a very intriguing thought excursive of the class. Kind of a philosophy.",
    "I definitely got a lot out of this class that I might not have in your average expository writing class. I really loved the way the texts were incorporated into the major works we were reading, so that you had a continuity of thematic elements throughout the course. I really enjoyed the class, personally. You can apply a lot of the ideas and philosophical themes to literally everything else in the world, which is one of the great things about literature in general.",
    "I was initially drawn to this class because the name was fascinating and the syllabus feature works I had never read before. The class started off a little slow but picked up and seemed like it would be rewarding, but by mid term, it became boring and tedious because the subject matter discussed was not expected at all. I would not recommend this class if you are not interested in the reading material or are used to more interactive professors. It will get annoying quickly."
