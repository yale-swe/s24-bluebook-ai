    "I think if you want to read more about Chinese poetry, then this class is for you. Again, a word of caution that the syllabus changes each year, so be sure to know what kind of Chinese poetry you will actually be studying during the course of the semester.",
    "If you've completed 3+ years of college-level Chinese, then take it! This course allows to read some of the most beautiful poetry ever written (in any language) and savor it in its original form. The course is laid-back and flexible to students' interests, and Prof. Chang is great. As long as you don't mind spending some time with a dictionary to decipher rare traditional characters, then you'll love Chinese 303."
