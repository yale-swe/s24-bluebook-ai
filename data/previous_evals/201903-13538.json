   "comments": [
    "I learned SO MUCH in this class! Prior to this class I had no engineering experience, and now I have a broad understanding of not only the different fields of engineering but also of some of the basic skills that span across disciplines like project design, coding, use of a breadboard and arduino, building\/working in the machine shop, using different tools, testing and collecting data, and problem-solving. The group project at the end of the semester taught me a lot about leading a team and I grew in my ability to deal with less invested team members.",
    "I learned how to use a variety of tools in the CEID, build basic circuits, use the machine shop, laser cutter, and 3D printers. It was a really good way for me to see what engineering was\/if I liked it.",
    "I learned a lot about the design process and how to build something from scratch to prototyping to a functional model. In the beginning of the semester we learned about different types of Engineering, but I think I got the most out of the second half of the course where we built something.",
    "I was introduced to physics concepts, coding, circuitry, and designing.",
    "This course is a great and fun introduction to the different fields of engineering and what engineering is like in general.",
    "Basic navigational skills required to negotiate workplace politics.",
    "Basic skills in knowledge for engineering such as tool use, coding, circuits and design processes.",
    "So much!! I learned about lots of different fields of engineering (both technical skills and just what they do), the design process, using particular equipment\/tools, and working with a client and with a group",
    "I learned about several different aspects of engineering. I was was able to become comfortable in the CEID environment and learned how to work with a client as well as a project team.",
    "The most valuable skills I learned from this class were in design, prototyping, and overall comfort with the services offered by the CEID (laser cutting, 3D printing, soldering, etc).",
    "I definitely got a lot of machine shop time during this course which was great. I was able to familiarize myself well with the CEID, and the resources and staff within which I believe is extremely valuable. In terms of academic learning, the course was more limited just based on the style of the course. Touching on all the different types of engineering was helpful but I do not feel I learned to much concrete information instead getting more of an overview of what taking a class in that type of engineering may be like. Of course, I was expecting this as it is an intro course and there is a 5 week project at the end of the course so there is not much time to go overly into any one topic.",
    "Got a great survey of all the engineering disciplines with hands-on labs and projects. Ultimately got to work on a really cool project with a client.",
    "I learned a surface level of knowledge of the many subsections of engineering. I learned how to 3D print, laser cut, build circuits, and other hard skills in engineering. In addition, I learned how to work in team (like actually work in a team). I took this class because I was interested in engineering, but I had no experience so I wanted to see if it was really for me. An extremely valuable insight from this class was that I realized engineering wasn't for me, even though I had a really fun time in this class!",
    "hands-on experience in the engineering disciplines, plus experience working on a design project for a real client",
    "gained a very basic overview of various engineering disciplines and worked on a hands-on project for a client in the Yale athletics department",
    "Of course I learned a variety of skills like basics of coding, electrical systems, mechanical systems, etc. but the most important insight I received from this course is that anything is possible with an open-mind, determination, and a good attitude regarding set-backs\/obstacles. It is entirely possible that I was the WORST box-assembler (maybe ever), but just when I felt that I wasn't cut out for the class, multiple students made design suggestions, held nails in place for me, directed me to nice TAs. Even though my boards weren't exactly in place, I felt inspired to finish my box (the first assignment of the class) and even decorate it. As the course progressed, I realized that the professors would be there to answer any questions and provide thorough help as long as I maintained an optimistic attitude, which only felt natural being surrounded by amazing, kind students and staff at the CEID.",
    "I came in with ZERO background (never coded in my life and taking a completely different major), but came out with a much better appreciation for engineering, gained a few valuable skills (woodworking, lasercutting, 3D printing, coding etc), managed to code my first program and finished a project I never thought I would be able to complete.",
    "I gained not only many technical skills in the field of engineering, but also gained insight in the way of thinking and the problem-solving mindset an engineer needs.",
    "Learned basics of all different kinds of engineering principles and most importantly how to succeed in a project team.",
    "I developed problem-solving, teamwork, and project planning\/organization skills. I gained knowledge and insight into the types of engineering offered at yale.",
    "I learned to use circuits, Arduino, laser cutting, and 3D printing to develop original designs of an engineering product."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the professors of the class and its format! Dean Vince and Larry were so clearly invested in this class and spent SO MUCH time at the CEID. They were available pretty much all day every day for anything we needed and did everything in their power to make sure we were learning in the best way we could be. Also, I really enjoyed the format of the class. I appreciated learning about the different types of engineering and then the lab each week that allowed us to apply what we were learning about.",
    "The labs and final project were amazing and really fun ways to develop a lot of new skills. I also liked spending so much time in the CEID and being able to spend a lot of time working with the professors. One thing that could be improved would be to make the project homeworks less in-depth. I understood the need to document our work, but I often ended up spending a lot of time trying to get the paperwork done.",
    "No real complaints, maybe a little more clarity on the additional work needed in project phase.",
    "Larry and Dean Vince are fantastic--always willing to help during the long hours it took to complete our various projects. Perhaps the lectures at the beginning of the course could be improved--not sure how much I got out of them.",
    "The course could be more in depth with what different engineering careers mean as careers instead of being general about what they do.",
    "The first half of the course was a very interesting survey, and I wish that the skills developed there had applied to the later half.",
    "The strength of this course is the final project and everything that is learned along to way to develop a prototype. The weakness of the course is that some of the lectures such as the biomedical, environmental, and chemical engineering ones are not very useful when designing the final project. If these lectures were removed there would be more time for a final project.",
    "The setup of this class is great. I loved the lecture\/lab pairings for the different fields of engineering. The project was amazing. The only thing is it would be cool if we could maybe have some input to what project we get. I know there were some projects that I wouldve rather worked on, and some students who had those projects felt that was about ours or others. I know it might not be feasible, but allowing us to pick or at least have some input into our project might make everyone even more engaged.",
    "The course was able to go through several different types of engineering, however it might have been helpful to have exposure to additional guest speakers to learn more about the industry. During the second half of the class, the projects we worked on were all very interesting. The course provided several different avenues for help and guidance throughout the design process. It might have been nice to know the projects we were assigned earlier on so we could have begun the ideation phase sooner. It was tough to complete the project during the time given.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is that it is taught in the CEID, with lots of opportunities to learn in a hands-on way (unlike many courses in the engineering program). The greatest weakness is that the workload for the course is so backloaded with the final projects, but there isn't a very good way to mitigate this. Just know that the last several weeks will be very busy.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course is the wide overview students get of all the different types of engineering. It is a very useful course for deciding if you want to do engineering at all, is helpful for eliminating types of engineering you do not want to pursue, however not extremely helpful in showing exactly what type of engineering you want to do as it does not go in depth enough to any particular section of engineering. Overall a great course and only improvement I could recommend is allocating more time for the final projects.",
    "Project could start earlier",
    "Strengths - Final project gives you a hands-on challenge to work on, which is very satisfying. Also, great survey course to figure out if engineering is for you. Dean Vince and Larry are great mentors and teachers. Weaknesses - The class does not go very in-depth on any subsection of engineering (not that you should expect it to). Work in this class is very light until the final project. If you have never coded before, the first few assignments can be difficult. You don't get to choose which final project to work on, it's randomly assigned (which could also be a strength).",
    "Strengths: I ended up really liking the people in my class and in my group, which was lucky. Lots of support in the class but you really need to ask for it. Weaknesses: First five weeks are meant to be an overview but personally i learned very little and definitely not enough to be considered an overview of that field. Environmental engineering was supposed to be covered but was a little disappointing as it just focused on ways to make manufacturing and other types of engineering more green. Little guidance on the final project, which is good for independent work on the project but ultimately was a little difficult especially in terms of the expectations. Also was disappointed at the lack of diversity in the types of projects offered as more than half of them were for the Yale athletics department.",
    "Strengths-wide variety of exposure, many resources, INCREDIBLE professors, team-building, praise for effort rather than perfection Weaknesses-some assignments felt rushed or unattainable in very short periods of time, but that is to be expected in order to have enough time for the final projects. Also, I was very inexperienced coming in to the class, so things took me a lot longer than they did for other people (from what I could see). However, Larry and Vince knew that we were capable of whatever we put our minds to, and provided guidance during office hours.",
    "+ Great variety of topics and very interesting projects + The instructors are the most passionate people I have met and really made the course very engaging - The coursework is higher compared to other courses, but there is always office hours to help (It will be worth it honestly looking back)",
    "Strengths: It gave a good introduction to each field of engineering and the final project was amazing and very interesting. Weaknesses: For some fields, like Chemical and Biomedical, the lectures and projects were too specific.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS. Would highly recommend to anyone who is creative or looking to explore engineering or computer science. Dean Vince and Larry are amazing lecturers and all of the homework really contributed to my learning. I loved the collaboration in the final project as well.",
    "The course's greatest strength was the opportunity it gave me to apply my skills and knowledge to create something real and learn throughout the process. The course could be improved by lending more time to the final project or going into greater depth on the engineering topics.",
    "I loved that the course was based on a hands-on learning environment and that the interaction between students and the teaching staff was very frequent and productive. One weakness of the course that could be improved is that the first half of the class, which was an intro to different engineering fields, was very shallow and not really rewarding in terms of knowledge. Although I liked the idea that I could engage with various fields, it would've been better if the proportion of lab\/hands-on learning was higher or the project period was longer."

   "comments": [
    "YES, if you are considering becoming an engineer or are interested by the idea of project design! Take into account that this class IS a lot of work, and the class will suffer if you are not invested, so make sure you are ready to put your best effort in. I am so glad I took this class -- I learned more than I could have ever imagined!",
    "Yes, I loved this course! It made me realize how much I like engineering. Getting to work with a real problem for our final project was such a good experience, and I felt really accomplished by the end of the course.",
    "I would, its a one in a lifetime experience for both engineering and non-engineering students.",
    "I would--Larry and Dean Vince are great, the premise of completing a project and then actually following through and doing that is so rewarding. Definitely a big time commitment towards the end (but not that much in the beginning)--the course is backloaded. However, definitely worth it!",
    "Yes, it is very exemplar of what engineering prospects should be interested in at the intro level.",
    "Not to every student. Perhaps those who are unsure of what they want to do.",
    "Yes, its a super interesting and enjoyable course, however it took the same amount of time as two or three of my other classes during the final project time.",
    "Yes!!! Larry and Dean Vince are great, and there is really no other course like this at Yale. You learn a ton, have fun building stuff, and get to work with a New Haven client. Such a cool opportunity. Take this course!",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is considering pursuing engineering. It is a challenging class that will take up a considerable amount of time outside of class. However, the end product of creating a device for a client and experiencing the design process is very rewarding and teaches you a lot about what it means to enjoy engineering.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that wants hands-on experience in engineering and design. The course is well structured to make sure your final project is something you can really be proud of, and the skills learned along the way are important for any STEM major.",
    "I would recommend this course to students considering engineering. I think it is a great course for any potential engineering majors not only to decide if they want to do engineering, but also to introduce the engineers to the CEID and giving them a broad overview of the other sections of engineering as every type of engineering intersects with other types. The workload is not bad (first half of the course you can coast) and the final project is fun and what you make of it.",
    "Absolutely. Really great way to figure out what youre interested in while working on a great project.",
    "Heck yeah I would! If you are wondering whether engineering is for you, or you are just curious about engineering, or you just want a fun, hands-on class, I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "I would recommend this course because it is an opportunity to learn the basics in a variety of fields, and a chance to explore potential interests in the field of engineering.",
    "It's a decent survey course and is good if you want to get into the CEID space, get hands on with tools and learn to use the machines and the great resources they have. For me it wasn't the most engaging or productive a lot of the time, but I did enjoy my project and spending time with my small group. Did not really get to know anyone outside of my small group, and teaching staff and TAs can sometimes provide less than helpful feedback, but for the most part if you are engaged and want to work on a project independently and really ask for the help you need, the class will be fine.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. There is so much that you can experience and learn from others in this course. The assignments were, I think, the least important part. Larry was willing to go above and beyond and answer questions you didn't even know you had, which opens your mind and provides new perspectives that you might not have considered previously. I felt so inspired by my classmates and I had a ton of fun with my team for the project. Everyone is really nice and you can build some long-lasting friendships through this experience.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend taking this course if you are interested in understanding different fields of engineering & developing your skills in different hardware\/software area.",
    "Yes, if you have never done any engineering. But if youve done FIRST robotics or VEX in high school, you will already know a lot of the material. Dont take 118 if you know team 118.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student, especially if they were unsure about engineering or wanted some experience building and testing a product. I recommend this course to anyone that if curious about the process of engineering.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all Yale students.",
    "yes I would recommend this course to other prospective engineering majors because I value the opportunity it gave me to learn about other types of engineering and helped me to focus my interest on mechanical.",
    "Yes, definitely. This course is a good introduction to Yale's engineering program and I would definitely recommend this to students who are thinking of pursuing an engineering major. We got to engage with various engineering fields and during it I found out what specific engineering program I wanted to pursue, EECS. Plus, we all became super users of the CEID and got to know the staff members and facilities of the CEID. The engineering project in the later half is time-consuming and requires commitment, but it is very rewarding and you get to become really close with your project team members. Instructors--Larry and Dean Vince--are simply amazing people; take this course and you'll get to know them very well."
