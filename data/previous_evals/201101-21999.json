   "comments": [
    "Take this class - it was my favorite this term and I'm not a music major at all. The material is fascinating and is important stuff to know for life!",
    "This is one of those awesome offbeat courses that will make you a better person. Prof. Kreuzer is an amazing lecturer. Some musical background (at least the ability to read music) is recommended, since things can get a bit technical.",
    "Great class! The modern stuff can be hard to listen to, but if anything it gives you a greater insight and appreciation for some of the more eccentric stuff (i.e. serialism).",
    "Gives you just what it says. Great course. Fun music and listening assignments. Not a lot of work. Exams definitely manageable. Professor engaging.",
    "While this class can be challenging at times, and you might not enjoy every piece of music or every composer we discuss, I learned a ton about classical music.",
    "Take it if you want to become more familiar with the big names in classical music and learn how to analyze music. No musical background is necessary, but it doesn't hurt. Lectures are interesting, though perhaps not as engaging as they could be. I wanted so much to be blown away by this course, but in the end it was good not great.",
    "A good survey course of Western music; if you have a strong musical background it may seem oversimplified but you can still take it as a fun way to expose yourself to a some new genres of music.",
    "Great overview of music. I'm musically illiterate and really benefited from this class, from being guided through two centuries of great music! The class was very enjoyable and I loved studying and learning... alongside music, and feel like I have a much better grasp of music as a whole now.The class is very manageable, and is as much about learning about the historical development of music as it is about appreciating the music.",
    "TAKE IT! If you've had any background in music at all, you will love this class! Even if you don't - it's a wonderful class that's not too difficult and very interesting. I started out taking it cred\/D\/fail and did half the readings as pre-bedtime reading, but then switched it to a letter grade without having to do that much more work. The mditerm and final are pretty straight forward though the final does take a significant amount of preparation just because there's a lot of material to cover. The grading is pretty generous though, and it's great to just go to lecture and just listen.",
    "You hear a lot of great music in this class and you learn to put it in a historical context, which is interesting. The listening assignments are fun too. Analyzing a musical passage like a poem is interesting, and after the fourth I think I\u0092d learned to understand classical music better, but not that much better.",
    "I would recommend this to students who are truly interested in western classical music and want to have a deeper understanding. If you are not interested, this class could make you bored at times. Also many of the students in this class are music majors.",
    "Incredible class, just take it!"
