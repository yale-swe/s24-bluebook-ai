   "comments": [
    "The course encompasses beauty from a philosophical perspective. Don't take this class if you don't like or have difficulty getting \"deep\".",
    "Yes",
    "This class was excellent. I came in anxious about my lack of writing skills, but having taken this course, I have not only improved, but am confident with my writing and plan on taking more writing courses in the future. This has been my favorite class since coming to Yale!",
    "ENGL 114 was a joy. First and foremost, it does everything it promises to do. You're taught to have a certain mindset when approaching academic writing. You're given a variety of essays to read and analyze. You're asked to do original research. You're given techniques to critique and improve your own work. Even if my skill hasn't seen improvement, I am certainly more equipped for writing papers at Yale than I ever was before. It is because of this that I also recommend the student take this course early on, so to better prepare themselves for courses later on in their academic career that require writing.Furthermore, if you're under the impression that ENGL 114 is elementary or that it's inferior to ENGL 120, know that you're wrong. They differ, more than anything, in scope. Of course, due to the nature of ENGL 114 to focus on particular subjects\/topics, make sure you enroll in a section with a topic you enjoy. It will make the experience that much better.Also, Ms. Jones is a wonderful instructor - if you're vaguely interested in art, beauty or history, take this class with her. She's taught me how to approach art and navigate a paper addressing such complex issues as beauty and the nature of history itself. Not to mention, she's very kind and more than willing to improve the individual student's writing skill.",
    "If you are at all interested in art and aesthetic theory, this is a great writing course. The class discussions were always interesting especially about the awesome readings, and it's a good class to develop and think about art and beauty if you are interested in that. We wrote about topics such as what is art\/beauty, a rhetorical analysis of an aesthetics essay, and a research paper on anything in art\/history. It was a good way to practice writing, but I don't know if it necessarily made my writing better. What did was going to a writing tutor who really helped a lot. But I definitely recommend as a chill class with a great professor and great material.",
    "i would recommend this class!",
    "I am very glad that I took this class. It was not only interesting on a content level, but from a learning perspective it truly helped me improve my style of writing and technique. Having said that, the students in my class were awesome. I am not entirely sure how good the class would have been had the group not been as engaged and dynamic. Moreover, the class is also great in terms of the cultural value of the different trips and assignments. We got the chance to go to the MET as a class, which was such a good experience, as well as visit the Art Galley at Yale. All in all, I would highly recommend English 114, especially Ms. Jones section.",
    "If you're interested in strengthening your writing skills, I suggest looking into English 120. English 114 was helpful but maybe the subject divisions made it more difficult to write so narrowly about, especially when Art and Beauty are so abstract.",
    "Definitely. It'll open your eyes up to different ways of understanding the abstract concepts of art and beauty while also improving your writing skills. That being said, if you don't necessarily have an interest in art, the class may be dull for you.",
    "Yes! The material is interesting and the professor is great!",
    "This was my favorite course of freshman year, hands down. The philosophical approach to the concepts of art and beauty forced me to make my writing more concrete and substantial. I feel that this course allowed me to improve not only as a writer, but also as a thinker. I loved the interdisciplinary feel of class discussions - we were able to broaden and extrapolate upon others' ideas, thus allowing us to go deeper in our explorations. In addition, Rosemary Jones is an amazing person and professor. She is as attentive to us as individuals as she is to the class as a whole. She brings energy and vigor to discussions, and never \"lectures,\" per say. She readily incorporates ideas from students, and is always willing to listen to our passions and musings - however abstract or random they may be. Ms. Jones facilitated a fertile environment of exploration and dialogue like none I have experienced since coming to Yale."
