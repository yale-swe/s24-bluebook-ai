    "I would definitely recommend this class. A lot of the readings are interesting and it is fun to write the papers because of the creative aspect.",
    "Absolutely the best even if you wouldn't think you would enjoy a WGSS class. There's something in it for everyone",
    "This course was an introduction into both food studies and women's studies. It was a great overview, with some really cool readings, and the papers give you multiple opportunities to delve into the topics that most interest you. I would highly recommend it. The papers are great opportunities to learn to write in a different style.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. It is very different to all other classes that I have taken at Yale. It is not a gut class but rather a class to think and write in a very different manner. There may not be wrong and right answers, but there are still good and bad papers.",
    "I loved this class. It's really interesting material and will make you think about food in a new light. there are 4 5 page papers. one is about the history of a particular food, one is about a cookbook, one is about photography of women and food, and the last is a portrait of someone's relationship to food. section is interesting, and lecture isn't super necessary. it's definitely manageable for a writing credit and enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this as an interesting 'fifth course'. The workload is not heavy, and the material is relevant and thought-provoking. You should really try to go to all of the lectures even though there aren't any exams for the class.",
    "Gut class. Take it if you never want to go to class since the lectures don't really correlate to the papers.",
    "Absolutely take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "A wonderful, extremely enjoyable class. Studies of food and femininity are so so important and under-appreciated, and relevant to literally everything. My largest peeve regarding this class, in fact, is probably how obvious other students were in treating this as a gut. Sure, the workload isn't heavy, the readings are enjoyable - but why does enjoyable mean nonacademic? I wish other students had been more involved and idk, just more passionate in section discussions. The papers were varied and very different from other classes - you use things like interviews, photographs, and cookbooks as the basis for your argument, and little else, relying on your own analytic skills. Analyzing unusual forms of evidence is not only fun, it encourages you to use more of Yale resources for other classes (like the Beinecke and YUAG). Therefore, I would highly, highly recommend this class for freshmen and sophomores. Also, go to lecture!!! Although not technically required to write the papers\/get a good grade, Professor Trumpler is the bomb. She is humble and so insightful, and if you're interested in sustainable food at all, she can direct you to lots of different resources. This class is very much a history of science class - its basis is on asking the right questions, analyzing different narratives and frameworks, and less about concrete facts. I personally feel this is extremely valuable, because it teaches you to approach what seems like the concrete with a more intellectual mindset.",
    "Take the class if you desperately need a WR credit. Otherwise, steer clear. One would think that the combination of a caring professor, an interesting course subject, and fascinating paper topics would make for a great class. However, most lectures were incredibly basic and not thought-penetrating in the slightest. This made most students stop attending lecture by the second week of classes. While this is a great way to get a WR credit, since there are only 4 5 page papers, I'm not quite sure I would enroll in this class again.",
    "Yes, it is certainly easier than a lot of other Yale classes, but ultimately it is what you make of it. The class really did change the way I thought about women and their relation to food culture.",
    "I would recommend WGSS 120 to another student. It exposes you to interesting material and is unique from a lot of other classes at Yale.",
    "Weekly readings + section, 2 50-min lectures, 4 5-page papers which you can choose some elements of what\/how you want to write about it so it can be a very personal experience. This class is all about how much you make of it. If you are all interested in food, women, or how they intersect, this class is great.",
    "I would recommend this class to any fellow student. For me, I needed a social science credit and I'd always been meaning to take this class. It's a good fifth class too because the work load is very manageable, interesting, and engaging.",
    "I enjoyed it. The papers were graded seriously though, and it doesn't really improve writing abilities, so expect to work hard on the papers.",
    "Take it. It is a chill class with a good professor",
    "The value in the course, in my experience, rests 100% with Maria Trumpler -- she is an engaging lecturer and an incredibly intelligent professor. The readings are also great but my experience with section was not good. Due to the size of the class, the TA, unfortunately, plays a big role in your experience. Mitigate this by taking advantage of Professor Trumpler's office hours, and you won't be disappointed -- you will learn a lot.",
    "Meh.",
    "A very good class with a VERY manageable workload. Definitely take this class! They are not easy to find",
    "WGSS is a wonderful course but the quality of TAs vary too much, so be careful with that.",
    "Fantastic introductory survey course! Though the course revolves around the relationships between food and gender, the course material is really broad in subject and disciplines, so be aware that you may not get as in-depth in any one topic as you'd like. Dr. Trumpler is well versed in what she lectures on and I was genuinely excited to go to lecture! The papers are short, really manageable, and some of them were actually pretty fun since the assignments are so atypical (literary analysis of a cookbook, for example).",
    "Great way to learn about food and women's roles while completing a writing requirement.",
    "The lectures are generally boring to the point of inducing sleep, but the sections were often interesting and stimulating. Some of the readings were actually quite cool. If you decide to take this class, make sure that you pick Megan as your TA.",
    "It is an interesting course about food and how it relates to the subject of women.",
    "Would recommend. Lectures are interesting, and helpful in getting material\/ideas\/themes for the papers. Good experience with paper-writing without the stress you would get from an English 120-type course.",
    "This course consists of an interesting series of lectures that approach a variety of topics from an interdisciplinary lens. Professor Trumpler is a great lecturer and I feel as though the course is accessible to a wide variety of students. In addition, the workload is very manageable. There were weekly readings and five papers throughout the semester. The papers were more personal assignments that allowed for creativity and were easy to complete. This class is an opportunity to learn a lot of interesting material, without having to invest too much time.",
    "NO!! No clear takeaways",
    "WGSS 120 is a great introduction into gender studies as they relate to food and culture. I found this class very interesting and would definitely recommend it!",
    "The class is interesting but kind of taught at a low level, so it can get a bit boring if you're at all familiar with the topics being discussed. It's not difficult though, and all of the papers are interesting and a lot of fun to write.",
    "Great class. Just 4 5-page papers and a quick hw assignment (I went to the farmers market and wrote a paragraph about it). The lectures are interesting too.",
    "Definitely a great writing class to take! Not much work - 4 papers - and the essays don't really relate to class so a lot of people don't go to lecture (although I would encourage you go to class because a lot of topics are interesting and Professor Trumpler often gives advice on writing papers during class). Readings were really interesting and essay topics were creative and fun!",
    "I would highly recommend the course. It's handles interesting topics you'd want to think about at some point.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. I thought the lectures were interesting - and yes you should go even though there aren't any exams. Section had interesting discussions too, and since class is 50 min 2x a week, it's not really any extra class time. the 4 papers aren't too bad and are on interesting topics that are a nice break from traditional structured course assignments.",
    "If you are interested in a relaxing course without the pressure of tests, take this. I was genuinely interested in food and this course really shows you the opportunities and resources at Yale for those interested in environmental\/food studies. It also serves as a general \"intro to WGSS\" course.",
    "This class was different than any I had taken before. I recommend this class to students who are looking for a creative style writing credit.",
    "Great!",
    "Don't really need to go to class. skim the readings so you can participate in section. Meet with your TA to discuss the papers. Hard to get bellow a B, also hard to get above a B",
    "Makes you think outside the box",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It is an easy class to work on writing and hear interesting things about food.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "A ridiculously easy and quite unrewarding class. The papers are easy and unrelated to the readings or lectures. Gut. You dont have to go to class or do the readings, but I would suggest doing some of the readings for fun. The only thing I really enjoyed was the final paper, for which I interviewed a friend and learned about her struggles with food disorders. That was very rewarding and I would never learn about it without this class. The whole class is a giant echo chamber with no opposing views though, so do not expect to learn much. You will hear a lot about farmers markets and the failed cheese farm project. The lectures are quite biased. I think some views expressed in lectures\/readings are poorly supported and pseudo-scientific (especially about nutrition and GMOs). You wont get a chance to challenge anything in class, section or the papers, so just sit there, nod and take your easy A and writing credit.",
    "YES! A great course that will make you think about something so everyday--FOOD--in an entirely different context.",
    "I would recommend WGSS 120 as a writing course. There are four 5-page papers each with very creative topics that each cover a different skill set of writing. Definitely sign up for a WR section if you can because the workload is basically the same but one gets you a WR credit. Professor Trumpler shows a great enthusiasm and understanding of the subject matter.",
    "This course was awesome - the lectures were easy to following and really interesting, Professor Trumpler is wonderful, the readings were diverse and easy to accomplish, and the papers were actually pretty fun to write.",
    "I would first say that I understand that most people take WGSS 120 as a gut, and it is an easy class in the sense that you don't really have to go to lecture, but it's not easy in the sense that you DO have to go to section, do the reading, and try on the papers. The papers, by the way, are often hard to understand in terms of what's actually expected, and they're NOT graded easily! I guess this depends on your TA, but mine was tough. Still, I would recommend WGSS 120 as a fifth class to anyone -- it's interesting, there's no final, and the work isn't bad at all. Also, take the writing intensive -- I didn't and my suitemate did, and there's no discernible difference except that you get a writing credit at the end of one and not the other.",
    "Loved this class",
    "Not an easy A!",
    "Interesting class with a light workload",
    "The lectures are very entertaining, and the papers are interesting. I enjoyed the class overall.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is very interesting, and it actually makes you look forward to lecture.",
    "I would recommend it either as an easy requirement filler or for someone who is actually passionate about food. It was fun, not very demanding, and interesting. But you get what you put into the class. Some people can skip every lecture and still get a good grade, but don't learn much.",
    "Solid survey of woman's changing role in food production, consumption, and preparation over time. The paper topics are NOT easy, unless you're genuinely interested in the material and have solid writing skills. Do not take this course to build your writing skills. Attendance at lecture is not required.",
    "This course was informative and very enjoyable. I absolutely recommend this course to my fellow students!",
    "Interesting class if you are interested in food studies or gender studies.",
    "This is a great class for people who want to learn about women, food, and culture all together, not just the individual subjects. I would recommend this class to other student because I found it very interesting and the professor is engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's only 4 essays, no final, and no midterm. The essays were actually fun to write and the readings were really interesting. It would be a good 5th class because there isn't much work weekly.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "Definitely worth taking as a writing credit, but don't expect it to be a gut. You may end up with a TF who grades quite hard, and in that case you will end up spending lots of time and effort on your essays to try and secure your grade. The essays are fun to write, however, and don't require excessive research and preparation before you begin writing.",
    "don't have to go to class, interesting but can be deceptive as it requires a fair amount of effort.",
    "Not as easy as you might think",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The material covered is really interesting, very applicable, and Professor Trumpler is an amazing lecturer. She really wants to teach students how to think critically rather than memorize minute details so there is no busy work; every reading and essay was interesting and had a purpose. Great course.",
    "This class is a good \"fifth\" class. It is pretty interesting and not a lot of work but the work is annoying",
    "Yes, because she is concerned about your success as much as you are and is willing to help you achieve that."
