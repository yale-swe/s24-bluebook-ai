    "Not fun. Not terrible.Tips for success:-- Organize a group of 4 or 5 fellow classmates who are good students early in the semester and get in the pattern of checking your problem sets with one another before they are due every week. This is invaluable. At first the problem sets might seem easy, but they are hard by the end and you will need others to get through them, especially if you want to get it done ASAP. Your HW is ultimately worth a lot.-- If you need extra help, skip the TA office hours and go directly to Dobbins. Beware, he can be long-winded. But helpful.-- Read the book and do the examples in the book. I think this is more important than going to lecture.",
    "I took ENAS194 this semester because taking a higher level math class was a co-requisite for physics. I feel as though I learned a lot from this class, which is why I took it, and I feel as though I spent so much time working on the problem sets that I won't forget the techniques we covered. These are good things. However, this class was very stressful and time consuming. The problem sets were long - the shortest problem sets I submitted were about 10 pages. I would say that I spent between 4 and 15 hours each week on the problem sets. I wasn't doing badly in the class: I was above average in both midterms. Nonetheless, my stress levels on Wednesday were always very high, as I was never sure whether I'd finish the problem set by the next day.Both Dobbins and the TAs were very helpful in office hours or outside of class. Dobbins seemed to be dedicated to what he was teaching, but needs a bit more self confidence. Joseph and Daehwan (and Dobbins, for that matter) put a lot of effort into learning the names of the students in the class.On the whole, I'm glad that I took the class, because I got what I needed out of it. It involves a large workload because of the problem sets (some of which are unreasonably hard), but the workload does mean that you learn the material well. That said, I haven't taken thefinal yet, and I'm terrified about that.",
    "Having just got out of the final for this class, I'll be completely honest and say the course is incredibly difficult. Based on a class evaluation Professor Dobbins did at the end of term, the consensus was that each problem set took about 10-14 hours to complete. The midterms and final exams always had two questions that went \"above-and-beyond\" the basic material covered in class. But, as many people have said before, if you're looking at this class then you most likely have to take it. Don't be too discouraged by the amount of work though - the topics are really cool (and definitely applicable for anyone studying to be an engineer or physicist) and Professor Dobbins is really accessible. I know that the 2011 evaluations for this class are overwhelmingly negative, but that was Professor Dobbins' first time teaching the course. He improved immensely this term and I think he was actually my favorite professor. It seemed like he was genuinely invested in us doing well in the course and he always sent out a friendly email with words of encouragement the night before an exam. It's the little things that count and I would definitely recommend this course to anybody studying engineering or applied science.",
    "It's a difficult class, so don't just take it for fun. Not that it isn't fun--the material is great--but you should take it with a purpose in mind, such as credit for a major or a prerequisite. You're going to have to work. The exams got progressively difficult because we \"needed a curve.\" Also, Dobbins is a great professor despite last term's reviews of him. He knows so much, so if you're having trouble on problem sets, go to office hours. You'll be impressed by how well he explains things.",
    "The class definitely requires a lot of time and effort, especially because Dobbins writes his own homework problems and they are often messy and\/or difficult. But I feel like I got a lot out of it, and really did enjoy the subject. Plus, I think Dobbins took past reviews to heart because the teaching really wasn't bad.",
    "It is a thorough, if frustrating, introduction to ordinary differential equations. Partial differential equations were covered very briefly at the end of the course and were I think the most confusing part of the class, so if you want a good understanding of them I would suggest taking the semester long class on partial equations from the math department.",
    "So much work. It will drive you crazy. Prof. Dobbins should change the problem sets to something more realistic.",
    "This class is for warriors. If you're passionate about mathematics and science, and you want to give it all you have, then you should definitely pick this course. Work hard, and make the best out of lectures, office hours, TAs, the textbook and your peers (they're all great).",
    "I strongly disliked this class. It was not well taught. The problem sets were long and tedious. I guess I did learn diffeq well, but I was very frustrated during the process.",
    "This class is hard. The psets are long, and I found them impossible to do well without going to the TF's review sessions. That said, I was always able to finish the psets and do well after going to a review session. Professor Dobbins is an okay explainer, but can get frustrated with himself\/lacks the self confidence that experience brings. I would not particularly recommend this course, but I know most people are taking it because they have to for a requirement.",
    "Don't take this unless you have to.",
    "Requires a lot of outside work and the problem sets take a while, but not an impossible class and definitely rewarding. At the end I felt like I really understood all the material we covered.",
    "Take it if you have to. It is really stressful and a lot of work. Lectures aren't particularly useful so you're pretty much teaching yourself the material. Attend as many TA sessions as you can (go at least one a week) and you'll be fine.",
    "This was a good class and overview of diffeq. I'm glad I took it with Dobbins in the fall. Heavy on homework but made studying easier for the midterms and final.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you need to take Diff EQ's. As a math course it isn't bad, but try to take it with someone other than Dobbins. He rarely managed to finish the lessons on time (so that we had several homeworks due the day after they were supposed to be due), and sometimes seemed agitated\/bothered when people asked questions. Also, the problem sets were almost impossible to complete unless you went to the TAs, who explained everything.",
    "If you can, take it in the spring. The weekly problem sets were unnecessarily long, and though you can tell Prof. Dobbins really cares - he's nowhere near as bad as last year's reviews will suggest - the tests were full of tricks and didn't reward the work you'll put in. Learned a lot, but suffered doing so.",
    "ENAS 194 is a difficult course. Each problem set will take about 10-15 hours, depending on whether you go to the TA office hours or not. I strongly recommend that you do go to office hours because they will cut down the time you need on homework. Study very hard for the exams and the 2nd one will be harder than the first since the first one is \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo easy\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Prof. Dobbins. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend this course unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required for your major.",
    "This class is a lot of work. But you will also learn a lot about differential equations. Professor Dobbins covers the material really quickly, so it's probably helpful to read the book before coming to class.",
    "Overall this is a good course. You have to be prepared to spend a lot of time on the problem sets each week (generally 10+ hours). Professor Dobbins is really helpful though and wants everyone to understand it, so help is easy to get if you want or need it.",
    "Last year's evaluations made this seem like the worst class ever, so I went into the class with that mindset. I'm happy to say that it wasn't at all. Yes, Dobbins isn't the best lecturer, but I feel that he read last years evaluations and tried to improve. He also does take the time to learn everyone's name, makes himself readily available after and outside of class and, once you get usedto his self-deprecating humor, he's pretty enjoyable in lecture. The psets are quite difficult and take around 8-10 hours a week, but I went to office hours and Daehwan and Joseph were incredibly helpful. Also the pset questions don't always reflect what we learned in lecture (maybe because we fell behind about halfway through) and are significantly harder than the types of questions on tests which was a bit frustrating. However, Dobbins does realize the difficulty of the course and adjusts the final grades accordingly.",
    "ENAS 194 won't surprise you. If you need it or like math, then take it.",
    "Dobbins gives hard problem sets and hard tests. I understand why he does it: he wants students to be able to apply the knowledge in new circumstances. But it does mean that I spent 10 hours each week doing problem sets. Ifyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be finishing psets at 7 in the morning, try taking it with someone else.His teaching style is example-based. I prefer to have results proven to me, but to each their own.Those objections aside, Dobbins is the nicest, most caring professor I have had so far."
