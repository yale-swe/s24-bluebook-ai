    "If you are serious about Sculpture and you are not afraid of getting in the shop and the studio and building, and spending money, then you should absolutely take this class. But this class is not for the carefree, though it is very welcoming to people of all backgrounds, due to its small size. Just be dedicated and go for it.",
    "Shoddily structured. Spent too much time on things that were only of interest to the professor. Queenland is nice, but not very helpful - his critiques can be pretty irrelevant and he doesn't seem to get to the heart of anything. Assignments were a little random, but not in the way that is exciting or thought-provoking (ie. make a scarecrow, redo a previous piece). Would only recommend it to someone who already knows what they want to work on, because Queenland will not be much help.",
    "Art 445 was a good class for independent development, however there was very little structure to provide direction. The specific assignments were often topics that I was not very interested in. Luckily, being art, these assignments were vague enough that I could still work in the ways I wanted.",
