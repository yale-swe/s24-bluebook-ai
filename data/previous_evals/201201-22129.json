   "comments": [
    "It is a lab, be prepared to burn hours working on code and circuits. I would recommend it as it allows you to control mechanical systems with electronics and programming which is very slick. You do need a lot of prerequisites as it is not an easy subject matter",
    "As Prof Morrell said, \"we ran down the hallway of mechatronics and opened a lot of doors, but didn't really go into the rooms.\" Intense overview of mechanical\/electrical systems, very interesting, but a lot of time and poorly organized.",
    "Eh, this is probably required for you. It seems cool and all to take a class from someone who was director of systems engineering at Segway, but I don't feel that I got as much as I should have out of this course. It's mostly DC motor control, with some segways (ahaha..ha...) in between like building your own strain gauge, etc. However, at least half of the class is going to be remembered (to me at least) as trial-and-error playing with numbers in C for 3 weeks straight until the motor setup works. This was an OK class, somehow I just didn't feel as edcuated as I do having finished fluids lab. That said, it's just one midterm, relatively light lab reports, 2-3 psets total, no final (but many more hours spent in lab than outside comapared to fluids lab once you get to motor control part).",
    "I learned a lot, although it was mostly not in lecture: it was trying to brute force my way through the labs. Not the most pleasant experience, but it's a much less painful course if you're good at programming. Morrell is wonderful, as always, but a lot of the lab successes\/lack thereof depend on the TA, so make sure you have a good relationship with whoever it happens to be and make sure they're willing to be around to help you out.",
    "It is fine - some good moments, medium amount of work otherwise.",
    "This class is pretty cool. You learn about many different applications and areas of mechatronics (electronic control of mechanical systems) without falling too deeply into any of them (read: few complex concepts, only 2 psets). It's like a higher-level survey course. Professor Morrell is very interesting and his industry experience (rare in the engineering department here for some reason) really shows in the way he approaches engineering problems. There were non-engineers in the class who did fine; just be ready to do a fair amount of microcontroller (PIC) programming, because that is the lab every week and sometimes it gets frustrating.",
    "Very interesting course, and one of the most grounded in real life usefulness. However, you NEED to gave taken intro to EE or you will be miserable. Also difeq is semi-required."
