   "comments": [
    "I would take it. The workload is very reasonable up until the last two weeks of school, when there is A LOT OF WORK (homework, reading, presentations).",
    "Yes, you'll come out with much better speaking skills.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, especially if they can take it with Se\u00f1ora Leon. The grammar you learn in this class is very useful, and the work is enjoyable. If you have any interest in improving your spanish, take this class.",
    "Speaking Spanish is my weakest point, is the most useful of Spanish skills, and was not particularly developed in class.",
    "I liked it fine, although I thought the vocabulary and topic areas were not very useful. It's just like the other Spanish classes - you know what you are supposed to know and it's graded as you'd expect.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student hoping to improve his or her Spanish skills. People taking this class should not expect to become totally fluent over the course of the semester, but I definitely thought it helped me to read, speak, and think in Spanish with more ease.",
    "While most people (including myself) take this class to fulfill the foreign language requirement, Spanish 140 is a worthwhile, well-organized class that is much better than Spanish 130. The first 7-8 weeks consist of grammar review and short stories, but in the final half of the semester, we watched movies, did a presentation and read a short novel. The workload can be high at times\u0097when you are expect to read the novel, study for quizzes, and work on a lengthy (about 25 minute) presentation with a partner, the class can seem very frustrating. But I found the class useful, and my two Spanish classes (L3 and L4) improved my Spanish far more than my years of high school study. Thanks to this class, I\u0092m now interested in taking further L5 classes. Take the class with Rosamaria Leon\u0097she\u0092s a helpful, engaging, caring professor who makes coming to class each day fun. Through her guidance, you get to know and appreciate the company of everyone in the class, making the experience all the more enjoyable.",
    "Spanish 140 is very similar to 130 in terms of the work load, but is focused more on the oral and speaking component of the language. It is a great class for those who enjoy speaking spanish and going beyond the grammar component of the language.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. It is not very much work and it is not very hard (assuming you can somewhat speak Spanish). You will end up talking everyday, which makes class engaging. If you've taken L3, it's exactly the same, except there are more assessments, and the material is slightly more difficult. Don't be scared by the \"novel\" that you have to read--you only end up reading about 4 pages every night.",
    "No. If you need to take it do but it is much harder than 130 and you need to do a few big presentations."
