    "Matlab skills. I didn't really know how to go about Matlab before but after this course I feel more comfortable. I would like to say it was thanks to my peers who worked with me on the modules. But the TA made himself very available and was always ready to help.",
    "I was able to become somewhat comfortable with MatLab programming and gained confidence in being able to produce and interpret code.",
    "I developed significant knowledge, skills, and experience with Matlab and delved into many topics in biophysics and bioengineering that I had never been exposed to before.",
    "I learned about several biological systems and useful computational models for them. In addition, I developed several matlab skills and improved my analytical problem solving skills. I also just improved generally my ability to look at a biological system and determine which aspects might be able to be modeled and what information could be gleaned from that.",
    "A general overview of the types of problems and approaches that fall under PEB. An introduction to Matlab.",
    "Matlab programing",
    "I learned about the applications of quantitative\/physical sciences in the study of biological systems. I also got more comfortable with Matlab and drafting research proposals."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths - enthusiastic TAs weaknesses - overall not terribly applicable for all PEB students, a nearly uninvolved professor (Corey), lots of heavy guest lectures with minimal relevance to class assignments",
    "I would say the biological component. I think the class is supposed to be half computational half biological concepts but I am not sure if this turned out to be true.",
    "I think the strength of the course is that the TFs, especially John , were very dedicated , patient and willing to break down both theory and coding concepts that I were not familiar with. I do think as a biology person, the course math background sections could do with some beforehand explaining as at times I was lost. Maybe if we were told a few days before what types of math\/physics concepts were being taught I could prepare so that I can fully take in the lecture. Overall though, I enjoyed this course and learned a lot.",
    "The strengths of the course are the Matlab assignments, where I felt I learned a significant amount about Matlab and coding in general, which will be very useful during my graduate studies. The weaknesses of the course are the biophysical concept components. In many of the assignments, I understood a general idea of the project and what the code was doing, but many times felt lacking when it came to the writeup portion. Since sometimes the guest lecture speakers weren't fully clear and the lecture slides weren't posted, it was difficult to apply the output of the code to actual biophysical concepts and to understand what was going on. This was especially evident in the last module (Assignment 4). In particular, the assignment instructions and the code for the last module were significantly more difficult than the other modules and I spent at least 5 times as long trying to understand how to do that assignment than the other assignments. This was due to lack of comments in the code and guidance in general as to what was going on in the code, as well as how the outputs applied to biophysical concepts. I think this could be improved (as well as this could be applied to other modules) by having a powerpoint with the TAs after the guest lectures that highlights the main biophysical concepts from the guest lectures that will be applicable, along with any difficult parts of the code that might be difficult to understand for beginning coders. As well as, module 3 was somewhat unorganized (feature 14), so it could definitely be improved just with organization and an understanding from the beginning at what all of the features were, but otherwise that module was conceptually understandable. Another thing that I felt could be improved was the explanation of Matlab code. I had never coded before this course, and while we did an intro for the first lecture, it felt as if we jumped from extremely beginner topics (making an array) to very difficult code (the videomaker in the last module - which would often result in errors) without any explanation of how to understand the difficult topics. It was somewhat discouraging and sometimes made me feel as if I shouldn't be in the course because I felt that I didn't know how to understand the code even after asking a few times\/only having more questions after asking for help. We would only hold \"office hour\" sessions when an assignment was first distributed, which while helpful, would be more useful closer to the due date since often I would not be able to form legitimate questions right when the assignment is assigned because I am still trying to go through it and understand it at a basic level myself. In addition, better explanation\/going through some of the sample code and maybe some \"goals\" of what needs to be done for the assignment as a group might be more helpful and make me feel more efficient. It is important for students to be independent and try to understand code, but it becomes extremely inefficient at times as I would sit for hours having no idea what to do\/how to do what I wanted to do. In addition, more feedback on what I did wrong and more timely feedback on the assignments would be helpful to improve on my mistakes in the early assignments. The final project was also a strength of the course as it was a fun time to delve deeper into a topic and really think further about the biophysical concepts and methods of the assignments.",
    "I think the survey nature of the course was a huge strength. Covering 4 different biological systems and types of models was very interesting and kept students involved even if there was one module they didnt find interesting. In addition the course was very accessible to people from all backgrounds. The only weakness I would say is the speed of feedback on code. It would have been nice to get feedback sooner so that improvements could be made to future code for things that that were commonly done like MSD and curve fitting. Also I think having the most difficult module first was challenging and students would have done better if that were the last module.",
    "I thought the introduction to Matlab was very approachable. The computational background for many students varied a lot, but some of the templates were too helpful for me, but each topic was rather short so any longer coding assignments might have been too much. It was nice to cover so many topics with different lecturers.",
    "Weakness: The course was taught by multiple guest lecturers and a bit less organized.",
    "Strengths: Diversity of topics are discussed, preparation of the homework assignments, availability of the TAs Weaknesses: A lot of class time was wasted as just time to ask about how to do the homeworks (entire class periods in fact), some of the lectures for each module were atrocious (poorly planned, horrible presentation skills, etc.), and the Matlab assignments were a bit rudimentary Improvements: Spend more class time presenting useful information and trust that the students will find time to work on homework and ask questions outside of class, provide opportunities for those more experienced with Matlab to complete slightly more advanced assignments in which not all the required functions are given in a nearly completed state."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. I found it to be generally a waste of time - the subjects of the modules tended to cater more towards physicists, with loosely tied or poorly explained biological applications. Coding assignments were a joke, most of the code was written for us and we would change a line or two and hit run. Will be very happy to put this class in the rearview to say the least",
    "I would recommend if there is people with you taking the class. Definitely not a great class to take on alone.",
    "Yes, it was a fun course.",
    "Yes, I believe the concepts learned in this course is applicable to any science field and important to being a fully science literate researcher.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student to improve their Matlab skills and learn about some different topics in biophysics. Although, it did feel as if some PEB students were discouraged from taking the course due to the large gap in Matlab experience of different students. I heard both sides of the spectrum - where inexperienced students felt that they were not equipped to succeed in the course due to not understanding code\/needing significant help to complete assignments. Whereas, I also heard from students that were very experienced in Matlab\/coding in general and felt that the course was too easy for them\/they didn't learn much more than they already knew besides just being introduced to different biophysical topisc. I think somehow bridging this gap would be helpful - maybe working on some assignments in groups to help inexperienced people with the easier parts of assignments and to challenge the more experienced people with the more difficult parts of assignments?",
    "Yes. It was very accessible to students of all backgrounds and a good first class to take to understand how models are useful in studying biological systems and to get an idea of how to implement them.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in PEB. I think even to an experimentalist, having a basic understanding of how to load and plot data in Matlab is really important. I also thought the class was a nice overview of not only topics in PEB, but also the labs available at Yale across different departments doing this type of work.",
    "Yes, if the student needs Matlab coding for future research.",
    "I would, especially if that student has an interest in biophysics but not a lot of Matlab experience. It's a nice introductory\/survey course of biophysics and forces students to develop a basic proficiency in Matlab."
