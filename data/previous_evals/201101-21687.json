   "comments": [
    "Sure, provides an entirely new perspective on something that we deal with every day --- food!",
    "Although I was really excited to take this class, I left disappointed. The structure of the class doesn't lead to any kind of overarching theme or goal, so topics often felt disjointed and unconnected. In addition, Prof Bronwell tends to \"preach\" during lecture, so that I often felt like I was getting his opinion on a subject rather than factual information. The grading of projects and papers can be totally arbitrary - be prepared to get low grades on things you've worked really hard on.",
    "learn about food in its many aspects as it affects our lives...but no i would not recommend it because it is not very entertaining and has more work to be done than necessary",
    "Interesting and the perfect amount of work. Reading response every week (only about a page and on readings OR lecture), midterm, op-ed, final project and final (which is on the last day of class and NOT cumulative)",
    "Great class. Not that much work, but very informative. It deals with virtually every major issue that relates psych to food. Attending the lecturers are must - the reading accompanies them well, but the lecturers provide many new examples that the readings do not go over. The mid-term and exam are very fair and comprehensive. The projects and papers are also grew and worthwhile. A must take class!",
    "I would recommend it. It is not as easy as some people make it out to be, but if you put in the work you will get a good grade. By the end of the semester, things can get repetitive but overall the information is really interesting.",
    "Great class! It will open you eyes about the food world. It is worth waking up early to take this class. The material and workload are very manageable and the professor and the TAs love to help out. The exams are very doable, and a breeze if you show up to lecture (and skin the readings now and then). This is a must take class at Yale! Professor Brownell is the best!",
    "Great course. I almost didn't take it because it was so early in the morning (9:00am) but I am so glad I did. This course really changed the way I see things. That said, the course load was very manageable, and the exams were fair. The readings were mostly very interesting, and the weekly concept sheets were a breeze - basically they're just reading\/lecture responses.",
    "Take it! It's a great class to look at real-world, pressing issues without the academic or intellectual theories to weigh it down.",
    "YES. It will change the way you see the world.",
    "Survey course about aspects of Psychology (mostly), Biology (little) and Politics (towards the end) of food. The psych angle is heavy and that can be dismaying for non-psych students who lean towards the hard sciences or policy. But, the course is a good overview of all the topics, angles, and issues associated with food consumption and production. This may be one of those courses that won't push you to a new career or path of study, but will make you a more educated and worldly person.",
    "I would recommend it, but contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a gut class.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who knows almost nothing about food or food politics. To someone interested in the topic you aren't going to get much out of this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is interesting material, not too much work and a good distribution of grades because no one assignment is worth a ton of your grade.",
    "This is a pretty good class. There are a variety of different assignments, which makes the grading nice--nothing is weighted too heavily. The weekly concept sheets are a bit of a drag, but it's like getting free points if you do them. The exams were fair--all short answer type questions, but straightforward, not tricky. The project can be fun if you choose a good topic. Most lectures were interesting, a little dry at times--this could stand to be a 50 minute class. Kelly Brownell is good--great guy, consistent lectures, engaging.",
    "Take it Credit\/D and you'll be good to go. The midterm and final are very specific.",
    "It's a class in which you might \"learn\" information that seems obvious, but it is presented in a way that sounds interesting rather than redundant. You see the studies that back up certain obvious truths -- of course soda contributes to obesity, but in this class you see studies that correlate that with other health issues and indicators. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Psyc 123 is an interesting class with a very manageable workload (light reading, weekly 1-page reflections, a 650 word Op-Ed, a final project, and two very fair midterms). The material is extremely relevant to life in modern society, but it is pretty straightforward. I already had a strong background in many of the topics covered in the course so lectures could sometimes feel a little dry, but I appreciated the opportunity to take a class with Dr. Brownell, a prominent figure within the world of public health and food policy. I would recommend the class to someone looking for a not very strenuous 5th credit.",
    "This is an interesting class about all aspects of \"food\" in the US. You will study nutrition, production, advertising, the psychology behind it, and many more things. Take this class if you are at all interested because it is a fun and straightforward course. The only negative: 9 am class but Prof Brownwell puts slides online in case you accidentally sleep in. Be prepared: midterm and final are scarily specific, that was the only surprise.",
    "This class is extremely interesting and Professor Brownell is a great lecturer, but beware that there is a lot of assessment for this course: weekly concept sheets on the reading and lectures, a midterm, a final, an op-ed and a final project. If you're prepared to commit to this, take the class.",
    "Definitely take this class! It gives you a new prospective on food and what you can do. The assignments are great and allow you to express your opinion.",
    "If you can wake up at 9 take this course. It is interesting to basically everyone because it involves everything about food and the way it is made. Assignments are graded very easily and tests are straight forward. Dont have to keep up with the reading but you end up doing so in the weekly assignments (which are easy).",
    "Psychology, Biology and the Politics of Food is a huge lecture, but has something for everyone, whether you fall into one of the three majors in its title or not. The material is highly relevant to everyone's lives and is brought to life by Professor Brownell's lecturing. He is one of the country's leading figures on food issues, and its not surprising why when you take this course. There are a lot of assignments for the course, but few are really time-intensive, so don't be scared away by that at the beginning. If you can take this course, definitely take it.",
    "Definitely recommend. Changes your outlook. Not too much work. If you study, and care. you will do well.",
    "Take it!!",
    "Food psychology is a great class. While a lot of the information seems like \"common sense,\" all of the lectures are super interesting and informative, and you definitely come away from the class with a better understanding of today's food environment. It also encourages you to rethink your food choices.",
    "Yes! There are a decent amount of assignments, but none of them are particularly difficult, and the project and the reading responses can actually be quite interesting.",
    "Its not worth waking up this early. The class is interesting but it beats the same points over and over again. Also, unless you know literally nothing about the subject, you'll get bored.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's not too much work, it's very interesting, and the projects are open-ended. Most of the readings aren't necessary, even though he says the exams include information from the readings.",
    "I recommend it, it's a nice easy elective class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's interesting and very applicable to everyday life. I absolutely LOVED this class. The lectures were great and Professor Brownell is AMAZING. He seems like such a genuine person and that he truly loves what he is doing and is involved in this public health movement.",
    "If you're prepared for the work and are interested in the subject, take it. It's interesting, but a bit repetitive. Also, Professor Brownell can be quite biased at times in lecture.",
    "Good class, pretty interesting. A lot of the material is pretty intuitive, but there are also some pretty surprising facts. Professor Brownell pushes his own agenda a little too hard at times, but you will learn a lot about the food industry, obesity, nutrition, and food politics. Go to the lectures, but you can probably skip most of the reading.",
    "Good 5th class. Interesting (although can get repetitive) and applicable.",
    "Take this course. It is interesting, fun, and informative. It is an awesome class.",
    "I recommend this class. It covers an interesting topic and really makes you think about what you eat.",
    "This class is definitely recommended. The workload is very manageable and the topic itself is so interesting, whether you are interested in science, humanities, philosophy or other. Some of the information is very common sense but thatinformation is well tied into other broader terms that put the information in a new light.",
    "I recommend this course if you're interested in food politics and like to read books by Pollan and Nestle. It covers a broad range of food-related topics, as indicated by the title, giving you a taste of almost everything. While it's nice that the final for this class is before finals week, it also means that you'll have a very busy last few weeks for this course (since many things are due close to each other).",
    "This was an excellent course, perhaps the best I have taken at Yale. The material is so important for everyone to know. Take it!",
    "I would take this class if you have the chance.",
    "If you want to take a quick survey of a wide variety of topics from individual food decisions to public health, take this class. Some lectures are more interesting than others but because each topic is covered so briefly, you learn a lot and don't ever feel bogged down.I think this was overall one of the most organized courses I have ever taken, there is a clear syllabus and samples provided for most assignments. Not a lot of work, but there is no curve.",
    "if you are at all interested in food systems or any aspect of contemporary food issues, take this class. the interconnections in the field are highlighted well, and even though it can sometimes seem fluffy, remember that it is essentially an intro.\/survey class and take from it what you can - there is definitely stuff there for those who look.",
    "The topics in this class are very interesting. Sometimes lecture could put me to sleep but I would recommend it because of the relevant content.",
    "Meh.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Food is an interesting topic and you get to see it in different perspectives. It might change you diet or not but you will learn a lot about it.",
    "Yes - it's one of the best lectures I've taken at Yale, despite weekly concept sheets for the first 2\/3 of the semester.",
    "Yes",
    "Yea, easy class",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's not a heavy workload, and it's really relevant to everyday life. Kelly Brownell is also a god. And food policy is really really awesome.",
    "Yes, very interesting class.",
    "It\u0092s a class about all the aspects of food, and you will learn about where our current system is and where it could be headed. A lot of the information is in the news or intuitive, but it is nice to have a concrete layout from a professor who knows a lot about the issue.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in Food Policy, Sustainable Agriculture, or the American Food Environment, especially if they're looking for a good Cr\/D. The lecture can sometimes lack focus, and as a psychology student I was a little disappointed in the \"psychology\" aspect of the course but overall, this was a very worthwhile and interesting class. Not too much work, and definitely interesting.",
    "I would definitely NOT recommend the class to freshman. Upper division students interested in the topic might find it interesting.",
    "Very fair course, concept sheets due every week that forces you to do the reading, but not a very heavy reading workload. Be careful though, it's not really a gut - getting an A requires work and you need to go to class at least most of the time.",
    "Great for a 5th class! It's pretty low stress, with a very small amount of reading, though there are a lot of annoying little projects such as a weekly 2 page concept sheet. The information is very relevant but also easy to understand. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in food, the politics of food in the United States, and food psychology. I actually enjoyed the lectures and looked forward to each one, though it was at 9am on Mondays.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any students who are interested in food and the issues related to food- obesity, poverty, agriculture, food policy, etc. This course provides so much interesting information that is so relevant to our daily lives.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. it really made me think deeper about foods and where they come from. However, be warned that is is a lot of work-- a midterm, final, final project, op ed, concept sheets every week. It's not an easy A. The class is curved so that a grade like 95% is an A. Its a great 9am class.",
    "Great class about food. Take it!",
    "As someone who has never studied any sort of food policy, the organic movement, the farm revolution, the material presented in this course was very interesting. Although I learned a lot, I do think the material presented in the class could have been presented in about half a semester. The class was very repetitive sometimes. That said, the material itself is not very hard at all. You do have a reading response due every week, a ten page paper or project at the end, an op-ed to submit to a publication, a midterm and a final. A large volume of work, but again, not too hard. Beware, as usual, of lecture classes though! Not a guaranteed A.",
    "If it's at 9am don't take it...otherwise take it!",
    "You're going to know everything that is taught. It's pretty common sense, but nevertheless still interesting. Pretty easy class, a lot of little assignments. Definitely take as your \"gut\" class for the semester.",
    "Worth knowing the information and putting in the work because it's not that hard at all and you'll actually learn something",
    "Yes, if you like any of Michael Pollan's books or documentaries like Food Inc or Supersize Me.",
    "The work load is deceiving-- you think it is going to be really easy and its not. Its not the hardest class by any means but if you want a decent grade you should probably go to class, though you don't have to do the readings. The topic is really really interesting!",
    "Definitely take it. It's a very interesting and relevant class. Great instruction and fascinating material.",
    "I recommend this class if you are at all interested in the growing importance of food policies and politics in the United States. You don't have to be a health nut, global health nut, or even want to go into politics - it's just interesting stuff to know about our country and where it is headed in terms of food and agriculture. Not too difficult, applicable to today, and actually interesting. The weekly concept sheets get a bit annoying, but they keep you from falling behind and take no more than 20-30 minutes each week.",
    "Take a more specialized classes if genuinely interested in material, Take this class if your just looking for another interesting credit with good grade potential (then, if you make that second decision, reassess your yale experience)This Class was a broad survey class--- which to me automatically means boooring. but Food is my biggest passion in life so I was intrigued nonetheless. THIS is a great class if you have no experience with food issues, however if Like me, food issues is your specialty, this class was pretty boooring.",
    "Worth taking. Not hard, and really interesting.",
    "A great class--really interesting, not too much work, and actually important. I think everyone should know all of this stuff. Definitely recommend.",
    "Very interesting material. straightforward intro level class. exams focus on lectures and the reading simply repeats the lecture. There's some tedious busy-work, but it's not difficult. The class is very fun and has a good curve. one of my favorite classes in my four years at yale.",
    "Take this class whether you are a psych major or not. But don't be fooled into thinking it's a gut class. There is an enormous amount of work: 3 tests, weekly 1-2 page concept sheets, op-ed, AND a final project. If you don't go to lecture you will not only be missing out, you will be missing out on test concepts.",
    "Loved it! It was probably one of my favorite classes this semester. The material is really interesting and relevant to any student. The lectures were well prepared. The busy work could be cut down a bit. But otherwise, really great class. Also, an easy class... tests and work was VERY leniently graded, and you don't really have to do the readings. Interesting material, easy grading, what's not to love? If you like food at all, if you EAT, take this class!",
    "Not as awesome as the course title sounds! Pretty dry\/boring lectures, exams cover a TON of material, and there are weekly responses",
    "Wonderful course. Not very difficult, relevant to today's issues, and exciting.",
    "A truly informative, exciting, and important class to have at Yale! I learned so much over the course of the semester, and could not have been more pleased with my decision to take the class. Kelly Brownell presented each lecture in an extremely clear and understandable fashion, bringing out all of the many nuances of the subject and helping direct us to find out own standpoint on the issues and ways that we can get involved in the areas that we have a special interest. I definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested--it is truly inspiring!",
    "YES TAKE IT.",
    "It's a gut, but it's an okay class. Since it's at 9AM it can be tough. If you're looking for an extra class, take it. Otherwise it might feel like a waste of time.",
    "Take it. You learn a lot and everything is very interesting, plus it is not very stressful.",
    "This class is a broad overview of many of the problems facing our current food system, from health, government, and environmental perspectives. I would recommend this class because the topic is important and everyone should have the basic knowledge provided by this class.",
    "Very relevant for any major, gives a great overview on the state of food in the US and provides the opportunity for more in depth learning on a variety of topics.",
    "If you are looking for a class to help you in life problems and situations with food, take it",
    "It's an overview of the food market and food-related issues around the world. I would definitely recommend this class for someone interested in psych, econ, health, anything. It's fairly easy if you put in the effort and quite rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to everyone regardless if you know anything or care about the topic because this class will help you see food in a whole new way and make you think about things that you never knew had that much of an impact on our daily food choices. I think that this class was super enjoyable, the work was fun and not overwhelming, the exams were straightforward, and overall you will learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. As promised, it covers a wide range of topics (economics, environment, marketing, etc.) all related to food. It may sound like a lot of work, but there is no section, the readings are basically optional, and the grading is lenient. The only problem is that it is at 9am, but I advise going to lecture as the material sticks and makes studying for the exams easier.",
    "Absolutely. This class is essential to your life, if nothing else.",
    "This is a wonderful class. It is engaging and informative and explores all different aspects of food. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. Like any other class, this one has its drawbacks (long lectures, early start time and quite a bit of work), but I can say it is worth it. This class will expose you to issues you did not even know existed. It will question your positions and it will encourage you to go out and make a difference in whatever way possible.",
    "If you're interested in any aspect of food, take this class. It's definitely not a gut class, but if you want to learn more about food and eating, sustainability, agriculture, obesity, etc., the readings are not hard (and in fact often very interesting). The lectures are good - Professor Brownell is very well renowned in the field and knows what he's talking about. Even if you're not necessarily interested in sustainability, and more interested in things like the Food Network (like me), you'll take away a lot from this class.",
    "take this class! its really interesting, the work is evenly spaced out, and you will learn so much",
    "No. If you are interested in this stuff, chances are you already know everything that will be said in this course. It's just a series of showy facts. Nothing you can't find out with two hours of googling.",
    "take this class",
    "good class but a lot of material is intuitive. lecture slides are so comprehensive that there is no real need to go to class.",
    "I definitely recommend this course for a fellow student. I loved this class, and would definitely would retake it in a heart beat. It's a topic that is very unique and not always talked about. The exposure to new material is great and eye-opening.",
    "It's a terrific class. A lot of assignments, but the workload is manageable if you keep up with the class, attending lecture and doing some reading. What's great about this class is that it's about extremely relevant contemporary issues, with the obesity crisis being such a pervasive problem in this country. I can honestly say that the class changed my thinking about particular issues in a significant way.",
    "interesting class but there were a lot of assignments toward the end of the semester that could have been spread out more. it has a lot of busy work. however, the material is relevant to everyone and while it could get redundant at times, i still came away learning new things.",
    "Take it! Easy.",
    "VERY interesting and relevant, and not too hard. The only drawback is that it's at 9 in the morning, but then the lecture slides are always posted so it's not hard to do well even if you skip lectures",
    "This class was my most fun and practically useful class this semester. It covers a lot of topics, but they are all interesting and you see them pop up in your daily life once you're made aware of them. The only weakness is that it's a lecture without section, which means you are told a lot of things but not given the opportunity to talk about them. Then again, I guess that could be a strength, too.",
    "Good course but don't take it unless its a topic that you're very interested in.",
    "Every student should take this course! It enriched my relationship with food and broadened my vision for what is possible with food. It did all this in a painless way. The professor is kind and innovative.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 123 to another student. The lectures were all really interesting and eye-opening. Brownell presents issues in a way the allows you to place yourself in the context of the issue so that you understand just how severe it is. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Yes, but only if you are actually interested in the material. You can also learn everything that he talks about throughout the course by watching the documentary Food, Inc.",
    "This course is aptly named - it is survey of the biology, psychology, and politics of food.",
    "Take this class. It's interesting and the work load is very manageable.",
    "Absolutely recommend it.",
    "Yes. Awesome class.",
    "I would recomend it because the issues it discusses are very prevalent today.",
    "A really good overview of a largely important issue in America. Professor Brownell is an international leader in the field, but I think the lectures could've been a little bit better. The tests were very broad, and there was a lot ofbusy work at the end of the semester.",
    "This was a solid course because the material was interesting, but the grading was rather difficult and the cutoff for every grade was raised a percent and the class was not curved. So prepare for a possibly unideal grade. Not a super difficult course though. A lot of the course is about obesity, which was somewhat undermined for me by the size of the professor. He is a case for why education doesn't work, since he probably knows more about the \"toxic food environment\" than anyone else, and yet it doesn't do a thing to help him avoid obesity.",
    "I would recommend it because the information is good to know.",
    "Yes, good class but watch out because although all the content seems very logical, it can be a bit difficult to regurgitate on the exams.",
    "This course is very interesting and the work load is manageable. I found the work to be manageable because the assignments are very open to one's own opinion about a certain controversial or current topic in the food world- there is a lot of room for different interpretations. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it taught me a lot about the real world and I learned a lot of valuable lessons that apply to my life and the current affairs that are occurring in the world today.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone at all interested in food...so anyone who eats, pretty much! As a learning experience (other than just learning facts that changed my worldview) it wasn't so great, as I didn't feel like the course had a project other than getting us informed\/excited about a set of issues...there was no feedback or method being taught, etc, which was disappointing.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! It sounds interesting, but it is NOT. It is only about the politics of food, which as a poli sci major, I would rather learn about important and relevant bills if we're going to focus on politics. The grading seemed to be completely random if not a bit unfair. The tests seemed to pose trick questions, (a midterm and a final) whole pages dedicated to things we covered in one slide during lecture. The final completely missed the topics we spent extensive time covering in class, and instead focused on random thinks like bio stories told to us by a guest lecturer (not even about food). On our opinion editorials, three different grades were assigned to papers that received the same exact comments word for word. They grading scale rounds DOWN. Overall, this class is not worth taking at 9 am.",
    "Yes I would. 9 a.m is early but the class is interesting and worthwhile.",
    "Not highly recommended. Course material is somewhat basic -- nothing you couldn't learn from a well-written book.",
    "This is a high-school level course. The topics, I think, are fascinating and relevant. That being said, they are presented in an extremely superficial and biased manner as Professor Brownell races to cover just about every topic related to food, and ultimately fails at covering any of them in-depth. It's a really, really, really easy course, but not a very rewarding one.",
    "Take it. It's not a gut class. There are a lot of assignments and the grading can be a bit harsh. But take it.",
    "yea if you are willing to get up and go to class at 9am...",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, it is very applicable to our lives and is especially informative when coming out of college or moving off campus when you have to start buying and cooking your own meals.",
    "Take it. Well taught by a super-star professor, and always interesting. There are a lot of assignments, but you can have fun with them and they are graded SUPER EASILY.",
    "You learn about the psychology, biology, and politics of food-- however, you spend the majority of the time on the politics, history, and modern controversies on food.I loved this class and definitely reccommend taking it. It teaches you about several looming and upcoming problems facing this world",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in nutrition, agriculture, and the food industry. The weekly concept sheets and the final project and op-ed can get tedious, but the more you put into the assignments, the more you'll probably get out of them. The subject is interesting, although it can at times be pretty vague, and is extremely pertinent to daily life and current affairs.",
    "I found this class interesting and quite easy. It really does teach you a lot about the food industry, and makes you think about your food. Very clear political slant so don't take it if that would bother you.",
    "This is an easy fifth class, though don't expect to learn a lot of new material if you consider yourself a foodie-environmentalist.",
    "The class description is slightly deceptive, and while many of these lectures seem to repeat the same things over and over, they still manage to put questions on the test that you can't remember the answers to. This class was very broad but managed to focus the most of its lectures on political aspects. The concept sheets (weekly responses) were graded VERY arbitrarily, depending on the TA that was grading you (changing each week). Having it at 9am Mondays was pretty rough, but there were definitely some interesting lectures",
    "This course provides a broad overview of issues relating to food, especially its production, consumption, and regulation. The workload is not heavy, except for a few weeks near the end of the semester when there are an Op-Ed, a final project, and a final exam in rapid succession. This course is also one of a few at Yale that may change your personal life as well as your academic life. Its focus on food certainly got me thinking more closely about my diet, and I do not think I am the only one to have been personally impacted by Professor Brownell\u0092s instruction. If you are interested in the psychology, biology, OR politics of food, take this course. You\u0092ll find that the aspects of food that you might not have thought much about are as interesting as the aspects that you have experience with."
