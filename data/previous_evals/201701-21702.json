    "I learnt how to look at an image or video and objectively analyze it.",
    "I learned about the Olympic Games through a lot more lenses than I believed possible: economic, political, historical, gendered...",
    "This class had a lot of very interesting conversations that i genuinely talked about with other so many people outside of the class. It's not just the Olympics as a sporting event - it's all of the politics and social movements alongside it that have been so important in human history.",
    "I loved the amount of class participation in the course and how Professor Syrimis encouraged the class to share personal anecdotes and connections. This was an interesting way to approach the history of something that is still ongoing in the present in addition to a great way to build a strong community with the students. Really interesting readings and discussions.",
    "I immensely enjoyed this course! We learned a great deal about the Ancient and Modern Olympics. The Olympic tradition is emblematic of many aspects of society. The politics and various implications of the Olympics are very interesting and intriguing.",
    "great introduction into the historical and cultural context of the Olympic Games",
    "Most of the time we think of the Olympics as a fun event that is based on ancient tradition. However, this class taught me how to look at the games through a controversial, critical lens.",
    "I think I learned a lot about improving as a writer."

    "I think the power point presentations could have been more concise in some weeks, although that is on the students, not the professor. The best ones were where each slide was fairly bare (perhaps one quote) that sparked a good discussion. Ones full of text that the speaker lectured at us weren't as good.",
    "I really have no complaints about the class! The material was fun and Professor Syrimis was great about being available for feedback and understanding of schedules. A really interesting seminar that generated great discussion.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the seminar-style for this class. Everyone had a lot to contribute, and it was a very worthwhile course. I honestly wish there would be more class time because a large majority of the class was dedicated to the presentations. The presentations were very interesting, but I wish there was additional time dedicated to group discussions.",
    "I loved having discussion about such a popular topic through a different lens. It was really fun to hear different athletes talk about their sports.",
    "Reasonable workload combined with really interesting class discussions"

    "This is a neat discussion seminar that is especially bolstered by the viewpoints of athletes who are drawn to the course. The material transcends sports, and you get to analyze the ancient and modern Games through various lenses. The reading level is on par for a seminar. There are 2 main papers as well as a presentation which is fairly relaxed and conversational. Professor Syrimis is great: he's not afraid to contradict your ideas, which helps to change your perspective.",
    "I definitely recommend this class! The conversations in seminar were very interesting and the material is super fun and relevant. The essays took more effort than I expected, but I found it worth it.",
    "If you're interested in sports, take this class! Professor Syrimis is an amazing discussion leader, and you get the chance to talk about really interested subjects relating to the Olympics and athletics in general. The syllabus includes a lot of visual media in addition to fascinating readings, and the professor is both engaging and understanding. Although the 9:25 start time may scare some people away, I can't emphasize enough how much this class is worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! I enjoyed the subject material so very much. Professor Syrimis was an excellent instructor, and the class discussions were always interesting.",
    "Yes! Take this course because it is fun and interesting. Professor Syrimis is so passionate and informative about every topic we cover and he allows students to learn so much about a popular topic.",
    "Yes- take it"
