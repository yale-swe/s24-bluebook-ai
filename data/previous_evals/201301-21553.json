    "AWESOME CLASS! If you are at all interested in medicine, the human body, mechanics, etc. take this class. Once you get through the intro lectures, it is all hands-on lab experience - basically how do YOU learn to recognize the structures. Lots of memorization, but not in a bad way as class time is entirely devoted to learning the bone structures. Tests are pretty straight forward and not hard to do well on if you study. AND you get a plastic, full-size skeleton to take home!!Overview: You learn the major bones, bone structures, and muscle attachments for the entire skeleton in 4 units: skull, axial skeleton, upper extremity, lower extremity",
    "ANTH 464 is a laboratory-based course that providesa through overview of the skeleton and an in-depth look at its osteological features. You will get to handle human remains and you will learn a lot. It's an extraordinary class. There are two exams and two quizes, and the material can be demanding. Most bones have many features, and you will often be asked to identify the bone, side it, identify it's specific features, and recall what muscle inserts or originates at that part of the bone. By the end of the course you will have worked with all bones in the human body, and you will be able to estimate age, sex, and ancestry based on osteological indicators. Professor Sargis and Stephen Chester are wonderful and very knowledgable. I highly recommend this course.",
    "definitely recommended. you learn all the bones in the body and most muscle attachments. it's all just memorization for the two exams and two quizzes, but most of the information will come in handy if you're pre-med, into archaeology, or some related field. the professor is great, always there to answer questions, and you go at your own pace with learning the material",
    "Human osteology was a phenomenal course - it is a true Yale gem. We learned about every bone in the human body, their features and functions, and about their associated nerves, blood vessels, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and articulations. This class was very hands-on, and working with human specimens was a truly special experience. This class was fun and easy-going, but still required us to acquire a large amount of knowledge. The exams are in-class lab practicals (i.e., you have tough specimens before you and you have to identify tagged features fordifferent bones in different stations as you move throughout the room), which makes this class very different and generally less stressful than most other courses. Overall this class was very enjoyable and a great experience. If you want to learn in-depth human anatomy and are comfortable working with human specimens, this will be one of your most memorable Yale courses!",
    "If you're an anthropology or archaeology major, take the class. If you're a biology or pre-med major and want to learn skeletal and muscular anatomy, take the class. If you like the TV show Bones, definitely take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - it's not too much of a workload until exam\/quiz times, but even when you've exams\/quizzes, the class is still fun and intriguing.",
    "TAKE ITIt's hard to get in, beware, but that's for a reason. This is literally the best class.",
    "TAKE IT!! Not easy but a great fun class. Very self directed",
    "Memorizing names of bones and some of their functions",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The professor and TA make it a ton of fun, and I enjoyed every class. Plus, now when I watch Bones I understand so much more!",
    "Yes, Human Osteology was a great course: very organized and structured, fantastic instructor and TA, fair exams and quizzes, and manageable workload. In the class, you will learn about every bone in the body and be able to identify different portions of these bones using real specimens! Class time is a free-form lab course and was fun and enjoyable.",
    "Definitely take e course if interested in human anatomy.",
    "Prof. Sargis (and Stephen, don't know if he'll teach this class next year) are amazing instructors. You will learn so much from this class. It's not an easy course, but it's very fair. You might have a hard time getting in if you're not a junior or senior.",
    "Human Osteology is a fun course that is sort of between anthropology and biology. The course is comprised almost exclusively of learning the major features of every bone in the human body. On average, there is one lecture every few weeks, while all other class sessions are self-guided labs using real human samples. Prof. Sargis is very helpful and enjoyable to work with. The workload is low, and exams and quizzes are extremely straight-forward. This is a good senior year course, since it's not difficult and most of the material can be learned in class. Take it if you have a chance!",
    "Take this class--it's entirely lab-based and extremely useful. Realize you'll need to do work on your own while in class. Sargis doesn't lecture that much so you need to work with the bones yourself. One of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Yes, definitely. If you're at all interested in this subject, this is an incredible course. Working with real human bones is SO COOL.",
    "ANTH 464 is structured around memorizing structures of the human body. Moving from head to toe in a systematic, well-organized way, you learn a lot of details about various bumps and grooves on the human skeleton. Some muscular functionality is discussed, but this is a memorization-heavy course to give you a chance to learn the basics of human body structure. Great course, would recommend for anyone interested in learning more about why humans look the way we do. Both premeds and non-premeds can easily appreciate this class.",
    "If you are an archaeology major, this class is a must. I feel very confident now about identifying bones in the field, even small fragments. The class doesn't go into great depth about the interpretation of the bones (sexing, ancestry, etc.), but you do get a taste of it at the end. The specimens that Yale has also provide a unique opportunity to study osteology with a diverse collection. If you don't need this class for your major, but are looking for a social science credit, be prepared for a lot of memorization. I'd still recommend it over other social science classes since the teacher is fantastic and at the end you will feel like you know a lot more about the material than you did going in.",
    "take it!!!!!! Definitely recommend...if you study hard and put in the lab time you will do well and learn a lot."
