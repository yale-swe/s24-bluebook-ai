    "DS Spring philosophy is a continuation of DS Fall philosophy. The texts mostly deal with skepticism.",
    "This was my favorite class all year -- we covered a lot of really interesting topics in a methodical way, and it raises a lot of fascinating questions. This is also the class that I feel improved my writing the most this year; having to write a clear and concise essay on some of these authors requires a great amount of effort and thought, but you will exit the course being much better able to write an essay on almost any subject. Professor Elliott was a great section professor who clarified issues but also allowed a lot of time for in-class discussion and exploration of ideas.",
    "Second semester Philosophy is perhaps one of the most difficult DS classes. People like Descartes, Berkeley, and Kant wrote very interesting, but incredibly complicated works. Professor Elliott, however, does a really good job pushing you to understand the material. He has high standards, but they are so clearly laid out that you learn a lot as you rise to meet them.",
    "Professor Elliott makes an immense effort to bring clarity when dealing with immensely complex ideas. He is always summarizing arguments and making use of the black-board to outline a philosopher's ideas. I found this immensely helpful. His comments are insightful and I only wish that he played an even more active role in directing the discussion. Meeting with him to discuss ideas for each of my three papers was always helpful. He isaccessible and wonderful to talk to if you are experiencing difficulties with a text.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it is an appetizer of sorts for philosophy and the readings are interesting",
    "fascinating texts--perhaps the best in the DS syllabus. sections vary greatly by professor",
    "More or less the same as first semester DS philosophy. Be prepared to do more reading, and to have some more abstract concepts to deal with. DS is worth seeing through to the end! Don't be discouraged if you are not assigned to an actual professor, the postdocs in the department are just as amazing!",
    "For all the reasons mentioned above: choose Elliott! and directed studies!"
