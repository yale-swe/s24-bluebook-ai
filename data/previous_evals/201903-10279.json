   "comments": [
    "This class teaches so much history, focusing on traditionally ignored narratives. It is very balanced between the history of African Americans and the history of health in the US. You'll be shocked at how little you knew about these topics, and will gain a whole new perspective on the world. The course is very broad, and covers a long and difficult history from the slave trade to the BLM movement. The content is interesting, the readings are a good mix of primary and secondary sources.",
    "I learned that this country is founded upon the backs of enslaved individuals and slave labor. Without slavery, America would not be in the place it is in, whether that means economic prosperity at the expense of black bodies or the racial issues that still persist in modern society.",
    "I learned so much that I could probably never learn in any other course at Yale. I have learned that there is a lot more that goes on in terms of health, interactions of people and societal dynamics that should be made aware. This will definitely shape me in my future career and make me ask the questions that many people may be afraid to ask now. This is a must take course!",
    "Amazing course all around. Low stakes way of involving yourself in deep discussions of African-American history and the idea of sickness and health in marginalized communities in the past and today.",
    "It justifies radicalism - the injustices marginalized communities face begins with slavery... This class just blew my mind about how I perceive the world.",
    "Every student at Yale should take this course. It's a fundamental history course that needs to replace the history that we've learned about the US throughout grade school. You will learn how systemic discrimination is present in nearly every single part of our lives and systems that we live, work, and engage in.",
    "This course is amazing. It challenged me intellectually to come to terms with and grasp the deep-rooted effects of slavery and the ongoing persecution. This is the first class at Yale to change me, and change the way I see the world. I will carry the lessons i learned from Professor Roberts with me forever and I truly believe this class has opened my world view for the better.",
    "I learned a lot about how health can be an important vector for studying social relations.",
    "this was THE BEST class I've taken at yale. I was initially attracted to it because of the high prof rating, low workload, and content but it completely blew my mind and expectations. EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE THIS COURSE. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED, ESPECIALLY FOR MED STUDENTS OR ANYONE INTERESTED IN GOING INTO HEALTH. this class will make you rethink all of your biases and give you space to evaluate the abuse of black people like never before.",
    "This class is the most eye-opening and best class I have so far taken at Yale. There are hardly words to describe the impact that this class has had on my life and on my future. I not only developed knowledge of 400 years worth of black history, but I also have also gained a deeper understanding of the relationship between history and the present.",
    "I learned so much about the black community and the history of its struggles in the medical field (and in society in general).",
    "I learned a great deal of African American history which has made me much more aware of the struggles that black people have faced and continue to face. It was definitely eye-opening to read first-hand narratives told by enslaved persons that are largely ignored.",
    "This was an incredible class. The material covered in this class is something that is often omitted from any history, public health, or bioethics course despite it being very relevant. You learn how to trace present-day issues with race and medicine back to their roots. It is a difficult course to take in that the material is very heavy, but it is probably the most important material with which I will leave Yale. The assignments make you critically think and present you with opportunities to engage with the material in personally important ways.",
    "We learned all about African American history from the Atlantic slave trade all the way to 2019, through the lens of medicine and health. We went in depth about the injustices that slaves, newly freed slaves, and black Americans faced and continue to face in the healthcare system and in general. This class has changed the way that I see healthcare and has opened my eyes to biases that exist and has inspired me to do more to spread the word to eliminate these biases.",
    "I learned about ways the African American community has been exploited throughout history and how that legacy continues today and follows people of color into their medical and professional and everyday interactions. I've learned about how racial science was something created to enforce the idea that black people were inferior. I've learned about the physical and mental effects of racism and things that we can do to combat these harmful attitudes and stereotypes and live a more mindful life.",
    "This course taught me so much about the history of public health in the US. It sharpened my empathetic tools, learned how to actively listen, and learned how to read historical texts.",
    "I learned about the history of African-American health and medicine in ways that history textbooks and prior courses never dared to venture into before. I learned how to take my academic experience into my own hands, how to dive into topics that mean something to me, and how to be a compassionate, active, dedicated learner. I also gained valuable insights into the history of abuse in medicine and am compelled to do something to change it.",
    "I have gained so much from this course it is hard to even explain it in words. Such a dynamic thought provoking course everyone entering medicine should be exposed too.",
    "I learned about racism in health, law, education, and many other fields. It was a great class for learning the facts and evidence to back up things you've seen\/thought before.",
    "The class is a historical survey on issues of black health and the place of African Americans within the American medical system, beginning from the slave trade and ending with contemporary issues. It taught a lot about dark parts of American history, but also about moving stories of perseverance and resistance among black individuals and communities.",
    "This course was so amazing! I learned so much about African American history through a lens that you don't get in other courses. I learned about the history of slavery and its impact on healthcare of African American people and how those inequalities continue to exist today. We analyzed historical texts and wrote essays that tied class material with our own interests.",
    "I learned about the many ways that our history of slavery and racism has impacted the health and lives of African Americans in the U.S. today.",
    "Survey course of African American health from slavery to present.",
    "Class teaches students through a lens of sensitivity and empathy",
    "The main take away from this class is how African Americans have been and continue to be abused by American medicine. This class changed the way I think about and understand race in the US.",
    "- how to write a historical paper - how to re-approach life with a new perspective given the terrible history of chattel slavery in the United States - learned how to better analyze primary source documents",
    "Greatly increased knowledge of the history behind the inequalities and injustices in our healthcare system, among other issues affecting African Americans.",
    "Insight into historical aspects that aren't covered in other history classes. Learning to be socially sensitive and see how racial bias impacts society and individuals today.",
    "I learned to question things that I had never considered. I learned how to examine primary sources and think critically. The assessments Made me think creatively about the material.",
    "It was an amazing course!!! 100% recommend",
    "I learned an overview of how African American people have had to deal with medicine and health throughout American history (from the slave trade to the present).",
    "I learned an incredible amount from this course and I cannot recommend it enough. I learned about the transatlantic slave trade and its influence on pharmaceutical companies. I learned about various epidemics during early America and how African Americans helped.",
    "THIS CLASS SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR ALL YALE STUDENTS. I learned so much about something so integral to America that it made me feel cheated by my high school education. This class taught me history, but more than that, it has changed the way that I see the world today.",
    "Too much to describe here. You will learn so much about the the black experience and find connections between that and every oppressed minority group in the world. There are so many lessons to take away and so much to learn. You get as much as you put in. And even if the only effort you put in is going to lecture, your life will be changed.",
    "This course was a comprehensive delve into 400+ years of history. We analyzed how health, medicine, and sickness is inextricably tied to the slave trade and racist systems of injustice. We were taught how to appreciate material for its importance, not just because we would be tested on it, and made to critically analyze our own role in these systems.",
    "Learned about healthcare from a completely new perspective that needed to be understood Incredible class",
    "I learned more about the history of the practice of medicine in this country than I ever had in any other class. I also learned how most of the problems caused by racism remain unresolved or are becoming worse in some cases.",
    "I feel this perspective and knowledge that I have developed will assist me in every single class I take at Yale. This is not because the content of the course applies directly to other courses, but because the content of this course applies directly to me. I understand myself, my family, and my friends circumstances way better now. This has not only given me clarity, but optimism in combating these issues with those I care about. This class has given me motivation to push forward and I sure am glad I took it. It has reminded and taught me a bit about who I am. That is a man who is very glad to have taken this class.",
    "So much about the history of medicine and public health of black and African-American people! I can't even begin to start listing what I learned - there's just so much. I really appreciated the ability to use the lens of health to examine racial injustice and its continued negative effects on black and African-American people today. It may be the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "This course provides a comprehensive look at the intersection of African American history and health. It explores topics that you might not initially perceive as affecting health, and shows how in reality, they are inextricably related to the condition of black health in America.",
    "This course covers a broad range of American history (from the beginning of global circumnavigation to the 21st century) but looks very specifically at the intersection of black history and medical history. We began with the study of the medicines, illnesses, and doctors present on slave ships and traveled to medical experimentation on the plantation. From there, we studied the first black doctors, the stealing of black bodies for autopsies in America's earliest medical schools, the history of reproductive justice and black women's health, war and black health, and the effects of racism on physical and mental health. The interdisciplinary nature of the course allowed us to ask a lot of unique questions and resulted in looking in a lot of unique places for answers. We engaged with primary historical documents, images, books, journal papers, videos, and news articles all at the same time. The course also has a wide variety of assignments that challenge you to think about history in different ways (a critical analysis paper, a sample syllabus, an op-ed, and a free-written final essay).",
    "I gained so much knowledge from this class. Professor Roberts did an amazing job of going through such a long period of time in African American History.",
    "I learned invaluable history and read amazing works, learned how history can be used as concrete evidence for social change, and learned how to question one-sided, or single stories that are frequently presented in other classes.",
    "I learned to examine history more critically, to recognize parallels between history and the present, and to explore the intersections of race and health in a more thorough and enlightening way. I also learned how to write in different styles (traditional essay, op-ed essay, lesson plan), which helped me engage with the course in really exciting ways.",
    "Insight into the historical struggle of African Americans and how we still have a long way to go!",
    "Thinking critically about the extremely painful history of black health in the US. Thinking critically about race.",
    "Opened my eyes to a new perspective that was certainly hard to hear at times, but one I am incredibly happy to now know about.",
    "In taking this course, I learned how to ask difficult questions and have conversations about complex topics. I learned about using history to address current issues and inequalities as well as presenting this information and these observations in writing and aloud. Additionally, I learned about facilitating conversations not in academic settings and the importance of giving communities a voice.",
    "Medical racism; social justice in healthcare",
    "This class taught me so much about the lives of Africans and African Americans throughout slavery and into today. I learned about the medical and political issues associated with their livelihoods and came to a better understanding of how slavery and racism have shaped (and continue to shape) our lives as people of color.",
    "How history is not divorced from the present and how you can see\/prove that through tracking medicine in Af\/Am history and linking that to health disparities today",
    "So much!!! Such an amazing and thought-provoking overview of, well, sickness and health in African-American history. I talk about this class all of the time and will continue to, I'm sure. I gained so much knowledge and a greater understanding of why medical discrimination exists.",
    "I learned about the history of African American health pre antebellum, health activism, the effects of scientific racism in healthcare today,",
    "Every single thing in this class has fundamentally changed how I view the world and how I will approach my future. Absolutely amazing. This is an experience I will not forget. It redefined every single thing I thought I knew about history and you learn a significant amount you will likely never learn elsewhere. The readings were phenomenal.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the history of African Americans and its legacies today, particularly in relation to health and medicine. Everything in this course was so eye-opening; I felt like every lecture brought a whole new perspective and taught me so many new things.",
    "Sickness & Health is by far the best course I have ever taken. As a large lecture, I did not expect to feel so connected to a group of students and a professor as I found myself feeling this semester. This course spanned over 400 years of history of black people in America, and helped contextualize the issues of prejudice and racism that we still see today, both culturally and in healthcare.",
    "I learned to analyze difficult histories and connect historical states of economics, social systems, and laws to our present state.",
    "This course truly nuanced my thinking about medicine and its role in society. This course put everything I learn about in my pre-med classes in a new and very important context that I would have never learned without this class. Much of what Professor Roberts teaches us is newly consolidated or new research that she or one of her colleagues performed recently. The course assignment format encouraged me to look for myself at the ways discrimination affects so many populations in healthcare, and caused me to be more critical about my outlook on treatment and healthcare practices overall. This course truly changed the way I think about medicine and has opened my eyes in a gentle but firm way no other class has!!",
    "This course provided a historical overview of the experiences of black people in the US medical system, from the slave trade to the present. It provided insight for the underlying reasons behind current racial health disparities and barriers to overcoming them.",
    "I gained a lot more knowledge about the history of African-American people that I have never had before. This is a super insightful and enlightening class.",
    "the history of racism and slavery as it pertains to the health of african americans.",
    "This class should be mandatory for pre-meds. I learned so much about the history of black people as it pertains to the medical industry in the United States. As a pre-med student, this class has completely changed the way I see medical school and the medical establishment and how I want to approach my career as a doctor.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in this course. It was the best class I've taken at Yale and perhaps the best course I have ever taken my entire life. The materials were gut-wrenching. The course overall has enhanced my knowledge and understanding about medicine and public health especially from a racial justice perspective and what it means to be an ally to Black and brown people. It was definitely an informative experience, and knowing that I have an opportunity to apply what I learned about the intimate connections between racism, slavery, and health in my work as a public health professional, I feel the responsibility to be thoughtful and intentional in advocating for racial justice and health equity. The course taught me that a lot of the problems happening in today's landscape simply evolved from those in the past.",
    "It enhanced my critical thinking skills and I was able to apply the material outside of the course. I learned about the untold history of medical practices and how many modern operations and forms of treatment were discovered through abuse, experimentation, and exploitation of the Black body over centuries. I learned about institutional health disparities and the role racism plays in the doctor-patient relationship.",
    "I learned so much about the history of health for black people in America. So much. Not only did I learn history, I was confronted with my feelings and emotions, and how those voices can weave into academia. I was also able to share my feelings and emotions, when sharing something personal can be hard to do.",
    "This class changed my whole world view. I realized that America was completely built on inequality and has not changed much back then. I feel like I developed the language to call out a lot of the things I've noticed was wrong in society.",
    "A deeper insight in a subject that is rarely taught here in the American Educational System. The knowledge of how deeply rooted racism in the US has affected black lives in medicine has helped me recognize the disrespectful, apathetic nature of people involved in medicine towards black people.",
    "I LOVEEEED THIS CLASS!!! You learn so much about African American history in regard to health. It is sometimes very difficult to listen to the type of horror African Americans had to historically experience, but I feel like it is necessary to be uncomfortable when learning the truth.",
    "so much about slavery and its continuities",
    "The insidious relationship between American medicine and racial bias that force us to reckon with how concepts such as sickness and health function as prisms with explanatory power beyond the biological. Instead, racial and gender hierarchies, cultural values, and social norms shape how we, as a society, interpret sickness and health in black communities. Often, we turn sickness into deviance, transmute illness into criminality, and render black pain as morally suspect and socially illegible. Activists today helpfully call our attention to such overdetermined beliefs and direct our gaze toward the social policies and institutions that uphold them. Although we will spend the semester focusing on black struggles for health and wholeness, much of this history is imbricated in, and resonates with, past and present challenges faced by other marginalized communities. By gaining a critical historical foundation in the several centuries-4 long struggle for black lives, we will be better equipped to understand the challenges of sickness and health faced by other vulnerable communities. (directly from the syllabus)",
    "I learned SO much in this class. I never realized how tainted the medical system was by racism and discrimination until this class. I never realized how much I wasn't taught in my past history classes until this class. Dr. Roberts was able to fit hundreds of years of history into a semester's worth of classes and she did it with eloquence, power, and conviction. I learned how to take in all the information I was learning and use it to inform my decisions and relate it to different aspects of life. I now feel fortified by this new set of knowledge.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of slavery and its relationship with medicine and racism today. An amazingly insightful course that EVERY Yale student should take. We are extremely lucky to have this course and to be taught by Professor Roberts! I genuinely loved coming to class every day:)",
    "So many things that I should have already known, yet had never been taught, about the history of race and medicine, which is such a testament to the importance of this class. We covered everything from the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade to modern issues of policing and maternal mortality.",
    "An in-depth look into African American history from the slave trade til now, with particular focus on origin and evolution of racial stereotypes, exploitation of bodies, black struggle and resistance, and lingering effects of racial prejudice with w modern medical system.",
    "We had an overview of American History in terms of the African American perspective. A truly unique take on American History, and enlightening no matter what background you have",
    "You will learn about the intersection of race, health, and American history in the class. A blend unlike any other.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS AT YALE. You learn about African American history from before the slave trade to current times. You learn SO MUCH. As a person of color, but not African American, I learned so so so so much that I would never have learned through reading the news or in my daily life. It is so eye-opening. If you take one class at Yale, it really should be this one.",
    "This course taught me about medical history in the US, specifically through the lens of race. I also learned about familiar topics in US history from a new and enlightening perspective. Professor Roberts offered an account of slavery more honest than any of the relatively sanitized versions I was taught in high school. Tying the past to today, a continual focus of the class, really helped me understand modern racism in healthcare.",
    "Gained so much knowledge in African American history and how it is relevant to all of us today",
    "I learned how the bodies of African Americans have been abused and commodified through American medical history, whether that was in the form of forced\/unconsented medical experimentation, forced reproduction, racial science, or lynching. I also learned about the segregated U.S. health system in the 1900s and the rise of health activism. Most importantly, I learned how this long history of discrimination and abuse impacts the lives of African Americans in the present day.",
    "This course opened my mind. I had minimal background with American history and this was a fantastic broad overview of American history from an African American and medical perspective. My opinion on several issues was completely reversed and I gained a new understanding for the importance of learning history.",
    "An entirely new and important perspective to critically understand our American society today and how we got here. Besides being a great and engaging history lecture, this class is vital for anyone going into medicine, public health, or who just wants to be a critical thinker about the time we live in.",
    "This course was by far one of the most informative classes I've taken at Yale. Each lecture presented us with information that most of us didn't know (for a reason) and challenged us to question everything we thought we knew about American history. Although the course analyzes history from the lens of medicine, sickness, and health, its very global in terms of the topics we discuss in American history. The syllabus was excellent and Dr. Roberts is one of Yale's greatest gems!! She puts so much effort and care into the class, which makes it work in every way possible.",
    "a comprehensive understanding of African American history through the lens of health and medical practices, an ability to connect this history to contemporary issues in race and medicine",
    "I truly enjoyed this class so much. It taught me how to enjoy class and learning again. I was able to apply first and second-hand sources and analyze them to support and strengthen my argument. I learn how to really delve deep into complex and often uncomfortable and hard questions during discussions with my peers inside and outside of section. This was my one class that I talk about outside of the classroom because it will always so interesting and inspiring. It reminded me why I love learning",
    "I learned about the United States' long history of violence against African-Americans. What I will most remember from this class is the lectures in which we heard gruesome accounts of different types of violence, including rape of slaves, murder of slave children, and, in the modern era, police brutality. We also learned about African slaves who contributed to Western medicine; in general, we studied ways in which medicine ties to slavery and racism. I will never forget the horrific acts of violence that we studied in this class. This class changed my outlook on race and the United States simply because I never realized how violent American history is.",
    "Learned a lot about African American history and how to begin discussing these complex topics in our daily lives.",
    "I learned the history of black bodies from the perspective of the subjugated group rather than the oppressor. A drastic difference from the rest of my life.",
    "I learned so much about the history of African American health and the present day implications. This class has forever changed my outlook on life and how I will navigate the world in the future. Thank you Professor Roberts.",
    "To draw maps between what was and what is",
    "Much of the historical background of the course was already familiar to me, but the exploration of how racism carried past ordinary historical knowledge into health was very interesting to learn--especially in the fields of medical experimentation and racial science. The importance of this class to potential health care workers and american historians --and really to all--lies most in what it teaches about racism in society and ways to combat it. A very enlightening course which revealed what is often not taught, perhaps due to the shame\/discomfort it evokes.",
    "I learned that sickness and health in America is not and has not been the same for everyone. At many points in American history, there has been an untold Black history that is covered up because it hides the image of American exceptionalism. For example, the expansion of the hospital system in the US and the rise of pathological anatomy (as opposed to the humoral model of health) was accelerated by studying and dissecting black bodies.",
    "A deep understanding of African American history starting from the Middle Passage, through the antebellum period, and after the Reconstruction using the lens of sickness and health. I have also developed a newfound appreciation for the ways in which history can inform the present.",
    "I learned about the troubling history of african american history, specifically concerning health and medicine. I learned how to look at issues through a historical lens, and I also learned how race is interconnected with so much of our lives.",
    "I loved this course -- it fundamentally changed my view on the nature of science and medicine by revealing how the knowledge we still use today came from such dark, exploitive origins",
    "I developed skills of critical thinking as well as creativity. I learned how to analyze different texts and use them appropriately to develop my own claim. I learned how to discuss sensitive topics with peers as well as learn how to digest difficult material in a way that I was able to understand it, learn from it, and be able to share my ideas in a clear way. Before this class, I would have been scared to express my opinion or thoughts on sensitive topics but now feel that I possess that skill.",
    "The class took us through a really difficult time in history and handled it really well! I learnt a lot and this was definitely my favourite class at Yale so far",
    "I acquired a wealth of knowledge and understanding for the course material and for the history of our nation.",
    "This was hands down the best class I have ever taken at yale. I learned more in this class than I have in any other and I was MOTIVATED to do so. The learning environment created showed me what learning CAN and SHOULD look like. It was absolutely amazing. It was really amazing to be in a class and have a professor in an academic setting center the experiences of African Americans especially in the context of medicine and public health. This is without a doubt a class that all yale students should take.",
    "I learned about the history of medical mistreatment of African-Americans - in terms of how their bodies were used and how they were prevented from entering the medical profession. We followed this history from the Atlantic Slave Trade into the present and used the history as a lens to view modern health disparities.",
    "I believe I am leaving this class with a new appreciation and admiration for the many African American people who had to struggle in order for many people today to enjoy their health care. This class revolutionized how I saw myself within the medical world and made it that more important for me to understand and grapple with the histories of minority groups in this country.",
    "This course provided a great overview of the history of African Americans health in the United States.",
    "I have learned how to think about the history of medicine and its implications in different perspectives.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount of the dark historical roots of the modern-day healthcare system. The material that was presented in this course will without a doubt impact the way that I understand and communicate with patients as a look to pursue a career in medicine for the underserved.",
    "An overview of salient topics in the history of African American health from the Atlantic Slave Trade up until the current day. Beyond that, we were also exposed to a new philosophy of teaching that doesn't center cramming and grades, but rather invites you to take learning into your own hands and focus on the things that interest you most. I think the content we learned in this class will be the most important information I have learned at Yale, and it has definitely changed the way I see the world.",
    "I learned about the key intersections between blackness and health at different points of American history, developing a clearer view of the depth and continuities of this history.",
    "I learned an entire other side to US history. It opened my eyes to the depths of racism that occurred in historical events I thought I knew the full picture about.",
    "If you take this course, you are guaranteed to develop a rigorous understanding of how racist institutions within this nation continue to detrimentally affect the health and wellness of African Americans.",
    "I cannot express enough how valuable and life-changing this class is. It offers a deep and harrowing look into the exploitation, brutalization, resistance, and achievements of African American people in American medical history. By connecting historical themes to issues like policing and inherited trauma, this class helped me to become a more effective ally and more informed human being about the troubled relationship between African American history and medical culture. While we don't often think about it, the American medical system was founded in a slave-owning society--and this class illuminates many issues and consequences that follow from this!",
    "I was able to receive an insight to a history that I knew about but had never been exposed to in a previous history class. This course thought me so much about have race and racism have impacted the culture we live in, especially in terms of health and medicine. As someone with an interest in pursuing medicine, I feel like this course was essential for me to learn about the complicated history of the medical field as well as my duty to addressing this history and its modern day implications.",
    "I learned so incredibly much about black history in the americas through a medical lens. It was truly fascinating. I have a profoundly different perspective on slavery and the way its history manifests today.",
    "I learned so much from this course it is hard to include it all. I have come away from this class a better and more aware person. Learning about another narrative of history that I have never been exposed to before was eye opening and Dr. Roberts guided us through difficult topics with compassion and composure. This is an amazing class. Take it.",
    "This class should be required for all Yale students. It teaches some of the most important information that is more often than not overlooked. Sickness and Health provides a small overview into the health and lives of enslaved individuals all the way through modern African Americans today.",
    "I learned about the history of slavery, medical experimentation on African Americans, and the black medical profession. I have gained insight into Black Power and black resistance to medical abuse.",
    "How to think critically about racial inequalities drawing from historic facts.",
    "Knowledge of structural racism",
    "An in-depth understanding of how the US medical system was built upon injustice to the African American community.",
    "I developed a much greater understanding of African American culture and the deep history of slavery in this nation.",
    "I learned so much in this coursewe traces African American medical history from the Atlantic slave trade until modern times. I especially appreciated the ending of the course where we focused on current issues effecting black health including black maternal mortality and police brutality.",
    "Developed a greater ability to link current crises with events from the last.",
    "I learned a lot about the long-lasting effects of slavery and how they manifest in the medical field.",
    "I learned about the history of African Americans in regard to health as well as its modern day repercussions.",
    "I gained a better understanding of Black history specifically regarding Black health. I think I also gained a more appreciation for how important Black oppression has been in our nation's history, and I think that's very relevant to my life today.",
    "I learned about the intersections of medicine in African American history and its intersections and importance in the greater United States history.",
    "We learned much about the treatment of African Americans by the predominant social and health systems throughout US history. Spanning the treatment of enslaved Africans during their passage to the Americas up to the health struggles of African Americans in the present time, this class showed us a wide overview of how Black Americans have been systematically mistreated for hundreds of years.",
    "I learned a lot about African American history and the historical practice of medicine within the African American community from the Atlantic Slave trade to modern times. I also learned about the impact that past medical abuses within the African American community have on modern day medicine and society in the United States.",
    "Genuinely the most insightful course I have taken while at Yale",
    "I learned a lot about discrimination towards a black people in medicine, slavery, and everyday life.",
    "I feel so much more informed",
    "I developed so many insights into sickness and health in African American History. I have discovered my patients in doctor-patient relationships and patient advocacy. I have enjoyed writing the oped and all the different types of assignments. I am interested in the intersection of mental health, trauma, and first generation immigrants and minority groups. This course taught me how to pour my passion into writing. How to write an Oped. How to design a course to implement in the future. This course is truly unlike anything else at Yale.",
    "The intersection of Race and Medicine in American History. We explored the slave trade, plantation slavery, the reconstruction era and Jim crow in addition to current events. My analytical skills definitely improved thanks to this class because I found the readings genuinely interesting and captivating.",
    "There are so many things that you dont learn in a regular history class setting and this class gives you the dark details of what occurred in history with African Americans. The aspect of health in slavery and the African American narrative is not touched upon and this class definitely jumpstarted an interest in researching and finding out more about this material.",
    "This course literally taught me to look at the world in a new way and to reconsider many, many things I once thought to be true. It made me develop skills to check myself when making an implicitly biased assumption and it also made me totally confused about my major and what I want to do with the rest of my life because Im currently majoring in something completely unrelated to all of this, but Im not sure I can just go back to ignorance.",
    "I learned an immense amount about the struggles that African Americans have and are facing.",
    "I learned about the history of slavery and racism as intertwined with medical themes such as slave physicians to biases present in the institution of medicine today.",
    "I gained a true appreciation of the history of abuse that African Americans have been subjected to in the US and a framework for how to analyze that abuse.",
    "I learned a good amount about the health, medicine, and exploitation in the African American community over the last 400 years.",
    "This course opened my eyes when I didnt even realize they were closed.",
    "life-changing experience. changed how i see this country, public health, anti-racism work, my purpose, so much. lots of specific examples and stats that can be used when having conversations with others about the history of racism in this country.",
    "Through the duration of the course, I learned a good deal of information; however, I think that the most important lesson involved how to approach academia. The emphasis placed on attention to wellbeing when engaging with painful topics as we did in the course made me realize that it really is important to allow for recovery and selfcare in an academic situation.",
    "African American history in medicine",
    "I learned about the interaction of healthcare and African American history from the slave trade to today. I learned that many societal ills of the past, such as slavery, were somehow even more horrifying than I thought (frequently on the order of Nazi war crimes). I learned that many narratives have two sides, and that the side that empathizes with African Americans is frequently ignored (for example, the Progressive Era of American history was mainly progressive for whites; it was actually among the worst of times in African American history). I learned that many problems of today (such as police violence and distrust of medicine) can be explained at least in part by the history of these institutions, and likewise that many phenomena that we thought we left in the past (such as segregated housing) are still widely abundant today (segregation may not be legal anymore, but in many places its almost exactly as prevalent in housing and schools as it was decades ago). This class opens you up to a new way of thinking about race relations in America (the fact that Im saying this as an African American male should impress upon you how special this class is). It also challenges you to go out and make positive change in the world. Professor Roberts really wants this class to be a jumping-off point for change, and for me, that has been the case.",
    "critical thinking, intersectionality of issues, historical injustices' effects on today's world",
    "I learned a lot in this class. This class took a different approach than others to where it challenged you to actually connect with the material. I can go on about the information I've learned, however by taking this class I learned how to engage with the material on a level beside the surface. A lot about black women. A lot about black people and movements. Etc...",
    "I loved this class. You must take it if you can. I learned so much about how there are so many systems in place that keep Black people down, but we are fearless. Black people and our allies have been and will continue to fight the injustices in our lives.",
    "I learned about the founding of medicine as it is built upon the slave trade and white supremacy. I learned about African American history and the role of medicine in it.",
    "I gained so much knowledge surrounding the medical system and how it was built on the backs of Black enslaved peoples, both men and women, and how this history affects the way Black people are treated today.",
    "This course gave me immense insight into the history of medicine and slavery in America.",
    "I learned a lot about how race, especially being black\/ African American\/African affects the medical care that a patient received. Lots of sources, data, videos, articles, etc were given as proof of the healthcare disparities that affect not only black people but Latinx people, low-income patients, and an array of minority groups. I truly learned a lot in the class but being that I identify with a lot of the identity patients presented I wouldn't say that it was new content for me personally, but I know that it was very new information for many of the students in the class.",
    "This was an amazing course that taught me much about slavery and shed light on issues such as medical exploitation and scientific racism that I had never explored before. I emerged from this class with a more informed perspective on the issue of racism and obstacles black Americans have face since the beginning of American history up until the modern age.",
    "We traced the origins of the modern health disparities in the African American community by following the threads through slavery, reconstruction, and more.",
    "I am sure that all of the reviews for this course will be overwhelmingly positive. This class is a wonderful survey and deep-dive into untold histories. I learned so much about the ways in which health and class, race, gender intersect. Students become much more knowledgeable about African American history (both medical and not), and they also become much more thoughtful & critical agents when examining medical\/public health narratives.",
    "I learned so much about our history that has been hidden from the spotlight. Most definitely one of the best classes I have ever taken!",
    "I learned SO MUCH from this course. I think this is one of the most important, brilliant, informative, and amazing courses at Yale I've ever taken. I learned a completely buried version of American History that showed me just how flawed my high school curriculum was.",
    "I developed a broad knowledge on the history of African American lives.",
    "This course allowed me to fill in the gaps of my education that had been created by the institutional racism of United States schooling. I learned how important it is to be able to learn and analyze uncomfortable and intense material.",
    "This class definitely improved my critical thinking skills and my ability to synthesize multiple texts, sources of information, and compare different time periods in history, including the present moment. Prof. Roberts gracefully and powerfully taught us about so many difficult, often ignored topics, greatly improving my knowledge of African-American history and as such, American history. I gained incredible insight into the roots of racial disparities in healthcare and health outcomes, as well as how racism and racial biases affect and harm people today, and how they affected and harmed people in the past.",
    "I learned a lot about slavery, its origins, and how the effects of it are still present to this day.",
    "This course taught me how to think critically about public health issues in America today and throughout our history with an emphasis on African Americans.",
    "By taking this course, I feel like I have developed a different perspective on being in the medical field in the future, as the course emphasizing uncovering concealed information that should be taught everyday to every student in America.",
    "I realized how entrenched slavery is in our every day lives and how we are still benefitting from the institution that we never really think about. This class was amazing and changed my perspective on racism and how we still have so much work to do in our society today. As a premed student, I think about medical schools and doctors differently, and I realize that the medical field has only advanced so far due to the blood, sweat, and tears of enslaved people.",
    "I learned the raw details about what it it like to be black in america.",
    "I learned about the medical dimension of trauma and injustice that has faced African Americans for about 400 years. Everybody learns about slavery and racism and segregation in elementary school, but nobody learns about this. The medical racism that has faced blacks is pernicious, long-standing, and unfortunately still active today, so there is plenty to learn here for just about everybody.",
    "Learned about aspects of history that are often swept under the rug, but that have huge and lasting ramifications today. Super important subject material.",
    "This course is life changing. It changed the way I think about America as a country, about our world as a whole, and about many of the day-to-day interactions I have with people in my life. It covers the history of African American health from the beginning of slavery on slave ships coming to America all the way up to today facing police brutality and maternal death rates. This course covers the history of America your high school class was afraid to teach.",
    "Ability to think critically about important issues and have meaningful discussions",
    "I learned a lot about the racial science that has permeated American history for a long time. I learned how to approach assignments that required creativity. I learned how the racial science that allowed for and justified slavery show permanence in today's society.",
    "I learned the forgotten history of African American people in the united states, how medical institutions have ignored the history of medical experimentation of black people, the importance of lost voices, to highlight the voices of minority groups through the lens of science as well as outside of medicine. To be vulnerable in the classroom and take time to digest the material properly so that i can make meaningful conversation. And that I don't always have to have a say in a conversation and I have to instead take a step back to simply listen. I also learned to be compassionate when sharing sensitive information and respect the people involved.",
    "Learned about race relations and my place in this world as a privileged white woman, as well as plenty of history."

   "comments": [
    "This class only has strengths. Prof. Roberts is a huge one, obviously. She is a phenomenal lecturer and cares so deeply about her students. The work is light, but designed to make you think deeper about the class content. It also makes the course more accessible to students from all backgrounds. The readings are engaging and interesting. Going to lecture is genuinely enjoyable, despite the distressing nature of the material.",
    "Professor Roberts is one of the best lecturers that I have ever had exposure to on Yale's campus. Every lecture is a new rollercoaster of emotions, discovery, and knowledge. Professor Roberts is able to absorb you into every lecture as she teaches as if telling a story and leaves you changed after every lecture. Further, my TA is one of the best TAs that I have ever had. She brings so much positive energy to every discussion section, which is very much needed in a course with heavy material.",
    "This class is amazing. There is nothing that needs to be changed. This professor is probably the best professor I have ever had because she cares so much and dedicates so much time. This is the best course of my entire time at Yale even though I am not the biggest fan of learning history.",
    "Amazing - cant be improved.",
    "strengths - professor roberts. such an amazing lecturer... she's sooo awesome. weaknesses - none!",
    "Professor Roberts was absolutely amazing!!! She clearly was very passionate about what she was teaching and her lectures were always super interesting.",
    "No weaknesses, only all strengths. Professor Roberts is an incredible lecturer - literally, after every single lecture there was a standing ovation for her.",
    "No weaknesses. This course was designed so that each student took take their learning into their own hands, and that is the true power of education. It makes people passionate about material that can be used for good.",
    "Professor Roberts is brilliant and kind, everyone could learn from her. I only wish we had a chance to talk about HIV\/AIDs or other health epidemics in the late 20th century before we arrive at modern day. Especially felt like we had a lot of time to talk about intersectionality with regards to Black women -- which was great!-- but less time for Afro-Latinx people or queer Black people and their unique health challenges.",
    "strengths - prof, tfs, content, thought-provoking sections, emotional release, literally everything weaknesses - n\/a",
    "The class was honestly so enjoyable to go to everyday, and grades are not an issue (there is extra credit given on the midterm, and she gives the questions in advance). It is an easy A because Professor Roberts cares more about her students taking a risk and exploring topics that actually interest them rather than the safe ones that would typically be explored in a class in which. grades are more of a concern.",
    "The strengths of this course include the importance of the material, the determination and compassion of Professor Roberts and the teaching fellows, the ability for any student to take the class. The fact that grades were not the most prevalent factor of this course improved engagement as students genuinely learned the material for the sake of learning and bettering themselves. If there were any weaknesses, they were unnoticeable. This class is so different from any of the other lecture classes I have taken at Yale since Professor Roberts made herself available to students and emphasized student engagement over passive learning.",
    "This course is incredible. Such a breath of fresh air compared to the typical academic pressure from other courses at Yale. The way Prof. Roberts structures this course is relaxed, but you still learn so much information by the end of the semester. Other Yale professors should seriously take note. Professor Roberts has got it figured out. The fact that you are not overwhelmed and trying to cram large amounts of information into your brain allows you to spend time reflecting on the material, and therefor you remember and actually grasp so much more.",
    "This course was really great as it is. Professor Roberts did an amazing job quickly managing the much higher than expected workload. The discussion sections felt intimate and still allowed us to get a lot from the material despite it being lecture focused. Some of the guest speakers were not as engaging as I would have liked. There were definitely times when I would have preferred hearing Professor Roberts cover the same material because she's just the amazing.",
    "This class is perfect in my opinion. The assignments were fun and engaging and open-ended, so allowed for creativity and exploration of specific topics we were interested in. Every lecture was interesting to listen to and I learned something new in each one.",
    "It's just amazing-- no improvements necessary.",
    "This class was amazing, no weaknesses",
    "The only weakness of this class is that it is only 50 minutes long; too short. Dr. Roberts is the BIGGEST strength. She is a powerhouse researcher, a fantastic orator, and a magnificent advisor. Her work and her pedagogy should be the template for all professors at Yale.",
    "The course is one of the strongest I have ever experienced at Yale. The TA selection was impeccable - all teachers were so kind and empathetic and really invested in students' learning. The readings were a little lengthy, but they were more there as a resource to guide you and inform your thinking rather than compulsory reads.",
    "Its all strengths I loved enaging with my class mates. I honestly wish the class time could be extended. Every class the time flew by so much. I would never say this about any other course but I would not mind staying longer for this class. It was just done so well.",
    "Strengths: literally EVERYTHING. hands down, best class I've taken at yale. multiple lectures where the class is moved to tears. Professor Roberts is the best, kindest, most caring human at Yale and I wish all of my classes could be taught by her. She cares so much about students! Other lecturers in the history department dont give one F about students. Not her! She should honestly lead a workshop or something for other professors at Yale so they can learn how to be better. This class is not a big workload or stressful in terms of grades, but it is extremely intensive in how deeply you are made to think. This class was a new kind of hard in that it was very difficult to read such sad readings and learn such devastating facts and histories and to make intellectual analyses. It is very hard to think deeper than beyond \"this is so fucked up how could people be so horrible\", but you have to! This class definitely challenged me. Weaknesses: NOTHING. I wish I could take this class for another semester.",
    "Professor Roberts cares an enormous amount for her students, and she lectures very elegantly. The course material is incredibly valuable for any person. Sometimes lectures stuck very close to the readings and didn't seem to diverge much into new things, but this wasn't a common issue. The readings were all important and section lent itself to good discussions.",
    "I loved how the class encouraged us to combine our own interests with the content in the course. It made the assignments really engaging. Professor Roberts did an amazing job accommodating the class so that she could teach such a large lecture.",
    "The strengths of the course were definitely the amazing lecturing of Dr. Roberts, the creative assignments, and thought-provoking sections.",
    "The lecture is absolutely amazing! Professor Roberts is probably the best speaker I have learned from during my time at Yale. Her lectures are engaging and insightful, I did not miss a single one. The assignments are also nice because they are low stress and they allow you to really engage with the material in a non-superficial way.",
    "Strengths: Professor Roberts is an amazing lecturer The topics discussed in class are very sensitive but Prof Roberts manages them perfectly",
    "The course is absolutely phenomenal. Professor Roberts is the best lecturer I have had and the content of the course is all information I wish I'd known a long time ago. The main way to improve it would be to support Professor Roberts as much as possible so she can keep doing the amazing work that she does.",
    "- the lectures were really well-written and organized - the readings were relevant and highly engaging\/interesting",
    "This was the most incredible course I have taken at Yale. The material is obviously compelling and moving, and inspires a lot of thought. The freedom we were given with assignments only added to the nature of the course, centered on provoking deep thought about these difficult topics. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to take this course.",
    "AMAZING class. This was my favorite class this semester, and I was fully engaged for every lecture. I honestly don't know how it could be improved. There was an emphasis on learning, and it was the reason why I loved this class so much. I didn't care about what grade I was to receive, but I still did my best.",
    "Literally none. Surpassed all my expectations",
    "Honestly, very very well taught so not many suggestions...",
    "Strengths: - lecturing style - amount of classes per week and time per class - interesting content Weaknesses: - no primary source requirement for the last essay - so much content on Canvas, sometimes it's difficult to navigate",
    "This class is perfect.",
    "Strength: Prof Roberts is the single most charismatic, genuine, incredible people. I never had a single conversation with her. But she amazed me every class. We clapped for her after every class. I cried too. Weakness: absolutely none.",
    "This was the most incredible course I have ever taken at Yale--for context I am a first semester senior--and I can confidently say that there will never be another course that is this caliber. Professor Roberts organization, willingness to engage with students, and passion for her work is unmatched.",
    "Incredible class",
    "The biggest strengths were the amazing lectures and the discussion sections (I had head TA Nkandu).",
    "This course was great because it allowed students to focus on learning information rather than getting a good letter grade. Even though it was a very large lecture, it felt like a seminar class. Professor Roberts was very involved in ensuring that students were getting the most out of the class, and the teaching fellows were very attentive as well. The course assignments also allowed students to apply and use the class information in the way they wanted.",
    "No weaknesses only strengths! The lectures were the best I have ever attended. Professor Roberts' passion and knowledge shined through. I have never taken a course where I have truly been engrossed during each lecture and absorbed all the information I was given. The way that Professor Roberts taught made it so that I don't think I will forget any part of what I learned during this course.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Roberts is the best lecturer and best teacher I have ever had. The course covers a really painful history, and Dr. Roberts attends to the material with so much care. She does not gloss over the hard parts, but she also highlights some inspiring and hopeful stories in the midst of a very painful history. Also, she always links things in the past to things in the present, making the lecture even more impactful. Every single reading was so interesting, and every single lecture was so powerful. Weaknesses: None. This class is amazing.",
    "This course only has strengths. Dr. Roberts is the first of her department to teach such a course, queen of lecturing, queen of intersectional history, unfazed, bringer of important racial history to all premeds, wizard of primary sources, undefeated in delivering engaging lectures and the best professor I've ever had at Yale (and I'm 37 credits deep at this point). Truly, Yale does not deserve her. This is the most organized, well taught, though-provoking, and important course I have ever taken. I loved every single lecture. You can tell that Dr. Roberts puts a lot of attention and detail into each slide and each unit. Her background in theater clearly shines through during her engaging lectures. She puts so much effort into making sure that we have everything we need to succeed and that there are ample options to explore the topics that we are interested in. This is the first class I've ever taken where the professor uploads so many resources for our own leisure that she had to ask to get more storage added to the Canvas page! The assignments were well thought out (unlike many lazy professors who just have you write the same analysis paper over and over again) and really aided the kind of thinking she was trying to encourage us to do in the class. The guest lectures were great and I loved how they tied into the central themes of the content. No weaknesses!!! - and I certainly don't know how Dr. Roberts could improve such a wonderful and well put-together course.",
    "Strengths: amazing lecturer (every lecture was so engaging), loved that I was pushed to think critically about the material and not be tested on how well I would regurgitate the information, always tied the history back to the present day and why it is relevant, really interesting topics that are more often than not barely (but should!) be covered in history. Weaknesses: honestly none!",
    "This course is by far the best course Ive taken at Yale and has so many strengths. The biggest strength is the instructor Carolyn Roberts, who truly puts her time, heart, and soul into making this class amazing and making it serve all of her students. In addition, the selection of readings were engaging and supported and enhanced the class material without being redundant, and amount of reading was manageable. Finally, the essays are fairly open ended, and the grading is generous, which gives students space and time to think and discuss and further research the course content without simply memorizing and reciting for a grade.",
    "Strength: Dr. Roberts! Dr. Roberts is such as fascinating and engaging individuals that truly made me feel valued and welcomed into a space to grapple with the long and dark history of systemic racism against black people in the US. Weakness: the lack of support from school administration in this course! (saddening to hear that some administrators were against the important work that Dr. Roberts is doing with this class)",
    "AMAZING PROFESSOR! Awesome TF! Incredibly disturbing but engaging material that every yale student should learn. Fun and diverse assignments",
    "Amazing class. Every Yalie should take this before they graduate. Professor Roberts is engaging, passionate, and caring for all of her students.",
    "Honestly, a spectacular class across the board. Cannot think of a single way to make it better. The best part of the class is the grading scheme. Not because it's easy to get a good grade, but because the way the assignments are structured allow for freedom to write about parts of the class that interest you. There is no mold that you are trying to fit, you get to write about the aspects of the class that have personally spoken to you, and that's pretty cool in my opinion.",
    "I don't have anything negative to say about this course. It was the most incredible introduction to Yale that I could have gotten and I am excited to continue learning about similar topics. The professor was fascinating and so deeply determined to give us the best opportunity possible. She presented the information in a clear and engaging way and all of the readings built on everything we were learning to make it a broad, incredible learning experience.",
    "Strengths - excellent lectures, engaging professor who made time to get to know us, amazing TFs, lots of opportunities for supplementary learning, varied assignments",
    "The course was so well taught and facilitated that I really don't think there is much that should change.",
    "Strengths: EVERYTHING!! Amazing lecturer\/professor, great TF, very engaging readings, fun assignments, what more could you ask for? Weaknesses: nothing !",
    "No weaknesses! Professor Roberts gave AMAZING lectures, the workload was super chill, and I gained so much.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. This class is probably one of the best I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Roberts does a wonderful job at structuring the class so that it doesn't feel like a burden but still allows you to engage with the content in the way that bests suits you. The assignments are not too difficult. Plenty of resources are available to help you throughout the class. Professor Roberts and the TAs are all extremely dedicated and do a wonderful job at fostering community despite there being 400+ students in the class.",
    "No weaknesses really. It was brilliantly structured, I would love if there was another class offered in the Spring as a continuation or some way to continue the work that was done in the class but the professor is working on that too. The fact we were allowed to explore our own interests in this class, and genuinely think and challenge the concepts that surround us was phenomenal.",
    "Professor Roberts is an amazing lecturer and person! She puts in great effort to get to know you outside of the classroom, and she works so hard to teach us this material. The content of this course was so important and eye-opening.",
    "This course is set up to be exactly what you make of it. That being said, it is almost impossible to do the readings and go to lectures and section without wanting to fully immerse yourself in the material and the thought that this course uncovers. Professor Roberts emphasized the importance of just sitting with the information and messages that were brought up in this course, and doing so was truly eye opening. I am so grateful to have been able to take this course with Professor Roberts.",
    "The workload of this class is incredibly manageable but still encourages engagement with the topics and their importance today. The open ended nature of the assignments allowed us to identify ways these issues are present in the real world, not just in the course assignments presented to us. Professor Roberts is an incredibly talented lecturer and text curator -- I have never been in a lecture that was so consistently well attended and well regarded by its students.",
    "The course covered so much ground in one semester. The lectures were completely engaging and thought-provoking. I also appreciated that the assignments were varied enough to accommodate everyone's different learning styles. My only critique is that most of the guest lecturers couldn't hold a candle to Professor Roberts.",
    "Dr. Roberts is an amazing professor and a super engaging lecturer. It is truly wonderful to hear her speak about topics that she is passionate about.",
    "strengths: incredible course. great professor, informative content. seminars were well-organized.",
    "This class should be a requirement for all students. Powerful, informative, necessary history that is not taught enough.",
    "This is an amazing course, Professor Roberts and my TA, Teona, did an great job of engaging us in the course material and the material itself was interesting and a reasonable amount of reading. No weaknesses.",
    "The course was extremely informative, well organized, important, and inspiring. The materials were emotionally challenging; as a non-Black person of color taking this course, I think it is necessary that more people should learn about this history in order to see the fuller picture of the inequities that affect people of color, especially Black and brown people. Assignments and tests were fair; students had the opportunity to be creative and thoughtful. I appreciate the practicality of these assignments (e.g. you can publish your op-ed or conduct your lesson plan) as a way to spread insights and knowledge about Black\/African American history in medicine and public health to others. I don't know and can't speak for any shortcomings about the class.",
    "Words cannot explain how AMAZING this class is. One can easily not attend class and somehow pass with B+\/A- but the way the lecture is structured and taught, we wouldn't want to miss it even if we are sick in bed. The professor really engages with the material and it is evident that she loves it, and she wants us to know why. The time she spends getting to know her students is also worth-noting. There are more than 300 students in the lecture and she doesn't miss a chance to get to know her students from chatting with us before class, to hosting almost 24\/7 long office hours and meals. It is really impressive and is the main reason why this class is so AMAZING. Will always forever be the best class ever offered at Yale!!",
    "This class was exactly what school should be! I learned so much from this course. Very engaging and the material was so accessible and eye-opening. Really interesting readings.",
    "Strengths were everything. I do not have a weakness for this class. This class is a great model for teaching a class. It may not be the only model, but should definitely be an exemplary standard.",
    "There are no weaknesses for this course, as it has been extremely impactful on my life. I wish that this course may be a requirement for all students looking to specialize in medical school",
    "Strength: The professor, the content, the lectures, everything. Weakness: NONE",
    "The strengths of this course is that it allows it students to think creatively and does not restrict them. The assignments are not just papers, but material that can actually be used by others such as a workshop. The class was very well organized. Everybody was very respectful to each oher and their backgrounds.",
    "This course was amazing!!! I loved how our discussion sections would connect the history we learned in class to current issues we face right now. I like how we weren't forced to discuss the readings instead the conversation would flow smoothly.",
    "assignments were so great and Professor Roberts was the best!",
    "This is an amazing class! Professor expertly went through roughly 400 years of history and also most importantly how that history still has huge effects on the present. I really appreciated how she also did not try to somewhat gloss over some of the truly horrific parts of history but showed us all of its ugliness which is needed to truly see and understand this history",
    "Honestly, no weaknesses. Everything about this class was amazing! Professors need to take notes from Dr. Roberts.",
    "Strengths--Amazing professor, very interesting content, amazing TAs Weaknesses--Some of the guest speakers were not very engaging",
    "There are no weaknesses- everything about this class is incredible. The assignments are meaningful, the readings are engaging, you learn so much from listening to those around you in section, and listening to Professor Roberts lecture is an absolute privilege.",
    "only strengths. this course literally taught me so much in one semester, i feel like i have evolved into a much more critical thinker with regards to race relations and history and modern effects of such a long trail of abuse and oppression, now that i have the words and ideas and facts to articulate my feelings. prof. roberts is phenomenal, and offers utmost support to all her students. the class is geared to teach students to think on their own terms instead of stress about grades, and as a result my engagement with the course was so high because i genuinely wanted to convey my thoughts in essays, exams, and sections.",
    "The professor and TA support is fantastic",
    "I have nothing bad to say about this course. There is so much that I learned, and Professor Roberts was one of the most passionate and engaging lecturers I've ever had the pleasure of learning from.",
    "Not a lot of work, and the assignments are graded very leniently which makes it really stress-free but the material is so engaging that once you start the work you get sucked into it and doing it doesn't even feel tiresome or hard at all. Professor Roberts is UNREAL at lecturing, she is so passionate and sweet and each lecture is captivating not only because the material is so important, but she also delivers it so well.",
    "Professor Roberts is an amazing lecturer and the course covers wonderful and important content that is so compelling it motivates you to learn.",
    "This course was very very engaging but sometimes the readings were too long",
    "This course is WONDERFUL. There are no weaknesses at all. For starters, Professor Roberts is someone who cares so deeply about her students and the course. She mentioned how she would stay up past midnight some nights in order to prepare a high-quality lecture for us. Since the class was so big this year, she set aside an entire day once a month for extra office hours as well as weekly lunches so that she could talk to as many of us as possible. She never put a cap on the class size either and simply worked hard to hire more TAs to accommodate all of us. Professor Roberts said in the first lecture that her goal is for us to think critically and deeply about this material. The material of this class is also incredibly engaging and important. It includes everything that many high schools leave out when they teach U.S. slavery. We learned about how slaves' bodies were commodified and abused due to forced medical experimentation, grave-robbing (in order to use African American bodies as cadavers), racial science, lynching, and more. We also learned about the historical segregation and present-day racism in the U.S. healthcare system. Professor Roberts is a very engaging lecturer and manages to present so much information in just 50 minutes. My section TA was also amazing. She made our section into an incredibly warm and welcoming space were we could discuss these painful topics. The workload of this class was also very manageable. I did all of the readings as well because they were so interesting. The assignments were also very creative. In addition to a standard paper, we also wrote an op-ed and designed a syllabus for a workshop. Overall, I only have positive reviews for this class.",
    "Dr Roberts was 10\/10. Her devotion to the cause of the course was inspiring. The course was inspirational, extremely educational, encouraged critical thinking. I did all the readings simply because I was so engaged with the course and its content. Could not recommend any improvements.",
    "The biggest strength is Professor Roberts. Anything that a professor can do to be excellent,cshe does tenfold. Because of that, the only potential weakness was by the end of the semester when we had a couple of guest lecturers who even though they were very good, simply could not live up to the standard set by Professor Roberts. Every lecture is fascinating and engaging, and every reading feels gripping and relevant.",
    "I really can't find very many weaknesses to the course. Dr. Roberts was constantly concerned with making sure the class flowed during the semester. Her syllabus was also so meticulously designed from the start, that it didn't really lend itself to any issues. The beauty of her class is that she practically let us take every assignment in any direction we chose, forcing us to truly engage with the material, but also giving us the liberty to actually enjoy our assignments.",
    "The strengths of this course were that it rewarded critical thinking, did not reward short term memorization, and that it had no weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Roberts is the best lecturer I've ever had at Yale. She is so full of charisma and presents a very difficult history with so much sensitivity, compassion, and care. This is a must-take class because nearly all careers Yalies aspire to go into have some stake in the social determinants of health. Furthermore, basic knowledge of the intersections of race and medicine is so important. Weaknesses: N\/A.",
    "The lectures and design of the class are beautiful. I have no complaints. All the resources we could ever need, academic or emotional, were provided for us by the professor and our section leaders.",
    "I loved that this class forced me to think about race and American history in a totally new way. Learning about the violence and racial terror that fills this country's history was incredibly valuable, and often very moving. I was on the verge of tears in class more than once. Additionally, learning about this history required serious personal reflection on my part as a white person; I never thought that much about what it meant to be white before this class. That was awesome and I will never forget it. As for weaknesses, I think the assignments could have been a little more serious. Professor Roberts wanted this class to be low stress, and I do appreciate that. But I wonder if it went a little too far and if the class could be improved by having one longer paper. It was mostly fantastic though!",
    "The grading could me a bit more strict (without drastically increasing the workload), and section discussions could be a bit more structured.",
    "The strength is the material. It's challenging and forces you to think about how racism impacts freedom and specifically health. It could improve by finding ways to put people in safe spaces to really grow their mindsets. I feel like the class was so big and the section was so scary for people that their experience was limited.",
    "No weaknesses. Only strengths. Best class at Yale. Give her more support and resources!",
    "Yale faculty not giving Professor Roberts shit for being a great teacher",
    "The strength of the course was the lectures of Professor Roberts, whose intention was to create a course where student could prioritize learning rather than grades or perfectionism. It was a very refreshing way to learn about a deserving and delicate topic. I think this a true strength of the course. Its weakness perhaps was the occasional simplicity of some historical background material, which many were already familiar with. While little-discussed topics such as convict-leasing and the mothers of gynecology were discussed we probably didnt need to spend as much time on the rote history of the Civil War or the politics of reconstruction. The focus on health was the strongest part of the course.",
    "Every single class was like a TED talk. I don't think the course would have done as well if it were taught by any other professor. Professor Roberts was fantastic. The readings were well-chosen. My mind was expanded. The one weak point was that I did not find the sections as engaging as the class.",
    "Strengths: FANTASTIC professor, engaging lectures, incredibly interesting and relevant readings, good mixture of analytical and creative writing assignments Weaknesses: I would have liked sections to be a bit more centered around the readings, but this may have varied from section to section\/",
    "This course did a great job of including information and materials needed to understand the information and facts behind this history, but it went above and beyond by exploring case examples, intense stories, and allowing us to have open discussions in section. This class covered material that few to none others at Yale coveryet the material covered should be required for pre-health and pre-medicine students to learn.",
    "This course was amazing in all capacities",
    "No weaknesses! Best class ever",
    "This course was perfect. From lectures to assignments and the discussion sections it was evident that every member of the teaching team was putting in their all. If they keep doing what they are doing this course will continue to be the best at Yale. I can not say enough about this class and I really believe that everyone NEEDS to take this course, especially if they plan on going into medicine in some capacity. The intellectual challenge of this course was in the synthesis and application. It was in figuring out how to move forward with the very difficult and at times gruesome information that we were learning about the history of medicine and race in the united states.",
    "Strengths: One of the most amazing courses Yale offers. Every lecture is thought-provoking and powerful and important. Thank you for allowing this class to exist and not be capped. Weaknesses: It seemed like there were a lot of assignments due in the span of a month - they could be spread out slightly more but honestly no real complaints",
    "Strengths: - well organized - thoroughly connected to events and phenomenons in the present day - attentive to personal and emotional effects of the material on students - engaged with various mediums to teach a lesson - unique assignments that allowed for creativity and reflection",
    "This is an AMAZING course!!!! Everyone should take it!!!",
    "The class presented the unfiltered, raw, and real truth about our countries' horrifying treatment of African American individuals. Every student at Yale should be exposed to the content of this course which digs deep into the roots of modern-day challenges of racism that continue to pervade every bit of society.",
    "There are no weaknesses in this course, other than a lack of support from Yale admin. Yale admin, do better! The strengths are basically infinite. Prof Roberts is the most caring, engaging and passionate professor I have ever met. I think all Yale professors should be required to take her class\/talk to her so that they can become better teachers and lecturers. The assignments allow you to really focus on what interests you and lets you apply the themes we learn about to whatever topics you are passionate about in life. Every lecture is like a 50 minute emotionally charged TED talk, there are literally people in tears at the end. The TAs are also really great and section was also super interesting.",
    "This course is all strengths. The assignments will get you to really think critically and reflect on what you've learned in class, how it permeates our world today, and what can be done. It is very well organized with clear objectives set and met each class. It is the perfect mix of humanistic perspective, especially in its inclusion of first-person narratives from African Americans, historical background, social science, and public health. Its interdisciplinary nature is ambitious but extremely well executed. Professor Roberts manages to communicate the gravity of this history each class, and it was refreshing that she managed this in such a large lecture.",
    "Strengths are the professor, the way the content is taught, the freedom within the class to choose what you write on\/explore. There weren't many weaknesses to the class, other than the fact that it is a hard topic to discuss\/learn about especially looking back in history and learning about\/seeing images of the terrible racism that occurred.",
    "The strength of this course is having a professor who has conducted a tremendous amount of scholarship on this topic and has personally experienced the acts of racism that she described during the lectures. Thus, she is able to present a powerful scholarly and personal introduction to the root of race-based health disparities in this nation.",
    "Professor Roberts is the absolute strength of this class. She is not only a brilliant, ground-breaking academic but also an inspiring and exceptionally charismatic human being. Her lectures are informative, engaging, and moving (I cried multiple times in this class!!!). Professor Roberts manages to make a 300-person lecture feel like a genuine community, and navigates the class through a harrowing history while encouraging students to value their mental health and connections with one another.",
    "The only weakness was my discussion section -- it was not super related to lectures or course material. Everything else was a strength.",
    "There are no weaknesses to this class. I loved every second of this class. I wanted to do every reading. They were so impactful and added so much to my overall learning experience. Another strength was that the kindness and compassion that I felt every lecture. I felt valued as an individual and understood the value of the class beyond what it would do for my gpa.",
    "This class was incredible. I have never been so engaged in a lecture. Professor Roberts is amazing.",
    "The strength of this course is its thorough presentation of the history of medicine and its connection to slavery. The weakness is some periods of history were not covered in depth, such as the Civil War.",
    "Weaknesses - course was a little too large to engage with the professor Strengths - amazing professor! Learned so much, talked about this class with my friends all the time because of how mind blowing it was",
    "Absolutely nothing about this course could be improved - it is perfect as it is.",
    "The course lectures were incredibly thought provoking and easy to understand.",
    "I loved every aspect of the course from the assignments where we could choose any aspect of the course material that excited us, the incredible lectures, and the numerous opportunities Professor Roberts presented outside of class to engage with the material.",
    "No weaknesses other than section feeling unnecessary in terms of learning class material but still helpful from a personal growth perspective.",
    "Excellent course. No weaknesses.",
    "Overall, Sickness and Health was a good course. The assignments were very open-ended in topic area, which I appreciate, but frequently narrow in execution styles, and the rubric often had a lot of specific requirements I occasionally felt were detrimental to my assignments overall. The lectures were overall quite good -- Professor Roberts is a very gifted lecturer; I can't stress this enough, the material is so relevant and not taught in other Yale classes. One weakness of the course is that given the nature of the material we move through history very quickly, and often Professor Roberts spent a good chunk of lecture giving us historical context not related to Black history. I think in the future another option might be to have a short pre-class reading (perhaps from an American history textbook or written by Professor Roberts herself, which I know would be a lot of work for her) that gave historical context for each lecture, and then the lecture could focus specifically on Black health. For example, in the lecture on the Civil War, Professor Roberts spent around 20 minutes talking about medical innovations in the first years of the Civil War, before noting that none of these applied for Black soldiers. Perhaps we could read a short textbook reading on these innovations before class, and Professor Roberts could then spent more time on how the Black soldiers were excluded or the role of Black physicians.",
    "This class is superb and Professor Roberts is a wonderful engaging teacher. Similarly, my TF Kelsey Henry was very knowledgeable and understanding. There were many readings, but most were covered in detail in class and section, so no reading felt like it was assigned for the sake of work. Discussions are guided and inspire meaningful exchange, and class is never dull - there's always more insightful to be gleaned from Professor Roberts' well-prepared slides.",
    "Professor Roberts is an engaging and dynamic lecturer. The level of care she put into each lecture was clear. One area for improvement might be the level of focus of the class. While it was nice to have a large survey course, it could be good to consider focusing more on one particular time period so that students can engage with the material for longer.",
    "This class provides an in depth understanding of an aspect of American history that is often times overlooked. It also places more of an emphasis on students engaging with the material than strictly on grades, which makes for a very welcoming learning environment.",
    "Carolyn Roberts is amazing, assignments are really interesting, discussion sections are engaging.",
    "The strength of this course was the Professors lectures and thoughtful sections.",
    "No weaknesses. Genuinely obsessed with this course",
    "This course has all strengths. The lectures are an experience in itself. This course has changed my perspective. It has changed academia. Each assignment was meticulously thought out so that we, as students, can think. We, as students, can engage with the material and see where our interests lie. I pushed myself academically and intellectually in this course as a result. It was the best thing that has happened to me at Yale.",
    "awesome professor and awesome class!",
    "Strengths: Because this class was based on our creativity and our engagement with the material, we produced much better work. Weakness: This isnt a signature class, and it should be.",
    "This course is extremely strong and I learned so much. I liked how engaged all of the TFs and Professor Roberts were with the students and the content was well-arranged (we travelled in chronological order). It was well set-up to arrive at the question where do we go from here? at the end of the course so that students could leave with a long-lasting impression.",
    "Professor Roberts was an AMAZING professor and lecturer.",
    "I thought this course achieved its purpose wellI learned stuff, enjoyed the course, and was not stressed out about it.",
    "The TAs did an amazing job creating a safe space for section and professor Roberts was amazing and thoughtful.",
    "strength is professor roberts. she could teach a class about watching paint dry and i would recommend taking it. but this class is much better than one about watching paint dry lol. she received a round of applause after every lecture and an extremely well-deserved standing ovation at the end of the last lecture. another strength of the class is the organization of lectures in a timeline so it really takes you through a journey. also the types of assignments she chose (critical analysis essay, op-ed, lesson plan and final essay on any marginalized group) let you engage with the material on your own terms. very well-curated reading list.",
    "This has been my favorite course thus far at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed and looked forward to each lecture, which is more than I can say for many other lecture courses. I think the strength of this course lies within the passion of the teaching staff. Beginning with Professor Roberts and all the way through to the TFs, I could tell that each educator was passionate about the material and glad to be involved with the course.",
    "Great lectures",
    "Strengths: Assignments are loose enough that you can really go any direction you want with them, making the material feel more personal; Professor Roberts is a phenomenal speaker, you literally feel like youre in a TED Talk every lecture; the readings (please do them if you can, they can be phenomenal) add even more depth to the class; we were encouraged to apply this study of African American history to other marginalized groups; this professor poured her soul into the class, and that gave it life. Weaknesses: The class meets twice a week but only last 50 minutes each time, please fix that to make it 75 minutes; the attempt to include guest lecturers is laudable, but with the exception of Professor Hogarth (whose lecture and topic I LOVED), I really would have preferred Professor Roberts speaking (a note on Dr. Ayobami: he seemed like a decent speaker, but it didnt seem like he practiced before speaking to us?).",
    "strengths: preparation, passion, organization, commitment to student success, clarity of professor",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, engagement high, reading interesting, professor cared about material Weakness: Not everybody had equal investment which could hinder section",
    "Strengths: The class was easy, but it allowed you to just focus on learning. I remember so much more from this course than other courses this semester. It allowed me to really engage with the material. Weaknesses: I would say sometimes section could get a little repetitive. However, Professor Roberts and the TFs really tried to make it as engaging as possible as the semester went on.",
    "A strength is that the lectures are amazing and all the coursework is really relevant to things I need to know as a pre-med-- learning about the history of medicine and how current health disparities came to be.",
    "This course really only has strengths. It is taught in an accessible way and allows for everyone to share their viewpoints in smaller groups (discussion section) and break down the material outside of the lecture.",
    "This course is powerful. Professor Roberts makes the large lecture feel like a seminar. I learned a lot about medicine and slavery and American history.",
    "I liked the class style a lot ad especially loved the way that Professor Carolyn Roberts lectures. The class is extremely interested and always leaves her students with food for thought at the end of each lecture.",
    "This course was taught very well and was engaging the whole time. Assignments were clearly explained and allowed students to interact with course material.",
    "The strengths are professor Roberts who is one of the most incredible professors I've ever seen at Yale. She makes class interesting and engages with tough material in a very sensitive manner. You can tell from her teaching that she cares deeply about the subject and understands its importance. She makes herself available to each and every student, she truly cares about everyone who takes her course. The TFs are also so dedicated to the material and ensuring we all understand everything. There are no weaknesses.",
    "I cannot think of any weaknesses for this course! The lectures, readings, instruction, section are all top-notch. Each class is deeply compelling; powerpoints are well-sourced with historical documentation and artifact; the lecturing by Prof. Roberts is moving; the student attendance and participation is remarkable (especially given that this is a huge lecture course!). Section is also fabulous - everyone remains engaged with the content. Finally, content curation in this course is remarkable; all of the reading assignments and essays are meaningful and worthwhile.",
    "I wish that our sections were a bit more structured and that our conversations were more based on the text.",
    "strengths - engaging, well structured, clear weakness - repetitive?",
    "Professor Roberts is an absolute gem and she clearly choses her TAs very carefully, making the classroom and section experience second to none. The Canvas and course organization was clear and prepared us early for the rest of the semester.",
    "I literally could not name a single weakness of this course. Strengths: engaging, important material, interesting assignments that gave you a lot of creativity, a super caring professor, incredible and dedicated TAs.",
    "The lectures, readings, and guest speakers were absolutely amazing. I loved all the assignments, especially the lesson plan because it was unique. I wish the assignments were a little bit more collaborative, not meaning that they should be partner or group assignments, but discussed more in section. It would have been interesting to hear what other students were working on and their views on the class. I think a blog where students could post their work would have been impactful to learning.",
    "This course was the BEST course I have ever taken at Yale. I'm sure many reviews would be the same, but this course was so amazing because of all of the effort and hardworking doctor Roberts put into her students. She picked remarkable TA's, which definitely impacted our learning, but was mainly focused on her students embracing the content, and her focus on our well-being kept me extremely engaged, even though there was a low workload.",
    "Professor Roberts is such a gift to Yale and the reason why this course was such a valuable learning and living experience for so many. Everything she says is thoughtful and important, and she is able to convey the intricacies and importance of her work while still being very accessible to a wide variety of student backgrounds. The readings were largely great and the ability of the course coordinators to accommodate all the students who wanted to take it with enough TAs for section was a strength as well. Dr. Roberts' approach to learning rather than grades is innovative and incredibly effective, but I wish I would've gotten a bit more critical feedback on my thoughts and writing because I still spent a great deal of time and effort on the assignments. Some of the guest lecturers were better than others and with such a great professor you really want the guests to be strong if they are taking away from Dr. Roberts' time.",
    "Strengths- the lecture was so enticing and kept us interested the supplementary materials like videos and speeches were very great weaknesses- none!",
    "it was all around great",
    "Professor Roberts is a wonderful lecturer and powerful speaker. She cares very deeply and personally about the class as well as the material, and makes herself very accessible to students. Most lecturers fail to keep Yale's promise of accessibility to and interest in individual Yale students. We are lucky that Professor Roberts bucks that trend. A few logistical suggestions: please do not put the midterm exam the day after break; break should be for break and not for studying. Reweight the essays: why is the 750-1000 word critical response essay worth 10%, but the 750-1000 word final essay worth 30%? They don't need to be equal, but this is a big disparity. Rethink the historical figures: there are so many slides each dedicated to historical figures, and there is a section on the exam dedicated to them (as stated in the study guide), so we needed to study tons and tons of these, which was a lot.",
    "I honestly cannot think of a single way this course could be improved. Although it is a large lecture, each class was extremely interesting and engaging. Professor Roberts is the BEST LECTURER I have ever had and truly makes the class special. The class covers vitally important important in a productive manner. The only weakness I can think of is the lack of support it received from administration.",
    "Strengths: very well taught, low-pressure, emphasis on real learning Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "The class offered a lot of flexibility. Because there was so much material covered, Professor Roberts made the assignments incredibly open-ended to allow students to really delve into specific topics that were of greatest interest to them.",
    "strengths: The assignments were all different and required a different type of thinking than any other Yale course I have ever had. Taking the course was an entire experience that I've never had the opportunity to take, it felt as though the teacher was truly investing in not only my education but my personal growth as a knowledgeable and aware citizen in history. I felt this class had a true impact on every students character for the better in that we all became critical of how our education shapes us as people. All the faculty involved were invested in my learning and provided clear and significant feedback that improved my analysis of the material. weaknesses: none improvements: none",
    "SUCH A GOOD COURSE! Professor Roberts is an unbelievably talented lecturer, very accessible to EVERYONE. Of course class could occasionally be uncomfortable but she NEVER made anyone feel guilty."

    "YES! Everyone at Yale should take this course. This is a course not only about health but in the life we live in.",
    "Yes",

    "YES YES YES!!! One of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale!",
    "This class should be required.",
    "Yes!!! 100% would recommend this class because it will give you a perspective on black history and healthcare disparities that you can't find anywhere else.",
    "Yes, especially if they are pre med or history students",
    "1000%. everyone needs to take this course. it's academically easy and emotionally\/intellectually challenging. If it were academically more rigorous, it would be very difficult because the subject matter is very hard to stomach at times (slavery, rape, abuse, denial of human rights, violence, trauma...). this class changed my life. as a global health student, I feel like this class was crucial and pivotal in my understanding of the social determinants of health and how the healthcare operates...it rests and thrives on racism. PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. you won't regret it. there is no other course like this! no one teaches about racism and trauma through the lens of medicine besides prof roberts. she is an angel that wants to help you see critical issues in an approachable way. i LOVED this class. made my semester!",
    "I have recommended this class to countless peers already, as this course was incredibly valuable to me and everyone in the course currently with whom I have spoken.",
    "YES!",
    "I have already recommended this course to most of my friends and will continue to do so. Professor Roberts is an excellent professor who values her students and genuinely wishes that her students learn and actively engage with the material; one assignment included creating a sample lesson plan of the material and there was an electronic lottery that allowed some students to create and present one for members of the New Haven community. In fact, throughout this course, there were connections made between the material and New Haven, and specifically how students can use the material to strengthen their own bonds with the community. For the last lecture, Professor Roberts shared her ideas on continuing to teach others the material and her sheer passion and resilience throughout the course brought the class to tears as we left her with a standing ovation. This is the only class I have ever taken where something of this nature occurred as most of us were truly sad to see it end, but were still hopeful now that a new group of students are able to experience what we experienced this past semester. In truth, I wholeheartedly believe that every Yale student and faculty member should be required to take this course in whatever format possible.",
    "Yes! A great course to learn about AfAm history in a low-pressure class.",
    "Yes! This class is valuable to anyone, but especially those going into health or medicine.",
    "Absolutely. Everyone should take this course regardless of your anticipated profession or career. These are important topics to understand and be able to talk about. With that said, every pre-med student should undoubtedly take this course.",
    "YES. please take this class!! essential for every Yale student.",
    "YES!!! It's honestly one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. If you want to LEARN and come away from each class feeling so much more knowledgeable and motivated to make change in the world take this class!",
    "Yes!",
    "This course should be mandated for all health and science students. It should be a core class for public health students (undergrad and grad) and medical students as well. So yes!",
    "YES. Carolyn Roberts is reason enough to take this course. She is a superstar teacher, lecturer, and human being and it would be a shame not to experience her passion and kindness, as well as her incredible breadth of knowledge about African-American history.",
    "Absolutely I would recommend it to anyone who has medical ambitious as a must take course. It is so sad I had to wait until I came to Yale to have this course. This material should be taught every where and to anyone in medicine.",
    "YES. Every single student needs to take this, ESPECIALLY white people and also not black POC. This class should be a requirement for graduating. Every major should have a race\/ethics\/civil rights requirement, especially in STEM. This class is a LOW WORKLOAD and HIGH reward. This class challenges the Yale framework of what a lecture is supposed to look like. There is an INCREDIBLY caring professor, a low workload, and emotional\/interesting\/important\/relevant content. If you take this class and engage with it you will become a better person, see the world in a different way, and be a better ally (if you're not black). PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Yes, this is an important class to take, as we need to be cognizant of this part of American history to understand where we're at today. It's a great fifth class to take, as Professor Roberts emphasizes that students should care about the material more than the grade. Lectures were consistently engaging, and the assignments had enough freedom to be tailored to personal interests.",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this course to anyone who has the chance to take it. You learn so much about African American history and healthcare that is rarely taught anywhere else. Even if it is a topic that you have no experience in, you are given the opportunity to tie your own interests with the course material.",
    "This is a must take course. It should honestly be required. Understanding the historical context for all the health disparities and biases that exist in today's society will make you more determined and understanding of how to combat them for the rest of your life.",

    "Yes. This is the most amazing class I've taken at Yale. The subjects discussed are interesting and relevant to life.",
    "Everyone should take this course. It",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student regardless of their major or field of study. This course is the best course that I have taken so far at Yale and has completely changed how I approach my classes and how I live my everyday life. It provides such valuable insight into the lives of African Americans that is not well known.",
    "Absolutely. This would be the first course I recommend to anyone asking. Everyone at Yale should take this course.",
    "Yes. I think it's a class that should be taken for the intellectual benefit and not the easy A. It's an eye-opening class if anything.",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale. Every single lecture was fascinating, engaging and important. The way the material was presented made every single topic come to life in a very real way. The material is crucial for all students to know and I think very student at Yale should take this class.",
    "100% don't even hesitate, take this course! It is genuinely in my top 3 best courses I have taken at Yale. Carolyn Roberts is a literal gem and you will learn so much about how healthcare has shaped our society. So good definitely taken!",
    "Definitely. Great class, interesting work, interesting lectures. Very engaging.",
    "YES! Please take this course. It is such an awesome, low pressure course that forces you to deal with issues such as racism and inequality. I highly encourage you to take this course.",
    "YES. Professor Roberts is the best educator I've been able to experience. This class changed my life. I look at the world completely differently now.",
    "Yes. I think every student should take this course, I have told everyone I know to take it.",
    "Yes. This class is everything that I thought Yale would be. If you already know a lot about AFAM history, maybe it will be way too easy for you, but as long as you engage in the course, you will have an amazing experience. I am Asian, I am pre-med. And this might be the single most relevant class to my life and my future I could have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend this course, and any other that is taught by Prof. Roberts in a heart beat. To not take this course is a disservice to yourself and the very expensive education we are receiving. This is the only course at Yale that truly means something bigger than itself.",
    "Most definitely",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. I am glad to hear that Dean Chun is a fan of this course and it should be a 'signature course' for Yale. The truths that I learned in this class were way more important than the technical skills I learn in my STEM classes and I believe we're all better people for having participated in this class.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course covers a lot of important information that is rarely covered in other courses. It really changed my perspective of things and shocked me to see how little I know about the pain endured by black people. Professor Roberts is also an amazing professor.",
    "Absolutely! A must-take at Yale for every student.",
    "Absolutely. This class covers a history that is not often told and will revolutionize how you think about health. This class is so so important, and if you can take it, you absolutely should. Especially if you're considering a profession in health, but even if you're not, this information should be known by everyone. It is really hard content though, so definitely be prepared for some difficult lectures.",
    "YES! Every student who has the opportunity to take this class should take it, regardless of your major or career path. What you learn in this class helps you be a more informed citizen. Would absolutely recommend.",
    "Not only would I recommend this course to another student, I firmly believe that this should be a course that every single student at Yale takes before they graduate. This necessity sprouts from two key aspects of the course: the importance of the content and the experience of taking a course with Dr. Roberts. This class engages with an important history that is almost never talked about. We all know about the slave ships, plantations, Jim Crow, etc. But almost no-one knows about the role that doctors played on the slave ship, or the ways that plantation slaves used medicine as a form of resistance, or of the first black doctors and black medical schools, or of the black women's clubs who transformed community medicine. The course culminated in addressing some of the most pressing issues in modern medicine, such as the black maternal mortality rate and the early physiological aging of black Americans, and how these phenomena are linked to a long-standing history of black medical injustice. This content should be an essential part of a medical student's curriculum and I would strongly suggest to all my fellow premeds that you take this course if you plan on ever engaging with a black patient (so all of you). However, regardless of the content, I have to recommend this course for the chance to work with Dr. Roberts alone. This is my second course with her and I'm very upset that it seems like my last. She is the most dynamic, engaged, caring, well-read professor I have ever had. Every lecture is like a play and she's the lead. She thinks carefully about every word on every slide and delivers lectures with meaning and passion. She is a collector of primary source, news articles, books, and journals and shares it all with everyone. The assignments were creative (your other professors are lazy), well though out, and fun to complete. This course is a masterpiece and you need to take it NOW.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Roberts is an incredible lecturer but also took the time to try to get to know everyone that was taking the course, which is not easy in a large lecture course. The course material is emotionally challenging but important and put together in a way that I imagine has rarely if ever been done before. The ways in which Professor Roberts and the TF's challenge you to approach many historical moments in the U.S. and bring them to light in the context of things today is something that everyone, regardless of academic interest or career interest, should be doing.",
    "Yes! Should definitely be a class you take before you leave Yale. Will be one of the best classes I'll ever have taken. Everyone should know the information that was taught in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. This is the best course I have taken at Yale, and should be a requirement for all students.",
    "Okay, so first and foremost, if you have the chance to take this class, drop everything and take it! I literally dropped a class that Ill need to take for my major next year to get into it! I 110% recommend this class to everyone and anyone due to the relevancy of the materials that this course grapples with. I only ask that in taking this class students please be cognizant of their privilege and are truly open to bearing witness to the history and atrocities of racism in America. This class is truly unlike any other that you will encounter here at Yale or anywhere in the world. For once in my time here at Yale, I feel like I am taking a course that will extend with my far beyond Yale and truly make me a more informed citizen of the world. Moreover, Yale and any who has the privilege to take this course under the instruction of Professor Roberts should be honored. Dr. Roberts has a way of making a lecture class of 350+ students in SSS feel as if youre in a seminar of 15 people. She works to connect with all her students and literally has office hours all day for undergrads to speak with us! (like name one other professor that has so many appointments in academia, teaches, conducts independent research, and still finds time to have a meal or individual office hours for undergraduate nearly every day!!) However with that being said, in this semester I had that many individual in the Yale administration have not been supportive of this amazing class and what Professor Roberts is trying to dofacilitate discussion and acknowledgment of the traumatic history that built the US and the problems we are currently facing. This is disheartening to say the least. As a student, it saddens me that educators of such esteem here at Yale are not supportive of such a relevant and pressing discussion based class. As a person of color in this space, I am ashamed, yet not surprised in the slightest that administration at a university such as Yale have pushed back against such a course. Especially as a person with medical interests and from a FGLI minority background, Ive for once seen myself represented in academia. For once in my time here at Yale, Ive truly been able to engage with course content that seems relevant beyond my major, this is why I chose Yaleto have the experiences of taking classes that promoted critical thinking about the world around us. Yale continues to laude itself for being at the forefront, for being a premier institution across many fields, I truly want to believe this, yet if some administration members do not support courses such as this, then I can only see Yale as an archaic institution that continued to propagate inequity in the refusal to truly educate it students. I am however, very appreciative of administration, professors, and students that do support and advocate for course such as this one. To have support from admirations for this class means that they acknowledge the gravity of the materials we are engaging with; it means that the dark history of this country can be brought to the light and ensure that we educate one another. Grading aside, this is a course that should be promoted like Psychology and the Good Life because of it relevancy and the ability to show students to recognize and question the entrench inequities that exists in the US.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students of all years and all majors\/academic backgrounds. I think the content of this course is not only critical, but intriguing and relevant. I think that everyone should also get to experience Professor Roberts teaching.",
    "Absolutely! I think everyone should take this course at some point during their time at Yale. So many of these stories go untold in other history classes, but understanding them is vitally important. And Professor Roberts is the most wonderful human being ever. Her lectures are captivating, and she presents the material in a breathtakingly raw, honest way. Plus, the workload is relatively small, which is intentional; it fosters genuine engagement with the course material without the pressure of memorizing things for exams. Cannot recommend highly enough. Please take this class.",
    "YES A MILLION TIMES! Hard material but a fun course overall and necessary",
    "Highly recommend!! Must take!!",
    "Yes. 100%. I wish more classes were taught this way -- would result in a much more positive college experience.",
    "I would recommend this course in a second to another student because it is such an important topic, but most specifically because of the way that Professor Roberts taught the course and engaged all of us. It was an amazing community, both in lecture and in section, and I hope that everyone at Yale can experience a class like this at least once.",
    "Please take this course - it is by far the best course I've ever taken! Learning this history is so important, regardless of what you want to do in life, and you get to learn it from such a caring, passionate, and sensitive instructor. You will learn things in this course that will be very hard to come by at any other institution.",
    "YES!!! I would honestly make it a class that every single pre-med and really every single undergraduate should take. It is full of important historical precedents that affect our lives today and helps us better understand relationships with others and the issues at hand in society that need to be altered.",
    "YES !! Professor Roberts is amazing and committed to connecting with her students. She puts so much into this course and it would be a shame to be at Yale for 4 years and not take a course with her.",
    "YES! Take it!!! You will gain so much without too much work, it's a great fifth class",
    "Definitely! The best class I have taken at Yale so far!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course discusses themes and content that are critical for ALL students to learn, regardless of their major. The class really allows you to reshape your understanding of history and more broadly, knowledge itself.",
    "Absolutely. If you have an opportunity to take this class, take it. If I could take this course again I would. By far, THIS is the best class I have ever taken and honestly what I thought at first Yale would be but wasn't. I have left this class in shock and tears and at the same time empowered to enact change. This was not a class but a shared experience by everyone in the class.",
    "Of course!! Please take this course! PLEASE",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! If you are interested in medicine or the healthcare field, it is so important to learn this material. Even otherwise, learning about this history and its legacies is incredibly essential, so I would recommend it to anyone!",
    "YES. Please, if you have the chance to take this course, take it! It has honestly been life changing, and I don't mean that to sound too dramatic. This course gives you so much depth and context to issues of racism and prejudice in the US that we still see today. The lectures have oftentimes brought me to tears because of the material and presentation of that material covered daily. It is a class that every person should take no matter what major or career path they choose.",
    "Please please please take this course! It doesn't matter what you are studying, what you plan on doing after school, or how much you may already think you know about this topic. You will take away a whole new understanding of our country's history by confronting both the historical abuse of black people medically and the present day health disparities between black and white populations in the U.S. This is fundamental to the future state of our society, and the more people that arm and humble themselves with knowledge, the better.",
    "This class was the best class I have taken at Yale in terms of ratio of things learned \/ hours doing homework. The assignments felt relevant and forced me to place the concepts we learned in class in conversation with issues in the real world, and lectures were consistently interesting and engaging. This course should be required for all students at Yale.",
    "Yes! This material is extremely important for everyone to learn no matter how you're positioned relative to it. I only became more convinced of that as the semester went on. I always looked forward to going to lecture, and the class struck the perfect balance of being engaging but also low-stress. Take it!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to all students at Yale. The information that is taught in this class are so vital and are linked to the injustices faced by black and brown bodies.",
    "YES. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Roberts is the most incredible lecturer. It is evident that she genuinely cares about the course and every student. Very important things to learn for everyone - especially those going into the medical profession.",
    "Yes, everyone should take this course! This course is low workload but high learning and you get out of it what you put in.",
    "Absolutely. This course is extremely important for those who consider a career in medicine and public health.",
    "Definitely!!",
    "Absolutely! I could not recommend the class more highly. It is relevant to any major and the workload is not heavy.",
    "YES. It is something I hope everyone has the opportunity to take, because it is so important, and concerns everyone. It is a history we should not forget.",
    "YESSSSSSS, this should be a MANDATORY pre-med requirement.",
    "If you truly want to take a class that is made to actually teach you something, TAKE THIS CLASS! It is facilitated in a way like no other class at Yale. It pushes you to truly think past just the readings and the history; you must reflect on yourself.",
    "YESSSS!! Definitely take this course!! I honestly think it should be required for STEM students as well.",
    "MUST TAKE, BEST CLASS EVER",
    "Yes! Yes! Yes! This class is, by far, the best class I've taken at Yale. Dr. Roberts delivered this history, this dark, challenging, difficult-to-digest history, with so much power and with such a great desire to teach us. She wanted us to engage with the material, to think about it and analyze it and work it into the way that we think. This class taught me so so much and I love that it was Dr. Roberts who taught it.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. EVERY Yale student should take this.",
    "100000000000000% yes. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Everything you learn is so incredibly important- things everyone should know but that I definitely did not before this course. Professor Roberts cares so much about what she teaches and about every single person in the room, and listening to her lectures is something everyone at Yale should get to experience.",
    "YES - i strongly believe this class should be taken by every student at Yale, regardless of academic interests. this history is so important to be aware of, learning about the endless trail of abuse\/prejudice\/stereotypes from the atlantic slave trade to civil war to jim crow segregation to modern medical interactions is horrific but paradigm-shifting. class is low-stress but high-engagement, sections and lectures push you to think fundamentally differently from this point onwards, professor is amazing, the perfect course.",
    "Without a doubt in my mind, the only class I recommend to every student here at Yale",
    "Yes-- please do yourself a favor and take this amazing course. ESPECIALLY if you are interested in studying medicine or health policy, this course will change your view on the role of race and discrimination in human health.",
    "YES, TAKE IT. I shopped the first class and literally had tears in my eyes by the end because I knew it was going to change my life. The material can get really really hard at times, but Professor Roberts knows that and delivers it with the perfect amount of passion and respect. You will leave each class feeling empowered and motivated to make a change in our society. You will learn about history that you didn't even know about. You will learn about historical events that you did know about through a very different lens and it will really open your eyes. Everyone I've talked to this semester that didn't end up taking it, wishes they did. It will be the best class you ever take in your life, and the most valuable.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes!! This is definitely a must take",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This class made me so incredibly thankful that I chose to attend Yale. Professor Roberts is one of the sweetest and most dedicated professors I have ever met. The class clapped after EVERY SINGLE LECTURE. Each lecture was engaging, evocative, and powerful. We discussed a lot of painful material over the course of the semester, but the material is so important. It is everything about U.S. slavery that you should've learned in high school but probably did not - at least I didn't. Everyone should take this class, especially people who will enter the medical field. It gives you new insight into African American history and the history of the U.S. healthcare system.",
    "I could not recommend this course enough. This was the best course I have ever taken in my seven years of university education.",
    "Please take this class. If it is offered, you have to take it. It can make a good fifth (or even 6th) class if you just want to go to lecture and be inspired, or it can be an incredible academic experience if you decide to really engage with the material. Either way, you will not regret taking this class.",
    "I think every student should at least shop the course! It's so interesting and I just feel that everyone should get to know Dr. Roberts. The class really does provide valuable and interesting perspectives on basic American history. I found the amount of knowledge I was completely unaware of astonishing, which made this class all the more gratifying. You really learn with this class.",
    "I would, this class opened my eyes to the degree of structural racism and how it can even exist at Yale to a level that no other experience has been able to reach.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to everyone I know. I think this class is SO important for people to know. It should be mandatory.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to every Yale student. The information taught in this course is extremely important and sensitive, and is information that will affect the way I view the the world and change the way approach interactions with people from different backgrounds for the rest of my life. Professor Roberts is so inspiring in the way she conveys this information, and her passion and enthusiasm for the subject matter is contagious.",
    "This course should be mandatory for anyone studying medicine or public health.",
    "YES!!!! This class will change your understanding of race and United States history. The lectures were so moving.",
    "Yes! This was a very interesting course that sparked lots of meaningful conversations in and out of the classroom.",
    "Absolutely, if that student is willing to accept change and grow!",
    "Yes, I think everyone has something to learn from this class.",
    "I have no words to describe what Professor Roberts class means to me and the impact it has had on my life and academic career. This is the BEST class I have taken at Yale. Period. It is just superb so take it if it fits into your schedule. Dont even second guess it. She gives you all the assignments we have to do on the first day (including the extra credit questions for the midterm) and the grading is NOT hard she truly just wants you to learn. I have left this class crying so many times just moved by her lectures and I hope everyone gets the opportunity to experience her as a professor.",
    "100000%, especially because it breaks the stigma that you need to be worked to death to learn a lot",
    "Definitely. A very poignant way to put current events into historical perspective.",
    "YES! This should be a mandatory course for all Yalies. Every single class was like a TED talk. I don't think it would be as good without Professor Roberts. She cares so much about her students and what they learn. This class will teach you that sickness and health is not and has not been the same for all Americans. We learned how Black people have been systematically marginalized and used by the US medical system.",
    "Absolutely. I strongly believe that this will be the most rewarding course I will ever take at Yale and would strongly recommended every student to take this course and if not, do yourself a favor and take a class with Carolyn Roberts. It was an experience that was shaped the way I look at the world and regard history and I will be forever grateful for it.",
    "Definitely. This was hands down one of the best classes I have taken ever, let alone at Yale. You will gain such an appreciation for this material and will learn about our country's troubled past. As Professor Roberts explains: while this history is intense, disturbing, and difficult to discuss, it is necessary that we use truth and reconciliation to move towards making this country more equitable and equal on the basis of race, because there is a lot of work left to do. She creates an open spaceboth in section and lecturewhere we can discuss these ideas and grapple with them in the presence of each other. We applauded Prof. Roberts at the end of every lecture, if that gives you a sense of how much appreciation the students had for her and for the class.",
    "Definitely I believe every student at Yale, especially those that want to pursue a career in medicine, should take this course",
    "Yes, I took this class as just a humanities credit but learned about so many things that I never even had heard of before. I think that this course should be a requirement for every student at Yale.",
    "YES. This is such an important course.",
    "DEFINITELY! The best class",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course. Professor Roberts was an unbelievable professor who opened up my eyes to the world around me.",
    "There are not words for how amazing this class is. As a senior double major I can say that it is hands down the best course I have taken at Yale. I loved everything about this course. To be able to discuss the history of African Americans in the context of medicine and public health, in an academic setting was amazing and I learned so much. Every single day I looked forward to going to lecture and section they were some of the highlights of my entire week. If you are lucky, there are moments in an academic education that make you think and that change you in some way, and you know that that experience impacted the rest of your life. At Yale I have been able to experience a few of these moments, but never in my life have I experienced one as profound as I did in this class. Never have I been in a course where every day was a life shaking moment. Each day, my desire to learn more only grew larger. The learning environment was amazing and if I could take the course again I would over and over again because I know I would take away something different and new every time. If you do not take this class you are doing yourself a huge disservice because it is absolutely amazing. I am so happy that I was able to take it in my senior year and could not speak more highly of the experience.",
    "Absolutely! The course material is important, the readings were incredibly interesting, Professor Roberts is INCREDIBLE, the assignments weren't too much work and allowed us a lot of freedom to delve into topics we were invested in. I'm a senior and this is truly one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "YES YES YES YES YES YES. I would use the entire character count to keep saying yes. The only person I would not recommend this course to is someone who is weak of heart because the story being told is a tragedy and the content is very raw so if you don't think you can handle this history yet then work on yourself and then take the class.",
    "YES! Personally, I believe this course should be required for all potential pre-med students! It is a wonderful overview of the medical experiences of African Americans in this nation and helps add another much needed layer of empathy to the medical field.",
    "Yes! Professor Roberts is amazing and this course provides extremely useful knowledge.",
    "YES PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. The best class I have taken at Yale so far",
    "I would 100%, without a doubt, recommend this course to another student. The material is not covered in other classes. Even as an anthropology major, I have never been exposed to the racist roots of anthropology, which were presented in this class. I have never learned more in any other class I have taken at Yale, and if I were to recommend a single course out of all the classes I have ever taken at Yale, it would be this.",
    "I would a 100% recommend this course to anyone who asked me about it. Professor Roberts is gifted and an excellent lecturer, she changed my life",
    "Yes, absolutely if at all interested in social issues. Essential if pursuing area of medicine, medicinal practice",
    "Yes, this is the best class at Yale by far.",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "I would recommend this class to literally every student, and it should be required for every aspiring health professional, if not every student. Learning this history and its direct ties to today's realities is fundamental to achieving any sort of intergroup understanding and empathy, which is essential as the alternative is quite literally the premature and senseless loss of more lives. This course will wake you up.",
    "I would absolutely. This class opened my eyes - most history classes fail to accurately portray these details of historical events, and it is so important, especially in relation to movements today such as Black Lives Matter.",
    "Yes, all students should take this course so that they can improve their understanding of negative social processes that they might contribute to unknowingly.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is on another level from every other class I've taken at Yale.",
    "This course was by far my favorite course is the semester and it was probably the best class I could have taken to start my time at Yale. I think that anyone with an interest in history or aspirations to pursue a career in medicine or public health should absolutely take this course. Even if they do not this course would still be a great history course. It gives a historical narrative that is often forgotten and helps make connections from the past to the present.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I absolutely would. Amazing class. So much to learn.",
    "Yes! Every Yale student should be required to take this class before they graduate. This class has changed the way that I look at the world and for that I will be forever grateful. This class has given me an opportunity to restructure my thinking. I think that I will carry the knowledge that I learned in this class for the rest of my life. It is hands down the best class I have taken at Yale thus far. This class should continue to be offered for years to come",
    "Yes, you better take it. You will have no regrets!",
    "YES. Everyone should take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the intersection of race, medicine, and politics.",
    "Yes!!! Hands down just take it you will learn so much.",
    "The knowledge this class teaches should be mandatory for everyone.",
    "Absolutely. Don't hesitate, especially if you're pre-med.",
    "Yes, Professor Roberts is amazing. Her lectures were clear and always taught me something new. The assignments help the learning process as well.",
    "Yes, everyone should take this course!",
    "Yes. Obviously many people will take it because it is low stress, but the extremely high attendance rate is a testament to the captivating nature of the material and strength of the professor.",
    "Yes. It is the best class Ive taken at Yale so far.",
    "Everyone Should take this class",
    "Yes I would. You absolutely get what you put in to this class. The material is extremely relevant to anyone's life today, and it's not taught in other Yale classes (even ones about public health).",
    "Yes. This course was such a wonderful opportunity to deal with some really emotionally challenging material with a professor who not only is passionate about the material, but also cares deeply for the wellbeing of her students. Many people showed up to this class looking for a gut, but left with a totally different mindset. It's rare to find a class that balances a low workload with really high engagement.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Most United States history courses ignore the stories of marginalized people, so for someone who is unfamiliar with African American history this class will serve as an excellent introduction. Additionally, this class is well suited for anyone considering entering a career in medicine, since in this class you also discover the events and people that led to the modern day practice of United States medicine.",
    "Definitely needs to be taken",
    "Definitely recommend. This is a class that everyone should take.",
    "100%. Best class at Yale.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. It is the best course I have EVER taken at Yale.",
    "YES! Take this class you will not regret it and thats on jebena.",
    "This was the greatest class I have ever taken at Yale. The course should be a requirement. It was the only class I have ever taken where the professor received a standing ovation after every single lecture. Truly amazing! Professor Roberts is very intelligent and articulate. She truly cares about her students' well being and her passion for this class in particular shows.",
    "10\/10 would definitely recommend. Everyone should take this class to start getting informed about Americas history in medicine and learn how to change the game in American medicine today.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I was scared that this course was too woke for me and that I would have a hard time speaking up because I would be afraid to say something stupid and ignorant, but taking it was the best decision I have made so far during my career at Yale. I learned so, so much and anyone would benefit greatly by taking it.",
    "Absolutely, this was the best course that Ive taken at Yale!",
    "Yes, it was my favorite class. You will learn so much, and it will evoke strong feelings and move you in a way you probably haven't been before.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!! The material is definitely difficult to sit with, but I think thats why a course like this is so important! You learn about medicine tied to black history and the injustices black people have gone through, and hopefully come out of the class better informed about the world around us and our privilege as students in this class to go forth and spread this knowledge.",
    "Yes! Best course I have taken at Yale, and I wish there were more like it.",
    "YES YES YES. Take it, it is a wonderful and informative experience and very low stress.",
    "Definitely. Everyone should take this class.",
    "Yes! The most important course you can take at Yale.",
    "Wow. Sickness and Health in African American History has been the single best and most important class I have taken in my three years at Yale. Professor Roberts has artfully crafted a heartbreaking yet inspiring, and teary yet beautiful journey through Black oppression and powerful Black resilience in the face of adversity. This experience has fundamentally shifted how I plan to continue engaging in anti-racism work. She has raised the stakes and invited us all to join our hand in this fight regardless of how limited the scope of impact we are able to see in our lifetimes may be.",
    "Yes, without a doubt. This course is fantastic in what content it covers and even more so in teaching staff. Although it is not a difficult class to do well in, I think that the challenge lies in how you engage with the course materials. This course leaves room for so much growth in terms of empathy, and I think it is a can't miss for anyone remotely interested in the topic.",
    "Yes, because it teaches important history in an engaging way",
    "Yes, yes, a million times yes. This class is powerful, has a great purpose, and has great leadership. But, I actually dont recommend you take it if you wont have time to think about it. The way the course is structured, you can only reap the full benefits if you sit with and digest the powerful material. If youre just taking it to get a grade or a credit, youd be cheating yourself and are better off taking some other course.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, you will learn how to study, you will gain an emotional connection with the material, and you will enjoy the class.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. It should be mandatory for everyone on campus because it teaches empathy for black and brown people. It teaches how deeprooted many issues are.",
    "Without a doubt.",
    "Every student at Yale should be required to take this course.",
    "YES!! Professor Roberts is such a great lecturer. This is a class that everyone at Yale should take.",
    "Yes, it is a course that forces you to think about how the U.S. operates on racism and has used it to thrive for centuries with no thought given to those who have been affected negatively because of it.",
    "Yes. I thoroughly enjoyed lectures. The material is interesting, powerful and can get very \"heavy.\"",
    "yes",
    "Yes!!! This is a class that every student at Yle, everyone should take. The content is extremely relevant and important and the topics covered are interesting and impactful. 10\/10 would recommend!!",
    "Yes I would. This course would be beneficial for any Yale student to take.",
    "This course is important for everyone. The threads of racism and dehumanization can be followed to every aspect of human life and has its clear impact on the body of African Americans today. Everyone should learn this history and how they can be of help in dismantling this system of oppression. This course will break your heart in the most important way.",
    "A true gem! Dr. Roberts is the most passionate, caring, and inspiring professor I've ever had. Her teaching style makes history more accessible to all her students. The lectures were incredibly engaging and well-organized. The assignments were meaningful and facilitated learning, and the flexibility of the prompts allowed students to delve further into topics that they were interested in.",
    "Yes! This class will not be offered until Prof. Roberts returns from research leave, but once it is available in the Bluebook again - please, please take it! This class is a gem at Yale, and the content is urgent and oft-overlooked.",
    "This class is truly fantastic and worth everyone's time (regardless of major or academic interest). Carolyn Roberts was one of the best lectures I have ever seen.",
    "I definitely would. I think every student at Yale should take this course, and that the medical school should have this course as a requirement. That's how illuminating and essential this course is.",
    "yes, it is vital knowledge for every student",
    "Every student at Yale should take this course. It is particularly applicable to pre-med students as they embark on doctoral careers, but as a none pre-med I still got SO much out of it and am taking an immense amount away from this course.",
    "YES. please take this course if you have a chance. Professor Roberts is AMAZING. I think everyone at Yale should have to take this course, because it gives you such a deep understanding of how we (all of us, regardless of race) got to where we are today. I can't say enough how much I encourage everyone to take this class!!!!!",
    "Yes! Everyday I walked out of class mind-blown by the things Dr. Roberts lectured today.",
    "Yes, absolutely! This class should be required for every Yale student. It was simply the best course I have ever taken. I learned so much without feeling the typical pressures of normal classes. I found myself engaging in supplemental materials beyond the course syllabus. A necessary warning is that the course content can be very grave and saddening, making the class emotionally and mentally difficult.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student solely because of Professor Roberts. She made the course content very interesting and easily engaging.",
    "YES!! I think everybody should make an effort to take this class or another AfAm\/Hist class from Dr. Roberts. She's truly a life-changing professor and wonderful mentor if you get to know her (which you should!).",
    "YES! I believe everyone should take this class at Yale. You have to learn this information and way of thinking with the privilege that you have.",
    "if you wish to learn the truths pertaining to America, the treatment of black people in America and medicine, this course is the absolute best.",
    "Yes. If you are going into medicine, this course is super important, and I think you almost have a responsibility to take either this course or something like it. I'm not going into medicine, but still thought it was important material to understand as someone living in 21st century America today. Two other bonuses are that Professor Roberts is a fantastic lecturer, and it is extremely low stress; I'm pretty sure all 300+ people taking the class got an A besides those who literally didn't turn in assignments. When Professor Roberts says to focus on the course material rather than the grade, take her advice because you can, and will still turn out just fine.",
    "Yes!! Should be required for everyone to take, but especially pre-medical students. The subject matter in this course was difficult, and as a pre-med it was especially difficult to reconcile my future goals with the rampant historic injustices in the field. But by the end, I gained valuable knowledge that I know will help me be a better doctor in the future. More than that, it made me more resolute in my pursuit of medicine; there are so many problems, biases, and inequalities, and taking this course made me see ways in which I could make a direct impact.",
    "Yes! Absolutely would recommend. It is a really hard class to stomach because it is a really tough history, and each class it feels like it only gets worse. But it is so so important and Prof. Roberts is such an amazing professor.",
    "Absolutely. A great way to learn about really important material.",
    "Yes. This was a very informative class. It taught me a lot about contemporary issues that I otherwise wouldn't have been as knowledgable about while connecting said issues to concrete examples in history.",
    "Yes, it opens your eyes to a whole different side of history that is rarely taught. You learn the importance of being critical of history and who is telling it. I think goes far beyond improving your academic skills in writing and analysis, extending as far as your ability to think critically about the world around you.",
    "YES this is a great class and I'm sure I'm not the first to say it."
