    "This class is not about learning new science, but about practicing skills that will be useful in academia (paper-writing, presentation). Parts of this class will feel like busy-work, especially the two papers\/presentations in the first half of the semester. Not hard, just something to plow through. The grant-style paper in the second half isn't bad either, and you go through a long process writing it. Participating in the peer review is a little disturbing, since you realize just how quickly people skim others' papers - and how quickly your review committee will skim your grants in 10 years. Overall, not a hard class. Weekly presentations from department members are fun, but unrelated to the graded assignments.",
    "Broad overview of BME. Yes. You need this class if you're a senior in the major.",
    "You have to take it. It won't take up too much time but it will take up some time. Class will range to boring to really interesting based on the presenter. You can't use your laptops in class so multi-tasking isn't an option. :(",
    "A good course for making you more comfortable with giving presentations and writing research grants."
