   "comments": [
    "A weird dynamic -Snyder is brilliant but clearly prefers lecturing, so take his lecture. Too much reading to do for a seminar meeting, meaning no one did it, so class discussion was halting and awkward, and the dynamic between Snyder and Silverstein was truly bizarre. Also a final paper based almost exclusively on primary sources where they expect you to speak other languages, which seemed unfairly demanding for underclassmen.",
    "Overall, I'm pleased I took this course. The subject matter was fascinating, the readings compelling, and the professors engaging. A few faults: one though the course in principle was to cover all of Eastern Europe, in reality it dealt mainly with Poland, Sara's area of expertise. The subject matter became a bit repetitive toward the end, but Sara mentioned that she felt the same way and would alter the syllabus in the future. Second, though Professor Snyder is a world-class scholar and an excellent communicator, he definitely left the administration of the course and the actual leading of the seminar with Sara, which is fine, but adjust your expectations accordingly. He also travels a lot and is occasionally absent; this is also true for his lecture course. But overall, Sara is pretty good (and excellent for a grad student). I wish Snyder were more involved, but that didn't stop the course from being worthwhile.",
    "TAKE IT!!! A great discussion with an incredible professor and an equally impressive grad student! The readings might bet heavy, but it's totally worth it!",
    "If this course is ever offered again, take it if the positives mentioned below outweigh the negatives also mentioned below. Positives: The course provides a good overview of the communist takeovers in Eastern Europe, and covers important material for anyone interested in 20th Century European history. You get to learn all about communism and how awful it was to be a zionist bourgeois intellectual (which you will discover you most likely are too). Whenever Professor Snyder would participate it was great, and overall I think I am glad I took the course. Negatives: the readings were long and often repetitive and class discussion was not always enlightening - a lot of the time the course felt like a training ground for the graduate student. It is also a fair amount of reading and the final primary source paper was kind of miserable, especially if you speak no Eastern European languages. The material is also very depressing almost all of the time.",
    "An in-depth seminar on the history of Communist takeovers; though not too heavy on the assignments, there is a lot of reading. All of it, however, is very fascinating and provides an intriguing look at a key moment in European and world history.",
    "It's a must take as a history major, and a great class in general.",
    "A great course- mostly led by Sara Silverstein, but Professor Snyder also contributed to discussion, and read over our papers. A very focused examination of the way that the Soviet Union gradually gained control over several countries in Eastern Europe; particular focus on Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Very little military history, more cultural, political, and social history.",
    "Take this class!! If you want to know more about communism, totalitarianism, World War II, or Eastern European history (especially intellectual history), this course is just great! The subject's really important and relevant, the sub-topics are really interesting, the readings are the best, and the teaching is great."
