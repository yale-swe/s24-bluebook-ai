    "Take this class if you want an ERM or Am Stud class that studies very contemporary issues within a larger historical scholarship.",
    "It's a solid class. There wasn't anything that I came across (in seminar or in the readings) that really blew my mind, but it was interesting stuff for the most part. Professor Brander-Rasmussen is great; however, the seminar sometimes felt more like a lecture, which wasn't that terrible because the Prof is really good. Kind of a lot of reading, but it's not all super necessary. All in all, a pretty middle-of-the-road course.",
    "Definitely recommend this class",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, DO IT. Very little work, lots of fun, lots of learning=amazing!",
    "looking back, i don't think i would have taken this class. for a seminar, it was way too big (~22 students) to be an effective seminar. oftentimes, it felt like a lecture because the prof talked more than the students. discussion wasn't that intellectually stimulating, but of course that depends on the students. the readings were interesting, though, so i would recommend taking this class if you want to learn more about viewpoints on ethnicity and race in an academic setting.",
    "This course provides a survey of different theories of race and ethnicity. We read some Angela Davis along with contemporary writers and scholars who discuss more current structural inequalities such as the prison-industrial complex and mass incarceration. We also observe through class assignments - which include designing your own ethnic studies department, discovering your own narrative and location in American history, and explaining the time when you first became aware of your racial identity - how to use our individual experiences as Americans in this increasingly diverse and multicultural nation to produce scholarly texts of our own. The class also compels students, just because of the harsh reality it presents, to contemplate hypothetical solutions to structural inequality and methods for facilitating racially and ethnically inclusive research. In short, we even examine whether ethnic studies is a worthwhile discipline and how we make it as inclusive for all minorities and exclusive (in order to prevent generalizations) as possible.",
    "A course comparing the histories and narratives of all the major American minority groups: Asian, Native, Chicano, African. We learn about relevant topics such as illegal immigration, the prison industrial complex, minority education etc. A lot of reading per week, but not necessary to do all of it. Minimal writing assignments- only three- but easy topics. Discussions often devolved into personal anecdotes about respective minority groups. If you're interested in issues of identity and want to gain a foundational history in comparative ethnic studies in the US, take this course.",
    "This is a class that every Yalie should take. Not just because it has minimal work, but because it truly prepares you to be an educated human in this world. If everyone in the world took this class, then we might be in a much better place. The class if fun, easy work load, thought-provoking, and will follow you the rest of your life. Take it, no questions.",
    "Comparative Ethnic Studies is a great class -- fascinating readings on processes of racial formation, historical and contemporary. Lots of opportunities to reflect on your own ethno-racial identity. Workload is highly manageable. Prof. Brander Rasmussen is wonderful. One drawback: this year's seminar had so many students in it that most discussions weren't too dynamic.",
    "Read the syllabus",
    "This course is so unique within the AMSTUD and ERM departments. It gives us an in-depth overview of the current obstacles and battles both disciplines are facing and relates them to the political climate in the USA. It is a great course and allows us to study the rise of ethnic studies in the US. Take this class if you are interested in current topics revolving around how policy affects how different ethnic groups and communities function within the USA today.",
    "Phenomenal class. Birgit is such a boss, and there's a lot of reading (but it's all not required as you'll find out). Sparks a lot of interesting discussion that is generally not had"
