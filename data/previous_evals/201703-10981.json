    "Mostly transport problem setup, setting BC and understanding how solutions should look like.",
    "A great deal of insights into various ways of solving partial differential equations. knowledge about solving coupled transport problems, boundary layer solutions etc.",
    "Taking this course I learned all the tools needed to solve any graduate level transport phenomena problem. Furthermore, the theory and physics underlying the subject were well described from basic index notation concepts up to complex non-linear problems. I developed important mathematical skills and a more profound insights specially with respect to heat and mass transfer problems. Based on matched asymptotic methods helped me understand well posed problems in the literature such as the similarity solution of boundary layer problems. I wish Prof. Amir had more time to cover the last chapters of the book which would definitely broaden my understanding of the subject."

   "comments": [
    "I did learn a lot in this course. But it is very difficult, and I don't know if I am gonna use the knowledge I learnt from this course any more.",
    "The homework assignments were way too long, especially in the first half of the course. It would have been helpful if lecture notes were posted at least a day in advance so that we could review them before coming to class. The first exam felt fair. The second exam was much too long and difficult, especially when you had to be able to get the first part to complete subsequent parts of the question. I would suggest shortening the exam and making the questions more independent of each other.",
    "Strength:it is very useful for engineering students weakness: the problems and real situations are complicated",
    "Strengths: The structure of the course is very logical and sequential. The note that the professor provided is pretty clear and helpful! Weakness: Because all we considered is a model, not a real question, the introduction of each section is a little bit abstract and hard to follow.",
    "It was taught in a very mathematical way. Very hard to understand.",
    "The course is very well organized but many lecture classes are completely aviodable. The professor knows the lecture very well but fails to convey the physics of the problem being solved. Although interesting some mathematical concepts were unnecessarily complicated",
    "Strength: a lot of relevant material was presented weakness: poor delivery of material. It felt as if the instructor was simply coming and solving problems. although it was important from the point of view of solving questions in exam ...it failed to give a more intimate feel of the course itself. felt like a math, problem-solving course",
    "Strengths: the course was very well taught and conducted along the semester. The problem sets encompassed important mathematical challenges that really helps the development of the student that is keen to learn transport phenomena. Lecture notes were very carefully written and really helped reading the theory of the book. Weakness: I had a good time taking this course and my only suggestion would be to focus a little bit more on physical insights and examples during the lecture."

    "No",
    "It is useful for anybody in engineering",
    "yes . only if the student has research interest in the subject. it has intense workload.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to a student who wants to enhance and broaden his\/her knowledge in transport phenomena. The reason is because the course is very well organized, the theory is clearly exposed in class and in the lecture notes\/book, and because it is a good chance for the student to review basic and complex math that a typical PhD student in engineering might face along his\/her formation or career."
