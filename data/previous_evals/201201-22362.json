    "Take this class. Brilliant professor, engaging classmates, fascinating topics. Also, the readings for this class are AMAZING. TAKE IT.",
    "Yes! Take it for sure. It's very interesting and the workload isn't bad - one paper at the end of the semester and a very reasonable amount of reading.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it but knowing it can be two things: 1) a light course where you can get by doing little in a tough semester or 2) the heaviest reading course in a light semester where you elect to get much out of it and do all the readings",
    "Nonviolence and Political Power investigates the dynamics of nonviolent social movements in the 20th century, starting with Gandhi and expanding to other movements and philosophies. It's a fascinating course, and for someone hoping to effect social change, both inspiring and practical. Take it.",
    "Yes, i would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about non-violence.",
    "This is an excellent introduction to an important political phenomenon. It is wide-ranging, combining theoretical reflection with readings on a wide variety of historical situations and movements. Prof. Schell is an excellent instructor, with a superb grasp of the material. The reading assignments are large, but there is only one final paper.",
    "The class might be overly idealistic, but will harbor many stimulating discussions. The readings are all really interesting, of which I strongly recommend Hannah Arendt's \"On Violence.\" Schell is not the most engaging professor, but he's super nice and the class isn't a lot of work at all (the 20 page term paper accounts for 70% of the grade, and the other 30% is participation). One word of advice: DO NOT BUY ALL OF THE BOOKS. You will have to purchase a huge ass course packet that has 90% of the reading. You will have to choose a very specific topic for your term paper anyway, and there's absolutely no need to buy all of the books for the class. Do yourself a favor and save $150.",
    "Essentially a summary of nonviolent political movements across the world. Fantastic if you're interested in activism, which was my background - it was nice to finally understand Gandhi instead of just random quotes. Schell is a great teacher, and the reading is always manageable. I would highly, highly recommend if you can get in!!"
