    "The only work is papers, and make sure you participate in class.",
    "This class was really interesting and I learned a lot. There are weekly readings and discussion, but the core work is made up of a few short papers and one final paper. I knew nothing about south asia but came away knowing lots.",
    "Great if you have low-medium exposure to the region. There were some kids from S. Asia in the class and they knew way too much for the class. If you're from the region, you might get bored. She did intentionally try and have a class with mixed knowledge.",
    "The class was a great and interesting class. It is what you make of it. If you decide to not do the readings, you can still do well in class by participating in class and doing well on the papers. But if you want to learn the topic, doing your readings will give you a broad introduction on countries in South Asia not usually covered in South Asian Studies classes' curriculum. This class covered Sri Lanka and Afghanistan which was a nice addition to the usually India-centered curriculum offered.",
    "It's a great way to understand much of what's going on in the world today by studying the India-Pakistan conflict, as well as the Afghanistan issue and other minor situations on the side. There is an opportunity to study a topic of choice in more depth with a research paper at the end of the semester. A great class with a wonderful professor!",
    "great intro to south asia",
    "Good class. Not too much work - 2 5pg papers and a 10-15 pg paper, discussions every week. Overall would recommend the class.",
    "Yes, take it! You'll walk away with a good understanding of the subject area.",
    "Take it if you are interested in South Asia (India, Pakistan, and even Afghanistan and Sri Lanka) and international relations. You do not need any background knowledge, and the professor is very nice and encouraging. The workload is very manageable, the grading is reasonable, and basically the class works like most Yale seminars: you do the reading, and discuss it for most of the class. The class also covers Afghanistan, the Taliban, and the ways in which the Cold War affected the region, which was very interesting. I recommend the class.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it. Probably one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale thus far. The course is a comprehensive survey of the political dynamics within the South Asian region. It also covers the history of how the current political scenarios came about. Discussion among the students could have been better but there were exciting discussions nonetheless. Professor Hanson is probably one of the best Professors I've had at Yale so far. She knows a lot about the region and is always willing to talk to you and help you out with any issues.",
    "It's a great survey course in a seminar format - the best of both world. I would recommend this course, however, only for students with little experience with topics on South Asia. You learn a lot of background history that may be redundant if you've taken other courses. If you take the class to become more informed about the area (the class focused a lot on India and Pakistan, with a week on the Tamil-Sinhalese conflict, and then the immediate aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan), you will get a lot - just do the readings and pay attention in class. Prof Hanson is wonderful, kind, and very eager to help her students.",
    "Would definitely recommend it to somebody who wants an introductory course on South Asia.",
    "YES! No matter if you're an expert on the region, nor you know nothing (like I did) you'll get a lot out of this class. Professor Hanson is such a sweetheart and it's always a pleasure to be in her class. Workload is not that terrible and readings are easy to do. Try to get in!"
