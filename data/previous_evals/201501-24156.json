    "This is a good course if you're not familiar with issues related to development and aid and want an easy class.",
    "Especially if interested in understanding the real nuances of civil wars, take this class. You will participate in your learning.",
    "A great course on complex emergencies. Will definitely recommend it to another yalie.",
    "GLBL 627 is a class on South Sudan whose lessons can be applied to humanitarian cases around the world. You learn about the history of South Sudan, the challenges of humanitarian assistance, food delivery and it basically gives you an understanding of how to respond in emergency scenarios.",
    "I would like to see less student presentation time in order to learn more from the professor. However, the students in the class came from diverse backgrounds so their perspectives were incredibly valuable. In addition, I believe the class will continue to improve as the blog and map projects are developed. This assignment is incredible unique and was an innovative way to engage with the material and think about how to synthesize what you have learned to transfer it to others."

   "comments": [
    "I gained an understanding of MSF's operations. It did not contribute to my research.",
    "Very much!",
    "I found the course extremely informative and insightful. I had a minimal understanding of South Sudan colonial history and this course definitely taught me a lot.",
    "Learning from an expert in the field like Professor K was an amazing experience. It was a great exercise to think about a current situation in a complex and interdisciplinary way while learning from the views of a diverse range of students. This course did not contribute to my dissertation or research.",
    "I have an enriched knowledge about how Complex emergencies are handled especially with respect to South Sudan. I have relatively in-depth knowledge of South Sudan, its politics, history, economic challenges etc. It has been a very useful course and mets all my objectives for taking it."
