    "This course didn't deepen my knowledge of ecology&evolutionary biology, and that is my main complaint about it. I personally would have enjoyed it more if it had been a little more academic, and less as though the faculty were presenting their latest research talk to us. Not that the talks weren't interesting, just that I didn't learn as much from them as I would have if we'd actually discussed papers.I don't think this course contributed to my dissertation\/research."
