   "comments": [
    "You're taking this because you heard it was a gut CS credit. Well, just make sure you have a Windows laptop or you have MacBook OS 10.9.",
    "The professor is extremely nice and the TAs are extremely helpful. It's a very broad class so you end up learning only a little about everything. The first half has very light homework but the second half has a few more time intensive problem sets.",
    "A hard class, a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. Don't underestimate the difficulty of the problem sets or tests. You will definitely have to put in work.",
    "An okay CS course; not really CS as it is a combination of cogsci, psychology, a bit of CS, etc. Don't need any math background, and there is very little C programming. Lectures are good but assignments are poorly explained and not very good. Overall it could have been a lot better, but is still okay.",
    "CPSC 472 is a broad survey of robotics. It's not technically difficult - there's very little math and only a moderate amount of programming. It's a good class if you want a broad overview of robotics. I personally like classes with more technical information \/ math, so it was a little disappointing for me. It's well taught and the grading is fair.",
    "Yeah take it. Good CS elective and super interesting. Some coding involved but mostly conceptual stuff, which is interesting and relevant to CS and especially to robotics (duh)",
    "CPSC 472 was a great class overall. Professor Scassellati is a fantastic lecturer, and this was definitely the greatest strength of the class. We covered both theoretical and practical aspects of intelligent robotics, and there were several guest lectures related to research in social robotics that is currently being done at Yale. When I first enrolled, I was not sure how interested I was in the material, but the lectures were so good that I really became invested in the concepts. Some of the problem sets were a little vague, and most of the work was concentrated in the last few weeks of the course, but there are only five of them. The midterm and final were pretty straightforward. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I think this class is definitely worth trying out! You learn about the ways people have approached AI. For example, self-driving cars rely on internal programs, which cast votes on which direction to turn. There's even algorithms that simulate evolution\/survival of the fittest to design robots! The problem sets are decent. Some of them involve coding to implement behaviors, and others involve designing something using a particular framework. Overall, I'm glad I took this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student if they're at all interested in AI. It's a bit of a hipster elective for me, who is more systems-oriented and don't really see the point of robots at any point in the near future yet, given where we are right now in terms of AI, but this course still engaged me a lot and I enjoyed it.",
    "A good course about different architecture, robots, strategies, etc, for developing robots with intelligent behaviors. The class covers a wide range of topics, so you'll probably love some parts and think others are boring. In general though it was an solid course, and a good foundation for learning about intelligent robotics. Homework towards the end of the semester included programming some simple machine learning and genetic algorithms. Overall, recommend the course, probably one of the stronger CS electives.",
    "Great lecture. Scaz loves what he's talking about and it shows! You need to know C for a couple of psets (there are only 5 across the whole semester), but overall the material is great and well delivered. Go to class! He posts the slides but you'll do much better on exams (even with less studying) if you're there in class, because he keeps it interesting and engaging, and purposefully makes the midterm to test whether you were there or not as well as how well you know the material.",
    "Intelligent robotics was a fantastic course. Scaz is engaging and very caring about his students. The course was a somewhat high level, so the problem sets felt oddly applied. The TA's were hit or miss, but the good ones were great. A really fun, low key, and interesting class.",
    "Great class on robotics - would recommend to any CS major as well as people just generally interested in the field. This is a very multi-disciplinary course, covering material from cognitive science, psychology, sociology, CS and electrical and mechanical engineering amongst others",
    "Not quite what you might expect but a pretty good class. Cryptic powerpoints but easy to follow lectures. Relatively nondemanding psets. Unfair midterm, fair final.",
    "I enjoyed this class. It's a survey, so you will cover a lot of things in very little depth. Sometimes some topics feel a little random, but Scaz is awesome.",
    "Id totally recommend robotics, especially for CS majors that need an elective. It's fresh and different, a nice break from structures and programs.",
    "It's not a ton of work, but you won't get much out of it at all. Take a different CS elective.",
    "Broad survey of history of robots (aka all the things that didn't work), rather than an in-depth focus of any particular topic. Course starts out interesting but gets tedious towards the end. Better than any other CS elective though. Also Webots, the software you use for half of the assignments, is annoyingly buggy and crashed a couple of my friends' computers.",
    "A great class. Take it. The problem sets are relatively easy, and Scaz is an awesome lecturer. Class time is always interesting, and there were only 4 actual problem sets. I also feel like I now have a good understanding of robotics fundamentals.",
    "This course is easy and the professor's lectures are wonderful. The course could be improved by eliminating the guest lectures which were uniformly terrible. Unfortunately, one of those incompetent lecturers will be teaching the course next year. Therefore, I recommend avoiding the course.",
    "A good introduction to the field of robotics. You spent quite a bit of time focusing on robot actuators and kinematics, so expect that in addition to architectures for intelligent robots. Scaz is a great lecturer so the classes are fun. The problem sets are extremely challenging and unrepresentative of what you learn in class, and the tests are quite difficult because it's hard to know what to study. The material is interesting but this will not be an easy class.",
    "Take this class, especially if Scaz is teaching it! The content is so so interesting, and so well taught. It's more of a conceptual class than a technical class, and covers so much breadth in the field of robotics. Definitely a good introduction to robotics and a very well constructed narrative in the lectures. Lecture is fun, psets are not too difficult (although they can be time consuming), and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Intelligent Robotics is a great course. A fun CS elective, it's a great survey of AI and psychology that is relevant to the subject. Scaz is a really good lecturer and great professor. I thought the guest lectures were a little weak and the last 2 problem sets, while hard, were really fun and challenging. I enjoyed the class and recommend this CS elective to any major!",
    "You'll leave every lecture either thinking about how cool robots are or about how pointless that lecture was. Some lectures approach pop science levels of fluff, but the other ones are well-presented and interesting. You'll also have to suffer through some decidedly mediocre guest lectures, but at least there's not too much work for a CS class.",
    "Take it! Interesting material, not too much work.",
    "This course is interesting and well taught. Speak with Scaz outside of class, he's very approachable and interesting!",
    "Super interesting course! You may think it is easier than other CS electives but it's still quite a bit of work. Don't slack off! Scaz is a great lecturer and the workload is super manageable. Make sure you study hard for the exam, since it's all memorization and course concepts.",
    "This course is a superb introduction to a number of topics including robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Obviously, due to its survey nature, youre not going to get extremely detailed treatments of any of those topics. But you will get a great sense of the big picture: what it means to build intelligent robots, how the modern hybrid architecture is a product of past attempts to build intelligent robots, and how to go about actually implementing the important parts, both in hardware and in software. Its a VERY refreshing and fun computer science elective, which practically speaking, doesnt require much more than some proficiency with basic programming skills. I would wholeheartedly recommend the course.",
    "This is a good class if you need a CS credit without too much work.",
    "Great course lecture based and a bit more liberal arts than computer science. Intelligent robotics was a fun laid back course.",
    "This course is fairly different from most other CS electives. Lectures survey at a bunch of different topics without going into too much depth for any of them. Most of the material is interesting stuff on robot design and robot architecture. However, some of the lectures are pure cognitive science and psychology and these are totally boring and useless for a CS person. Also, there are 5 different guest lectures that happen during the semester from people in the social robotics lab and these are all somewhat useless and boring. And even in the robotics lectures there are times when it feels like you're learning random disparate details about different robot models or different examples that don't have any real teaching value. Still, the class is interesting and its easy as far as CS classes. go.",
    "Overall interesting, not programming intensive course. Psets weren't that time intensive, but midterm and final were sort of weird (especially the final where you got to take in 2 sheets of notes, and a lot of the test was based on if you randomly happened to put a specific equation or slide on your note sheet).",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for an easy CS elective- not that much programming experience required (only the last two psets out of five require basic programming). Definitely do not take it if you are looking for a fun class where you will learn a lot- it was pretty boring and seemed like a historical survey for most of it.",
    "It's an awesome course. Scaz is an excellent lecturer, and I highly recommend the course. Problem sets CAN be a little bit wonky (WeBots has some problems with some operating systems, and the written problem sets can be sometimes be a bit strange\/harshly graded, requiring you to go to office hours before they're due), and the exams can be difficult (but they're fair if you've studied), but the actual teaching in the course is excellent. The course is a bit on the soft side, but it's an excellent departure from some of the mind-numbing courses in the department. The lectures are more on the humanities side, the the technical aspects taught in lecture aren't too bad if you pay attention.",
    "This class is great for majors and non-majors alike. There are two problem sets at the end of the semester which require basic C, but otherwise there is no programming. The lecture moves quickly and covers a lot of material, but that is not reflected in the problem sets. Very interesting stuff.",
    "I would recommend this class.The lectures for this class are great. Professor Scassellati is very engaging and tells interesting stories. I actually didn't find the material as interesting as I thought I would. The material is very abstract and it was sometimes hard for me to connect what we were learning with anything of value. This class will not teach you how to actually build a robot, so don't go in expecting that. Overall its a decent class and maybe a great one if you are into the material.",
    "Intelligent Robotics was a fascinating course probably the most interesting CS elective Ive taken so far. The class centered around the question of intelligence what makes a system intelligent and why havent we been able to build one to date? We spent the first part of the course focusing on a series of architectures used to build robotic system starting with traditional architectures, behavior-based architectures and culminating with a discussion of the multi-tiered systems that power the Mars Rovers, have driven autonomous vehicles, and are the focus of research today. In the second half of the course, we discussed the various technologies used in building robots sensors, actuators, etc. The workload was reasonable readings, 5 problem sets, and two exams. All in all, an awesome class!"
