    "Excellent class.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to any student in physics who is interested in the subject matter, or will find it useful for an experiment, or is just itching to be taught by an experimentalist for a change.",
    "yes, this is a very useful class for modern day experimentalist and engineers in a world where RF and RF oscillators and well as MW components on chip take a pervasive part",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who works with microwaves. I do not imagine there to be a lot of relevance outside of that niche.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone working in a field that uses microwave components and to physicists and engineers with any interest in microwave technology. It's fun.",
    "Students who need to do research on microwave should definitely take it",
    "Definitely would recommend this course to experimentalists in condensed matter and quantum information. It's very helpful and provides lots of insights into the subject-matter."

    "The class gave me a broad overview of microwave electronics which was very relevant to my research, and will inform future reading on the subject.",
    "Highly relevant and useful for day to day work",
    "I am working with microwave structures and using microwave components to build circuits as part of my research, so this course was extremely relevant to my daily activities.",
    "Give another approach other than optics",
    "This has elucidated past and present projects, and I know that what I've learned will be very applicable to my work in the future, not just in this lab."
