    "I learned to think critically about the broader concerns in my field and about my field's history.",
    "I have increased my understanding of subfields other than my own within Classics. This proseminar was very helpful in terms of creating the low-pressure environment in which I was able to do this along with fellow graduate students from other subfields, allowing me to learn about these subfields in a way that I would not be able to by simply reading on my own.",
    "The course has provided me with a good knowledge of the main issues and debates within the discipline, as well as with a greater understanding of the different approaches to classical studies."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of the sessions could have used less time and made room for other sessions (i.e. less time for numismatics to make room for epigraphy). More thorough bibliographies particularly for primary sources would be very helpful. But considering that this was a proseminar that could be taken for pass\/fail, we really learned a lot without an excessive amount of work. Our discussions were always extremely productive and engaging. The proseminar helped fill in a lot of missing pieces of knowledge--for instance, the proseminar gave me context for and information about a lot of important names and figures I'd heard tossed around in undergrad. It also gave me a clearer timeline for important figures\/schools of thought in scholarship.",
    "One of the strengths is definitely the breadth of material covered, as well as the combination of theoretical discussions with more hands-on sessions, such as those in the Yale Art Gallery, or the sessions on paleography and papyrology at the Beinecke. On a more practical level, the fact that the course also requires students to lead two classes each has been really useful as a sort of introductory training in teaching, and thinking about the reading also in terms of how to organize a discussion about it. In class, we have discussed the possibility of switching the order of some of the classes, so as to make the course more coherent, in order to improve an already well-structured seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is very useful for a classicist wanting to fill in gaps of knowledge about scholarship\/the history of scholarship that isn't really systematically taught in any other course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to first-year Classics graduate students. In particular, it was a helpful introduction to the history of Classics scholarship.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course offers more than a simple introduction to the discipline: it allows students to engage with the main issues that both define and challenge the field, and encourages them to think about how some aspects of the discipline are changing, and what role future classicists might have in shaping the field. It also offers the possibility to get an insight into sub-fields within classical studies with which one may not be familiar. This has definitely helped me think differently about my own research and about how other sub-fields might contribute to shaping it."
