    "if you want to learn pde, this class is wonderful, just be sure to spend time thinking about the material so you can have a good understanding of it.",
    "I would definitely reccomend Math 247 to another student. The workload is manageable since the HW sets are not graded, and this information is extremely useful, especially to someone interested in physics. Take this class if you are interested in learning a variety of methods for solving PDE's.",
    "Great class, very interesting. The workload is very reasonable. And it's fun having three different professors.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those with a strong math background. PDE's are essential to studying any sort of physical science."
