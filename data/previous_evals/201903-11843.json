    "My Spanish improved drastically during my time in this course.",
    "A conversational fluidity in Spanish. Reading skills. Writing skills. Comprehension skills.",
    "I became significantly more comfortable with conversational spanish",
    "I learned a variety of advanced Spanish techniques, such as analysis of complex written texts, an array of vocabulary, and advanced grammar techniques."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Cividanes was fantastic, but sometimes it felt like the syllabus was disjoint. I'm not sold on the efficacy of learning mass amounts of vocab, being tested once, and then forgetting it immediately. The presentations also ate up a lot of class time and I'm not sure the audience got much out of them.",
    "The strength was clearly Professor Cividanes: she was incredible, gave clear feedback, and her passion for teaching and care for her students was clear. The weakness was all of the readings we had and the assessments.",
    "The class is really great for practicing your Spanish grammar and getting comfortable speaking and writing. think the class is very fast-paced and a lot of that has to do with memorizing a bunch of vocab words for a test and then never looking at them again.",
    "The course could be with more opportunities for speaking in a potentially more native format (ie going on some sort of field-trip where students can spend the day with native speakers).",
    "This course is very structured and does a good job teaching all necessary grammar components. It could be improved by providing more feedback for speaking abilities and avoiding repetition.",
    "This is a very strong class. There is consistent, nightly work, but it is never out of hand or unreasonable. Outside of class work always brings class forward.",
    "The course is structured similarly to any Yale Spanish course and assigns nightly homework. In this regard, it proves rather immutable. I found that exam questions were often irrelevant or poorly modeled on in-class discussion and practice or made significantly more ambiguous\/difficult.",
    "As much as I dislike it, meeting every day is a huge plus. However, the course is situated in such a way that all of the content is top-loaded, and that the grammar is covered far too quickly. It would be far better if the book (which in all honesty could be understood by a speaker who had just finished L3) was returned to every week, as opposed to every day for two weeks. In addition, the daily supersite homework is a pain, and often amounted to busy work that required guessing of the exact sentence structure, when many sentence structures would work."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I learned a lot, loved Prof. Cividanes, and loved the rest of my classmates. We had a great class dynamic, as fostered by Prof. Cividanes.",
    "Yes if taken with Cividanes.",
    "Yes, if you need the language requirement you should do it, it was much better than L3 in terms of work and you learn so much",
    "I would recommend this course to a student wishing to continue their Spanish language education.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed the Spanish program as a whole and think many would benefit from learning the language through this department.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course if it you need to fulfill your L4 requirement.",
    "Yes absolutely. I've never felt so free to practice what Spanish I have. No shame or fear, ever.",
    "Yes! Professor Cividanes is wonderful. You'll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend it only for a language requirement. The grading is quite strict and to a degree dependent on professor, and the presentations, tests, and quizzes are frequent (and dependent on what order you are assigned; I happened to have to go first and second first which resulted in both cases in about two weeks of prep that I was not allowed). Finally, the lack of extra credit and a curve, as well as a grade cutoff of 94% for an A, means that exceptional work is in often cases still not sufficient for a good grade. If you must take it, professor Cividanes is kind and easy to understand."
