    "I learned a whole new way of thinking! I learned to think philosophically and logically about p-set problems, and to understand and evaluate philosophical arguments. I came to understand the arguments for and against the existence of infinity. I also learned basic set theory. Out of all my classes this semester, I feel like this one taught me the most. Professor Szabo is an amazing lecturer and the lessons are very engaging.",
    "I learned a lot about the different schools of thought surrounding infinity and the divisibility of space and time. We also learned about decision making, game theory, and general paradoxes. I also learned basic set theory.",
    "I learned a very minimal amount of set theory and I got to ponder a few cool questions about infinity.",
    "Knowledge of philosophical concepts of the infinite; acquaintance with set theory and other mathematical frameworks.",
    "This course served as a solid introduction to analytical philosophy (philosophy of math, logic, etc.). A particular emphasis was placed on well-structured logical thinking and creative problem solving.",
    "Infinity was quite a challenge, and the material was not presented in the most perspicuous or unified way. Despite this, I did come away from the course with at least a basic understanding of the set theory that we were presented with and the core paradoxes of infinity.",
    "learned how to argue and think in philosophical and mathematical ways. was encouraged to think for myself and to challenge all ideas. very great course.",
    "Basic proof-writing skills, analyzing an argument, presenting our own arguments, etc.",
    "Some interesting philosophical ideas about infinity",
    "This course helped me get a better understanding of the philosophical issues that infinity raises. It also introduced me to a lot of interesting paradoxes that I had never heard before. These had the effect of turning me into a finist.",
    "Math and philosophy",
    "Better logical thinking",
    "Some basic set theory Knowledge of tons of paradoxes about the infinite and proposed solutions to them Practice evaluating arguments (and just critical thinking in general)",
    "Basic set theory, implications of mathematical principles on deeper philosophical thought, logical thinking and argument synthesis.",
    "Set theory is fascinating. This course really stretched my concept of how basic tenets of reality function.",
    "A really key ability to poke holes in other arguments and understand logical proofs, as well as just being mind-blown with cool ideas!",
    "Infinity-related mathematics (e.g. countable and uncountable infinities), many paradoxes, and a whole lot of other little things I had missed in the cracks of other philosophy\/math courses. Very helpful overall I'd say.",
    "I learned the connection between math and philosophy. Even more general, I learned how philosophy can create debates, interesting seminars, and paradoxes in situations in real life that I never would have otherwise considered in that philosophical way.",
    "I learned logical thinking, number theory, set theory, space theory, and very interesting paradoxes about the context of infinity over different areas.",
    "Infinity, Zeno's paradoxes, decision theory",
    "I believe I developed a more rigorous method of both philosophical and mathematical thinking.",
    "This course proved to be a great introduction to mathematical philosophy and set theory. With no background in set theory, I now feel like I have a good handle on the subject, along with introductory topology, sequences and series, and some new terminology, such as \"cartesian product\" and \"bijection.\" Similarly, I now feel able to hold a conversation regarding ancient philosophers and their ideas about infinity and the world in general. I learned how to think about infinity in a way that brought it down to earth a little more -- a way that made it seem \/possible\/, and made me realize where it could be \"hiding\" in daily life. This course opened my mind and helped me sharpen and clarify this blurry concept we call \"the infinite,\" and I am grateful to Professor Szabo for that.",
    "I learned more about solving logic and probability problems.",
    "Learned how to think broadly and differently",
    "Honestly learned next to nothing",
    "This class gave me new tools to evaluate and solve problems from a different angle, both mathematically and philosophically.",
    "Developed greater understanding of creating philosophical arguments and some math techniques",
    "Ability to evaluate rigorous technical arguments.",
    "I am not really sure what I learned during this course, but it was fun (and easy)!",
    "I learned more about what infinity is about and how it is problematic in mathematics and philosophy.",
    "If you are at all interested in philosophy of math, philosophy of science, or philosophy of mind, you should definitely take this class. The questions infinity raises are intriguing on all those planes.",
    "learning more about infinity",
    "It was very philosophy heavy, to the point I think it was a weakness. You learn a lot of things that make you say either \"huh?\" or \"who cares.\" Most of the interesting stuff you can get from watching VSauce on YouTube.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include Professor Szabo's incredibly engaging lectures, color-coded slides to refer back to, and the help available during office hours. For me, the only weakness was that the professor only had two hours of office hours per week and I had to change my own schedule in order to attend them.",
    "The strength of this course was the broad range of topics it covered. Its weaknesses included that the TAs did not have a standardized section lesson plan, so each section taught different materials. In addition, there was often a mismatch of what was taught in lecture and what was on the problem sets.",
    "This course was absurdly mis-advertised. The syllabus literally said that there will be \"minimal formalism,\" but the first week of class hit us with full-on set theory. Zoltan never explained how to do any of the math or even told us what the symbols meant. This class should honestly have prerequisites, or at the very least be honest about what it entails. Lectures were incredibly boring and just frustrating to sit through because the math was rushed through with little\/no explanation. Problem sets and the midterm were difficult but fair.",
    "Some of the concepts introduced have great promise and truly piqued my interest; I would say, however, that the course was not particularly well-organized, in that the subjects introduced did not flow one to the next. It was a bit scattershot. Moreover, for humanities students the math was quite difficult, as I recognized in several of my friends, who struggled consistently.",
    "Lectures are engaging and do a good job of communicating information. Sections might benefit from more focus\/clear direction.",
    "STRENGTHS: Infinity has the potential to be a compelling course. WEAKNESSES: (1) The readings are NOT sufficient for success on graded assignments. If you're a humanities major and you take this class, get a set theory\/mathematical logic textbook!! (2) The slides do not make the information clear and usually have undefined symbolism (which, naturally, is quite challenging to look up). So that doesn't exactly help solve the previous problem. (3) The material is not presented in an incremental (but more of a cyclical) way. Again, buy a textbook!! (4) There are no practice problems besides PSets. This is especially problematic for the midterm, because we (humanities majors) are expected to produce lines of reasoning we've never begun to think about. Granted, the material is entry-level for math folks, but humanities folks will probably struggle. (5) There needs to be a clearer roadmap for how these topics relate to infinity. It is often not clear until hindsight, and MANY students are lost for lectures on end trying to relate the seemingly disparate topics to infinity. (6) Unless the set theory and probability theory material is presented in a more systematic way, there needs to be a prerequisite(s) or at least a note on the syllabus description that familiarity with proof theory is encouraged.",
    "course was very interesting and easy to do the work in. although the workload was not too high, it was challenging and often required the usage of office hours in order to get an okay grade. Psets seemed to be somewhat ambiguous when it came to marks and which TF was grading.",
    "The coursework is interesting but obscure and often strange. Much of it could have been better explained.",
    "The content is extremely interesting, and the class does a good job in mixing mathematical and philosophical ideas, although I'd argue it is more math oriented than philosophy oriented.",
    "Class didn't seem that structured in that the material was a bit all over the place",
    "This course is scattered. it is not helpful. it did not teach me anything new. The lectures were poorly put together.",
    "The topics that the course covered were interesting, but there was very little continuity from one topic to the next. Many times, the topic would be introduced way too quickly. This made it hard to build up an intuition about what to expect, and why infinity breaks that intuition. For example, in order to understand why the Cantor set is so interesting, you have to have an intuitive understanding of measure theory, which you can't have if it's just been explained to you in 5 minutes. Also, sometimes the lectures didn't make sense - I didn't understand anything in the unit on gunky stuff. Lastly, it was a little frustrating that in a philosophy of math class, we were unable to get a TF from the philosophy department or the math department. Instead, our section was led by a psychology grad student who didn't understand any of the math (or much of the philosophy for that matter).",
    "Strength: Great lecturer Weakness: wasn't interesting",
    "Strengths are the teaching and TAs weakness would have to be some of the problem sets.",
    "The questions raised (largely through paradoxes) are pretty fun to ponder and play around with. Not too much reading, but you can spend tons of time just thinking about the problems and how you think they should be resolved If you have a strong math background this can be a pretty chill class that is just fun to think about. I had a good TF who studies this stuff and so could treat it in a serious way, but I could imagine that this could be a weakness if I had other TFs (I dont know) PSETS are fair, but can be somewhat tricky if you dont have any math background This class covers a set of problems which although entertaining, I personally didnt find as satisfying to think about, but it was still fun.",
    "The strengths of this course, I believe, lie in its philosophical approaches to arguments which have expanded our views of infinity. This part of the course, the latter half, was very interesting to be in and led to my engagement in lecture, section, and on problem sets. The first half of the course, however, was not pleasant for me. It dealt almost exclusively with complex mathematical theory which caught me very much off guard. This part of the course, for me, was extremely difficult, not only to understand but also with relation to grading (the level of ability with regards to this complex mathematical ability seemed like it was assumed to be very high, which, I believe for many, it was not). I take issue most with this because, though this first half of the course did deal with theory regarding infinity, the level of ability and difficulty that was expected during this portion of the course did not at all relate to what was expected of us in the latter half, the half which was actually dealing with philosophy. Because of this it felt almost as if I had taken two courses which were not too closely related, only dealing with similar subjects.",
    "Very interesting subject matter, course was somewhat divided chronologically between math and philosophy, could have been more integrated.",
    "I loved Prof Szabo; he is so energetic and passionate, each lecture flew by which is not easy to do. Sometimes I felt that a lot of in between steps of explanation were skipped over in lecture, and it would take me a while to follow the logic later on my own. This was probably because it was my first class ever like this, and also I understand he has limited time in lecture but I thought this could be improved.",
    "Strengths: very interesting subject matter Weaknesses: The midterm, in my opinion, could use a lot of work. I just really had no idea how to study for it besides trying to quiz myself on our slides. If we had practice problems and a textbook that'd be one thing, but the nature of the course prevents that. As a result, you end up seeing questions on the midterm that aren't exactly what you get on the problem sets--sometimes the answer is obvious if you studied the slides well, but other things are just more likely to catch you off guard (e.g. the question about an irrational number in the form of a series or whatever it was) because they're more so the kind of question you prepare for by doing similar practice problems, and I don't really know how we would have found those practice problems. Maybe I just missed something but some sort of a practice test or greater instruction on how we are expected to apply our knowledge beyond what we have done in problem sets would be helpful for the midterm. The other assessments were great, though I think the essay prompts seemed pretty unusual to some people.",
    "This is a good course overall, but the due dates are placed nonsensically. We had multiple assignments that were due during vacations.",
    "Strengths are the small discussion sections, which I loved and helped me learn so much about every week. The lectures were also great, but if I had to choose a weakness, it would be that I expected it to be a smaller lecture, but it ended up being another big lecture that I found it hard to engage with.",
    "Strengths: The paradoxes are interesting, the lectures are great, Professor Szabo is very brilliant and the TAs are great Weaknesses: it is certainly not a math class for humanities majors, making it very hard if you are not STEM inclined. I was humanities and was very disappointed with how math-heavy it was. Its very hard if youre a humanities person. The p-sets can be rough and rather figure-it-our yourself, but you can get ample help from TAs and Professor Szabo.",
    "Certain aspects of the course are not particularly clear, especially at the beginning. For example, no one understand Zoltan's grading scale till around the first midterm. In addition, the homework isn't very related to the lectures and can be difficult without help from the TAs. Overall, though, the class was not difficult, and the grading was very generous towards to latter half (perhaps the TAs felt bad for us).",
    "I believe that the course could be better served with a more defined structural flow, but I believe that it was rather well taught.",
    "The strengths of this course include the way the problem sets are designed to really make you think in new ways and develop those new methods of thought as habits in such a way that allows you to apply those methods to similar problems in the future. In other words, the problem sets feel meaningful, and you can tell that you're learning from them. The sections are also very helpful, as the TAs are fantastic and really know their stuff. (Mine was Michael Burton.) The course also felt very organized and straight-forward grades-wise; the slide shows were color-coded in a manner that made review easy. The only weakness I can think of is that the lectures sometimes felt too similar to the slide shows, which led some students to feel as though they could get the class experience exclusively from the lecture, which in turn led to a decreased attendance at lecture. To improve this, maybe less text on each slide, or have these slide shows purely for review, and in lecture go over example problems or share more stories and anecdotes to break away from the slides.",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures; fair amount of work Weaknesses: moves quickly; not a lot of explanation\/background information given (you have to be very self-motivated to succeed)",
    "Since the course is taught in lecture style, its sometimes hard to understand what some of the material means if you dont get it the first time the professor mentions it. Youll often have to wait for section to get an explanation because the professor doesnt interface with students much besides in class",
    "Scattered lectures and content--infinity is a great topic, but it was terribly presented.",
    "I thought the things we were learning in lecture and in section were slightly disjoint and didnt really help strength my understanding of one via the other and vice versa.",
    "I thought the psets were engaging, but the grading is very confusing. Additionally there was almost no preparation for the exam, which makes it stressful. I appreciated Professor Szabo putting the slides online.",
    "Poorly taught, but the TAs were pretty good.",
    "I was fortunate to be a STEM major taking this course. I believe that many of my humanities-focused peers were confused by the math portions, but I cannot speak for them. The hardcore philosophy sections confused mostly everyone, but were never evaluated. Professor Szab is very enthusiastic about what he teaches and is the perfect professor for this course. It was a bit difficult to tell, however, what was the common consensus on thought experiments and what were his own ideas.",
    "Strengths: A lot of interesting paradoxes talked about in the course Weaknesses: Math course disguised as a philosophy course Too many topics covered that require a lot of prior math familiarity I don't like the TA sections - it seems that everyone had really different experiences with their TA. I wish there was more coordination between the TAs.",
    "Professor Szabo's lectures were superb. I'm not sure the class needs a section. The sections were not all that helpful. Extended TA office hours might be better. Also, the Problem Sets could be a bit more clearly defined in terms of what is asked for.",
    "great prof. hard concepts.",
    "The lectures felt dry and canned to me. The material was also not presented in a clear or sometimes even coherent way -- fundamental concepts were often introduced too late, and we just jumped around between different disjoint subjects with no real continuity. The homework (and midterm) was also graded like this is a p-set class, when the class is not structured that way (i.e., if you're gonna test us on theorems, teach the class like it's a textbook).",
    "Occasionally some things we learned were interesting, but overall we bounced around from topic to topic without actually learning how to use any of the information. PSETs were super challenging because based on the lectures I did not know how to answer any of the questions."

    "Yes, if you have a math background",
    "This is basically a Math course that counts for the Humanities credit. Take it if that's what you want; don't if that's not what you want.",
    "YES!!!!! I took this course as a first-year with no formal background in philosophy, formal logic, or set theory. For about a month I felt pretty lost and confused (especially when we started learning set theory), and wondered if I should even be in this course. It was a steep learning curve, but it was worth it. Over time I adapted to a new way of thinking and began to feel very engaged in and excited about this class. So, if you have no background knowledge, this course will be a challenge at first. If you work hard, go to office hours, and form a study group, you will be successful.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is curious about philosophy and the infinite. Although the class is much more philosophy than math, so take that into account.",
    "No. The only way I would recommend it is if you're a math-y type person. Then it should be a pretty easy QR. If you're a humanities student looking for a doable QR, do not take this class. It is a complete bait-and-switch, and you will be hit hard by the amount of math that you're expected to understand from the get-go. Not worth it. I came away from this class having learned very little that was valuable.",
    "I can't say I would. As I said previously, the general disorganization and lack of intellectual guidance made for a difficult learning experience.",
    "If you are a humanities major looking for a gut QR (I'm a philosophy major), this might not be your best option. The class is definitely interesting and does a good job of grooming analytical thinking skills, but it requires a fair amount of student engagement. Psets are graded fairly and the grading scheme is far from threatening, but psets will probably require more than an hour or two of work. The midterm is essentially just a new pset (just has to be completed in class) and was by no means unrealistic or extremely difficult.",
    "Humanities majors: RUN FROM THIS CLASS! Don't be duped by the sparse syllabus. This class is designed for math-y people. It is not well-organized (unless you are already familiar with the material) and essentially requires knowledge of how to write proofs in mathematics--which is never taught in the course. The lectures and slides are quire confusing. Unless you have a solid background in logic and mathematical proofs (or are willing to teach yourself on the fly), this will be more work than it's worth. You will learn more if you take the time to fulfill the (unwritten) prerequisites in advance. It is not an easy A and certainly not a gut unless you Credit-D-Fail. That said, the grading scale is not too intense (a D- is around 1\/10 points and a C is 5\/10) and the assignments get easier throughout the semester.",
    "yes, the class is challenging and a ton of fun, but it is hard and not an easy grade by any means.",
    "Only if you are very interested in math and philosophy.",
    "If you're a humanities major, I would not recommend this course. If you're more STEM oriented, and are looking for a humanities credit, this class is for you.",
    "Probably not, it's a gut in terms of workload, but grading isn't always the kindest. The material wasn't that interesting to me and I didn't really feel engaged.",
    "No. don't take this..",
    "This class is great. There's a lot of random math that you'll have to learn if you want to do well, and the topics are all over the place, but the material is super interesting. It introduces you to a lot of cool paradoxes, and it turned me into a finist.",
    "Only if you're interested in the topic",
    "Fun course. Meant for STEM kids",
    "Eh. It was fun and chill because I had a good math background and enjoy thinking about this sort of stuff, but there were other classes that I could have taken to get a more impactful intellectual experience....so it depends on what you want to get out of the class",
    "As long as they are aware of the difficulty of the mathematics that will be required of them for the first two months of the course, yes I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, interesting thought experiment class for both humanities students to get a taste of math and for STEM students to get a taste of philosophy.",
    "Its a fascinating course. Be prepared for a lot more math than youd expect out of a Philosophy course.",
    "Definitely. Super good for dipping your toes into philosophy, but also good for people who already are deep into philosophy and or math. I walked out of class almost every time just swirling with new ideas. It was such a cool new view of the world.",
    "If you want a surface level dive into math logic, probability, set theory, etc. then I'd say go for it! Otherwise it's probably more worthwhile to do the deeper classes. This is a great sampler of many difference concepts, so if that's what you want, go for it.",
    "Yes! Especially to someone who is interested in math, this showed me another mathematical application that is less well known than other applications.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in infinity and not completely repulsed by the idea that its math heavy. If youre cool with doing extra math or if math is easy to you or if you are committed to working heavily with the TAs then then its a good course. I still thought it was very interesting, despite being a humanities major.",
    "Depends. If you are STEM-focused, then this class isn't a terrible option for a humanities credit. If you are humanities-focused, STAY AWAY. This class is definitely more geared towards STEM majors, and there are so many better (and easier) QR's.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! It explained some rather interesting things in lecture, and the sections were great spots for discussion.",
    "Yes, I would. If you're even a little interested in both math and philosophy, you should take this course. It makes you think about confusing things in new, clarifying ways, the workload is light compared to math classes, and you'll have fun doing the problem sets and discussing the course material with people in section. I'm very happy I decided to take this course.",
    "It depends on your level of motivation. The grading is very fair and if you put in the effort you can probably get a good grade. However, the content is not easy and will require extra effort on your part to understand if you have not taken advanced mathematics; there is a lot of set theory, some calculus, some probability theory, and lots of proofs (almost all of the questions on problem sets require you to do proofs). Although the proofs do not have to be formal (since it is stated that there are no prerequisites), you will be at a disadvantage if you have not taken advanced math courses.",
    "If youre very comfortable with math and philosophy, yestheres some interesting material here and the workload isnt bad. If youre just looking for an easy QR, its not the worst, but I would recommend taking it with friends.",
    "Yes. This is a good course for STEM students who prefer a more mathy humanities course",
    "If you want a low workload class go for it, but be prepared for a semester of mind-numbing monotony and PSETS that revolve around random minutiae instead of understanding of the concepts.",
    "Yes, but only if it really is something you are interested in. If youre not into math and philosophy and the intersection of it, it can be hard to grasp conceptually.",
    "It is an engaging course if you are interested in the philosophy of infinity. I think you should be prepared for more confusing psets than expected.",
    "Most certainly. Fascinating content.",
    "No, don't take this class. The psets are hard and have very little to do with the lecture, and they're graded pretty erratically. What's more, the grading is wildly different across TAs...",
    "This is a very easy humanities course for the STEM major, but the converse is probably not true. I am happy that I took this course, even if I am unsure as to what I learned. Neat thought experiments were posed. Many of the \"proofs\" were frustratingly hand-wavy. Overall, I would recommend this class.",
    "Only if they have a strong background. Otherwise I can't imagine the amount of catching up one would have to do to understand the ideas introduced in the course.",
    "Absolutely if you're interested in philosophy of mind.",
    "yes. you learn to think better.",
    "Not really. I didn't agree with any of the actual philosophical work, and you don't really learn anything. Most of it is incoherent or irrelevant. Take it if you need it for a major -- if you're looking for an intro philosophy course or QR gut, look elsewhere.",
    "I hated this class, but if you already have a good math background it it probably not bad. There were no prerequisites but he definitely assumed we knew math things that I had not learned before."
