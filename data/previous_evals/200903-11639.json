   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as frustrating. Although some of the lessons learned from other people's projects were interesting, nobody in the class had any time to apply them to their own projects. The main lesson everyone learned was to \"start early and plan ahead\" which wasn't possible for someone hearing that only a week before their project goes up. I would not recommend it to a fellow student, but if that student is a Theater Studies Major and needs to do a Senior Project, he or she doesn't have a choice.",
    "If you are a theater major, then you probably have to do this. Writing a research-style paper based on a performance project is pretty stupid and useless in my opinion, but it has to be done.",
    "THST 491 is required for Theater Studies majors who are doing a production for their final project, and that's a good thing. It helps create a sense of community among senior Theater Studies majors and provides a forum in which they can help one another solve technical and artistic problems. It was also incredibly helpful to me to have to do a design presentation--this clarified my thoughts about my production and forced me to stick to a schedule to realize my goals for the project.",
