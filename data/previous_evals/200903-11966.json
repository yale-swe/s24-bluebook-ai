    "Yes!",
    "Extreme amount of work, but very good class",
    "The language is pretty tough, but Sean did a good job teaching it. Take it under him if you can.",
    "I would summarize it as a really intense class where you learn a ton. But you certainly don't learn everything, and by about 3\/4 of the way through it becomes more and more frustrating. Get ready for a lot of work, but not an unmanageable amount - the class is very reasonable about what it expects.",
    "It's a good class if you want to learn ancient greek. It's more time consuming than i expected it to be - greek has a lot of grammar, and there is a lot of memorization of endings... much more than in latin. It really is a class and a half, so you should plan accordingly. But you will come out of the semester knowing a lot of the language, so if that's your goal, it's a good class.The grad student who teaches the class usually changes. Sean was great.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. The work load was more manageable than I expected. It moves very quickly, which can be frustrating and difficult, but keeping up is rewarding.",
    "Ancient Greek is an introductory course to the Ancient Greek language. It is fast-paced and very comprehensive. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to another student if they wish to get a taste of the wonderful classical language."
