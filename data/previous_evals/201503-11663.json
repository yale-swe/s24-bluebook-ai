   "comments": [
    "A transition course between the lower, syntax-oriented levels of Latin and the more advanced, translation-oriented courses. Authors include Cicero, Martial, and Pliny.",
    "This class is perfect for people who have translated Latin at a relatively high level, then taken a year off, or people who took a lot of Latin in high school but not the AP. You get to read Cicero and learn a lot of great things about how speeches are constructed. If you are looking to really get into Roman culture\/civilization, this is not the class for you; it's primarily about developing ability to read Latin. Sarah is a really great teaching fellow and is always willing to meet up outside of class and help you extra with the Latin. Don't forget to study for the Monday quizzes, which are a pretty big part of the grade.",
    "I would reccomend Latin 131 to another student, only if they really enjoy Latin. It is a lot of work and the tests are hard. If you don't understand the gramma well, the tests will be extremely difficult.",
    "Solid class to finish requirement."
