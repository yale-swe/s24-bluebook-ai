   "comments": [
    "I think that the course focused a little too much on the algebra of the models and not much on the results and implications. The field is a really cool one and I wish we got to explore it a little more and spend less time on math.",
    "I liked how clear and useful the slides were. However, I would say that the midterm and final required quite a lot of memorization. Also, I wish we had been given an overall roadmap of the course. At the end of the course, I was a bit confused about how many models we had learned and how they were different. I also wish we had had more opportunities to do some independent research or data analysis. The course was interesting, but we mostly had to learn the theory behind the model and not to apply the model.",
    "Lecture slides need to be proofread and improved prior to the days presentation. There were numerous times when Arkolakis stopped in the middle of Gianna lecture to correct his slides on Latex. I understand this was the first term this course was taught, and thats hiccups occur, but the number of times this occurred is horrid.",
    "The class has an easy to follow structure and the lectures are online which helps. I think too much time was spent on one specific model. It would have been nice to spend more time on different models or different econ subjects or to have more time spent to real world applications. The professor is very nice and dedicated to the subject which is fantastic. Problem sets were extremely math heavy though, and I never really got much from them. Overall, it would be good to differentiate a bit."

    "This is a first time course so Im sure adjustments will be made. Because of this Id definitely recommend",
    "Yes, as long as you enjoy diving into a very specific model. Do not take this course if you want to achieve the title of the course... know that you will learn a lot about this professor's work. Overall, it is an interesting course and not too difficult if you are comfortable with math. The grading seems fair. The course will probably get better as it is taught more. So, while not one of the best classes I have taken, it is certainly a decent 400 level class to take."
