    "This is a pretty cool class, with the concepts taught in class and then hands-on work done during lab! Be careful about what research topic you choose though, because that might just make it harder for you. Otherwise, everything was taught in a straightforward manner and tests\/problem sets were fair.",
    "Carefully consider your workload before taking this course. The first half is doable, with weekly lab sections, writeups, occasional psets, and an exam. The last five weeks are over the top--lab sections continue almost until the end, so weekly lab reports are still due, but at the same time you'll be working on your project, which requires a presentation and report during reading week and finals period. While it's exciting to learn by working through a project, it makes the additional hours spent on lab sections and write-ups at the end of the semester especially frustrating, as you are already basically equipped with what you need to know to do the project, and you learn much more with your project than with the labs. This aspect of the course, plus the issue of working with less than ideal technology for image presentation, makes much of the time you spend on this course feel like busywork. Hopefully this will change in the future, so that more time can be spent on learning instead.",
    "Good class. Really enjoyed some of the labs (though ENVI isn't the easiest software to work with) though the lectures sometimes felt a bit useless as it's hard to talk about software things when you don't have the software in front of you. Overall I would recommend this class though be aware that it is heavily focused on environmental\/forestry applications and not other types, which was a bit of a problem for me. Very little course work besides the final project.",
    "Great course but a decent time commitment",
    "Definitely take this course! It's a big time commitment, between lectures and lab every week, but the lab allows you to learn practical skills regarding how to use ENVI, which can then be applicable to a lot of different disciplines. All of the professors and YCEO staff are super helpful with the final project, which gives a lot of freedom to pursue whatever you find interesting.",
    "A good class for understanding the basics of satellite imaging and how remote sensing can be used in a variety of applications, including whatever you do your final project on. The final project is a lot of work but should not be intimidating; everyone from TFs to professors to other students in the class is generally willing to help you out. (But start early and don't leave it until the last minute because it's sometimes literally impossible to do what you need to do if you are waiting on computers...) Anyhow the subject material was very applicable to a wide variety of topics, including how satellites work, how cameras work, biogeography, urban studies, archaeology, geomorphology... so many things!! It's a really cool class. The first six weeks are about the fundamentals and basic concepts and then the rest is exploration by project.",
    "A good skill to have and an ok class to take but not highly recommended for undergrads unless they specifically want this skill because its the kind of thing you could learn in many different places or on your own."
