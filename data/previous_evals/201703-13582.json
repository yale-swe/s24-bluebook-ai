   "comments": [
    "Overall, the skills gained did not align with my expectations mainly because I feel like I did not receive the base knowledge and support needed to gain the skills in a productive and meaningful way. Instead, I felt like I was thrown into situations with very little context or knowledge and forced to scramble to develop the minimum skills necessary to complete an assigned task.",
    "This was the course I was most excited about taking last semester, and it completely exceeded my expectations. The combination of in class seminar time and time spent working on our client projects allowed for learning both concepts\/theories and then the ability to apply what you learned."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths of the course: student assignments to real EJ legal cases and clients; weekly seminar with thematic elements that work as building blocks for how to be an agent within the EJ movement. Weaknesses: Lack of context or base knowledge given by instructor for assigned cases; assigned tasks were often so outside skillset and knowledge base of students that a lot of time was used trying to figure out what was being asked of me.",
    "Strengths: 1) Community feeling between students and strong commitment by everyone in the class 2) Diversity in perspectives and experiences due to having law, forestry and public health students 3) Ability to jump right into cases at beginning of semester 4) The opportunities to work on really important, fascinating cases with others outside of Yale"

   "comments": [
    "Understand that this course will end up taking up a lot of your time depending on the cases\/clients you are assigned. Also understand that you should be comfortable regularly feeling completely lost and ill-prepared for the tasks being asked of you to complete.",
    "If you are interested in environmental justice and project\/client-based work, this course is amazing. It is a lot of work in a way that most other courses are not - emails, logistical planning, and meeting with you partner is constant, and very time consuming, but there are not designated papers or assignments necessarily."
