    "It's not as bad as people make it seem. It's a core requirement, so I guess you have no choice but to take it, but it's really not that bad. I had a good time. Professor Koleske is awesome, the grading is very fair, and the TA's are all fun. It's not overly time-consuming, and as long as you keep on top of the homeworks and skim the readings you'll be set. I had a blast, and I learned a lot. JUST BE CAREFUL OF THE TRICK QUESTIONS!",
    "I would recommend it either to someone who was interested in biology or who needed to take it as a prerequisite.",
    "BIOL 101 is a great introduction to biology at Yale. Would definitely recommend.",
    "BIOL 101 is a general overview of biochemistry and biophysics that doesn't go into too much detail. The quizzes can be a pain, and if you're not considering studying biology the material can be a bit dull. I would recommend taking this course only if it's a requirement for you.",
    "Great and easy to follow. If you have taken AP bio, very manageable",
    "Would definitely recommend as an intro bio course.",
    "BIOL 101 is a well-run intro bio course.",
    "I would only take if necessary for prerequisites.",
    "I would definitely recommend BIOL 101 especially for someone like me who has not taken Biology in a long time. It provided a really good foundation and it was very enjoyable.",
    "BIOL 101 quizzes are sometimes graded in a very nit-picky way. You get points knocked off because it \"could've been phrased better\". So it's not just enough to know the material, but you also need good test taking skills. The material is pretty basic and not that difficult. Most people ended up not ever having to do the readings because everything you're tested on is in the lectures and study guides.",
    "If you are looking for a solid foundation in the biological sciences, Biol 101 is a excellent choice.",
    "It is basically a simplified version of AP Biology. Professor Koleske is great. The expectations are crystal clear, and if you put in a bit of time studying it's very straight forward for this module.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 under the condition that a student must be committed to seeking out his own answers. Piazza (which was treated as the saving grace of the class) was insufficient in helping me to grasp a difficult concept.",
    "Take this class if its a major requirement. Grading is not hard, but they cover a lot of material in a short amount of time and the quizzes require that you keep up on work.",
    "If you're a bio major or premed, you basically have to take this sequence anyway, so there's not much persuading I can do. I will say that you might like it more than you'd think, especially if you have Prof. Koleske.",
    "BIOL 101 is a standard introductory biology course. It seems to assume a knowledge of AP Biology, so if you haven taken advanced biology classes in high school it will be relatively easy, while if you have not taken advanced biology classes it will be relatively hard.",
    "A somewhat challenging, though always interesting course on biochemistry and biophysics. Might be an interesting .5 a science credit if you needed such a thing, though this is definitely a class mostly for intended bio majors.",
    "It's easy, and you have to take it if you're premed\/going into biological sciences.",
    "Bio 101 is extremely fast-paced, surface-level introduction into interesting topics in biophysics and biochem. It is not as scary as it sounds, but you will need to put in time to study the topics if you have not taken Bio before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as both a necessary foundation for knowledge of biology and as one of the best large introductory courses taught at Yale. This course was better managed and more invested in students than any lecture I or my friends have ever been in.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 to another student who needs to take intro biology as a prerequisite course. If someone took AP biology in high school already, the course will basically be a review of past biology concepts that allows one to take more in-depth biology courses later on.",
    "This is a good class. If you've taken AP bio in high school, it's probably a lot of review. I didn't find this class very hard, but it was often tricky -- I lost points on the homework because I didn't think through my explanations carefully enough. The weekly quizzes make you keep up with the work (and I liked them better than a midterm), which makes it easier to study for the final. Professor Koleske is a funny, approachable, and engaging lecturer. Overall, a good and very well organized class.",
    "If you need to take a science course to fulfill a requirement I would not recommend BIOL 101. I found there to be a great amount of work required to try and understand\/grasp\/learn all concepts for the weekly quizzes we had.",
    "BIOL 101 is a very generic, oversized lecture class. I feel that a lot of the material was very briefly mentioned and that much of the material didn't go into detail, but then the examinations, namely the weekly quizzes, required a much deeper understanding of the simply presented topics. As someone who hadn't taken AP Bio in high school, I felt that I was at a district advantage, because many of my friends who had taken AP in high school said that it was very repetitive. I will say what I have said for many other large intro classes: There should be two separate classes, one for people who have taken a comparable course prior to Yale, and one for those who have no background. The only nice thing about this class is that it was only half a semester and that the final was pretty doable. Be ready for a boring lecture and a quiz every Monday that you will dread.",
    "Biol 101 is not as terrible as people sometimes say it is. It's an organized class, the weekly quizzes encourage you to review material before the final, and it's generally interesting material. If you're a science major, don't dread it, and do homework in groups! If you're shopping for a distribution requirement, you might look for something smaller and more focused.",
    "I suppose if you have little to no biology background, the class would be helpful, but for me, I found it to be quite trivial\/boring.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 to a student who is thinking about doing pre-med. Even if you have taken IB or AP Biology I think it is still essential that you take this course for whatever major you decide upon later. It served as a very good introduction to the biology that Yale focuses on.",
    "Your standard bio class. Not bad! You definitely need to do some of the readings and go to lecture, but it's totally manageable.",
    "Goes less in depth than AP Bio, but definitely challenging",
    "As someone who took biology all through the high school, I think the lectures covered a lot in such a short period of time. First few lectures might seem relatively easy if you know the material, but do not be fooled, it moves very fast and you have to know the basics of the first few very well to understand the rest of it. Moreover, the grading is TOO harsh (you have to memorize details perfectly to do well in the first half of the quizzes, and apply them to the experiments for the second half). Make sure to be on top of the material, and you will be fine. Still, that is not a very easy class.",
    "Bio101 is a well-conceived, pleasant introductory biology course, covering similar material to AP Biology (macromolecules, genetics overview, metabolism, biotechnology). The primary assessments are weekly quizzes, homework and a final exam. It is designed to be low-stress, thanks to being able to drop your lowest quiz scores and lowest homework score. They do a very nice job applying the concepts you've probably seen before to a whole range of biomedical fields, particularly HIV\/AIDS for the last two lectures. Professor Koleske is an excellent lecturer. I took this class as one of my premed bio courses, and I think it provides a solid, comprehensive background.",
    "BIOL 101 is a fast paced introductory course to biology that is a must-take for scientific minded individuals.",
    "you're probably just taking it for pre-med or a pre-req, so you just have to get through it. the way they do things is pretty good. it could be worse.",
    "Yes, I would recommend BIO 101 to another student. It is a really big class, but it's fun to take with friends so that you can study together.",
    "BIOL 101 is an effective introduction to the realm of biochemistry and biophysics. Professor Koleske is a clear and organized lecturer and therefore the material, though having the potential to be confusing, was accessible. Having taken AP Biology, I found most of the material to be review. It's definitely helpful to have had experience in biology before, though there are enrichment sections students can attend to help fill in the gaps. Homework is manageable. I highly recommend this course!",
    "BIOL 101 is essentially AP Bio. If you've taken AP Bio, most of the material will be review for you and will be tedious at times. For those who haven't taken AP Bio, BIOL 101 is a well constructed intro to biology.",
    "A good over-review of AP Bio topics that should be very familiar to students that have taken it in high school. Each lecture is built upon the next and led to an accumulation of knowledge. However, this also meant that some of the end topics had much more information to digest than the earlier ones. Stay on top of your game and know their stuff. Tougher for students that have a weak biology background. Quizzes are not very difficult objectively because they were based on two individual lectures each, however, grading is very strict (e.g. write everything you know down in detail in order to prove you understand even if it seems that it should be implied--you must be explicit). The final was not too difficult.",
    "Yes, great, straightforward induction into biology.",
    "This class is a great introduction to biology. It is taught well and is extremely manageable while still being challenging.",
    "The first of four modules in Intro Bio, BioChem and BioPhysics is a large lecture class that includes enough in-class exercises to keep you focused and assignments, both homework and weekly quizzes, to keep you on top of learning the subject matter.",
    "BIOL 101 repeats a lot of concepts from AP Bio, but is overall a solid and for the most part clearly presented course that is perfectly manageable as long as you study for the weekly quizzes (which are usually fair but occasionally can trip you up) and keep up with the material. As a non-Bio major and non-premed, I do question a bit why exactly I took this course, since it does involve a good deal of effort and time commitment and material-wise is only moderately interesting. But if you have to take it, it's definitely doable (better than 102, I've heard), while if you don't, then only take it if you have a real desire to refresh and hone your basic Biology knowledge.",
    "BIOL 101 is probably one of the most fun pre-med classes I've taken. It's not as much pressure as something as organic chemistry but I felt that I learned a lot in a short amount of time and feel much more prepared in biology now. The HIV\/AIDS stuff we covered at the end was also very interesting.",
    "This course goes really well if you have taken AP Biology. Most of it is review and you should be able to keep up. That said, I don't think I would have been able to understand everything if I didn't take the class. It is a good class, especially for a prereq, but I would not deem it a gut class.",
    "Biology 101 is an introductory college biology class that describes the foundations of the study that are needed to learn biology at a higher level. The topics are well-explained by the professor and further clarified in section. The course requires a good amount of reading and studying since there are weekly quizzes and problem sets.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 strongly for a student who has limited background in biology. I would also recommend BIOL 101 as a good course to review biology concepts in for students who have completed AP Biology or have completed advanced coursework in biology. However, I would also say that BIOL 101 necessitates dedication to the quizzes each week, which require students to memorize specific key phrases that graders want to see on quizzes. To me, the quizzes are not purely based on actual knowledge of the biology behind the course.",
    "There's a reason why Yale makes it so difficult to place out of intro bio - the class is packed with information at a level just beyond AP Biology. It really caters well to the crowd that loves memorization, because a lot of the responses on quizzes and tests require word for word recollection of information from lectures. I guess it's a good introduction to what Biology at Yale is like - very competitive, superficially resourceful, and a constant race to learn more, in increasingly shorter periods of time. Take it if you must, but there are definitely more fun introductory biology style course in MCDB to explore.",
    "In BIOL 101 you learn about the foundational building blocks of life: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and DNA, etc. The course also works to provide interesting applications of the material to greater issues and diseases like the fight against HIV. The course lays a clear and important foundation for understanding biological science and effectively conveys its relevance and importance in life. I would recommend BIOL 101 to anyone, not only people interested specifically in science or medicine. It is a demanding but really fun course and the things learned in it pertain to anybody even on the basic level of understanding how certain foods effect our bodies and their metabolic functions.",
    "Dumb. Everyone is premed so the grading is tough. But everyone had to take it now when that was not the case a couple of years ago",
    "Take if you know nothing about biology or want a review",
    "Pretty standard intro topics",
    "Too in depth",
    "This class was weeks of the professor reading off pre made slides so going to lecture was almost pointless when the slides and accompanying textbook pages were provided online. This is one of those classes, like general chem, where you just get through it as a requirement for other courses you want to take.",
    "If you want to be bio major or premed take this class. Don't take it otherwise.",
    "I would definitely reccomend the class. The corse material is extremely interesting and also manageable.",
    "Very similar to AP bio from High School",
    "I would summarize bio 101 as not particularly challenging, but graded more on ability to recognize when to use key words than on demonstrating knowledge of the subject material. I would not recommend bio 101 to another student.",
    "It's not bad but the structure is absolutely terrible. I honestly wish instead of 4 modules there were two semesters.",
    "Take BIOL 101 if you have to. I heard there also was a introduction to biology seminar that had some pretty good reviews. Definitely consider that before looking going straight to this class.",
    "Bio 101 was better than i initially expected it to be. if you did AP Bio before, this should not be very challenging. Take it with Koleske if you can, he is a great lecturer. Weekly quizzes are not bad at all and the overall workload is very managable.",
    "Take it if you want to do pre-med or be a bio major. If you have no background in bio it is a lot of information but very interesting. If you have taken ap bio, it is a lot of review. Maybe, skip it and just take the 102 sequence which has a lot of new information but still some review.",
    "It is a very information based class and I would only recommending taking it if necessary for your major.",
    "Great intro course, but you're off to the races from day 1.",
    "Biology 101 is a very large introductory class required for many of the science majors. It covers many of the important, basic topics that you'll need if you want to become a biology\/biochemistry major. I would certainly recommend this class to any science majors or pre-med students; however, for other more humanities-minded people, this class may not be the best choice.",
    "I would recommend Biol 101 to other students because it is a good introductory course to biology and presents one with a lot of valuable information.",
    "Bio 101 teaches the basics of biology and is a good class to take even if you haven't taken biology before.",
    "BIOL 101 is a great introduction to really important processes in biology, and the material is presented in an understandable and non-boring way. Don't be scared if you haven't taken AP bio.",
    "Don't take this class unless you A) have to for your major; B) have not taken AP Bio and want to get a feel for basic biological concepts without gaining a fundamental understanding of the specific mechanisms beneath them. This class was not particularly enjoyable or inspiring, though Professor Koleske is the one to take it with if you have to.",
    "Take it if you must. It's not too exciting, but the professor and the coordinator are great!",
    "It's a very standard review of AP biology material. It's boring but necessary for most",
    "Take it because you have to.",
    "Biol 101 is an easy class, and if you've taken AP Bio, you won't have to do the reading. It's basically a requirement for premed and a couple of science-based majors, so take it if you need to. If you can place out of 101, you aren't missing much by not taking it.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend it to any students interested in biology. It's a fantastic intro course and everything is very clear.",
    "Introductory biology class. Need to study. Many available resources, use them.",
    "I think the course description aptly summarizes 101. I would not recommend 101 to another student to take unless that student needed the class as a prerequisite for other classes or for a major. I took the class just for fun, and while 101 was decidedly better than 102, I think there are better classes out there if you\u2019re looking to take a science just for fun. This class was definitely more geared towards pre-meds and science majors, which is totally understandable, just not ideal for a non-science major.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't taken AP bio because it is geared to be better for students with experience.",
    "A class you have to take to be pre-med or do any sort of bio, but if you took AP in high school, you will definitely be fine.",
    "BIOL 101 is a classic intro to biology course. If you are interested in biology, take it, if you need a science and don't mind putting in the work, take it. The quizzes and homeworks were sometimes tricky and the grading could be a little nit-picky but overall, not a bad introductory course.",
    "If it made sense for them to do it I wouldn't urge them not too, but I wouldn't be a huge advocate for it either.",
    "This class was a good foundation for future biology classes I will take (including Biol 102) and it also was a good refresher course of what I learned in AP Bio in high school. I would recommend this course to another student looking for a basic biology class, particularly if Professor Koleske is teaching the class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have any interest in biology or pre-med. It's a must take, not for it's strength but rather for it's necessity.",
    "This is not a class to take for fun but if it is a requirement for a major don't let it turn you away.",
    "BIO 101 is a relatively easy class-- almost all the content was review from AP Biology. The workload wasn't too bad either (weekly PSET, weekly quiz). This was a large lecture course as nearly all of the students were pre-med or interested in one of the three Biology majors. Professor Koleske is a very knowledgeable, welcoming, engaging instructor; he's definitely one of the best I've had so far at Yale. Attending lecture was unnecessary-- reviewing the lecture slides and lecture notes, which Professor Koleske posts on ClassesV2, was more than sufficient to do well in the course. There was also a great support network for this class (Piazza, TA) While the class itself isn't too difficult, the TAs are very nitpicky about grading, so it's easy to get a few points knocked out from a quiz or homework assignment.",
    "dont take unless youre premed or science major. good intro class though",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides a great foundation for future work in the biological sciences. The quizzes are challenging, but I feel like I have learned so much through the process. It is amazing to look back and see how little I knew at the very beginning of the semester and how much I learned in just a few weeks.",
    "Bio 101 is a good course, but definitely seems more catered to those who have taken AP bio. If you haven't taken AP you'll have to work a lot harder. The study guides and lectures are really helpful though.",
    "Do not take this course just to get a science credit. Only take this if it is a prereq for your major, especially if you didn't take AP bio in high school.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is important to learn the foundations of biology no matter what. It is a difficult course but manageable, and in the end I felt that I had retained a lot of information.",
    "Good intro bio course. Take it if you have to. Otherwise, take some higher probably. Write easy having taken AP bio.",
    "Basic and not that hard, but important class.",
    "wow such bio very learned nice folks wow",
    "Generally speaking BIOL 101 isn't a class that you can choose whether or not to take. But rest assured that it is at least enjoyable, and by no means overly challenging. Come with a good attitude and some patience and you should be fine. The lectures are fairly enjoyable.",
    "I would summarize this class as AP Biology with less learning and more regurgitation. I honestly would not recommend this class to another student for the reasons listed in Question 1. It is a shame to have to take a class where you can honestly say you learned nothing.",
    "Difficult intro course that packs a lot of in depth information into a short amount of time.",
    "I would recommend Biol 101 to someone who was considering taking it. It is a well-taught class that covers interesting introductory material."
