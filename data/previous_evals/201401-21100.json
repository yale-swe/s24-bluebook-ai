    "I would suggest AFST 340 to another student because the material was very interesting and contrasted what I thought of the Atlantic coast of Africa.",
    "Yes. It's a nice course to learn about countries in Africa through the thread of slave trade.",
    "Mind blowing class!",
    "Absolutely, not only does it hit two distributional requirements for the history major, it is also a really interesting class about the side of the slave trade that no one seems to think about.",
    "Incredible! Gave a new perspective on a story we often hear in simplified terms. I would definitely recommend!",
    "Take it! Amazing course, very interesting material that is not well understood by much of society today. It will broaden your horizons in a fun and great way.",
    "This was a solid history lecture. On the easier side with a lighter workload, and manageable exams.",
    "It's a small lecture but more students should be taking this!! Readings and lecture material you won't encounter elsewhere and honestly probably will never learn about on your own, yet SO critical and informative to one's understanding of the modern world.",
    "A history of the rise and fall of empires in Africa that every history major should not miss. This is history that is mostly left out of every other history course I have taken--and it is crucial information for historians looking to understand imperialism in general and the specific breed of European imperialism.",
    "It is a study of the Atlantic Slave Trade in terms of its effect and history on the West African Coast. I would definitely recommend it to any other student as it is an interesting and compelling topic."
