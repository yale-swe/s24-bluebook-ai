   "comments": [
    "Professor Hill is onto something quite extraordinary here. How can the practical arts teach you about leadership? Find out in this course. The workload is manageable for a seminar: a book\/week of reading, a 2pg midterm fun paper, and a 10pg final.",
    "Great course with really interesting readings",
    "Thought-provoking, fun course. If you aren't bothered by thinking (sometimes way) outside the box, it could be for you. The quality of the course depends quite a bit on classmates.",
    "This course is fantastic! Definitely not a typical Yale course-- be ready to think a lot about a myriad of topics. Strength is in the discussions, so it really depends on the other students, but Professor Hill's contributions are always very good and perfectly timed so section is always enjoyable. The other strength comes from the reading selections. The weakness would be that at times the class can seem unstructured, and the final is a paper which can be written on anything. Each week, there is a new topic and new readings, so you never find this section boring.",
    "Great fourth or fifth class. Whether or not the parallels to statecraft are there, there's plenty to learn about how to work well and live well from every book in the curriculum. Professor Hill is controversial and he definitely thinks there's a \"correct\" way to think about certain issues and read certain texts. I'm not sure this course succeeds at being what it wants to be--the Grand Strategy-style this-is-how-to-run-the-world manifesto--but it's still thought-provoking and will encourage you to think about how to be better at whatever you do.",
    "A man great and wise, and thoughtful and kind, Mr. Hill knew just how To guide the young mind; But the young minds were loud, With thoughts of their own, And he often allowed their loud thoughts to be shown; He'd quietly listen Until they lost track, Then he'd offer a parable, Bringing them back; But back to what notion No one really grasped Until the last essay When prompting, he asked, \"What does one learn from a practical art, about how to lead, what to choose, how to start?\" So back to the books Students scurried with will to write the best essay and impress Mr. Hill; Out came Aristotle (For the first time that fall) And the pupils were shocked To find that it all Began to make sense-- (As life tends to do When you're flying and fishing and shipbuilding too) To work towards an end And craft your thing well Makes for a good life, ('Tween heaven and hell) Where man has control, creates and can rule But only with smarts, with cunning and tool; He finds where he can as well as cannot; he knows that he won't know all that's Begot'; And so he is wise and does what he ought.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course. It's unlike any other course I've taken at Yale. You will definitely struggle to explain the idea of the course to other students, and at times you may wonder whether the course should really be titled \"Let's Read Some of Charles Hill's Favorite Books.\" But there is a larger continuity that I began to understand about half way through the semester. But even without that continuity, the course is still fascinating. It was wonderful to sit down every week with excerpts from a book about hunting or cooking and just sort of let my brain have at it. It's also a very welcome break from plowing through textbooks and academic articles for other courses. Professor Hill is a wonderful teacher. He's incredibly knowledgeable about everything you can think of, and he has a sense of humor that makes the class very pleasant to be in. I really felt like he would rather hear us say something original and interesting than the pseudo-intellectual BS that Yale students tend to rely on, so that removed the pressure to say the \"right thing\" and let everyone think and discuss. I looked forward to class every week.",
    "A mindblowing class, would recommend. Felt a bit like a DS graduate's club though, so if that's not your cup of tea than beware.",
    "Aristotelian Statecraft is bit of a misnomer. We don't read anything by Aristotle nor anything directly about statecraft. The class is inspired by Aristotle's idea that statecraft is a practical art. We therefore studied different practical arts (farming, fishing, cooking, etc.) in the hope of learning principles applicable to statecraft, strategy, and other areas of life. To a skeptic, reading about farming to learn about statecraft may sound like a waste of time. And I'll admit it was not always clear why exactly we read and discussed what we did. But it's surprising how much there is to learn from these arts, and at the very least, the class cultivates an appreciation for practices one might otherwise consider simplistic. I think the value of this class will only become more apparent as time passes, but for now, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to other students."
