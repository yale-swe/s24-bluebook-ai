    "This course really opened my eyes. I didn't know anything about Buddhism before, and now I feel like I have a good understanding of the basics. I am not Buddhist, but it's a very interesting religion to study because it's so different from Christianity or Islam. Professor Granoff is really sweet and cares about her students. She made herself available whenever I needed her. She is an expert in her field, and always gives great answers to questions you have. If not for the material, take this class to get to know the Professor. NOTE: There are a LOT of heavy readings, but she warns you about this at the beginning. If you're not prepared to do the reading, don't take this class. If you are prepared, you will learn a lot about Indic writing styles, and learn about some really complex ideologies in which many people believe. Also, this is a very reasonable way to get a writing credit.",
    "Absolutely take it even if you aren't considering Religious Studies! It's a great introduction to Buddhism. You might even find yourself thinking of majoring in RLST by the end of it!",
    "I would recommend this class only to students with some background in Buddhism or religious studies in general.",
    "Definitely take this class. There is a fair amount of reading but it is usually narrative based and thus very interesting. Also the more difficult texts on Buddhist philosophy are extremely interesting although intellectually challenging.",
    "If you're even remotely interesting in Buddhism\/Indic religious\/Eastern thought, take this course. Although you might end up inadvertently becoming a RLST major, against all prior expectations.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. It is an interesting and in-depth exploration of different parts of Buddhism. To really get the most out of the class, the student must be willing to dedicate a significant amount of time to doing the readings (but its worth it!).",
    "A look at historical Buddhist religious texts and analyze them like you would in an english class. I would recommend it. Shows you a completely different way of thinking about the world.",
    "If you have any interest in religion at all, take it! Professor Granoff is an expert in her field and holds lively discussions, the readings are interesting, and you have the opportunity to go on several trips throughout the semester.",
    "yes, by all means!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course."
