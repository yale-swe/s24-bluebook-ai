    "This course is extremely strong and the content and teaching could use little in the way of improvement. The course was well organized and taught, and the material was interesting. The only \"weakness\" was the time of day - ending at 8pm is unfortunate."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This class is excellent for any 2nd year graduate student looking to get a more thorough understanding of what micro theory research looks like. The topics change year to year, but if bandit algorithms are being taught again it's a fascinating topic to study with broad applicability and many avenues for research open. If you are not a 2nd year graduate student, I would also recommend this course to others with sufficient math background including analysis, econometrics (or statistics), and a bit of optimal control theory.",
    "Its a course directed at students interested in pursuing research in game theory. It is intense in terms of how much you learn , so you should take it only if you really are interested in research in such a theoretical field."
