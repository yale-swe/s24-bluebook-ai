    "This class is awesome if you're looking to read some french classics in a brand new way. The list of books is amazing, and the subjectivity angle allowed us to really see the literature as a product of the changing 20th century. It was also really helpful in learning about 20th century art and poetry.",
    "Yes! The readings are fantastic, Prof. Zhuo is great, and you will leave it with a good understanding of some important ideas of 20th C fiction.",
    "I highly recommend this class! If you're interested in 20th century literature that pushes the boundaries of things like temporality and narrative within the story, then this is the course for you! The work load was very reasonable but I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Take it if you're a French major and enjoy somewhat experimental literature!"
