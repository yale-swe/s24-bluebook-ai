   "comments": [
    "RNST 500 is a survey of early modern history from the Reformation to the Enlightenment, focusing this year on religious controversy. I would definitely recommend it to another student interested in strengthening his or her knowledge of the Renaissance period.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course for any student who wants to develop a deeper understanding of the intellectual branches of the Northern Renaissance, especially Reformation theology and its output in various discourses.",
    "Yes! I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a colleague especially for the chance to study with Professor Eire. The course content was appropriate and manageable. My only comment would be that it might be advantageous to rename the course 'The Northern Renaissance', as that more accurately depicts the content than 'Intro to Ren Studies', and works as an addendum to 'The Renaissance in Italy' on a transcript."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt that this course provided valuable background information for a further exploration of early modern English literature and history. I was aware of some of the religious controversies that were most central to British politics in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, but getting an international context put things in a different perspective.",
    "The final paper topic is the students' preference, though Professor Eire helps guide you towards the way that your topic is (or isn't) \"Renaissance.\" You will have better footing in the class if you previously took the Renaissance in Italy seminar, but Professor Eire is very cognizant of the different approaches and levels of familiarity with which each student comes to class.",
    "It helps me understand how complex \"the Reformation(s)\" are and how difficult it is to research on such as vast and difficult topic. I enjoyed the class tremendously, but I also know that I need to study a lot harder if I wish to write a dissertation on it. Thank you, Professor Eire!",
    "The course deepened knowledge of my profession by giving me a vehicle to read works that I had known about beforehand but had never properly studied or discussed. Professor Eire's practical insights into academic research, publishing, and translation were also immensely helpful."
