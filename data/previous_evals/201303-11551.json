   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to students genuinely interested - and with some background - in global justice and human rights. It is not a good intro course if you have never thought about these issues, and you have to be self-motivated to do the readings and engage actively in class discussions.",
    "This course should actually be called \"Justice and Global Poverty.\" Its present title suggests that it is a survey course for all justice philosophy, which is incorrect. You will address topics of international distributive justice and global poverty. The course is challenging and well taught, and I would highly recommend it.",
    "The first lecture of this course was kind of mind-blowing. That single two-hour class session altered how I look at the world and the institutions which comprise it. I felt the course quickly began to rely on the students too much for the content of classes though, so we didn't get as much straight-on, really fascinating teaching by Professor Pogge throughout the semester as I would have liked. Also, assignments took FOREVER to get graded, so you couldn't really tell how you were doing in the class.I think Professor Pogge is pretty brilliant. He examines issues critically and thoroughly. That critical eye extends to his students. He could be a bit short occasionally, and isn't loathe to embarrass people when they make points he doesn't like. I don't think it was the worst, but it wasn't always pleasant, either."
