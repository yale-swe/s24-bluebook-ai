   "comments": [
    "A look at foreign investment, particularly project finance, and the way that these deals should be evaluated.Highly recommended - if you're someone who enjoys the business side of things or the development side of things, you'll get a lot out of this class. Kingsley's also a great teacher who finds creative ways to illustrate concepts and makes an exceptional effort to get to know her students and meet their needs.",
    "This was a terriffic class. I learned a lot that was useful both for my career and I also learned information that was applicable in other classes. I love having a teacher that is also a practitioner. I would highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in international investing or development.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in political economy, foreign investment, or development in general - it has a good look at MNC project development in emerging markets.",
    "An interesting, challenging (for someone with no prior background) course that provides an insightful look into a particular investment approach to emerging markets. The course is aided greatly by the first hand private sector experience of the professor and provides a nice balance between academic and pragmatic perspectives on the issues.",
    "This is a course on international finance, with a focus on foreign direct investment. It is helpful in understanding the many institutions that govern international business, finance, investment and development. I most definitely recommend this course.",
    "Class provides a mix of theoretical and real world investment deal evaluations for international foreign investment and project finance. Great background for project finance incorporating finance, political science, international relations, economic development, and law.",
    "Yes. It teaches you how in the real world project finance works.",
    "Overall I loved the course, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to other students. It is geared toward professionals, not academics, and gives an insiders perspective on how multimillion dollar investment decisions are made."

   "comments": [
    "As a student of development, it helped me see the role MNC's play, their priorities, and investor's priorities in big infrastructure projects in developing countries.",
    "Since taking this course, I have begun to reassess the way in which I will engage the issues central to my professional areas of interest in the future. I personally found the course, and the topics covered insightful and inspiring in more ways than one. I hope to have the opportunity to take additional courses on this and similar topics.",
    "As a student at SOM class provided overview of FDI and Project Finance that isn't offered at SOM. Class material was at the intersection of international geopolitics, government, and finance which is the area that I am most interested in.",
    "The analyses of foreign investment deals deepened my knowledge of what international investors care about, and the variety of ways they can mitigate risk. It also made me want to further research these types of deals."
