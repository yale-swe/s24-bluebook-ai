    "As I mentioned above, I don't feel like I got a good sense of the genesis of American studies as a discipline this term. In the future, I think understanding where American studies has come from and what its practice looks like today should be the focus of this course. In my mind, I think that means reading texts on the history of the discipline and reading works of American studies scholars (rather than focusing primarily on theoretical writings from related disciplines).I do feel that Prof. Agnew's vision for the course was different than what actually transpired, perhaps because professors misinterpreted his instructions for selecting readings to assign.",
    "I believe I gained most from learning how other academics now in American Studies begantheir careers and have adapted their work to the discipline."
