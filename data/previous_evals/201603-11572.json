    "Working independently, developing a research plan, writing literature reviews, analysis plans.",
    "Great way to gain experience in research without too much time commitment..",
    "I learned a lot about research, asking scientific questions, reading papers critically, and how to carefully think through the procedure of any experiment",
    "I gained a lot of valuable experience doing real research. I learned more about what it means to be a researcher, how to design and run studies, and many essential research skills.",
    "I learned how a research lab operates, about many different psychological questionnaires, and how to recruit participants to a lab was.",
    "Working in a lab for credit was a great way to gain hands-on skills and apply things I'd learned in my other courses.",
    "I learned a lot about what life is actually like as a research assistant, gaining insight into the daily tasks of researchers, as well as learning to interact with subjects, which was incredibly rewarding.",
    "I developed stronger organisational skills and learned to work from a more self motivated framework.",
    "I spent time this semester working on skills in presentation of data and felt like I improved my ability to make figures that are easy to understand and help explain the data in a visual format."

   "comments": [
    "This is a well designed course-no final assignments, which is nice.",
    "Strengths: Great environment, very hands-on, lots of valuable experiences Weakness: significant fixed time commitment",
    "I enjoyed the open-ended nature of the final paper that I had to write for the course, but perhaps would have enjoyed a bit more structure\/instruction with respect to the topic.",
    "Poor coordination between DUS and research advisors regarding forms, requirements for completion of course, and regular milestones. At best ambiguous descriptions of final project submission."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend if you have a busy semester otherwise but still want to be involved in research.",
    "Working in Laurie's lab is a wonderful learning experience. As a student, you're treated equally; your opinions are valued and respected at lab meetings. The graduate students are also wonderful and very happy to help teach. The overall lab atmosphere is very conducive to learning.",
    "Definitely. Especially if you are considering a research career, experience like this is invaluable.",
    "I feel that every pysch and cog sci student should do lab work prior to starting their senior thesis. It is important to get a feel for what conducting an experiment is actually like and some of the roadblocks you may face.",
    "Yes!",
    "Until Professor Ahn and other responsible advisors eliminate research projects that place too much administrative onus on the student to both develop a class plan and execute research duties, I would advise students to stay away from this elective."
