   "comments": [
    "This course was really interesting and fun! We talked about a myriad of different topics that applied to countries around the world and had great discussions. The readings were interesting and the group presentations were fun. Professor Greenberg is awesome and very accessible to students.",
    "Very good course. Not much weekly work and Professor Greenberg presents the material in an engaging and interesting way. Each class is split between lecturing and student discussion. The assignments include a group project, a midterm, and a paper.",
    "Very good course. Definitely more of a survey than an in-depth course. You learn a lot of things about language and politics across the board and around the globe.",
    "I would highly recommend PLSC 365 due to the fascinating subject and energetic professor. It is a mix of ideological discussions and more concrete lectures about language theory and specific case studies.",
    "Take it! I really enjoyed this class. I guess I would have liked a bit more lecturing\/background information, but the class isn't too much work, and discussions are usually pretty enjoyable. There's a group project and a final paper on almost any topic of your choice, so you really have the option to look into what you're interested in related to language and politics.",
    "Yes if you are interested in language and how the politics of language impact people and demographics.",
    "Great survey course of language policy issues but doesn't go as in depth as the syllabus indicates and we never made any satisfying conclusions. But each seminar meeting was interesting and Professor Greenberg is extremely entertaining.",
    "Definitely take it if you have a chance.",
    "This is one of the rare classes that can pull of the evening seminar time slot. It is relaxed and not too stressful and the material is interesting. However, some days discussion would be slow and not very engaging, which was compounded by everyone having their laptops out during seminar, which I find is the number one way to foster a disengaged environment. THat being said, Prof Greenberg is a wonderful person and really entertaining. Take the class if you want a low stress seminar, but know that there are other seminars out there from which you would gain a lot more substantive knowledge and have much more fruitful discussions.",
    "I would recommend it. A nice class that is interesting and fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I loved it so much, I'm going to try to take Prof. Greenberg's other seminar as well."
