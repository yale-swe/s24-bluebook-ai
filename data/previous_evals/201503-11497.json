    "Yay, rotations!",
    "Rotations are required, but there is a good reason for this. Rotations allow you to try different labs so you can find a good fit. Since one rotation has to be an \"off\" rotation, you have the chance to experience a different field. The amount of time you spend depends a lot on the professor, and through rotations you can see if the work schedule of the lab fits with want you want.",
    "Rotation is necessary for finding a good thesis lab.",
    "Essential way to tour labs to determine what work you would like to do.",
    "It's a lab rotation. It depends a lot on the lab in question but you do get a good feel for the lab work and environment."

    "I learned different techniques through rotations and had my own project in both of my rotations so far. Although the rotation project most likely won't be the thesis project, I can get an idea of lab dynamics and also different types of research done in the lab.",

    "Rotations have been extremely useful in helping me broaden my skills and knowledge in various biochemistry techniques.",
    "Fairly self-explanatory. I got a good idea of what it would be like to work in both labs."
