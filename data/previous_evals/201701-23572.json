    "Prof Reuning-Scherer is an excellent lecturer. The course was a thorough walk through the methods and applications of applied spatial statistics. Each class, the prior class' concepts were briefly reviewed, and then built upon. The use of R, and provision of the scripts used, helped illustrate the application of the theory. I hadn't used R at the beginning of the course, but by the end, was able to perform complex models and troubleshoot code.",

Former colleagues at MIT had used these methods to characterize the spatial relationships of buildings and enhance models for estimating the urban heat island effect.",

    "Find a few datasets early in the semester and do work on them throughout. Not all of the techniques are applicable to every type of data but it's helpful to work through more than just Jonathan's scripts since 99% of the battle is dealing with the vagaries of spatial data.",
