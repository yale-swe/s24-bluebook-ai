    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It had some of the best readings and was one of the most unique subjects to study.",
    "The best course I've taken at Yale. Professor Laster was an incredible discussion leader, and the subject matter was fascinating. Readings are manageable (usually 30-40 pages per session), which means that all of us actually did the readings. This year, we had a really small class -- seven people, including Dominika -- which was great. Go to the first few classes and get a feel for whether you like the other people; if so, definitely definitely take the course. (If not, just convince your friends to come take the class with you!)",
    "Politics of Performance is next level. It's the single most engaging, challenging and enjoyable class I have taken at Yale. I was invested in each of our discussions. Professor Laster created such a special, inviting, validating space that raised the emotional and intellectual stakes of our class. Each member of the class had a strong presence and contributed in such a personal and powerful way. As an artist and thinker, I grew enormously. In the final session, we made plans to continue meeting as a group with the professor in the following semester(s), manifesting the truly special nature of the course.",
    "A gemDirect application of theory in readings to practice in class, so much so that it at once commanded the total involvement of the mind and body. We learned how the abstractions come to affect us, beings that possess a body that feels and thinks not too differently from other bodies possessed by others. Honest and sincere course with a caring professor; unmatched authenticity among all the courses I've taken. Going to class was an energy-generating experience that inspired me for remainder of the week. As a humanities student, an incredible way to approach theater; at once a performance, a social critique, a catharsis, a revolution, an acknowledgement of the other, an acceptance of the self, a linkage of the other and the self to a political mechanism, a sincere play. Course reading responses and website a great dialogue, a honest reflection in solitude that is then discussed in class. Course midterm and project a daring effort on behalf of the self toward exercising the material learned. Quite sad when it ended; the class became a small understanding collective by the end of it.Absolutely absolutely brilliant and caring. Brought in outside instructors from far away locations to speak to us; invested herself in the performances as well. familiarly with the material impressive, communication of it even more so. Willing to ask all the hard questions and consider all our honest unfiltered opinions on the political material presented; perhaps looking for an honest relation between the student and his work rather than the performance of a faux academic. Focused on listening to each of her students, at responding to them with the particular information that would affect them themost. Obviously passionate about the subject and about all that's currently going on in the world. So genuine that her affects makes us want to stop the performance of competent logic and reach into the irrational depths, pull out what we find, and present it to all. Unforgettable.",
    "Politics of Performance is by far the best course I have taken at Yale. The discussions were intense and fascinating. The combination of interested students and the professor led to a class where we were all willing to break down boundaries and have truly insightful explorations."
