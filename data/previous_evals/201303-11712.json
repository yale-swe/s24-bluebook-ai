   "comments": [
    "A balanced first-semester course. Not very difficult but very interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "Students take Econ 110 because they have to and because it is necessary, it is a pretty basic intro class. If you're serious about economics, I would definitely recommend it over the lecture.",
    "Take it if you are interested in Econ. Make sure you're not terrible at Math.",
    "I would recommend Economics 110 05 to another student because it is a great introductory course to microeconomics that has a reasonable amount of work and great access to the professor.",
    "A positive experience. But do not be fooled by the Bluebook's claims that this course covers the same material as the lecture. It's quite different. You cover a lot of interesting topics that the lecture doesn't, such as cognitive biases, positional externalities, monopolistic competition, sequential games, et cetera. Professor Simons is hilarious.",
    "I would not recommend this course to non-majors, as it is not the most interesting class to take.",
    "About what you'd expect. Don't worry if you get a bad professor; this is the type of class where it's easy to learn from the textbook. Read it, do the practice problems in the book and online, DO NOT go to office hours to get the answers (they'll just give them to you and you'll learn nothing) and you'll get an A.",
    "It is a great introductory course into economics. If you have the chance to take it, do. Also read the text book. It is well written and very useful.",
    "Yes, great class for the material, whether or not you intend to be an econ major. Perks of the \"seminar\" class are large enough to consider - easy to ask questions during class, professor who is easily accessible by email, etc. Myths about a harder curve were not validated by my experience.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not too hard and it's pretty interesting without being a lot of work. Intro Econ is required for prospective Econ majors, and Econ 110 students learn more than in 115.",
    "DO NOT TAKE SEMINAR!! take the lecture! this class is unnecessarily hard!",
    "A comprehensive overview of microeconomics. You actually have to do the reading in this course and put the appropriate amount of work into the problem sets, but if you are willing to do the work you will get a greater understanding of basic micro than the lecture could offer. Professor Simons is great at explaining the concepts and associated examples,and she is approachable outside of class, though I would rely more on the book than your in class notes to study for exams and to help you along with problem sets.",
    "I would recommend this course. The lecture was great because it was a smaller group of students and we got to ask more questions and get to know our professor. I learned some pretty cool stuff, and I feel like this course widened my view.",
    "I would certainly recommend Econ 110 -- it's a great introduction to macroeconomics. Professor Simons does a fine job teaching the class. She teaches the material effectively, with good examples in class. We had a few small class discussions but most classes were lectures. Some of the lectures can be dry, but she certainly did a good job covering the material. There were 6 problem sets (lowest one dropped) which helped for practicing for the exams- one midterm and a final. The exams were pretty straightforward and fair, and there's a good curve. I certainly recommend this class -- a great intro to microeconomics."
