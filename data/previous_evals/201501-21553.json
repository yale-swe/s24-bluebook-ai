    "This is a great course in terms of lectures. The readings are a bit variable, and less valuable that the lectures overall. Jacobson builds a pretty good narrative arc to American history but of course in doing so there are some generalizations. Highly enjoyable overall.",
    "great comprehensive course on the cultural history of the US. professor jacobson is an engaging and fantastic lecturer. the course itself is not that difficult. the reading workload is somewhat heavy (a book a week) however, you can easily be successful in the class just knowing the general ideas of the book. the 2nd paper is very open-ended and lets you do it on whatever you want. very doable and interesting course. wouldnt nessecary recommend it, however, as a gut or a super super easy 5th class.",
    "ForMAC is a 20th century US history course taught from the perspective of various media sources that were prominent at the time. It took me a while to get into the course -- I thought the beginning lectures were somewhat disjointed, but by the end I came to really really enjoy it. If you're skeptical, stick with it! Lots of reading, but it goes well with the material, if you take the time to do it. And lectures are very interesting and often lots of fun. MJ is awesome. It ended up being my favorite course this semester.",
    "A DEFINITIVE course to take at Yale University.",
    "Would totally recommend, very interesting and very easy to do well if you have any background in American history.",
    "In my opinion, everyone who cares at all about American History and the formation of America as we know it should take this course. It goes on a journey through songs, videos, movies, and books from World War I to the current moment, proposing that culture was a pervasive and integral tool in shaping this country. It will make any student who takes this class seriously a wiser, more well-informed, and more thoughtful person. Workload is not too bad, either: Two papers, an in-class midterm, and a final with a take-home option.",
    "ForMAC is an excellent class. I highly recommend it to any student, regardless of major or interests. Professor Jacobson is a wonderful lecturer and presents the material in a story-like fashion. The readings can sometimes be dry and long, but they do work to supplement the class material very well.",
    "I took this as a class outside my major because I wanted to take a fun and interesting course. I'm glad I took this class, it's definitely very good, and I learned a lot. That being said, I didn't find it quite as amazing or life changing as some previous course evals implied, so if that's the kind of course your looking for, keep this in mind but shop others too. This class also spent more time than I anticipated on topics of race and gender. This isn't a bad thing - I think these topics are hugely important - but it's not something I expected going in, so make sure these are topics you want to talk about. Also, the reading is fairly heavy if you want to do all of it. I also recommend taking this class credit\/d. I rarely understood my TA's grading or comments on my work, and the standards seemed inconsistent and arbitrary. Taking this class for a grade would have caused me a lot of stress this semester. I know others had better experiences, but at the very least this seems to vary by section.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! great insight into American history but in the context of culture.",
    "TAKE IT! This is important information delivered in a really fun, personable way. You learn how culture works in extremely subtle ways and it has made me reevaluate a lot of things that happen in society. There's not that much work - 2 papers, 1 midterm, 1 final. Don't take a section with weekly reading responses... def not worth reading the books unless you really want a specific account.",
    "amazing, life-changing",
    "Basically \"white men suck.\" High school level history with some cool cultural stuff mixed in, but all to teach the message that white men were horrible people. Second paper was really fun to write because of its flexibility.",
    "Absolutely",
    "This is a really great class. Professor Jacobson gives you a completely new way to look at history and current events. There were a few points where the class seemed to turn into a basic history class. Overall it was a terrific class!",
    "Take this class.",
    "SUCH AN AMAZING CLASS!! Formac will equip you not only with an awesome, Leftist perspective on 20th Century American history, but also a methodology of critiquing the world around you. MFJ is incredibly thoughtful and incisive. This class is basically perfect, and you should DEFINITELY take it if you're interested in politics, Leftism, cultural history, or just generally want to immerse yourself in historical narratives and truths that your high school teachers hid from you. MFJ will provide you with an archive of cultural artifacts political cartoons, government propaganda, advertisements, movie clips, and songs that you really won't have access to anywhere else. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!! It will not disappoint.",
    "FORMAC is an incredible class. It teaches you about pop culture and important historical events and movements from each decade form the 1920s to present. It was always interesting, and we really did make it to present day, which a lot history classes don't teach. It was great to learn about recent and current culture through the historical lens. The book a week was definitely stressful at times, but all of the books were so fascinating and amazing so it was worth the work. Definitely take this class!",
    "Would recommend. Super relevant and engaging.",
    "This class will change your life. It's really well run as a class. But more importantly it's super engaging and will literally make you walk out of it every day questioning your very existence. Professor Jacobson is very special.",
    "A great course that opens your eyes to the history being made around you everyday and gives you a greater understanding of the past.",
    "I'm a senior, non-AmStud major who took this class for fun on the recommendation of my AmStud major friends. The workload wasn't too bad, the material was interesting and I came out of the class having learned a lot. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Formation of Modern American Culture is hands down one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Jacobson's lectures are always amazing, and the books that you read are incredibly interesting (you get to read about cultural icons like Muhammad Ali, Janis Joplin, and Frank Sinatra, to name a few). Section is a great compliment to the weekly lectures, and the TAs are all awesome people. If you're interested in learning more about American history, and you love listening to music, watching movies, reading books, or keeping up with pop culture, then this class is definitely for you. Not only is it a great time, but Professor Jacobson will make you see the world in a different light by the end of the course. Best. Class. Ever.",
    "Absolutely, especially for underclassmen beginning their Yale college careers.",
    "Take this class! Its absolutely amazing, will change the whole way you understand how this country works, and teach you tons of things you didnt know before. Professor Jacobson is an excellent lecturer, fun to listen to and always interesting. We started with the Harlem Renaissance and ended pretty much with 9\/11 with some extra stuff thrown in at the end. The class is very much based in the culture (as the name says), so its not focusing on details of war or presidents policies unless it has something to do with a trend in the lifestyles of the American people. Theres a big focus on historical artifactssongs, films, etc and analyzing what they mean\/show\/represent. Theres a lot of reading, but most of it youll actually want to read. We had two 5 page papers, a midterm, and a final.",
    "This was a good class, and one of the few at Yale that allows you to critically examine American pop culture. Jacobson can be a little dull at times.",
    "Take this class if you have room! Not a terribly huge investment of time, but fun analytical work and really the constant lesson of looking at features of culture we take for granted.",
    "TAKE IT!!! As Prof. Jacobson said, this course would ruin your life (but in a good way!!!). It definitely changed the way I look at US history and culture!",
    "ForMAC is a great survey course of American cultural history, beginning around the Harlem Renaissance up to present day. Lectures were always interesting and engaging. If anything, this course tries to do too much. Course load is heavy - at least a book each week - all very interesting material though. There were 2 short papers, a mid-term and a final (take-home or in-class). The mid-term was not bad at all but the short papers were a bit trickier (depending on TA). Would definitely recommend this class, especially to freshmen\/sophomores.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I would describe it as an analysis of American culture throughout the 20th century and how evident those cultural aspects become to the present day.",
    "I would say that though I found the lectures to be a tiny bit scattered, I thought the material was so fascinating (and Prof. Jacobson so totally adorable) taht it was worth it. Papers and exams were also weirdly fun to do. This class definitely made me think in a newly critical way about culture and politics.",
    "cool survey course from 1920s on. Skips around in some basic history, but the focus on cultural artifacts our generation might not necessarily be aware of is a cool tradeoff. A little disorganized but not problematically so. Take it!",
    "An incredible history of America told mainly through the framework of racism and exclusion. Changes your perspective on history of America.",
    "HIst 106 is a wild ride through American cultural history since 1920. It's fun class which allows one to analyze cultural products to find the historical implications of the American mindsets of the time. There is a particular focus on race in the American system. I would recommend this course. There is a lot of reading (a book a week) especially if you read cover to cover, but they are all fascinating and well-chosen to compliment lecture. I think it is the kind of course that would be interesting to anybody regardless of major, and almost essential as it encourages questioning of and actual thought about the system we inhabit and the traces it leaves within us.",
    "This is an amazing course that I would recommend to anyone that is slightly interested in American culture and to all prospective American Studies majors! Jacobson is incredible, the readings are fascinating, and each lecture leaves you stunned. Favorite class at Yale to date!",
    "IT GOES SO QUICKLY. Have a working knowledge of American history, otherwise things go right over your head a lot. The exams and the papers are tough. And the material is tough. And there is so much of it. BUT because of that you are unexpected drenched in the past that made the USA of the present - a highly informative, eye-opening, sometimes brutal call to awareness. Take it, it's ok if you struggle a little.",
    "Take it!",
    "It's kinda boring at times, but the readings and papers are interesting if you're into American studies. If you don't like the readings on the syllabus don't take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend ForMAC to anyone who wants to understand parts of American culture they may superficially recognize.",
    "ForMAC is really a class about how everything American, from the media, to our economy, to our culture, to race relations, just everything. There's so much worthwhile and captivating information that it's hard not to learn from this class. It's also completely inclusive to different perspectives and ways of life, whether it be on race, class, sex, etc. You really get what you invest in the course, and if you want to learn then you will learn. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Great class! Take it! You will learn how to analyze cultural artifacts for their historical and political content. Jacobson is a fun, funny lecturer, and the course requirements are not too bad (1 midterm, 2 papers, 1 final, and required section).",
    "A little overrated, but an engaging lecture and interesting material.",
    "ForMAC is probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale thus far. I came out of every lecture excited and I felt it changed my perspective about American history and culture. It has made me engage with the media I see on a regular basis in a more thoughtful, nuanced way, and it has brought meaning to phenomena in American history and culture that I've always been aware of but hadn't understood fully before.",
    "If you want to understand more about American cultural heritage and be able to better analyze any type of cultural text, this class is for you. It is not for you if you are seeking more than an overview or if you've taken very similar classes that are more targeted and specific (the pace, then, might be even more frustrating).",
    "Take it, but understand that it is a lot of general cursory information with little other information that does not come from the professor's point of view. It doesn't dive too deeply into the material and when it does, it is often from the professor's standpoint. It does have a focus on Black people, but the focus is not exclusive nor dominating. It's fun and interesting with not that much work. I think everyone will definitely learn valuable information from taking this class. There is something to be said though that you have to read a book per week. That does add up.",
    "This may be one of the most life-changing, perspective-altering, world-shattering courses I have taken at Yale. It will redefine your outlook on what it means to be an American, a citizen, a woman, a man, a student, etc. ForMAC analyzes music, poetry, film, prose, television, YouTube videos, radio, and many other mediums to create an all-encompassing view of 20th century American history. An incredible experience.",
    "Amazing course. You'll never look at \"low\" culture - TV, movies, board games, advertisements- the same way. It makes everything we're surrounded by more interesting, for what it reflects about its context- when it was made, who made it. This course makes you think. If you're a culture junkie, or a history junkie, this is a must-take.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. This is the single most valuable class I took at Yale. It changed my life and made me a better person, or at least showed me how I could be a better person.",
    "A class where you'll get out of it what you put in. You don't have to do most of the reading (its a lot, one book a week) but if I had i would have gotten a lot out of the class. The lectures cover specific material that Jacobson thinks is interesting (and usually is ) but because of the survey nature of the class you have to move pretty quickly. Jacobson is a good lecturer if you pay attention. Easy to zone out in his class. If you enjoy culture though and like American Studies you should take this class.",
    "Great intro class for any student interest in American history and culture. Some might urge students to take Prof. Jacobson's short expositions of radical thought with a grain of salt. While it's important to keep an ear out for those moments when Prof. Jacobson intertwines the historical analysis with his own criticisms, great value could be glossed by entertaining, if only briefly, the truth of his words.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It teaches the twentieth century American story that every American should know. And while much of the material takes a similar political position, the material dealt with in the course displays a breath and style unlike any other in a course I've taken. Taking this course is a must.",
    "The Formation of Modern American Culture was a phenomenal course. Probably the best class I have yet to take at Yale. The engaging material, the terrific course syllabus, and Professor Jacobson's prodigious skills as a lecturer made for a winning combination. It was probably the most intellectually fulfilling experience I've had while at Yale. This class is not to be missed!"
