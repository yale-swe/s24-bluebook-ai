    "I tink the subject matter is incedibly important and really interesting. I would recommend taking this course because of all you will learn abou how military has almsot completely defined most of western history. Don't expect to get that much out of lecture. It doesn' apply to the exams at all.",
    "If you took AP Euro then you pretty much know it already, but take it for the love of God. You will see why.",
    "Absolutely take it if you need a history course that isn't boring as hell.",
    "Take it, but don't expect it to be life changing",
    "Survey course on Western military history. You'll learn a little bit about a lot of things.",
    "Relatively straight-forward and easy history class, quite unique among the Yale history offerings. This would be a good fifth credit.",
    "Probably not",
    "TAKE IT",
    "I would call this a broad but reasonably detailed overview of a fascinating subject lead by an expert teaching staff. I would recommend it, with caveats, to most people interested in taking it -- if you're ready to work hard, you can really get a lot out of this class.",
    "It is a review of the economic, political, technological, and geographic factors which played into the history of military warfare. While Professor Kennedy does detail some of the more tactical components of military history, much of his lecture content seems to focus on these other factors.Kennedy's lectures are often focused on general thematic questions, as opposed to being highly content-driven. Consequently, the reading is something which you HAVE to do if you expect to know your stuff when the final\/midterm arrives. The readings, however, are very interesting for the most part, although some of them can be rather dry.",
    "This is a great 5th class. I enjoyed the whole thing (lecture, section, and the readings are all great), and it is not too demanding. If you are swamped with work from other commitments one week, you can usually put off the readings in Military History and come back to them later, as the class only grades based on a midterm, a final, and section attendance\/participation. Professor Kennedy is also an excellent lecturer, and the topic is fascinating, even though it's very broad.",
    "This is an excellent course. Paul Kennedy is a hero and one of the greatest professors I've been taught by at Yale. This course will offer an extensive GENERAL summary of military history in more than five centuries it claims to cover (1500 - present). There is no medieval or classical history, but that isn't what the intention of the course is. Take it if you want to learn about the role of navies, air corps, and land armies in military history. If Paul Kennedy is lecturing, even more reason to take it... he's unbelievably dedicated and a rare primary source for history.",
    "I'd recommend it as a good survey history course. It's pretty light.",
    "It is a must-take course",
    "Yes, a bit broad, but a nice class to put all the battles and wars of history into context of a grand study of war.",
    "A great course! I love military history and this course was perfect for that. Professor Kennedy is a really great lecturer who gets your attention with his telling of the story of history. I would recommend this to everyone.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was a very unique perspective on recent history and on history since 1500, which I appreciated. It is a little heavily weighted towards the final (60%), but I would recommend it all the same.",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend this course to another student. Though entertaining, the lectures don't really have any structure at all and often represent a series of pictures rather than a coherent point\/argument. The Kennedy book is well written and cogent, however.",
    "Great oversight of the military reasons for the rise of the west since 1500.",
    "Fun class. Some of the lessons are intuitive (airplanes changed the nature of war), but overall worthwhile. Get Aaron as your TA.Warning: many think of this as a 'gut class' but the exams are fairly difficult. Don't be scared: if you do the readings and engage in class, they are nothing with which to be concerned but don't expect to get an A without studying in this class.",
    "Don't take this class. There are many other history courses that will be better organized and more rewarding.",
    "Absolutely! It isn't demanding (although the readings are extensive they're not all necessary - though I did them because they were interesting) and provides a good survey of Western powers.",
    "great anecdotesminimal chronologyprior knowledge helpsIn all seriousness though, no work apart from readings, but there's a ridiculous amount of reading. Kennedy gives some very fun lectures. If you're disciplined enough to pay close attention in lecture and do most of the readings, take it.",
    "Good general introductions of wars, less about the specific dates and events and more about the economic and tevhnological advances.",
    "Its a survey of american and western military history, with an emphasis on aeronautics",
    "Take this class--it is excellent. It was a little different than I expected from a military history class--rather than focusing on individual wars or battles, we concentrated on the long-term economic and technological trends, which really tied the course together. Professor Kennedy is great, really funny and just enjoyable to listen to. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student who has a real interest in the subject. There is a lot of reading but one is not held accountable for finishing all of it.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to a friend. Lecture involves Paul Kennedy rambling about whatever happens to come to mind, there is no organization, it doesn't matter what the slides have pictures of because he won't be talking about them, and it doesn't matter what he says, the test is all about the reading and section. There is a fairly large amount of weekly reading and you really have to do all of it to succeed since the lectures provide no useful information. Then there's section. Believe me, you want to be in one of the ROTC sections. Their section leaders are great, very nice, not too intense, and knowledgeable. The grad student section leaders are terrible in comparison, they grade much more toughly (and you are graded only in comparison to your section by the way) and are much more serious in general which isn't fun. In the end, there's only a midterm and final plus the reading so the amount of work isn't too high, but it was definitely not an enjoyable experience for me. If you want anything resembling structure look elsewhere.",
    "This course is extremely interesting. The information covered is great if you are interested in the economics, tactics, strategy, and politics behind war and during it. However, Professor Kennedy's lecture is not interesting and almost useless. I would suggest taking the course only if you are willing to do all of the readings and like the course topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this if you are interested in Military History in the slightest. The class is fascinating and Professor Kennedy is AMAZING. He truly made class so much fun to come to. It's definitely a niche history class, but one that is incredibly valuable. I also really appreciated that the class reaches into the present day and poses questions about the future of military history and technology.",
    "I would recommend it definitely if they were interested in a history class with a large scope and only few hard dates and facts.",
    "A great longue duree survey of military history of the West. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the military history with two strong caveats: 1. this is a survey course. It is probably best to have some background info on history especially WWI, WWII before taking this class. 2. this is a very macro level course, so don't expect minute details of tactics and ground level movements of individual battles, it is about grand strategy in a big picture sense.",
    "Hist 221 is a great course, however you won't get a lot out of it if you don't do the readings. They are very worthwhile doing. This is a great survey course, but does not go into intense depth because of the breath of the course. This is not a very hard class but is worthwhile.",
    "Credit\/D is the way to go",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale (I'm a senior). It's nice to get a more pure history class that lacks the ideological bias of focusing on gender, race, class etc. I looked forward to doing the readings each week. Professor Kennedy's lectures are a pleasure.",
    "Good class--a lot of reading, but most of it is fascinating",
    "Fantastic course!",
    "It is worth it because of all the interesting material and lectures - but probably best for a credit D or an audit. It is too broad, and there is too much information, for one to really concentrate on absorbing it all and performing well on tests.",
    "A course that any one should take. Be open to shopping it. This is not about prof Kennedy ranting about how good or bad war is. It's about listening to one of the most famous historian alive analyzing objectively the anthological development of warfare: who funds it? How does the rise of the nation state changes it? What drives its technological advancements ? etc etc etc.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student that has an interest in the deveolpment of the early European nation states as well as the military innovations of the past century",
    "I would take it if you want a cool overview of Western history told through the major wars. It's definitely interesting, but you really have to do the readings if you want anything out of the class. Kennedy seems like an amazing dude, but he's far too rambling (and probably just too old)to be an effective lecturer. That said, the readings are great and very easy to do. The workload is also eased by the fact that there's just a midterm and a final, but it also means you better not mess either one of those up.Overall, I'd take it as an easy-ish option, but there are definitely more informative history classes out there.",
    "GUT",
    "My advice would be to not take this class unless you are seriously committed to doing the many readings and unless you find those readings enjoyable. It IS very interesting, but you won't get much out of it unless you make a commitment to doing independent work to keep up.",
    "Take it while Paul Kennedy is still around teaching it. Makes you think about the social and economic factors driving war.",
    "Yes; I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It provides a unique outlook as to how today's world power structure came about. Kennedy is a great lecturer, and the supplemental readings illustrate the themes that Kennedy discussed in class. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and I hope that others will take this class to have the same enjoyment that I did. I will certainly be trying to schedule another class taught by Professor Kennedy!",
    "I would recommend the course. It's a great survey course of European history in general. Be warned: take excellent lecture notes (Prof. Kennedy requires you take them by hand, so make sure you type them up afterwards and cross-reference with someone). The power points he puts up are NOT that helpful for review. And the readings aren't very clear and succinct either. Also be warned, you will probably be doing a lot of outside research because he often glosses over events that you'll want to know in more detail when writing your exam essays.",
    "Yes. Interesting class, very reasonable workload. Exams are worth everything--if that is a problem for you, do not take it.",
    "A good history class. The work throughout the course is entirely readings, which do contain crucial information for the two exams which make up almost all of the grade.",
    "My first history class at Yale, kind of took it because wars are always interesting to study. I'd imagine it's not too different from any of the other classes out there. No reason to recommend not taking it, material is interesting and you get out what you put in (cliche, but the closer attention you pay to your readings, the more you'll learn, even though it's not entirely necessary).",
    "If you are not in ROTC definitely still take this class if you are interested in military history. Professor Kennedy is really interesting to listen too-even if his lectures are totally off topic. There is a lot of reading and you get lost pretty quickly if you don't keep up. The work load is definitely a downside but the readings themselves are interesting. I would recommend this class.",
    "Imagine the childhood tales of a grandfather sitting his grandkid on his knee, first settling comfortably into his armchair before regaling the child with stories of the past and arousing even more curiosity \"But why did they fight this war, grandpa?\" \"Well let me tell you, it was no easy decision....\" Paul Kennedy is like your cool grandpa that seems to know everything. His manner of teaching is brilliant, weaving even the most minute of detail or unknown fact into historiography. He is very funny and his sense of humor is only enhanced by his calm and softspoken manner (if you've read any of his books, you'll know what I mean. Brilliant.). Danggit, just take a course with Professir Kennedy before you graduate; he is also ill, so get in a class now. He cares about students, about people, and wants you to be curious about the world.",
    "If you have any interest in military affairs this course is for you.",
    "History of Military in the West. Only the west, and it jumps based on lecture.",
    "There are better Global Affairs courses that you can take. I felt that I really did not gain much knowledge or perspective from this course. The biggest lesson taught is an understanding of how finance\/taxation\/military might led to the rise of the West, but in a fairly basic capacity.",
    "I would say it's a survey course on western military history that focuses a great deal on American military power of the last 150 years, utilizing experts both on campus and in the nearby community to tell a convincing narrative of military might and multilateral relations. With a different professor than Professor Kennedy, I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would absolutely take this class. It fills a much needed subject of history that no other history classes at Yale fill. I am glad I had the opportunity to take this class.",
    "This was an excellent course that taught me a lot. The workload was very manageable and the instruction superb. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone wanting to enrich their Yale experience.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a fellow student, especially someone in one of the ROTC programs. Even though I myself am not in ROTC, I could see the value of the class for them. It was clearly aimed toward teaching future military leaders. But even for non-ROTC people, I would recommend the class because I learned so much. However, I would warn them about its difficulty.",
    "Loved this class. Take it.",
    "This is probably the best class I've taken at Yale. It is a rare gem of a class that is a) easy, b) educational, and c) enjoyable at the same time.Put it this way: I would procrastinate on work for other classes by doing the readings for Military History, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how much fun they were.Each lecture is basically Paul Kennedy, the biggest BAMF of all time, the guy who literally wrote the book on the topic, being a boss. While occasionally he'd ramble on about random pictures that he put in his slides, it was always interesting. Furthermore, this guy is really dedicated to teaching and really wants to pass on his knowledge. Case in point: One day, he hobbled into the hall and said \"Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to apologise for not being clean-shaven; I just checked myself out of the hospital to the very disapproving looks of my nurses. There's a car waiting to take me back there after class. Pip pip, let's begin shall we!\" (creative license taken).Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this class for future students, especially if they have any interest in the topic or if you need a fun fifth class",
    "I would definitely recommend History 221 01 to my fellow students. I found this class extremely interesting and informative. The knowledge gained in this course does not only benefit people with military aspirations, but also people who plan on doing anything in the realm of politics, public service or even want to become better citizens by improving their ability to make informed decisions on their votes. This course will allow students to see military actions or inactions and their consequences on a much broader scale."
