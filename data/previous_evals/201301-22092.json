    "Recommend with some restriction.",
    "I took Intro Micro (ECON 115) in the lecture format and fell asleep during every single class. ECON 111 definitely forces you to be awake and pay attention to the material, so take this format if you prefer a more personalized setting. Some of the material from the Psets is covered in class, but for the most part you're forced to play around with the formulas or look to the Internet for additional information. The midterm is basically an extended problem set + concepts. The Final (at least this year) was not cumulative. Finally, Prof. Simons makes herself very available, for example, by holding her office hours in Bass Cafe as opposed to the Econ department on Hillhouse. In summary, an entertaining class with interesting material that is challenging but straightforward.",
    "You will learn a lot more than you will in the lecture course, plus you cover the financial system, which is really interesting. It's worth taking it over the lecture even if it's a little harder. Six problem sets (which take about 2 hrs each), a midterm, and final (both of which were reasonable). If you take the class, definitely take it with Katerina Simons...I have heard very bad things about Alonso. Katerina worked for the Fed, so she definitely knows what she's talking about. She's also super helpful when it comes to answering questions on problem sets at office hours, and she's super entertaining. Overall, great course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn a lot, will have average work throughout the semester, and will have to work hard for midterm and final.",
    "It's a basic econ course--a necessary evil for many majors. More conceptual than micro, but not much more fun. Take it if necessary, but otherwise you're better off using credits on something else. This doesn't reflect badly on Prof. Simons, just the inherently dry material.",
    "This class is definitely more engaging and interesting than the lecture, but I'm not sure the tradeoff is worth it.The lecture is much easier and for that reason, part of me regrets not taking it.However, having taken the lecture last semester for micro, I do think that I actually learned some macro this semester.",
    "Econ 111 Seminar is good. Simons is a good teacher -- generally clear, responds well to questions. Curve can be tricky, though.",
    "Econ 111 is generally a good intro econ course, and anyone vaguely interested in economics should take it. The workload is generally light, and I definitely recommend reading the textbook as the course progresses. Prof. Simons is a good teacher though her lectures can sometimes be hard to follow\/organize in your notes (again, reading the textbook will help remedy this). The grading is a bit arbitrary, and usually the questions are looking for a very specific answer, which can be frustrating. Overall it's a pretty easy, and oversimplified, economics course",
    "Definitely take this course with Professor Simons if you can. The curve is not nearly as hard as everyone makes it out to be, and there is not that much more work than the lecture. Even if you are not majoring in economics, everyone should have a basic understanding of macroeconomics, and taking the seminar is by far the more effective way of gaining that grounding in econ.",
    "Solid course. Well taught, fair exams, not too much work. The P-Sets are challenging, but not impossible, and don't take much time. You learn a lot. I'd recommend it!",
    "I think it is a more challenging and self-selecting course than Econ 116 (the macro lecture). Students in Econ 111 are more focused on economics, so the curve is a lot less forgiving. I'd definitely recommend it if you want a more comprehensive and deeper introduction to macro. My friend who took Econ 116 this semester learned the same material, but did not go as in-depth as we did (IS-LM and AS-AD models especially).",
    "I definitely would. It is an important introduction to macroeconomics an it is also so interesting that, as in my case, it might inspire to take further economics courses.",
    "I do not regret having taken this Econ seminair instead of the lecture. I think I learned more in 111 and am better prepared for future econ classes. Having said that, choosing the seminair over the lecture means subjecting yourself to a way harsher curve. This is a small seminair so the curve may not work in your favor.",
    "Yes, but I would recommend taking the lecture over this class. For Intro Macro, there really is not any advantage to being in the seminar. Prof. Simons basically taught the class like a lecture in that there was very little interaction between students or between her and the students. Occasionally, we would stop to discuss certain topics or have \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuzz groups\u00e2\u0080\u009d where we solve problems in small groups, but overall it felt very similar to a lecture, with the disadvantage of not being able to skip class when you need to. That being said, I enjoyed the class and Prof. Simons is a very nice professor. The curve is much more difficult in the seminar, so you are forced to spend more time studying if you want to get a good grade.",
    "Solid intro to macroeconomics. Not too painful, and Professor Simons knows her stuff.",
    "This is a rewarding class. Knowledge of macroeconomics is extremely useful and you will definitely learn well with Professor Simons. The class also covers particularly fascinating material on finance and banking. Do not miss this opportunity!",
    "Take it with Simons; she knows her stuff and does a great job with the course. Go to every class, take notes, and pay attention; it will be so worth it at the end of the semester"
