    "Ceramic analysis is a subject that I had not been exposed to during my undergraduate career when I focused on geological and geographical applications in archaeology. For my thesis this year, I was thrown into the field of ceramics with very little prior knowledge. This class helped give me a sturdy foundation on which to build my thesis and the techniques and information that I learned in this class will carry over into my research on a regular basis."
