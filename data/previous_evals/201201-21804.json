    "PHIL 430 is more scientific and psychological than any other Philosophy class I have ever taken, although it is well worth the scientific content for which I was not so much prepared. It opened up a different perspective on how to think about philosophy in applied and quantifiable ways.",
    "If you can get in, take it. This is a very new and exciting branch of psychology, with big promises for questions in cog sci at large. In short, you study folk intuitions about the mind in a very personal setting. Prof. Knobe is an extremely wise teacher, carefully guiding the conversation. Other than being awesome, he is also the friendliest person you will ever meet, so you will feel comfortable approaching him.",
    "Maybe. The class is certainly interesting, but seminars are at their best, I find, when progress is made from the beginning of the semester to the end. This seminar felt like spinning in circles around a topic. While fun, I did not emerge from the other end feeling like I'd gotten anywhere.",
    "You don't necessarily have to be interested in mind perception to enjoy this class, but you definitely have to like brainstorming ways to empirically test philosophical concepts, because that is what the majority of the classes entail. That said, if you do like that kind of discussion, you can't go wrong with Professor Knobe--he's incredibly supportive and made classes a lot of fun. There's also a great amount of freedom on the final project.",
    "TAKE THIS IF YOU CAN GET IN. Tiny workload, fascinating subject, and Knobe is the bomb diggity. It was really fun."
