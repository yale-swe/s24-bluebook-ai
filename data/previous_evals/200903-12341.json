    "If you've any interest in using a social-theoretical approach to investigate the interplay between language, political forms, and social imaginaries (especially if you have a side interest in South Asian studies or feminism), then this is absolutely a class you should take. Just make sure that you're able to make the commitment to actually do all the reading every week and write the weekly 750-1000 word essays. (If you're an undergraduate, this is the only written work you'll have to do all semester.)",
