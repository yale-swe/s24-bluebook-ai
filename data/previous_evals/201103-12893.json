   "comments": [
    "Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Take it if you can't find a better easy science. It's ok; you learn a little bit and it'snot too painfully difficult. Really not great though.",
    "I would recommend this class with the one warning that it is in no way what it seems like it would be like based on its title \"An Issues Approach to Biology.\" The lectures are more focused on real science and not focused on \"issues.\"",
    "Take it. Best way to get your Sc Credit.",
    "exams graded arbitrarily - needed specific keywords which became a bit frustrating; TA sections very different - some had a lot of work, others just read the assigned materials and had normal discussions",
    "Find your science requirement elsewhere. Will the homework is minimal, the tests are crazy and hard to predict.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT. PEOPLE WHO TAKE IT ARE LYING WHEN THEY SAY IT'S GOOD. IT'S MISERABLE. ALSO. THE CURVE IS A LIE. THE HISTOGRAMS ARE FAKED!!",
    "This is a good class for non-science majors.",
    "Take it if you want an easy science credit. Kind of interesting, but confusing to jump between 3 different professors. It would also have been more interesting if the teachers actually emphasized the issues approach more in class, instead of leaving that to section.",
    "Good class for a Sc credit but don't expect it to be an easy A. Sometimes exam questions are not as straightforward as you might expect them to be. A lot of memorization before each of the three midterms but not having a cumulative final exam is great!",
    "Good class for a student interested in a science class but not necessarily interested in a science major. Not too difficult, the amount of work is pretty low, and professors are pretty good.",
    "With the exception of professor Wells, the other two lecturers presented a lot of superfluous information in a dry manner. The grading was arbitrary and didn't test our knowledge of the material so much as how precise our answers were compared to what the TFs expected (which was very difficult considering how general the questions were). I expected this to be a veryeasy gut class but (depending on the curve) it wasn't as easy as I expected - you still have to study and memorize a lot of information. The material was not that interesting and it's a lot of biology - only \"issues\" part occurs during sections where you have discussions that don't come up in the tests or the lectures.",
    "Not as good as I thought. I advertises itself as an \"issues\" class but all the tests are pretty much strictly technical and scientific. Wells is definitely the best too, hands down.",
    "This is a pretty good science credit.It is fairly interesting and has lots of small pieces of work so that you have many chances to engage with the material more or less productively than you did the last time.The unit on radiation is dull and section is somewhat useless.",
    "Good enough and a Sc credit. I actually was interested in the first 2 units and thrown by how boring the 3rd was...basically we discussed systems and farming. Yes, what a \"system\" is in general. But the exams weren't that bad though they were graded harshly and theres a 5 page final paper that's easy. Section is incredibly useless but that's expected.",
    "Issues Approach to Bio is a well-rounded course because it allows students to learn about different yet interconnected topics that are all relevant to today's most current issues. I would recommend this class because it is interesting to read articles about what you are learning about in class as it applies to the real world.",
    "Unless you really need a science credit, I would not take it. This is my first science class as I am NOT a bio major, and I struggled with the concepts in this class. The class goes into some unnecessary nitty gritty details, and it's difficult to prepare for each test, because you never know what to expect coming from three different professors.",
    "It's an OK science credit for nonscience majors.",
    "You can find more interesting classes to take. The material is not hard, but it is not hard for anyone. To get a great grade you will still have to put a good amount of time.I took History of Life for my other SC credit and really loved it. I still think about stuff I learned in that class. That is not the same case here.",
    "I would recommend it for non science majors needing a science credit.",
    "An Issues Approach to Biology is a mediocre and inconsistent course. While David Wells is generally quite interesting and clear, the examination for Bill Summers' portion of the course was perhaps the least straightforward test I've ever taken, and Timothy Nelson seemed to show a clear disdain for the lack of scientific knowledge that the students in this class (specifically for non-science majors) had. The sections are an utter waste of time\u0096the majority of the people in the class have no comments about any scientific issue other than \"let's fund more government research.\" While some of the topics covered were very interesting (again, mostly in David Wells' segment about neurological disorders) this class is not worth your time. Read a few articles in major newspapers and magazines and you'll have the \"issues\" covered without the ambiguity and mindless memorization of seemingly random facts.",
    "No, I wouldn't. If you really want to learn something take another class.",
    "Getsreally boring as you go. Study hard for the exams, they're no joke. If you can find a more interesting science course, take it instead. Pick a good section with a section leader who'll know your name and lead discussions because that's 20% of your grade.<---really important. you don't have time for annoying, mean section people and tf's who'll tolerate them.",
    "If you need a science credit take it. However its not a gut, mainly because the tests are really random and broad and the TAS grade absurdly hardly. So if you can find another science class that isn't too complicated take it. This class tests the science, not the issues.",
    "An Issues Approach to Biology is basically a survey course of three different subject-areas that relate to Biology.I would recommend it as an interesting course for a science credit, but be careful on the exams because they could be tricky.",
    "A fine course for non-science majors, but frustratingly dull at times. The modules seem like a good idea, but constantly switching professors prevent you from getting used to the class or understanding how to study for tests. Expect lecture to focus just on the hard science, while section is ostensibly designed to focus on the issues behind it - even if what you really need is a clarification of what happened in lecture. I would not reccommend this class to another student.",
    "If you need a Sc credit and you are vaguely interested in Bio, take it! Do be careful though, the curve is harder than most people expect.",
    "Take it if you want an easy science.Not too hard, not too boring.",
    "great",
    "I would summarize it as a class that goes over three random biology topics. They may be superficially related to biology, but some of the material gone over in lecture would be hard to find in a biology textbook. The section on radiation, for instance, was pretty focused and was in none of the recommended course textbooks.I may or may not recommend the class to another student. I've never taken another science credit, so I don't know if all of them are this hard. But this was definitely a hard class with hard tests.",
    "Take a different course if you need a science credit.",
    "Relatively easy course, but pretty interesting too.",
    "It's a science credit",
    "NO!",
    "No. Take another science class. This should not even be considered a biology class. There isnt much work, but the only good section is the first third of the class (the only time we talked about biology). If you want to sit and listen to the second and third professors speak about radiation and plants for 3 months, then by all means, this is the class for you.",
    "This class was fine, a good science credit for students with little to no background in science. The work load was reasonable and fairly interesting, although the tests did require a lot of studying. Sections were miserable, the TAs either didn't care at all or were brutal. It was also impossible to know how i was doing in the class, since the test scores didn't translate to grades and we didn't know anything about what the curve would look like. But, in the end, this is probably the least scientific science class at Yale, so definitely take it if you need a manageable science credit.",
    "If you have any kind of science background from high school it will probably drive you crazy! It is a good way of getting your science credit, but keep in mind that it is not as easy as people say it is. The exams were more difficult than you would expect (usually about 10 essay\/short answer questions). There are probably more interesting ways to get your science credit.",
    "Take it if you could put in a little extra time for a science credit!",
    "Yes but only for needing a science credit that is relatively easy and interesting.",
    "Overall a good class if you need a Sc credit. Three different professors and three totally different topics - don't take this if you want a sense of continuity at all. The tests were very fair and I learned way more than I expected to about each topic. Section was a waste of time, but the paper and tests were all fair and I learned a lot by studying\/writing them.",
    "Technically class for a non-science major but be ready to study REALLY hard to do well on the tests.",
    "Lecture class that can be boring at times. A large amount of material is on each of the three tests. I would recommend this only if you need a science credit, and are willing to put in a bit of work each week, and a good amount of work for the tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to other students. Do not expect it to be an absolute joke. I went to pretty much every lecture and could have paid better attention but studied multiple hours for the mid-terms. The material was pretty interesting even if you are not into science and I had a lot of fun during section actually. The professors and TAs know that you are not science majors and do not treat you like you are. I have not taken any other science credits but from what I heard this one is a very good choice.",
    "This class is boring. It is difficult to pay attention. The tests are hard, even if you study a lot. I have not heard good things about many science credits, so I guess this isn't a terrible option as there are no readings or problem sets.",
    "Take this as an easy and interesting science class. I'm glad I took it although I didn't necessarily enjoy it at the time.",
    "I would recommend it only if you need a science credit. If you take it, shop TAs because some sections make you write 2-3 pages a week on the readings while others give you one brief creative writing assignment the entire semester."
