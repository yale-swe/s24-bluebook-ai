    "This course teaches you about several different mathematical structures and how to apply them to model linguistic structure\/phenomena. Prof Frank is a wonderful professor; he is very enthusiastic about the subject matter, which he explains in a very clear manner. He always leaves time for questions, and if someone does not understand a concept, he is happy to spend as much time as necessary clarifying it. I would recommend this class if you enjoy math\/logic puzzles. I would not recommend this class if you do not want to do weekly problem sets.",
    "I have very mixed feelings about this class. It was very hard for me. The lectures get very confusing very fast if you don't have a strong math background (I'm a Linguistics major and I took Calculus in high school... that did not help much at all). Even though Professor Frank is very nice and a good teacher, I couldn't pay attention for a whole lecture after the first two weeks. Still, I was able to complete (and occasionally enjoy) the problem sets, and I do think I have learned. There are easier QRs and there are MUCH better classes to take if you want to explore Linguistics. It is not a bad course at all, it's just not for everyone. Basically, take it if you want to learn specifically what this class teaches. Otherwise, it's probably not worth it.",
    "This is a great course for anyone who wants to see the quantitative and theoretical side to linguistics! It definitely helps if you have some background in math or proofs, but it's not necessary. Bob Frank is a great instructor who cares that you learn and enjoy the material. Assessments are challenging, but not impossible, and relevant to the material.",
    "So much fun. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's really interesting and challenging, but you learn so much. Even for non-majors, I would totally wholeheartedly recommend. Also, work with other people on the homework! It's much better that way.",
    "A MUST-TAKE CLASS. This is absolutely the best class I have ever taken. Professor Frank is such an amazing professor and anyone who doesn't take a class with him is seriously missing out. The class is a combination of math and linguistics. The linguistics applications come through on the problem sets; most of the class time is spent talking about the underlying mathematics that describes certain linguistic structures. REALLY interesting stuff - but you have to like math. The problem sets are hard but not at all impossible and the feeling of satisfaction you get when you finish them makes it totally worth it. The exams are also hard but are take-home, and you get to use your notes, so they're also definitely doable. At least shop this class - it's worth it.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! In my opinion, linguistics is at its best when it is most rigorous, so I enjoyed this class immensely because this class applies rigorous mathematical tools to linguistics. The course was fill of insightful proofs and startling revelations, and Bob (the professor) was so energetic and entertaining that the 75 minutes always flew by. If you enjoy both math and linguistics, you should definitely take this course; and even if you are not a huge fan of both those subjects I would still recommend it as practice in writing proofs and making convincing arguments.",
    "The class is definitely fascinating! Not sure how applicable the material is to anything but math and linguistics. But still interesting."
