   "comments": [
    "-Immersing myself in recent econ papers -Analyzing econometric techniques employed by those papers (diff in diff, monte carlo, etc.) -Identifying potential natural experiments -Working directly with experiment data to recreate results and achieve new ones",
    "I really gained the confidence to read papers like this with a critical eye. My knowledge of micro theory was slightly improved, and my ability to consider Identification problems and other econometrics topics has skyrocketed.",
    "I got a lot more comfortable using Stata and applying the metrics skills I had learned in 131 and 132. I also learned how economics papers are typically structured and how to read them with a critical eye. I think I am better at engaging with and interpreting data.",
    "Great class to review the basic ideas of econometrics and see them applied to the real world while reading famous papers",
    "It was a fabulous introduction to research in applied micro. The thing I learned most was how to think critically about research",
    "I learned a lot more about the applications of econometrics than I did the theory; that is, I learned a lot about the different techniques and strategies that economists use to identify causal effects and conduct econometric research. I also learned a lot about varied topics relating to crime, gender, the environment, etc., so it's almost as if the class doubled as a poli sci \/ sociology class.",
    "A broader understanding of techniques and methodologies of empirical microeconomic research and themes in the field.",
    "This course definitely gave me much more confidence reading academic economics articles. Because we were forced to write short responses analyzing a problem in the academic papers we read, I learned to think critically about the methods used in the papers and to better understand their short-comings. I also was able to brush up on econometric strategies such as difference in differences and instrumental variables. We also covered really interesting papers in race, gender, and crime."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths -reading list -data assignments -in class discussions Weaknesses -time and length (one very long class on friday) -no assignment where we had to acquire data on our own",
    "Class was often dominated by 2-3 key players, who are all obviously very smart, but didn't necessarily facilitate discussion, as a seminar is supposed to do theoretically. That being said, I thought most of those conversations were helpful just to listen to, and professor Reyes is great with the topics she selects and her engagement with the papersand in creating opportunities for us to engage with them as well.",
    "I really liked this course. Sometimes we didn't have enough time to get to all the papers we had to read. I also didn't like the Mastering Metrics book, but overall I really enjoyed all of the papers and class discussions.",
    "There could have been better guidance on the assignments. I had no idea how to do well on them.",
    "Amazing professor, really interesting papers, engaged students!",
    "I thought it was a very good class in terms of its structure. I liked the balance between reading, empirical assignments, and response papers, and most of the readings were carefully chosen.",
    "Fantastic course. Not much can be improved. The real strength was the focus on the papers. They were chosen carefully, for very specific reasons. They laid a solid foundation for a fruitful discussion in the classroom. The final paper was also designed in a way that the process was really rewarding.",
    "The biggest strength of the course was the discussion style that Professor Reyes set up and the ways in which assignments were broken up into piece meal sections. Discussions were almost always the right balance of well-guided with insights from Professor Reyes and flexible with open discussion between classmates. The final paper was really nicely split up into sections that made it much easier to take on. The syllabus also included some very interesting papers, paired with helpful readings on econometric strategies and methodology. But, at the beginning of the semester, the syllabus was very methodology heavy, making the discussions less interactive and interesting. It might be helpful to try and spread out the methodological sections more in order to avoid having so much metrics reading in the beginning of the class and so little at the end."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this course. Classes like these are why I majored in econ. Applied micro is where it's at and I'm already finding this class useful in my other courses and future direction. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
    "Would highly recommend if pursuing econometric research or if have serious interest in microecon. Papers are interesting, if not controversial, which makes them interesting, and the professor guides class through discussions, traditional seminar-style.",
    "It was probably a little over my head, but I learned a lot and she was very encouraging and supportive. Highly recommend.",
    "I loved this course. It is a good way to apply what you know about economics and econometrics in interesting ways. You get experience reading, critiquing, and doing your own analysis and Professor Reyes is the best econ professor I have had here.",
    "Yes. The instructor is great, and it is a great way to learn about research that has already been done using empirical micro.",
    "Yes! It was amazing. I would recommend it to any student genuinely interested in economics as a framework to answer questions",
    "A great class that gives attention to applications of empirical micro to a variety of topics (gender, crime, environment, etc). Having learned many of the techniques in 131\/132, I was happy to have a class that taught me how to actually apply those techniques, and to think and critique papers in a thoughtful way. Definitely recommend.",
    "This class didn't assign an overly burdensome amount of work, and it taught great microecon skills. Very happy to have taken it.",
    "Definitely. Probably the best Econ course I've taken at Yale. Easily the best Econ seminar in the Bluebook. Prof. Reyes is diligent, sincere and extremely sensitive to her own subject but also the larger issues surrounding the themes that we address in this class. You will walk away having gained a strong conceptual base in econometric techniques and a very deep rooted understanding of microeconomic themes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any students interested in better understanding econometric methods and gaining more familiarity with economics literature. I am much more confident reading academic papers in economics and have a better understanding of the process involved in cleaning data and writing it up (as a result of the final paper)!"
