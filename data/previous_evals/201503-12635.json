   "comments": [
    "It depends on what you want to get out of this class. I am a STEM major who was looking to learn a little more about what was going on in the world around me. I think it worked well in that capacity. The work load was pretty light, just 5 little essays, a midterm and a final. I really didn't mind the 5 short essays because each one was written in the context of something actually happening in the world in recent years. The quick research for those helped me get a better understanding of current and recent events. Overall, I'd say it wasn't anything mind blowingly amazing, but a good intro class that could be a nice 5th credit.",
    "Basic intro class. Don't need to go to class. Kinda boring, don't take it unless you're looking for and easy 5th.",
    "I recommend this course for someone looking for an introduction to international relations.",
    "Great overview of international relations. I would definitely recommend the course. I feel like I learned a lot and became a better world citizen.",
    "PLSC 111 01 is an introductory course looking at the big picture of international relations. I would probably not recommend this class to another student, a lot of the topics seemed like pretty common knowledge.",
    "It is a solid introduction to International Relations, and if you are interested in Political Science or International Relations I would definitely recommend this course. The content is also very relevant to real-life incidents, so even if you are not necessarily into Political Science it would still be a good choice. The course provides a good balance of textbook content and actual scholarly articles which helps get a more comprehensive understanding about the concepts that come up in class. Readings were interesting, and Professor Trager is a nice lecturer too. Also, if you do take it, I would absolutely recommend that you choose Chris's sections. He really tries his best to help you, either through frequent office hours, review sessions before exams, or even just through email, and he made my experience with this course so much better.",
    "A relatively easy intro course to IR. Mentions war, economics, terrorism etc",
    "I would recommend PLSC 111 01 to another student looking for a solid Intro course in political science. This course covers a lot of history and is a good building block for the next level courses.",
    "Intro to International Relations is a good course for any student who wants a broad understanding of global interaction from 1648 onward. It is not too much work, but you do learn plenty of material. There is also a lot of writing, which helped me engage with the material.",
    "The class is a very complete and good overview of the theory of international relations. As the class is titled, it is an introduction to international relations. If a student is looking for a formalized class on international relations theory, this is a good class. The class isn't incredibly rigorous, in fact, the workload is probably less than most classes.",
    "A very detailed, basic understanding of international relations and political science as a whole.",
    "Very good intro class. The content is great, but you could gather pretty much the same information from simply reading the book. Considering there is no writing credit, it is quite writing heavy (5 briefs). Good experience overall.",
    "Good course with the right professor. Would recommend if different professor was giving the lecture.",
    "Good class. Not terribly hard, interesting, and useful. Would recommend.",
    "This course was a great introduction to political science. The material was very interesting, and the textbook and supplemental readings were all enjoyable to read. If you think you might be interested in political science or would like to explore the field, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "It is a good intro poly sci class with a few 2 page papers and a mid term and a final. Not a lot of work but a ton of information on the tests so you have to prepare very well.",
    "The material was interesting but the class in general was not great",
    "This course is a good chunk of challenging reading and thinking. You will learn a lot if you put the time into to learn and ask appropriate questions.",
    "Intermediate in difficulty, very theory intensive.",
    "I would recommend this class for Political Science majors, since it serves as a great introductory course.",
    "PLSC 111 was a good was to get an introduction to political science at Yale. It was not an amazing class, but if you're interested, it can be fun. Most people do not show up, which can make lectures seem optional. If you do the readings and the work, it is not hard to do well in this course.",
    "PLSC 111 was a great introduction into Political Science, and I've found the knowledge I gained really helpful in just daily understand of world events and discussions with peers as well as hopefully for future political science classes. I would definitely recommend it for people who are or aren't pursuing a poli sci major.",
    "Broad treatment of international relations, with focus on World War I, World War II, and the Cold War as case studies of war as bargaining failure, international political economy, nuclear diplomacy, international negotiations, and other global political phenomena. Very, very broad at times, and it may be more useful to take a class like International Security or Intro to Human Rights if you want to get into more specifics about IR. Only take if you want broad foundation.",
    "The class has very interesting ideas taught, but may not be the most interesting to sit through.",
    "This is a pretty good Intro political science class. Midterm is easy, final was moderately difficult and specific. The 5 short reading responses we had to do were graded very generously. Overall, fairly interesting class and with a light workload. Would take again",
    "I would recommend PLSC 111 to another student if they were sure that they were interested in the content. Doing the reading is necessary."
