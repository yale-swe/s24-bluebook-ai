   "comments": [
    "This course generally helped me to think more critically about epistemology and methodology. I learned about research methods I hadn't really considered using in my work, as well as gained more knowledge about research methods I was already interested in. In particular, the final project was very useful in spurring me to think more critically about the research method I hope to specialize in.",
    "I feel far more comfortable in developing research questions and projects now than before taking this course.",
    "- Excellent overview of major issues in research design. Good practice in writing a proposal."
