   "comments": [
    "I would recommend 100%. It won't be the most challenging course you take, but it will absolutely make you a better writer and reader.",
    "It's a really fun class because Michael is so much fun, but unless he adds a lot more structure, it's not that helpful to your writing. You workshop two pieces each a semester, and his comments are amazingly helpful, but I think most of us could have benefitted from more structure.",
    "Absolutely, if you're interested in the craft of fiction.",
    "Absolutely. Cunningham runs a great, constructive workshop, and I have made tangible improvements in my writing--not something that happens in every workshop. Not only can the guy write, but he can teach, too. This is why you come to Yale.",
    "If Michael Cunningham is teaching, then expect to write and workshop two stories over the semester, and to read other students' writing. There is really nothing else to the class: no thematic discussions as many other English department writing seminars have, though Michael does dispense insightful nuggets of wisdom. Low-stress class, where you get exactly as much out of it as you put into it. Meet with Michael individually and revise your stories for him--he is always willing to read whatever you provide.",
    "Professor Cunningham is a great workshop leader with a unique style. He tells you exactly what he thinks of your story, where it might be able to grow, and will help you get it there without tiptoeing around whatever he thinks is the main point of your work. The class is a great opportunity to work with someone with a lot of experience, a great sense of humor, and to get to know a group of people who are passionate about writing in their respective styles and subject matters as well.",
    "Broad introduction to writing short stories. You submit stories for extensive critique two times during the semester. You choose what you write and how long it is. You comment on other people's stories each week. Guidelines are rather vague and best for students with a strong background in creative writing and interested in using their own initiative to guide their work. The course lacks very little structure, so don't expect to learn specific \"tools\" of fiction writing per se. The feedback from Cunningham is thorough and helpful, and class discussions were generally good.",
    "It's a workshop, so if you enjoy reading creative writing and writing, TAKE IT."
