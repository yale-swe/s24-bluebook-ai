    "HSAR714 is a global survey of craft revivalist\/idealist movements around the world. It seeks specifically to trace the flow of ideas in addition to the flow of material goods and aesthetic influences. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in thinking about craft and material culture.",
    "Given its global approach, this course would interest most students--I would definitely recommend it be offered again!"

   "comments": [
    "This course encouraged me to rethink some of the assumption I had previously made about craft movements. As such, taking the course contributed quite a bit to my larger research project. I used the final paper as an opportunity to explore literature outside of my comfort zone, and to flesh out a some gaps in my previous research.",
    "This course really helped me to make connections between what was going on between painting and craft during the last quarter of the 19th century. It really broadened my horizons and I hope to incorporate much of what I learned into my own research."
