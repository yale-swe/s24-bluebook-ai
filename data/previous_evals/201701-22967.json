    "I learned a lot about the current state of the science of science communication literature!",
    "I learned about different theories of science communication, particularly why science communication breaks down and why issues become polarized. I learned the relative merits of these approaches. Additionally, and more than most classes, I developed skills in critically comparing competing hypotheses and whether the methods of studies support the inferences being drawn. Also learned a lot of interesting information about real world issues like the controversies surrounding HPV, global warming, and evolution.",

    "I thought the day that the producers came to visit was super cool, but I think perhaps it could've been organized a bit differently? It felt a bit unstructured, and I think many people didn't get to talk to them much. Like if you could gather people's questions for them beforehand or something, that might increase engagement with them!",
    "I enjoyed the professor's lecturing style. I found class discussion to be weak though, I'd have preferred just to listen to professor speak honestly",

    "yes!",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in science communication, but beware that it is a law school seminar. If, like me, you get frustrated when people talk over each other and you aren't very assertive in seminars, you may have a difficult time in this class. Otherwise, it's an interesting introduction to the identity protective cognition thesis and Kahan's other work.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in understanding how science communication works in different setting and with different people."
