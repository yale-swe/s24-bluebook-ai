    "I learnt to appreciate many of the nuances of Chinese culture and how they contributed to the development of the Chinese language. I learnt a significant amount of vocabulary, and how to differentiate between different synonyms and grammatical structures. Also learnt how to express myself in formal Chinese with a lot more confidence.",
    "A complex vocabulary, partnered with a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and ideology. Learned how ancient thoughts and beliefs have impacted China to the current day, as well as the current problems China faces. How to write essays in Chinese (and really any other language) by learning what really makes a good essay",
    "",
    "Su Wei is so wise and kind. You will learn a lot personally through his stories! Your Chinese will also naturally improve through classwork.",
    "My Chinese obtained much higher proficiency after taking 162, especially in terms of writing skill.",
    "The range of my Chinese vocabulary improved. Through Su Laoshi's stories, learned a bit about the nuances of Chinese culture.",
    "My mastery over Chinese reading and writing vastly improved over the course. Yet the most important insight development I treasured was the deeper understanding of Chinese culture through the stories that Mr. Su would tell in class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Really entertaining and encouraging support. However, not enough opportunities to speak and practise our Chinese in class. Despite Su Lao Shi's great stories, the volume that he spoke compared to us was skewed. Perhaps this is best solved by employing more TAs and making them more available to us. Would also be helpful to have more detailed feedback on essays on an individual basis, and also to receive our grades back for presentations.",
    "One of the greatest strengths is the professor. Su Wei's experience is second to none, and the topics he talks about in class get you thinking. The textbook and course material also do a good job of exposing you to a wide range of high level vocabulary. However, I wish there was more conversational practice, and slightly more emphasis on grammar.",
    "",
    "The class only meets three times a week so you can't sort of lose track of things and you won't have as much time to improve oral capabilities. However, the actual textbook is pretty interesting and the essays are a good challenge so writing will improve.",
    "The course is quite enjoyable - Su Laoshi makes the class environment relaxed, and the material covered is interesting. However, the worst feature of the course is the pretty big differences in skill levels between those coming into the course, some who have taken many semesters of Chinese or have returned from the Light fellowship, and some who are taking Chinese for the first time. Su Laoshi makes little effort to account for these differences, often putting words that are not in the wordset he tells people to study on dictations and tests. This aspect of the course can be bothersome.",
    "The strength is Mr. Su's charming personality and stories which put the language into a tangible world sense and within Chinese culture. Weakness is the relative lack of the speaking and conversational practice."

   "comments": [
    "Great relatively stress-free way to maintain or increase your Chinese fluency. Coming back from heritage level HBA, this was pretty straight-forward, requiring only a few hours of study a week.",
    "Definitely recommend just to have the opportunity to know Su Wei and hear many of his life stories. Your Chinese will also improve, especially writing because he challenges the class to write really good and meaningful stuff (since he himself is a writer). Workload also isn't too bad and he is very lax about deadlines.",
    "Yes! Very fun course\/you'll learn a lot\/Su laoshi is a very fun teacher to have :)",
    "go for it! Su wei is a very cool man and he wants to help you learn about Chinese culture and language",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to students who are looking to take their Chinese writing skill to a new level.",
    "I would recommend the course, with certain considerations. The course is quite enjoyable - Su Laoshi makes the class environment relaxed, and the material covered is interesting. However, the worst feature of the course is the pretty big differences in skill levels between those coming into the course, some who have taken many semesters of Chinese or have returned from the Light fellowship, and some who are taking Chinese for the first time. Su Laoshi makes little effort to account for these differences, often putting words that are not in the wordset he tells people to study on dictations and tests. This aspect of the course can be bothersome.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I felt like I not only learned about the Chinese language but was able to better connect with my roots and my cultural identity.",
    "Yes as it really did help me train a stronger understanding of Chinese, both the language and culture."
