    "It is about databases.",
    "pretty easy class; make sure you go to class and study the slides. book not needed, but be vigilant! A few assignments here and there that'll make you realize, \"Oh shit, I need to learn this stuff.\"",
    "This is a very good course in introducing the idea of databases. It requires almost no prior CS knowledge and if you are interested in databases could easily be taken by a non-CS major interested in the topic. For CS-Majors, it's one of the easier classes, but nevertheless very interesting and informative. You will enjoy taking this class, it's a fantastic 5th credit to be taken alongside harder classes. Go to the lectures, do the (few) homework assignments and you'll be fine!",
    "Pretty good computer science elective. Not necessarily conceptually easy but very little work. Class was very well prepared. All lectures available on powerpoint. Lectures could be dry but overall reasonably interesting and useful."
