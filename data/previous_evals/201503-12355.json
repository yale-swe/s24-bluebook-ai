    "I'd probably tell them to take Stats, only because it is more intuitive to me, but Calc wasn't a bad course if you like Calc.",
    "if you need a credit",
    "It was a well-rounded calculus course that traveled at a good pace.",
    "I would summarize Math 112 03 as an introductory calculus course. We start with derivatives and its definition, then applying the derivatives to situations and practical uses and lastly we end with and introduction to Riemann Sums and the definition of the integral. I would certainly recommend Math 112 03 to another student, especially if they do not have a strong calculus background because the design of the course truly allows you to get a solid grasp of the concepts taught.",
    "Just first semester Calculus",
    "Basically covers differential single variable calculus and introduces integral calculus.",
    "Math 112 is a course that focuses intensely on attempting to make its students better at graphical reasoning, with a focus on the nitty gritty tools of calculus second. You will be surprised if you take this course coming out of your high school calculus curriculum. While the PSETS are many (31 PSETS due before the end of the semester), they are easy and come out of the book. The tests, on the other hand, are ridiculously challenging, and are not always the best reflection of what the Math 112's students have learned, but rather are a reflection of how well its students live up to the courses jaded goal of having its students be naturally better at something than they actually are. Take this course with John Hall above anything; this professor is the head of the course."
