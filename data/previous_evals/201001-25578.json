   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend taking French 140 06. It was a great course!",
    "This is a great class as a continuation of 130. There is a good balance between the focus on reading, writing, and speaking. The books are interesting, and there are a handful of films as well. There is also an oral presentation at the end of the semester. Mme Duval is a terrific teacher: she is kind, helpful, and caring. She is more than willing to provide extra help to students outside of class, and she went out of her way to make sure that we were prepared. I enjoyed this class a lot, and my french definitely improved.",
    "French 140 is an indepth look at grammatical concepts that have most likely already been studied, using written stories to provide information about the French speaking world and to practice various grammatical concepts. I would definitely recommend it. I know that my French has improved, and I think I've learned some valuable and interesting information through our study of various texts.",
    "I would recommend it. I feel as though I have definitely improved my French skills a considerable amount over the past two semesters of French 130 and 140.",
    "Not really? Lots of grammar and everything you read is SO DEPRESSING. I think that should be changed, since it's a language class not a literature class and there's nothing wrong with talking about happy things in French. Probably more practically relevant than Nazis, too.",
    "It's a fun class. You read a bunch of interesting books, watch films and do quite a a bit of homework but it is totally worth it.",
    "French 140 is an excellent continuation of French 130. Be prepared for nightly reading and a weekly writing assignment that becomes progressively longer throughout the semester. French 130 was generally focused on grammar; I found French 140 to be more focused on reading comprehension and writing. I would strongly recommend this class, I enjoyed it immensely.",
    "French 140 requires a lot of time and effort but you will see your French improve. The class involves grammar review, writing practice, an oral presentation, two novels, numerous short stories, and at least three films. It is very similar in structure to 130. The major new grammar concepts seem to be tout\/tous\/toute\/toutes, causative faire, conjunctions requiring the subjunctive, and indirect discourse. If you want to continue French, 140 is worthwhile class.",
    "I would recommend this course. It might seem tedious at times but you learn a lot at the end and the discussions during class about the various stories we read are engaging."
