   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. I think it's useful to have this kind of a survey to expose us to a lot of different techniques, which we can then explore in more depth if we need.",
    "I would highly recommend this class.",
    "This course is an excellent overview of practical techniques and concepts for biochemical and biophysical research.",
    "It's required for MB&B, so yes. Otherwise, very useful for anyone interested in spectroscopy or enzymology.",
    "I would recommend this class - good overview of several biophysical techniques and structural biology.",
    "The beginning of the course is geared towards phenomonology and aims to look at protein and nucleic acid dynamics and folding. The other part of the course is geared towards more practical applications of how to study these things.A significant portion of the course looks at spectroscopy and microscopy techniques and there are also practical approaches to binding and kinetics. There is also a section on Cryo-EM which was helpful, but a bit rushed and a small section focused on microtubule and actin dynamics and motor proteins.",
    "I would recommend it to any student that needed an introduction to biochemical and biophysical techniques.",
    "This class gives an overview on important biophysics techniques, including binding assays, enzyme kinetics, EM, fluorescence, microscopy along with some fundamental biological topics including protein-protein interactions, protein-RNA interactions, ribozymes, riboswitches, motor proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins.This class is really solid and will immensely help with one in understanding literature in biophysics. I will definitely recommend this class to another students.",
    "I will highly recommend this course to another student. This course provides fundamental knowledge about macromolecule dynamics and useful advanced methods. It is a good trainning for students who want to do research in this field.",
    "Macromolecular Dynamics is a technique based class. They teach different experimental techniques, the theory behind the technique and data interpretation.I would definitely recommend this class to another student."

   "comments": [
    "See above responses.",
    "Provided an excellent overview of conceptual approaches and practical techniques in the fields of biochemistry and biophysics.",
    "see Question 1. I'll be using a lot of the techniques described in lecture on a regular basis.",
    "Particularly Liz Rhoades' section was very helpful. It was extremely helpful to learn about commonly used (and even not so commonly used) fluorescence and spectroscopy techniques in great depth. I wish more of the course was geared towards applications and methodologies rather than phenomonology. Overall I found that section extremely helpful and made the course worthwhile. The other sections were useful, but not directly relevant to my future career or I had been taught previously in other classes (like Macro I). I also found the lectures by Anna Pyle about binding, folding, and kinetics and extremely useful and beneficial.",
    "This course exposed me to different methods I can apply in my future research.",
    "This course is very important in developing my understanding in some fundamental biophysics techniques, which will help me design experiments in biophysics and help me understand the literature covering biophysics topics.",
    "This is very helpful. Thanks for organizing this course."
