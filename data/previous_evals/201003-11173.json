    "Best course for learning about statistics and regressions for understanding social science research.",
    "I would recommend this class to all students in social sciences. As a matter of fact, I would recommend it to be compulsory at least for all MAIR students, as it introduces concepts that would facilitate considerably the understanding in other social sciences classes, ranging from economics to sociology or political science.",
    "IR771 is a great class for brushing up on your quantitative reasoning skill and acquiring a new skill (STATA). It's an excellent, manageable and most importantly enjoyable class that bridges the dry calculus with statistical applications. It's hard to make this kind of content enjoyable, but this class makes your re-introduction to the math in a doable yet comprehensive fashion.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend the class, especially if taught by Dr. Grieger. He allowed for ease in learning dense material and fast-paced course."

   "comments": [
    "I now know what regressions are and how to interpret them!",
    "This course really helped me brush up my quantitative skills and finally get a solid understanding of quantitative methods in social sciences.",
    "The STATA will be helpful for data analysis that most grad students will in theory do at some point. However. again, we didn't focus enough on STATA so in that sense the course was not as helpful as it could've been in deepening my skill set for IR field work. The last class when we analyzed IR academic papers was very interesting\/applicable; I would like to see a greater focus on IR applications in the future."
