    "Don't take it.",
    "Econ 116 is an important course, and I think it's great to have a basic understanding of the macroeconomy. However, in this course, you will do more learning studying with your fellow students than you will sitting in section or lecture. I would not necessarily recommend taking it for fun, but if you have to take it as part of a major requirement, definitely try to get involved in a study group with friends from the very beginning.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is good practical knowledge to have. The lectures were kind of vague but the sections were extremely helpful. The workload isn't too bad, just weekly problem sets similar to other classes.",
    "With Professor Shiller, you are getting a wealth of knowledge about the field of macroeconomics, especially behavioral macroeconomics. You need to know that Professor Shiller won't teach you everything in lecture, and you *must* read the textbook. It is a very interesting class if you like economics, and the TAs are great. Overall, I would still recommend the seminar over the lecture for macreconomics (reverse for microeconomics).",
    "The material is far more palatable than Intro Micro. However, though Shiller is no doubt intelligent and qualified, he is not a good lecturer. It is not worth going to class. Find the best TA and stick with them. The textbook is also quite good.",
    "recommend class but not with Shiller. He is perhaps too advanced, and not detailed enough for an intro class.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, because it is a good intro to macroeconomics, I would just hope they have a different professor who is somewhat interesting in class.",
    "take it if you need to, not the most interesting course at yale - but worth taking nonetheless",
    "Interesting stuff. Shiller didn't really teach anything related to macro though.",
    "While I did get an alright basis in understanding introductory economics concepts, I would recommend taking the smaller class version of intro macro if you can.",
    "What is the point",
    "Please don't take it with Shiller.",
    "Basic macro class ... better than micro at least",
    "Shiller is by far the worst professor I have ever had. Spare yourself the trouble and do not take this course if he is teaching it; wait until the following semester.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "It's a lot of work come midterm\/finals studying, but if you get through the first half without a problem, you'll be fine. Monotonous weekly problem sets, but it ensures you at least keep up with some of the material",
    "I think everyone should know the fundamentals of economics. However, maybe it's best to take the course when Shiller isn't teaching it.",
    "Normal intro lecture: more interesting and useful than Micro, though.",
    "You can take it with 4 other classes, shouldn't be too much of a problem. The concepts are not that difficult so just make sure you know them inside out for the exams (which have to be hard in order to get any kind of grade distribution spread) and spend time with the textbook.",
    "Biggest waste of time. The material is interesting but if Shiller is teaching you won't learn anything.",
    "One of the problems with introductory classes in general is that there is very little flexibility\/room for creativity with the syllabus. The material is mostly the same from year to year, and the teacher can choose to do one of two things with class time: to reiterate and elaborate on the readings or to provide applications of the readings. I think Professor Schiller this year had the right idea with filling the class with applications of the readings, but some lectures, I felt, were a little too tangental. Other lectures were very interesting though, especially towards the end of the semester, where there is a little more room for creativity.",
    ".Professor Shiller is a brilliant scholar, but he is not the best teacher for an intro econ course.",
    "Don't take this class!!!",
    "Economics 116 is a prerequisite for many social science majors, so it's almost unavoidable on the track to one of the above majors. Also, a large Economics class is an experience in itself, so it's worth taking.",
    "I would recommend ECON 116. Its a solid intro to macroeconomics.",
    "NO! If Shiller is teaching wait until next semester.",
    "Maybe. If you're ok with learning all the concepts for this class on your own but just want to hear a Nobel Prize winner speak twice a week, this class is for you.",
    "It was an introductory Marco course. I enjoyed it better than Micro. I feel like it has given me a better sense of how the world economy functions. If you are interested it would be worth taking.",
    "Intro course that teaches you a lot about macro, don't take it with shiller though",
    "This was a terrible course. The material is fascinating and the textbook is good, but do not expect to glean any information whatsoever from the professor, the TAs, or the problem sets. The tests are poorly designed and do not comprehensively or accurately reflect the material that's been \"taught\" in the course. The problem sets are tedious and provide little insight into the lesson plans. Overall, take the course only if you need it. If you're just interested in learning about econ, buy the book and teach yourself without the added pressure of grades.",
    "I took this class for three reasons. (1) I wanted to take a class with a Nobel laureate. (2) I wanted to be able to interest myself with newspaper articles on business and economy and actually understand them. (3) I had major requirements to fulfill. I think I got all three, so that's cool. I enjoyed the class. It's an intro class obviously, so there's lots of people and lots of material covered. But it's pretty doable. Psets didn't take too long and pointed out the core concepts of the week pretty well. Exams were a bit lengthy so it was tight on time, but it was pretty fair. In general, I enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot. Not bad for an intro econ class at Yale! (I've heard some horror stories about intro econ classes at Yale. This really wasn't bad at all in comparison. I generally hate economics but actually enjoyed going to these lectures.)",
    "ECON 116 is a useful class for all students. Take it unless you are 100% sure you want nothing to do with economics and understand how the economy works. Lecture is not very well thought though. Be prepared to learn on your own.",
    "Don't take this class if it is being taught by Shiller. Wait until another professor is teaching it some other semester. I can't really even comment about the subject matter pertaining to macroeconomics, because I was never taught it. If you do decide to take it, be prepared to learn from the textbook.",
    "Yes, under different circumstances, I would recommend this course.",
    "I recommend it. It's a mandatory class for some majors and really interesting",
    "Econ 116 is a great introduction to basic macroeconomic concepts. The problem sets are engaging and fair, the textbook is helpful and clear, and if you get a good section, some of the TA's are wonderful. Professor Shiller, however, although he's brilliant and kind, is not very good at explaining economic concepts. His lectures were often rambling, and interesting mainly for his many digressions. I would recommend the coursework but not the professor. This class is worth taking if you're going to pursue economics in the future and want a macroeconomic, in addition to a microeconomic, foundation. But if you're just looking to be exposed to econ for a general overview and introductory experience, I would take an intro micro class, which has much better professors.",
    "I wish I took this class earlier on in my time at Yale; it's a great introduction to important concepts underlying the dynamics of the global economy. Also, wasn't too bad being in the presence of a Nobel laureate.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to be an econ major because you have to take it.",
    "I didn't enjoy it too much because I do not really like economics and this was a major requirement for me; however, if you enjoy and like economics or need it for a requirement then yup take it !",
    "Good fundamentals-- find a good ta I can't say if I would recommend it because I don't know if Professor Shiller will be teaching it again which would change my specific recommendation. However, macro-economics made me realize that all econ is based off of opinion -- for example we are learning a totally different theory of how the economy works compared to students at UChicago -- which has made me realized I would probably not pursue economics as a major.",
    "Coming into the lecture, I had never taken a macro class before. Overall, it was a pretty good introduction to macroeconomics; Shiller's lectures weren't very helpful in terms of the midterm of the exam, but I kind of preferred it this way since he taught more about real-world application.",
    "ECON 116 is a pretty good course, but how much you get out of it is entirely dependent upon how much you put in. If you do not read the book, you will likely not get most of the Macroeconomics fundamental ideas. Professor Shiller's lectures are sometimes very interesting, and other times quite dull. I would recommend it to another student he\/she is interested in economics.",
    "Intro Macro is a course I would only recommend as a prerequisite for a major. Professor Shiller can be an entertaining lecturer when you aren't looking for him to teach information relevant for problem sets or exams.",
    "Standard intro course. Take it if you need to for your major, otherwise you could simply do a few hours reading online to learn everything you need.",
    "Every student should take this class in order to learn about the functioning's of a national economy, regardless of if they intend to be an Econ major.",
    "It's an intro macro class, not super exciting and shiller isn't a very charismatic professor,",
    "Not much to say about Intro Macro; I wish I could say something else but don't take it with Shiller.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, even if it has nothing to do with your major. Understanding the basics of macroeconomics is vital to knowing how our government policy, housing markets,and many other things work. As an Econ major, it was obviously a requirement, but it gave me a much greater appreciation of the subject.",
    "Don't take it because of shiller's brand name. Take it if you need it, and make sure you need it.",
    "This class is unique. Shiller is not going to go over the material you need to know for the final and that's just something you need to accept. Once you have, you can just appreciate his lectures for what they are- interesting musings from one of the most brilliant economists of the day. Shiller is a little ridiculous but you can get a lot out of this class if you stop focusing on whether he's teaching to the test and just pay attention to his observations about the world. It's a very cool opportunity to learn from him.(And you MUST teach yourself from the textbook\/ go to section so you don't fail the final.)",
    "If it was taught the way it was this year, I would not recommend it. Not a great introduction to the material.",
    "Econ 116 is a basic level introductory course to macroeconomics. It has weekly Problem sets and one midterm and one final. Lecture is sometimes interesting, but you can for the most part get by without attending every single lecture. Definitely important to read the textbook and then complement that by attending section to have any questions answered by your TA. The tests will be harder than you expect, but you can still do well if you prepare well.",
    "A good into class.",
    "ECON 116 is a prereq econ course that's really not interesting, but hopefully later courses will get better. Don't take it with Professor Shiller if he teaches it again.",
    "ECON 116 is a class you just have to take as an econ (or econ-related major). You just gotta get through it. Shiller was not a great lecturer (with regards to the content we were actually supposed to learn) but has lots of interesting stories and insights. They might not be fantastic for the class itself, but will deepen your macroeconomic understanding. TAs were strong, problem sets were generally well-written. The midterm and the final were both major time crunches, but will be curved. Because the exams make up 80% of your grade it's important to be on top of your game while studying for and taking the exams. All in all, you just have to get through this course. Try to go to lecture to see how Shiller thinks, and work well with your TA.",
    "It's an important subject that will deepen your understanding of the world. Just don't take it with Shiller WHATEVER YOU DO. I could teach the class better than he did. I would at least try harder. At least it was easy.",
    "It is a good basic macroecon course, though a bit dry at times. Professor Shiller is clearly passionate about the subject and, as long as you recognize that his lectures are not intended to correspond directly with the reading or the problem sets, they are actually very interesting!",
    "I feel pretty ambivalent towards this class. I wouldn't know whether to recommend it or not.",
    "This is a basic intro macro course",
    "If you take it, you have to be prepared to do a lot of learning on yourself.",
    "If you are planning on being an Econ major, then the class is bearable. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't bother...there are more interesting SO courses out there.",
    "Lectures were rather boring but the material was very interesting",
    "There's no way around this course if you want to major in economics, but the good thing is that it is not much work. Problem sets do not take much time at all, and sections are very helpful. Lectures are definitely boring and do not help the students learn, but the main upside of this course is that the material is very interesting and the textbook is very clear.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because it taught me a lot of knew things, and the TFs were extremely helpful. It is hard, though, so if you're not interested in economics, I would not take this.",
    "Take it if you have to take, that is the only reason I took it. A complete disaster of a course. Intro Econ classes at Yale are my biggest academic disappointment. Such suffer through it if it is required, otherwise stray away from taking this econ course, specially if it is being taught by Shiller (which I don't think will happen again).",
    "Typical intro macro course. Lecture has a better curve, but I would assume taking the seminar would be more effective for learning the material.",
    "A good, general, introductory course. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in economics or the way the economy works as a whole.",
    "Take it with Shiller if you really need the credit, but otherwise it might be worth waiting out if another professor with more undergrad teaching experience steps in. Prepare to do a LOT of self-learning though.",
    "It's a very manageable class, especially compared to trickier classes in the department. As most intro classes are, it's not too juicy with ideas that are immediately applicable to real-life concerns (because the models are simplified often near the point of absurdity), but the concepts are interesting and imo still crucial (though simple) to knowing what on earth is happening in even basic discussions of economic policy.",
    "Yes, it is information that is good to know, and I enjoyed the course. I might recommend that they wait until Professor Shiller is rotated out, however.",
    "I think it really depends on the instructor. It is also an intro class so I cannot say it is the best class I've taken at Yale but overall it was good.",
    "I would recommend ECON 116 to a fellow student. It is a good overview of many areas of macroeconomics and I now feel that I have substantial knowledge of many areas of life and economics that I feel are very important to know. The course could be a bit more structured in lecture and at times it was difficult to know what subjects would and wouldn't be tested.",
    "This class should be renamed \"The History of Shiller and Friends, and the application of macroeconomics in the real world\". If you're an independent learner and can learn from reading a textbook, I'd recommend this class. Shiller was also extremely entertaining and brought great insights to the table.",
    "A course that is necessary to understand a vast amount of material in following courses. I would recommend it as a stepping stone to other critical majors and courses in other subjects.",
    "Hell on earth. DO NOT TAKE IT WITH SHILLER. He is truly the worst teacher\/professor I've ever had in my life.",
    "I recommend this class to someone interested in the economy in general (even if they aren't planning on majoring in it). All of the subjects discussed are very pertinent.",
    "A preface to this review: This particular version of intro macro may never be repeated again, as it was special circumstances that led Shiller to teach this class, but I'd be surprised if the record didn't end up with some Yale Record-worthy stuff. A class that was a little too applicable: it became itself a reenactment of the U.S. economy c. 2006 - 2008. First, there was great excitement: a packed SSS 114, valuations of the class rising through word of mouth before it even started. Shiller came in and talked for 65 minutes about the history of economics professors at Yale, the textbook authors, the Nobel prize, his handwriting, and his mother. After a few more lectures that were more relevant to trivia night than macroeconomics, confidence started wavering. The multiplier took care of the rest: attendance bottomed out to a steady 20% after spring break. The only thing that saved this class from the lowest rating was the TA's, whom they must have found in some TA heaven because you learned more macro in one 50 minute section than in 500 in lecture. They were the government bailout. To be fair, it's not that Shiller didn't put effort into this class; you could tell his powerpoints took a while to put together. It's just that the material was more appropriate for \"Take Your Professor Out To Dinner\" conversation than precious class time. And he had speech ADD; he couldn't string a complete thought together before jumping to something else, a symptom that also plagued the book he assigned us. After enough half sentences, you just zone out. This class was the perfect example of a fundamental flaw of the research university. Give us real teachers, certified or vetted, like the Math Department is doing, and don't make an apple be an orange.",
    "Necessary for econ major, obviously. It's also rather useful knowledge so I'd recommend the class to everyone.",
    "The best thing about this class is that you can teach everything yourself from the textbook. This is also its weakness because then you are simply not compelled to go to class. Particularly with Professor Shiller, who cannot teach. If you just want to take Macroeconomics to fulfill a requirement and don't actually care about learning from your professor, take the class. If you want a great experience with a professor (and actually learn from him\/her), wait until another professor is teaching the class. Professor Shiller is a caring man, but he just doesn't know how to teach (classic example of someone being too smart to teach a basic, intro class). Otherwise, this course isn't much work, the problem sets are pretty much straight from the book, and you can teach yourself and not go to class!",
    "If you have to take this course, do so. If you don't, don't. And try not to take it with Shiller- all you get is the right to say you were taught by him, you won't learn that much.",
    "Do not take Econ 116 if Shiller is teaching it again. Take the seminar. If you end up taking the class, I suggest reading the textbook like a Bible. You must keep up with the readings and go to section. Find the best section leader and go to their section otherwise you won't be able to keep up with all the material. Go to class too if you have the time, but it probably won't help you learn the material.",
    "Very interesting. You should definitely take it even if you are not thinking about an economics major. It definitely is useful information on how the world works.",
    "try and avoid this class with this professor if you have the choice",
    "Read the textbook to learn the material. Go to section to learn how to do the problem sets. Prepare early for exams and keep up with the readings\/section.",
    "Do not take unless you are an Econ major. There is no need to take it. It basically just teaches rational money flow. CAUTION: Do not take with Shiller. He's a professional genius, not an undergraduate professor.",
    "Great introduction to macroeconomics class. It went through everything in depth at a good pace.",
    "With Shiller as the professor, I would definitely warn the student that attending lecturer is not very helpful. However, as an introductory class, this class is necessary to be able to go into higher classes, so this class was fine if needed for the economics major.",
    "If you can learn subjects well on your own then take it.",
    "Definitely take this class as knowing macroeconomics is essential in understanding how our economy works. Class is interesting overall; lectures could be not so informative but sections are useful.",
    "Typical intro econ course. I think Shiller teaching it was really an exception to the normal macro class. It touched on asset pricing and housing markets much more than a normal intro macro class would. It is what it is. Some of the topics are pretty interesting, but overall the content material is pretty basic.",
    "I would describe it as a necessary step for econ even though a lot of the learning occurs outside the classroom. I would not recommend it for a student looking for an interesting class but I would recommend it to a student on the econ track.",
    "I would not recommend this class if Prof. Shiller is still teaching",
    "Take it if it's for your major.",
    "only take if you need to for further courses\/majors.",
    "Interesting material with a decent lecturer and a good textbook- read it and learn the material from it.",
    "This is a course that needs to be ticked off as a pre req for a few majors, so I would recommend taking this course as early in your Yale career as possible.",
    "For this particular semester, lots of reading and little verbal instruction. Lecture was unnecessary to attend and you mainly went through the textbook. Wouldn't recommend this course, but hopefully a better instructor will be chosen.",
    "Nope it's boring as hell and you don't learn anything",
    "Professor Shiller is not the most interesting lecturer to listen to. His lectures do not cover the material on the test, making the lectures seem pointless. I basically taught myself by reading the book, which was very annoying.",
    "Econ 116 is a good foundation for macroeconomics. The concepts may at first seem very dispersed, but in the end, everything falls into place.",
    "I would recommend this course to potential Econ majors as well as students who are interested in a basic knowledge of economics. The math isn't too heavy, but it does help to have some background with basic functions (like exponential functions).",
    "Poor class. Do not take this if Professor Shiller is teaching.",
    "I would not, unless they are an Econ major",
    "Most students take this either because they're a freshman or because they need it as a prereq. That said, the Econ Dept. could do a lot to improve the class's structure and instruction so that the lecture matches the problem sets and exams in its handling of complex topics, something that didn't happen this semester.",
    "Econ 116 is an intro to macroeconomics taught as a lecture. The material was much more interesting (and qualitative for the most part) than micro, but sometimes the lecture format isn't as engaging. If you are interested in economics, however, this is a class you will have to take.",
    "ECON 116 lectures are good for exploring supplementary material on macroeconomics, but be prepared to learn actual introductory macroeconomics on your own or through section only.",
    "HORRIBLE TEACHER. He meant well but didn't teach the course material at all. He should be teaching an upper level, specialized class, probably a seminar. Not an intro class. Intro macro needs to be taught by a competent professor who can go through the textbook and teach the hundreds of people the basics in econ. DO NOT take this class if it's taught again by Shiller. Other than that though, it's interesting material and way more applicable than micro. You learn about inflation, trade policy, taxes v. cutting spending, etc.",
    "I would recommend Econ 116 to any student given that the professor is known for being a good professor, so make sure you research whoever is teaching it. The reality is that although Shiller is a nobel prize winner, he is not at all a good fit for Econ 116. Professor aside, the concepts learned are incredibly interesting, and good general knowledge to have.",
    "A good course with good material, but very reliant on self-teaching.",
    "Basic intro macro course - probably important class for everyone to take.",
    "Required class for Econ majors, try to take it in the fall if you want to have a more engaging lecture.",
    "Necessary class, but kind of dull.",
    "Econ 116 is definitely necessary for the econ major or for a broad understanding of the macroeconomy, but I found it to be much more challenging than Micro. This could be due to the teaching style, which I was less compatible with. It is a reasonably challenging course, but the material makes sense when it clicks, and most of the TAs were really great at helping to make it click. I would recommend this to students who have an interest because it is important information to know; however, the course could see many improvements that would make it much more enjoyable without taking away from the information it conveys.",
    "It's a decent intro course. I learned a lot. I would recommend this class to anyone who has at least some interest in econ, because it is a good body of knowledge to have in modern times.",
    "If Shiller is the professor, be prepared to read the entire textbook and teach yourself Macroeconomics.",
    "I'd recommend taking it Credit\/D if you don't need to take it, but I enjoyed the course. Professor Shiller meandered a bit around the material, but Jeff Zhang was an incredible TF, and I really enjoyed learning from Professor Shiller, even if his lectures weren't that applicable. I think that if he teaches this course again it will be better, because this was the first time he's taught an intro-level course.",
    "I would recommend ECON 116 to students who are interested in economics (or need it as a prereq), but do not have a strong enough grasp on it to go for the Macro seminar. You'll definitely learn the material well, the psets and exams make sure of it, and I think you'll enjoy having Shiller as a professor. Just remember to read the textbook and go to section! (And hope you get Jeff as a TF).",
    "Professor Shiller's lectures focus on anecdotes over the subject matter of the course. I would wait to take Econ 116 with a different professor.",
    "General macro Econ. If you didn't take it in high school, well you have to take it now.",
    "This class is like going to a series of Master's Teas. Don't expect to go to lecture to learn the textbook material. Instead, go to lecture to hear some stories about Shiller's experiences and how current events are related to such economic principles.",
    "If the same professor teaches the class, I would urge my companions not to take it because it was disorganized, stressful, and overall an unenjoyable learning experience.",
    "I would recommend this class. The content is very interesting and incredibly relevant to our world. The information we learned explained so much about how the financial world works and how politics play into economics. I think everyone should be required to take this class just to get a working knowledge of such things. I think the information is very important.",
    "A rudimentary economics course. The quality of lecture really depends on the professor. The lecture may not supplement the textbook and predominant exam concepts well. If you're not an economics major (or Global Affairs), it may be worth taking to improve your overall economic literacy\/understanding. I feel much more confident reading the business\/finance and political-economic sections of newspapers and magazines. It can be a slog though if you're not truly interested.",
    "A very wide overview of some basic issues in Macroeconomics. Though the course material wasn't overly inspiring, there's value in listening to Shiller muse on about current events and the nobel dinners he's been going to etc. The actual tested material (like intro micro) will be delivered in large part during section and by the TAs. Not a terrible course if you need it. Curve is generous of course",
    "Econ 116 with Prof. Shiller is different to the regular 116 because Shiller is a behavioural economist and looks at the economy from a psychological perspective. The lectures include material from the depressions and crisis. He loves Ngrams. Everything is visualized in a graph.",
    "A standard intro to macro. Irrelevant and rather boring lectures, but interesting material and some great section leaders make this class worth it. Manageable weekly psets that took around 2 hrs, a midterm and challenging final, helped by a significant boost by the curve.",
    "Econ 116 was a so-so class. I didn't love it, but I did learn some necessary and recommended information about the modern economy. I would recommend the class, but perhaps with a different instructor.",
    "If you want to do well in this course, you do not need to go to lecture but just to sections while doing the reading. However, if you actually want to learn how the concepts taught in this course apply to today's world and manifest themselves in the pages of business newspapers, then going to Shiller's lectures is the way to go. I would recommend this course to a student who does not want a typical macroeconomics course, but wants a fuller view of the macroeconomy.",
    "Econ 116 is a pretty thorough introduction to macroeconomics. There were weekly problem sets, a midterm and a final. The homework is reasonable and the exams were pretty fair. The lectures were fascinating -- Professor Shiller is full of interesting stories pertaining to the current state of the economy-- but the real core of the learning (for the homework and exams) came from the discussion sections, reading the textbook, and the ta's office hours. The topics covered were interesting and particularly relevant to the happenings of the modern world. Professor Shiller's thoughts were always interesting and insightful. Part of the experience of this class comes from the wonderful opportunity to hear a Nobel laureate speak on topics of interest to him. This class presents you with two separate learning opportunities -- those of the textbook and discussion sections (which the exams test your knowledge of) and those of the lectures (which include Shiller's fascinating insights to the current state of affairs). Both of these are worthwhile. Overall, a great class -- I'd highly recommend it.",
    "Basic intro class which definitely answers a lot of questions about economics, many of which we run into in our daily lives.",
    "If you are willing to put in a lot of individual effort, it's a fabulous class and I would definitely recommend it. Find a good section from the start because they explain most of what you need to know there. I was in trouble because I didn't find that out until the mid-end of the course.",
    "If you want to learn a lot, you'll have to put in more input on your own and study the textbook etc., but the class overall is fairly easy. It's a good intro course, a very very large lecture.",
    "A really good class if you take advantage of it. With Shiller teaching it, going to section and reading the textbook was enough to get you by (took until the midterm to figure that out). But Shiller's lectures were so interesting because he discussed research and current events that related directly to the material we were studying. A lot of people thought he was bragging when he talked about being good friends with this economist or this Fed chair, but I thought it was a great perspective on the life of a current, real world economist.",
    "Read. That's really the only important thing. Read and do problem sets.",
    "I really recommend the class, good professor and good teaching fellows.",
    "A good overall view of the macroeconomy. I would recommend.",
    "The material is interesting, the class less so.",
    "Intro Macro seems like your average intro economics course. The content is interesting but the lectures are pretty disorganized."
