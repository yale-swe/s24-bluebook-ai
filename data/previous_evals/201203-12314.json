   "comments": [
    "I was disappointed in the lecturing in the class. There was content, but it was sparely represented in the actual coursework; most of the coursework was in details and equations that wereavailable only in the \"optional\" review sessions and on the blackboard, rather than in easily-accessible, quickly referenced, and well put-together lectures. A lot of the evaluated content was easily missed. Definitely could have been improved by evaluating the content in the regular lectures and by providing the equations that we weren't expected to derive ourselves (or were able to, basically all of them.)Go to everything, you'll do okay. Content is fairly interesting, good on the science, a little vague at times. Not really into it, don't take it.",
    "No because it is just not as interesting as I thought it was going to be going into it.",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT. It's complicated and occasionally very confusing. You have to work hard. But the TFs this semester were great. Overall, I did learn a lot. It was just occasionally super frustrating.",
    "I would not recommend it. There are easier guts, and there are more interesting and useful classes that are legit. This was the worst of both worlds.",
    "Take this class. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to do a normal amount of work. The math is simple, and the concepts taught are really easy to understand (and also very interesting and relevant). Professor Priya Natarajan is awesome, and very accessible. The lecture notes are posted online, but I would recommend attending class, because the concepts are much better understood directly from the professor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words. The course includes a few ungraded concept quizzes (genuinely engaging group discussions), four problem sets (occasionally challenging, but not frustratingly so), three in-class tests (open-book), a mid-term (again open-book), and a 10-20 page final paper (on a topic of your choice \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I really enjoyed researching for and writing the paper). You must attend the sections for clearing doubts, understanding how to approach the problem sets, and knowing how to prepare for the tests. The teaching assistants were a great help (and really friendly too)! You should leave this class with sufficient knowledge to be able to understand current cosmological discourse.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The workload is very manageable, but the course manages to be interesting enough to always keep your attention and provide an interesting and rewarding experience.",
    "Do not take this class. You can get your science credit with a better one.",
    "A really great introduction to cosmology for someone to whom the subject sounds interesting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who isn't interested in black holes, the finiteness of the universe, the Big Bang, dark energy, etc.? \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0but isn't prepared to dive into extremely complicated math. I would not call this class a gut, since there is very real content that you need to master in order to do well on the (very frequent) tests, even though they are open-notes.This is an excellent way to fulfill a science credit requirement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if I had taken this my freshman year, I might have taken a lot more astronomy courses. Priya's intelligence and enthusiasm are hard to find in professors elsewhere at Yale.",
    "this is not a gut class! problem sets are fine, but the exams are extremely hard near the end. It was insane how hard it was. Also, there is a lot of work involved.",
    "This class started of fine. The tests reflected what we went over on the P-sets. Before the midterm, our professor announced we were doing too well on the open booktests and wanted to see more grade distribution. The midterm was absurdly hard, and no one even finished the whole test on time. After the midterm, the tests and the problems sets were very very hard and a lot more theoretical, as a punishment for \"doing too well\" early on in the semester. The class was nearly impossible to pay attention to for an hour and 15 minutes. I wouldn't really recommend this class to another student, unless they were genuinely interested in cosmology and not just looking for a straightforward QR like I was.",
    "As long as you can plug and chug equations, you should be fine.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this class to anyone who's interested in intro cosmology or simply want to find a good class to fulfill the distributional requirement.",
    "This course is an interesting introduction to the basic topics of Cosmology: the early universe, the structure of the universe, dark matter and dark energy, black holes, star formation. The course does not require extensive knowledge of math, but the concepts are relatively complex. It is taught as a basic course in the field, and so is not really an easy science credit for humanities majors. That being said, the course material is made accessible through the helpful sessions with the TAs and the lectures, and the tests are doable and aimed at the key concepts covered in the course. I would recommend it if you have a genuine interest in the field, or if you're looking for a science credit that's a bit more of an exciting challenge.",
    "The content is really interesting. I learned a lot and I did not find it too difficult, as a non-science major.",
    "An introduction to the basic ideas of cosmology, designed for students with a strong background in physics and mathematics. Not a conceptual science class for non-majors (i.e. fun ideas for English students). Rather, difficult concepts that would be more interesting and understandable to somebody familiar with physical science.",
    "It's a very interesting course, and the professor is very interested in her work. The material is sometimes difficult to grasp and does not seem to follow any certain path, but the overall course in intriguing and not extremely difficult. I would recommend taking this course is you can think conceptually and manipulate basic math equations. There is not much homework and the tests are not extremely difficult.",
    "I took this course to fulfill my science requirement. I can see how a person with a greater interest in and altitude for astrophysics would find this class interesting, but I had suh a hard time getting what was going on that it ended up feeling like a chore. That being said, the grading was pretty fair and there was enough help from the review sessions to survive the home works and tests without too much stress.",
    "If you've any passing interest in Stephen Hawking-like cosmological questions (and a are not much of a science person), you ought to take this class. The workload is very manageable, the tests are open-book (and thankfully qualitative), and the content is fairly comprehensive - at a basic level.",
    "Yes, this is a good class for a science credit, and you can learn something about the cosmology and astronomical physics. Also, writing the final essay is a lot of fun.",
    "It is an interesting general introduction to Cosmology that is mainly aimed at non-science majors, and therefore can present things in a rather superficial way for those who wish to delve deeper in the field. At times, the lectures could be rather dull, perhaps due to the nature of the material itself, and it would appear for those unfamiliar with the subject to be too technical. The homework assignments are quite simple and the sessions offered by the TAs really make a difference for those struggling with them. The tests were meant to be straightforward and unambiguous, except for the midterm when more was expected within the same period of a lecture. The final paper enabled students to do some research on their own, but at the same time it was broad enough so that people might get lost and unmotivated. It was an interesting way to conclude the semester, but it could be a little burdensome for those who have to write long papers for other classes as well. As a QR\/Science credit, it is still a manageable course even for those with very little exposure to math.",
    "For any person fascinated but confused by the major astronomical issues of the day, especially those whose talents and predilections lean them to the humanities, Introduction to Cosmology is a good choice. Though the order is sometimes confusing, the topics are all pretty intriguing and significant, and the tests (all open-book and open-notes) are very manageable. Prof. Natarajan is a great presence and can be fun. Participate in lecture, and you'll be on her good side. This class is worth taking.",
    "This class claims to be for \"non-science majors\" and so I took it for my sc credit and while I was able to follow much of the class and felt like I enjoyed and benefitted academically from the course, there are tons of science majors in this class that dragged up the mean!! The class, however, is super interesting and not that much work, so even though I'm not sure I will get an \"A\" I got a lot out of it! Also--key advice: the information taught in the review sessions\/problem sets sessions is 10x more important for the exams than anything in the lectures\/textbook.",
    "Pretty good class. The field is very interesting in general though lecture can be quite dry at times. Professor Natarajan is brilliant and really cares that you understand the concepts. There were 3 tests and a midterm, which was a lot, but they required minimal studying.",
    "Very good introductory course. Take it if you are marginally interested in the materials, though beware that sometimes the calculations get a little bit tedious."
