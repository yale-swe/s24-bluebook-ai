    "This class taught me about the history of public health in detail that I had not previously learned. I constantly felt like I was learning new things which I loved!",
    "I learned a lot about a large range of topics, including lectures on everything from Tuberculosis to slavery and disease to AIDS to sugar intake. Dr. Rogers is fascinating, and I learned about many topics in American life. We also don't just talk about them factually; we also analyze the social, political, and ethnic response to the issues. Very fascinating with a low workload-- highly recommend!",
    "-critical analysis of historical documents -patterns in American public health thinking",
    "An in depth understanding of public health in the US over the past few centuries.",

    "I gained a greater understanding of the nuances of public health over the course of American history.",
    "I learned about the epidemics in America since 1793 and various diseases and how public health administrators and America reacted to those diseases. I learned about how public health measures have changed over the centuries and how the behaviors of individuals have changed over the centuries. Public Health is a global problem and I learned how as years go on the means to combat diseases as changed as medicine gets better and technology improves as well as sanitation and hygiene behaviors improve across the globe.",
    "I learned a lot on the history and development of illnesses and diseases as well as the structure of America's health and medical efforts. I think it was important for me to take this course in order to understand how the public health sectors work today.",
    "Learned about history of public health in America + how to think about themes and patterns in history",
    "I learned how to think about the history of public health and explore conflicting interests.",
    "An AMAZING class!!! I learned so much about Public Health over the history of the United States and all of the implications of the events that transpired. What a great intro to critical thinking and analysis in the public health fields. As a STEM major, it was great being able to apply critical thinking and analysis to historical events.",
    "This was the first history class I took at Yale! I learned how to look at historical events in the larger context of the sociopolitical situations of the time and I learned a lot about the history of our medical system and how it was shaped into the system it is today.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a strength of this course is its solid overview of American public health over time. We touched on many different topics, so I learned a wide range of information However, lectures were disorganized and never uploaded in a timely manner. On multiple occasions, Professor Rogers held us past class time and tried to finish her slides, thus making us all late for our next class. I think she need to re-evaluate how much she puts in her lectures, or how fast she goes, and needs to upload her slides on time. Furthermore, having a final paper and a final exam that account for 70% of your grade it too much. The paper needs to be due earlier or there needs to be two midterms instead of one midterm and a final, just to break the grade up a little more.",
    "The readings of this course were fascinating. I loved the primary sources! I thought that the lectures were well structured and were easy to follow.",
    "I loved the workload. The class was always engaged with lectures, but we only had one paper, a midterm, and a final. Also the TF's were truly phenomenal-- all so knowledgeable about the topic. No weaknesses!",
    "-it's good overall",
    "Lecture was a bit boring, but the material was interesting.",
    "Strengths: The material is straightforward and a lot of information is provided to you by Prof. Rogers and the TAs. It is engaging and the readings are really interesting. Weaknesses: Sometimes lectures are hard to follow\/a little too fast but not bad, Prof. Rogers is a very interesting lecturer and I enjoyed her knowledge of the material.",
    "The grade distribution for this course was a bit nerve wracking, as the final paper was worth 40 percent of the total grade.",
    "Great overview of the history of public health and the contexts that shaped it.",
    "Strengths: very interesting material but the lecture itself was a bit boring. Could be more engaging and exciting if there were not so much words on each slide==many students seem to copy verbatim of the slide and not attend class. Weaknesses: boring lecture...too many words on the slides so the lecture was not very engaging .",
    "This course had a lot of great information that helped me learn and understand the structure of America's public health system but it wasn't always taught to the degree the helped me learn or understand it well. I think the readings helped fill in a lot of the gaps in knowledge and I thoroughly enjoyed doing them because it was interesting to me. I think the course could improve in the way the slides are created and presented in lecture to help highlight the more important aspects.",
    "Strengths: Interesting syllabus. It was nice to be able to pick our own topic for the paper, and TAs provided a lot of guidance when asked. Workload was fair. Weaknesses: Lectures went too fast sometimes, and parts of them felt irrelevant to public health (although I later made the link, it would have been better if lectures had been slowed down to make the links more obvious). Grading was unnecessarily harsh and took points off for things not asked for in the question.",
    "There didn't seem to be a logical order to the lectures.",
    "An AMAZING class!!! I learned so much about Public Health over the history of the United States and all of the implications of the events that transpired. What a great intro to critical thinking and analysis in the public health fields. As a STEM major, it was great being able to apply critical thinking and analysis to historical events.",
    "This course is strong in its breadth but I wish it was more public health focused. Sometimes lectures would be about topics extremely tangential to public health",
    "I thought this course was strong because the information was presented in an organized manner and it was very interesting.",
    "This course was very engaging, despite being a lecture course. It described each public health milestone in detail, and in chronological order, which increased my ability to understand the content. I have no complaints of the lecture course.",
    "I think there could have been more checkpoint assignments to keep students on track. Overall though, Professor Rogers made the content very engaging.",
    "strengths: interesting content weaknesses: jump around in time a lot, sometimes hard to follow",
    "I think during section we can go over more terms. The readings were rarely helpful for the midterm and final.",
    "The class is a lecture where students meet once a week for section. I enjoyed both aspects of the class, however I wish we could have had better readings for section. I would have liked to have covered more contemporary public health issues, but we only devoted a lecture or two on these. The readings for section could have been a good way to incorporate these topics more into the class.",
    "The lectures are very much limited to taking a lot of notes with little interaction with the professor. However, the lectures are very organized and clear.",
    "It was a solid course",
    "Strengths: many topics covered, exams were fair, TA's were excellent, interesting readings Weaknesses: lectures were not that organized",
    "The readings were very interesting and section was helpful.",
    "Overlapped a lot with content of other intro public health classes."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if the assignment distribution is changed and if Professor Rogers adjusts her lectures. The information is interesting, but it is presented in a confusing and disorganized manner.",
    "Most definitely! I thought this course was extremely enjoyable. I even loved the final paper because the topic was something that the student wanted to research which made all of the difference.",
    "Absolutely loved this class!! You learn about so many different topics throughout American history, from Tuberculosis and slavery medicine to AIDS and sugar intake. Dr. Rogers is amazing, and the TF's are some of the best at Yale. We also don't just talk about them factually; we also analyze the social, political, and ethnic response to the issues. The course is not difficult-- only a midterm, 10 page paper, and a final-- and the readings are all short and interesting. Highly recommend!!",
    "Yes, it's interesting",
    "Yes, it is very important especially if you want to be a doctor.",
    "Absolutely, I thoroughly enjoyed this class.",
    "Yes! Great intro to American public health.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely! The lectures are always interesting, and the section is actually worthwhile.",
    "It's probably the easiest history lecture out there and the lectures can feel disjointed at times.",
    "Yes, fantastic course, super engaging lectures, awesome topic.",
    "Yes; especially if you want some base knowledge about what shaped public health.",
    "Went to class about three times and will probably finish with a B+\/A- so if you're looking for that kind of class and need a Hu credit this is your course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interesting in HSHM and public health. The material was very interesting and I learned a lot but I probably would not recommend it to students looking for a very interesting lecture.",
    "I think this course can be great for another student if they are interested at all in medicine or public health.",
    "The class is okay. It's not bad but it's not spectacular. The lectures can feel pretty dry, but the content is interesting. The workload is manageable and really only picks up at the end of the year when you have to submit a paper + do a final exam.",
    "Yes",
    "An AMAZING class!!! I learned so much about Public Health over the history of the United States and all of the implications of the events that transpired. What a great intro to critical thinking and analysis in the public health fields. As a STEM major, it was great being able to apply critical thinking and analysis to historical events.",
    "Yes, I would! It's a fairly straightforward history of public health in this country. It was really interesting. Sometimes Professor Roger's lectures can be a bit scattered but I always left feeling like I'd learned a lot. I think it is a little weird that we have both a final paper and a final exam, but it wasn't too bad.",
    "Only if youre really interested in public health. Otherwise could be boring",
    "Yes, the content is really interesting and you learn a lot of important things regarding public health that are good to know in the real world.",
    "I would recommend this course as an introduction to the field of public health and the HSHM degree.",
    "Yes. This course is a must-take for anyone interested in the history of science and medicine.",
    "I would recommend the course because I think the content was very interesting and has many implications for the present.",
    "Yes, if they are looking for an interesting humanities course and to learn more about the history of public health in America",
    "Absolutely! I feel like I learned a lot of important information.",
    "Yes if they are interested in the material",
    "I would recommend this to another students. The topics covered are interesting and beg for further discussion. The course does a good job in referencing you to additional sources in case you are interested in learning more about them, and the final paper is a good way to explore any subject of interest and it helps spark a conversation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about the history of public health in America.",
    "Yes its a good lecture class that gives a lot of interesting information.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are very interested in the history of public health. The workload is light and exams are fair (ID's and short essay), but the lectures were not that well-organized and cohesive.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. While not being overly tasking it is incredibly interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "Ya it's chill, cool topic",
    "I think this was a really interesting class with low workload."
