   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only to students who genuinely enjoyed Econometrics and Data Analysis I and who understand that ECON 132 will require a greater level of comfort with proofs and mathematical notation. This course could be summarized as a rigorous examination of what happens when we can't use OLS because an assumption fails. It's very practical knowledge, but the material feels theoretical and is heavily geared towards use in economics research. The papers we looked at in class were interesting, and Meghir is a good professor and provides clear explanations, but this course was challenging.",
    "I would recommend Econ 132 if you want to do a senior thesis in econ, or if you're in sociology or poli sci and want to learn some econometrics tools. The class is about the study of causality: how can you prove one thing causes another, and it's not just correlation? The professor goes through the theory, but the main focus is on application. We had several homework assignments that were graded very generously, 2 projects that helped drive home the things we learned, and a midterm and final. Not bad at all. (my background: I've taken all of the core economics classes like intro and intermediate micro and macro, and econ 131)",
    "This class might have been one of my favorite courses of the semester. Costas is great, and you learn so much. If you've ever thrown around the phrase omitted-variables bias in class, well, you should probably derive what it actually means.",
    "I would recommend ECON 132 to other students because it is one of the most useful classes you will take. Not only will you become an expert at regression analysis, you will learn some experimental methods. Prof. Meghir makes this class great because he is really patient with teaching. The material will be hard if you are not used to formalizing everything...so brush up on your stats.",
    "I would recommend it to ECON majors and any one else who'll need to conduct primary research in the future. The course gives you a great understanding of how studies are designed and how economists actually estimate effects of certain programs. Econometrics is pretty critical if you're going to be working with any empirical data at all. In comparison with ECON 136, which I shopped last year but ultimately dropped, ECON 132 is insanely easy as far as the math goes since you're not expected to prove any of the theories. However, at the same time I definitely thought 132 was more useful, since it gave more direction on applicability and how we can actually use the models to conduct research. In terms of workflow, 132 was much less, so I would recommend 132 to any Econ major.",
    "This course is great. It is also much more difficult than ECON 131. Don't be afraid to Cr\/D\/F it, because you will learn a lot no matter what. Be warned, though: a lot of very important foundational material taught at the very beginning of the semester, when many students aren't serious yet about their studies. If you think you might take this course, pay close attention.",
    "Take it Cr\/D!",
    "Long problem sets, but they are doable. All of the tests are very fair though.",
    "It is a good class, take it if you are at all interested in how social science works. I would strongly recommend the course.",
    "As far as econometrics goes, it's not a bad course. It's very fair and manageable. And our TF Adam was terrific. If you want to have the skills, go for it. Otherwise, another course might be more interesting and fun.",
    "Take it if you are interested in empirical analysis at all! Of course, if you are way ahead of your peers in quantitative skills, you may want to take the graduate courses instead.",
    "If you are an economics major, or interested in reading academic papers or designing studies in any field of social studies, TAKE THIS CLASS! It is difficult, but it will be worth it. I feel like this class has equipped me with the skills to read an academic paper, and I have a much better understanding of how to get at causality. The statistical concepts I learned in this class were very often helpful in my other economics classes as well. I am very surprised that this is not a required class for the economics major. Econ 131 did not teach me anything, while this class was extremely useful.",
    "The lectures lack clarity, but the TA sessions and the review sessions are very helpful. The exams are fair.",
    "It's not going to be easy, but it's a rewarding class.",
    "Yes, one of the most useful classes I took in Yale, not easy, but if you make an effort, youwill enjoy the class tremendously, it gives you in the end, not only technical backing on econometric and statistics, it provide you a analytic muscle learning experience, I had a very vivid dream about step-wise regression, just saying",
    "I took Econ 131 with Prof. Benkard (no longer at Yale, unfortunately) and really enjoyed it. The problem with Econ 132 is that it simultaneously attemptedto be thorough and not too intense. The lectures covered difficult topics for which we were only required to have a basic understanding for the exams.. Given this, it's hard to feel like I learned that much in this class compared to 131.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in research, or taking econometrics 1 to the next level. It's great!",
    "Please, TAKE THIS CLASS. Costas Meghir is one of the best instructors at Yale. You know all the important stuff in Economics. This class is 1000000 times better than ECON 131\/135. The lectures are very dry but entertaining (sounds like a paradox, right?). You always leave class thinking: \"Wow, I actually know how to write and read a paper in Economics now.\" If you want to do anything in Economics or just be a superb student, take this class. I got one job at Yale just mentioning that I had taken this class with Meghir. He is one of the most accomplished Econometricians in the world (just google him!)The requirements for the class are the BEST: we have 8 exercise sheets (that are not graded but you have to turn them in), 2 projects (which have the length of a problem set in any other class), one midterm and one final exam (for both, Meghir provides us with a study guide that tells you exactly what will be on the exam). Besides, Meghir makes it very clear that he does not want to give anyone a bad grade. The TA, Adam Osman, is amazing, but he will not be TAing this class again. Take it, you will not regret it."
