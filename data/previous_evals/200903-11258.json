   "comments": [
    "Do you want to make things? You are welcome to think as much as you want, and it is doubtful you\u0092re being graded for it. Mostly everyone came late to class, the projects were slow and plenty of class time was allotted to work on each. Quality of work was dull. It\u0092s more than likely the class consists of mostly art majors, since more people want to take the class than spaces are available (or three times the limit). Sarah won\u0092t be teaching the class for a while and unfortunately what could be a wonderful, rigorous thought project instead becomes a series of several crafty, pre-sculptural tasks from \u0093101 Fun Art Things You Can Do on Your Own or for Class Credit\u0094.",
    "A course that covers a broad range of materials. I would recommend it to anyone. The workload is not unmanageable. However, the sculptures were a little difficult to do given that we had Thanksgiving Break right after we were assigned the project.",
    "Its probably not great for non-art students, but as a required course of the major it is not bad at all. I had fun.",
    "Lots of fun, wide variety of projects and lots of flexibility within each project. Absolutely take it. At times I felt like I was 12 again at an arts and crafts camp, which is a positive thing, trust me. One problem is: good luck getting into this class if you're not a junior or senior art major. It may be an itro level class but because of the size of the class most art majors have to wait a while before they can get into it. Worth showing up for the first class just incase though",
    "Take it for the major with Anna - she's fun. But otherwise I'm not sure it's the most productive use of a credit.",
    "Visual Thinking is sort of a design course. In this class some of the projects were designing a pattern, making sculptures inspired by shadows, and creating books. It's really fun and it is a different way of thinking about art than \"that's good.\"",
    "Its a great class for anyone considering being and art major.",
    "well, you have to take it!",
    "I liked this class because it incorporated a bunch of different projects that covered different ways of creating art. It is a basic introductory course. Anna was awesome.",
    "Visual thinking (as taught by Professor Betbeze, it is different with other professors) is good for someone who isn't an art major and isn't super serious about art but wants to do something fun and somewhat creative. As an art major one has to take it and its pretty frustrating for someone who wants to get some actual work done. The projects are totally random, like making wallpaper or making a 5-foot reproduction of a miniature, or making a mobile. The crits are pretty laid back. You can get away with doing very little if you want to."
