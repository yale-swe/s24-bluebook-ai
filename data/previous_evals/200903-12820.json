   "comments": [
    "This is a decent course, but the value of it depends greatly on the teacher. It is often tedious reading, but the classes themselves are interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course. If you are looking to develop your French skills in college, this course is an important stepping-stone. If you simply are interested in learning more about contemporary France, I think the course is equally valuable.",
    "Yep, I would recommend it. Bear in mind that you will have to turn in assignments every day, and it can get kind of tedious. Make sure you get a good teacher (like M. Lamy, who very kindly didn't mind when I forgot to do my homework) and a good class (smaller is better in a conversation class).",
    "Awesome.",
    "A great class that focuses on oral french. A fair amount of work (daily writing\/reading\/listening assignments, but it is worth it. Take it if the teacher is good."
