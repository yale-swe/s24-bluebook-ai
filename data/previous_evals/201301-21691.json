   "comments": [
    "On the first day Prof. Lalli describes this course as a masterclass-style class, the type of which is offered at music conservatories. There is a HUGE range of singers in this class, anyone who really wants to sing is going to take away a lot. This is far from a gut - weekly 30 min. coachings are expected outside of class. They're inconvenient but INVALUABLE. There are a few painless writing assignments. I was very happy I decided to take this course.",
    "Yes, providing the student likes to sing and is willing to put in the time to learn the pieces.",
    "I would defintely recommend this course if he\/she is a singer who is looking to build his\/her repertoire. It gave me an impetus to learn new music, and I felt accomplished at the end of the semester.",
    "I would NOT take this class again simply because we didn't do anything. We sang maybe every other week (less frequently had we not had Snowstorm Nemo) and it was more to see that you had the music in your binder than to critique. Students who sounded awesome got a \"good\"; students who sounded terrible got a \"needs work\". The wide variety in musical experience means that half of the singers know all the rep\/musicians and are bored out of their minds while the other have sit there trying to absorb all of the new information (not put anywhere, not repeated, just sort of tossed out).If you're looking for an easy class, find another one. If you're looking for real coaching, get a voice teacher. While I'm walking out of this class with at least an A-, I'm sad that I wasted so much time in this class instead of taking something more interesting.",
    "It is a great and fun class for singers to be introduced to a more academic setting of vocal performance and vocal music (as opposed to voice lessons) and in general is not a demanding class. The only exceptions are when house concerts or concerts in the Whitney Humanities Center happen, which usually require more time commitment.",
    "YES! If you put in the time for practice, class prep, and coachings, it is so fun and rewarding. (If you don't, it's just silly.) Professor Lalli and Sarah are incredible teachers, and this kind of personalized coaching would be very expensive elsewhere! The class is less intense than the syllabus makes it seem, especially because you hone the skills needed to learn music quickly and well. Professor Lalli is an expert at sensing what advice, coaching, and critique will be helpful to individuals, when to praise and when to scold (although his scolding is often in jest, you eventually learn), and guiding students of all backgrounds through a wealth of cultural background and musical technique. He cares genuinely about his students.",
    "This was a great class in many ways -- it gives you the opportunity to perform on a regular basis for the rest of the class and at the WHC, and to work with accompanist\/coach Sara Kohane. It's a great way to grow as a performer and interpreter of vocal music, especially if you already have a basic technical background in singing.",
    "Really good class for both the pre-professional aspiring art music singer or collaborative pianist, and for the novice singer. Each semester you get guided exposure to a different subset of the repertoire, which is indispensable for anyone hoping to go into music. You also get the chance to perform with your peers: as a singer you can be paired with a student pianist, an incredible learning experience for both of you. Don't think you can just coast by, though. You have to learn your music. Lalli will mock you in front of the class, and you will have deserved it!",
    "You learn 6 songs. It's fun. Yes, but be prepared to work."
