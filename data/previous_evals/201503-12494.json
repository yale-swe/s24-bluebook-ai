   "comments": [
    "Spanish 120 was great. I learnt more during this semester than I did for the entirety of high school (4 years of Spanish). Sebastian is a wonderful teacher. He really encourages you to speak in Spanish during class. He, too, will only speak in Spanish (with the small exception of three times during this semester). This certainly helped me become more comfortable with the language not only in speaking\/listening, but also writing and reading.",
    "The course is not an incredibly large amount of work (no more work than a toughish one credit class). There are a lot of assignments and there is work every night (although not a lot) and no curve, but not bad overall. If you take it, I would absolutely take it with professor Daz. He is very helpful, is a good explainer, and cares genuinely about his students.",
    "It was a good class with reasonable amounts of work and testing.",
    "A pretty introductory Spanish class in regards to vocabulary and grammatical concepts, but the entire class is entirely taught in Spanish which was challenging at times. I would recommend this class to another student since it is really helpful helping to build a foundation in Spanish."
