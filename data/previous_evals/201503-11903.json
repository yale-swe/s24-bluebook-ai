   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this class a lot! It's one of those things where you get out what you put in. You could write a story the night before, or work on it for weeks, but what makes a difference, in my opinion, is the improvement you see. It's almost all workshopping of stories, and minimal work on the weeks you aren't submitting your own, which means that it could be a pretty good 5th class, if you're willing to put in the effort for the three stories you write. If you aren't, it's really not worth your time. The benefit of this class for me was definitely to push myself to start writing again. If you don't necessarily need that push, maybe intro fiction isn't the best use of your time. I did love this class, but keep this in mind.",
    "It's a great class. If you like to write, take it. You'll probably get something out of it. It's also a super light reading load becuase you're just reading a few student stories per week, so the workload is very manageable and the writing part is fun.",
    "Good class for anyone who wants to improve their fiction writing in an academic context\/with the added incentive of weekly assignments. I imagine the experience differs significantly between instructors, however, so I'd suggest that interested students with questions should try to find someone who's taken the course with that particular instructor.",
    "If you enjoy creative writing, take this class. Professor Crowley is great, and the class is entirely workshop-based. There isn't a ton of work required, but it allows you to grow and be pushed as a writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Crowley does a great job teaching about what a story is and how to write one, while also giving students a lot of flexibility in their work. It is essentially a workshop. Classes start with mini lecture and then transition into discussion\/feedback about student stories.",
    "It's a course that you should take if you need help developing your fiction, and also if you are interested in seeing what others are working on in a group workshop environment."
