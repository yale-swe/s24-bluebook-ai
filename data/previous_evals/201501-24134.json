    "The HurriPlan in itself is not enough to build a course around. It's not even readings-- it's simply slides, many of which we didn't go over. There was no structure in the readings either-- the fact the professor wanted us to come up with our own readings on Urban Resilience shows how poorly the course was planned. The readings (outside of the HurriPlan) were more around Hurricanes and Emergency Preparedness than actual urban resilience. The assignments were even more unstructured than the readings! The syllabus did not clearly line up what was due when, and many assignments or essential information about assignments were provided last minute. It was up to the class to decide on deadlines, groups, assignments. The TA really didn't do anything either. I felt as though the course name was a misnomer used just to attract students. I also wish that the panel or other parts of the course had someone with a federal gov't perspective (FEMA itself, HUD, etc.).",

    "The course was extremely disorganized and assignments were haphazardly planned. I would get more out of this course if it were structured better.",

    "it fits well with my interest of disaster management and resilience",
    "FES is sorely lacking any courses on resilience, disaster risk reduction, and\/or climate change adaptation so I'm taking any related courses I can get. I was hoping this course would focus more on urban resilience much more comprehensively, but it had only very particular applications - specific to hurricanes, specific to the US, and specific to building and urban planners. I don't plan to be either of those, but was hoping to tackle disaster and climate change management on a greater scale. So I don't feel like this course fits in with my overall goals. Additionally, though we were supposed to produce a deliverable that would help build resilience in the East End neighborhood of Bridgeport, I question how valuable or novel our final product was for this community."
