    "ENAS 151 01 was one of the most enjoyable introductory courses I've taken. There is a lot of material to cover in a short amount of time, but Professor Smooke is the best! If it is a choice between this and MATH 120, take this by all means, even if you're not interested in engineering at all. The quality of instruction and dedication of the teaching staff of ENAS 151 is infinitely better than that of MATH 120. There are nice demonstrations to break up the monotony of a lecture, and just in general, this is a great class. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",
    "The lectures can be a bit hard to follow as they move quickly and Smooke's writing isn't very clear. However, looking through the textbook easily fills in any gaps. The psets are quite long (usually took me ~6-8 hours) but half of the answers are in the back of the book so you can check and they prepare you quite well for the midterm (fair warning: the first midterm is significantly easier than the second). We get formula sheets for the midterms, and he also lets us stay longer if no one finishes in the allotted time which is pretty great. I was deciding between this course and MATH 120 and while I can't speak to what MATH 120 is like (from what I hear, it varies a lot between different TAs), I definitely don't regret my decision.",
    "At the beginning of time there was nothing. And then there was Smooke. Smooke created the earth, the human, the derivative, and the integral. And Smooke taught the human how to use these tools to create a world for itself, so that the human could take the gradient of a function in three space or determine the mass of an irregular shape with an irregular density. But the human did not always understand how to use these tools correctly. For example, sometimes the human took the curl of a function when they wanted to simply find a second derivative. The almighty Smooke did not punish the human for this insolence, but rather took an opportunity to teach the human about its mistake. And so the human lived in general happiness and enjoyed its life. But soon an evil subconscious overtook the human: the want, the craving, the addiction to the Roman numeral. In the time of this odd and strange number system, the mathematics of Smooke was no longer possible. How can one even understand the mathematical world with a number system that tries to be decimal but has multiple base units? Smooke saw the havoc that these so called numerals were causing on the humans. And so he sent down a version of himself in human form. At first the many tried to extinguish the calls of this human-Smooke. But soon a small group of disciples formed around the human-Smooke (who shall henceforth be known as Ookey). Ookey taught the humans about the power of the base ten decimal number system, and its many advantages over the Roman numeral system. He then proceeded to teach his followers about the derivative, the partial derivative, the integral, the double integral, and the triple integral. He prophesied powerful concepts, such as Greens, Gausss, and Stokes theorems. The Romans did not like the trouble that Ookey was causing, so they banished him. But Ookeys words lived on through his disciples. One disciple wrote a book about Smooke himself. It went like this: At first, Smooke created the variable. Smooke saw that the variable was good. Then Smooke created another variable. Again, Smooke saw that this new variable was good. Then Smooke created yet another variable. This variable was even better than the last. And Smooke saw that all variables were good, and so he created an infinite number of them. Another disciple wrote Calculus, 10th Edition, by Howard Anton, Irl C. Bivens, and Stephen Davis. Dear reader, o yee in search of which class to take: look upon the experience, way of life, that ENAS151 is. See MATH120 and see that it is inferior to ENAS151. See the CourseTable ratings and understand that they are the shitty propaganda of the Romans! Take my hand, dear student, and join me on an adventure through the world of multivariable calculus guided by the wonderful mind of Smooke!",
    "you need to take this class if you are looking at it. take ENAS 151 not math120, it is much more easier to understand and it actually makes sense.",
    "i obviously did not take math 120, but from my conversations with peers who did i have surmised i made the right decision. this class actually helped me i my conceptualization of stuff in PHYS 181; i would highly recommend taking this in conjunction with the intro physics sequence, whichever one you're taking, if you're premed or stem or whatever the heck. smooke is a phenomenal professor and will treat you right. if you are a math major, do not take this class you dinkus! there isn't a proof in sight.",
    "I would recommend this course!",
    "Difficult course matter. Requires a lot of time to be put in. But with a great professor and excellent TA, the course is manageable and even fun.",
    "A good class if you need calculus. Not necessarily \"fun\" but it gets the job done and is kind of fun!",
    "If you have to take ENAS 151, try your best to take it with Smooke because he makes it a very fair, straightforward class.",
    "Highly recommend for any stem",
    "Only take it if you need to.",
    "The best way to take multivariable at Yale by far. Avoid Math 120 like the plague.",
    "Take it with Smooke! It's not that bad!",
    "I would recommend ENAS 151 with Smooke. It's about as interesting as any math class gets, because you deal more with applications than with proofs. The material is covered pretty quickly, but because it's efficient rather than cursory. I came away from the class confident that I can apply multivariable calc in a number of different disciplines.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone who has to take multivariable.",
    "A good course for practical multivariable calculus.",
    "Very hard psets, but if you do all of them and review, the tests will be no problem.",
    "It's a very good course. From what I can gather, much better taught than Math 120 and a equivalent replacement. I honestly think this is the best option for a good multivariable course.",
    "Tough material, but if you put in the time and effort you'll do well.",
    "Was really glad I took this class over 120, and take it with Smooke. Be aware that the exams get harder as the semester progresses, but they were always reasonable. Smooke teaches very much from the book, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since it makes it easier to go back and look over lessons. Smooke cares a lot about his students and is very approachable. If the TAs are as good as the ones I had this semester, go to their problem sessions and for help from day one- my TAs were amazing.",
    "ENAS 151 is a good alternative to math 120 if you plan on doing engineering, at least from what I've heard. There are a lot of physics applications that I was not too familiar with, so maybe a background in that would be helpful.",
    "Take this class above 120, but only if Smooke is teaching. The material is difficult (its calc so) but tests and homeworks are fairly graded.",
    "ENAS 151 is a good class to take to learn multivariable calculus. The workload is definitely manageable, but you'll have to be diligent about keeping up with class notes in order to succeed. Tests were difficult but reasonable. Take this class if you need it.",
    "This class as taught by Professor Smooke was as excellent as I imagine multi. calc. could be. I found lectures to be incredibly fascinating for understanding the equations and concepts that we use, though the lectures are not entirely necessary to be able to successfully use the equations(usually). I enjoyed the course material more than Math 115 and Smooke's huge knowledge base of the applications of these topics made learning the material feel much more important and fulfilling. One thing is that if you start the homework late, it is almost guaranteed that you will struggle, so start them early and do a few problems a day and your life will be MUCH easier!",
    "100% better than MATH 120 dear lord",
    "It is multi variable calculus in a lecture hall. I did not like the professors teaching style - writing notes on th board the entire time, that I was never able to catch up to.",
    "Take this over Math 120. The material is still difficult, and you will still struggle, but at least you get real world applications and better explanations. The TAs were wonderful and Smooke is great. Honestly, there's no reason to take 120 if this course is offered and Smooke is teaching. Why are you still questioning ? Trust me on this one.",
    "Professor Smooke's lectures come pretty directly from the textbook, as do the problem sets, as do the general scheme of the test problems. I found the consistency to be very helpful. Tests aren't too tricky, material is very interesting especially if you like visualizing things in three dimensions",
    "I decided to take ENAS 151 after dropping Math 120 the previous semester; for me this was a much better class. The class is taught by a single professor (who also writes and schedules the tests, decides the homework problems, etc.) so the concerns of the class can be adjusted more freely. This course also does have a curve based on the averages of the midterms\/final, which math 120 does not. ENAS 151 also has Professor Smooke, which math 120 does not. He's a great professor, extremely friendly and approachable. There was only an official review session for the final exam, but the TFs held both office hours for conceptual help and problem sessions for homework help three days each week; the TFs stayed well after the designated times for these sessions and were also always willing to schedule individual help sessions, which was an incredibly helpful resource to have. Problem sets were difficult and time consuming, but not impossible, especially if you take advantage of the problem sessions and start earlier in the week. Tests were long and difficult, but Professor Smooke checks in periodically and gives extra time if a decent portion of the class is still working.",
    "The class was a big overall disappointment. Strengths: (1) a strikingly easier alternative to MATH 120. To be honest, this is probably the only genuine strength. (2) Very strong on computational practice so youre good with big numbers and easy problems that are just painfully long and packed. (3) A very very committed and helpful cohort of TAs who were the saving grace of the class. (4) A committed and organized professor who genuinely cares about the class and the students. (5) Occasionally, the lectures would have cool engineering demonstrations, videos and presentations. (6) The class wasnt super stiff and cruel about deadlines and TAs were very understanding with extensions and help with problem sets. Weaknesses: (1) The class didnt really teach me anything substantial in terms of mathematical insights and concepts. I left MATH 115 with a new confidence in my ability to interpret calculus and mathematical problems in general but not ENAS 151. MATH 115 also enabled me to discuss and debate the fundamental math and I was (as an exception) a big fan of the flipped classroom approach (which Professor Smooke and most other ENAS 151 students hated). ENAS 151 was mostly a joke - the problem sets were easy and mechanical, an extensive formula sheet was provided, the exams were not challenging (except the 2nd midterm which was also balanced out by the curve). This is not to say that I aced the class - it is to say that I didnt learn anything (and I did not ace the class). Im not an engineering major and was taking this class to further my mathematical ability but I left with just computational ability to deal with a few engineering problems. (2) The lectures were horrifyingly boring. It was nearly impossible to stay awake during the actual Math content. Most of the time, he would just copy content from the book onto the board\/project it on a screen. Then he would turn his back to us and just write long math problems and solve them. It is not fun or enlightening to watch computational problems solved on the black board. Admittedly, because he went through the entire problem, I felt more prepared for the exams from lecture but it wasnt substantial and felt like teaching to the test. (3) No substantial proofs were explained and there was no emphasis on developing a numerical and mathematical intuition. (4) The class grading was a bit haphazard - the professor should decide early whether the final is cumulative (it wasnt and should have been), how much will each exam matter etc. (5) The exams and problem sets were probably too easy. We really werent challenged and it was possible to do most of the psets in 2-3 hours (max up to 5-6 hours), and the answers were openly discussed in problem set sessions with TAs. (6) The PEER TUTOR TRAGEDY: The peer tutor was paid $1000 in the semester but he never showed up to his office hours and essentially stole money from the department. The professor really shouldve cracked down and asked him to return the money and ascertained that his time sheet calculations were correct. The peer tutor was David (Renhao) Wang."
