    "I have learned so much from this course! I've learned to use the white of the paper to reflect and capture light. I also grown to understand the balance of strong colors and how to let the colors blend into one another.",
    "I refined a lot of watercolor techniques and learned several new ones!",
    "I learned about the styles of important watercolorists and how to apply their techniques to my own work.",
    "I learned a lot about various techniques to utilize when painting watercolors. We also spent time getting to know various famous watercolorists, but I would say the majority of what I learned was painting technique, while the art history component was a survey.",
    "Explored watercolors! lots of different techniques."

    "I honestly see no weaknesses in this course. I loved being able to paint outside and capture the scenes in natural light.",
    "Fantastically structured course, fantastic professor. Even coming in with art experience, I found I learned a great deal, and I loved it. I loved visiting so many spots on campus to paint, and I loved the slideshows of work by famous artists, and I loved Professor Van Women's honest but supportive critiques. He made all of us feel like respected and inspired artists, and the art show at the end of the year was so professional and exciting.",
    "I loved this course. It was such a nice chance to spend some time doing art as a non-Art major and I really appreciated that the course was accessible for painters of various skill levels. I also really enjoyed our time painting outside, though it wasn't really realistic to finish paintings or necessarily even start painting in the hour allotted. I liked that we were encouraged to try various styles, and I thought critiques were helpful and kind. I am also glad that we were able to have private tours of the galleries, which was a really special experience. The multiple paintings a week expected of us were sometimes a little overwhelming especially when I was spending \/ wanted to spend multiple (6-10) hours on each.",
    "It is very relaxing you get an hour art history lecture about certain artists and their techniques then you have an hour of painting time!"

    "Absolutely, this class was amazing. But if you want to really get the most out of it, you cannot be scared to just go for it. I spent too much time worrying about how my paintings would look and I wish I weren't so timid.",
    "Take this class if you have any inclination to do something art related! This class teaches you how to paint watercolor, and it's a really freeing and different experience when compared to most classes at Yale. Professor Van Doren is very engaging and committed to helping students improve through his critiques.",
    "Yes, if you get in you HAVE to take this course! This is one of my favorite courses that I've ever taken at Yale, and Professor Van Doren is the absolute best!",
    "yes absolutely take if you can get in!",
    "YES! Great for artists at all levels :)",
    "Yes! You definitely have to put the time in to complete the paintings and get something out of the course, but I highly recommend this course. I hadn't taken an art class since high school. This course challenged me and was also a lot of fun.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. Take it, and take it immediately, if you can get in. Professor Van Doren is wonderful, and the course is wonderfully structured, and it's a warm and supportive and inspiring environment in which to make art. You visit locations all around campus to paint, and you also see slideshows of work by famous artists of the past. I can't recommend this course enough.",
    "YES, such a great fun class!",
    "If you can get into this course, absolutely take it! The course is open to students of all skill levels. You will have a wonderful time learning the art form and will be provided with high quality supplies to get you started, for which I am hugely grateful. Professor Van Doren was always helpful and available to meet personally, which will help you grow as an artist and develop a talent you can keep up forever! At the end of the course and during the final reception you will look back at your work and be amazed how far you have come. It does take a decent amount of time to keep up with the paintings, but it is enjoyable. Take it!",
    "Yes! Learn to paint its fun and rewarding."
