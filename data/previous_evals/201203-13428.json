   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 20 to another student as an excellent way to learn about academic writing in different contexts, inclusive of literature, culture, history, science....I would summarize it as a course with personal approach, in a small group of people, where individual skills are dynamically developed through interaction with fellow students and the professor.",
    "English 114 in general allows you improve your writing technique from the brainstorming to the final piece. Section 20 in particular used to idea of smell in society to explore varying opinions about and research on smell, which is a very marginalized sense as compared to the others. The readings let us discuss claims that pertained to smell, and caused us to think about smell in ways we had never done before. It was very interesting!",
    "I LOVED the class. It really takes you from that point of writing great high-school essays to writing real academic papers. And I real feel that the professor you have makes a huge difference. A lot of my friends in other sections complained about their teachers, but Carolyn Sinsky was absolutely wonderful. She's so nice, gives you so much feedback on all your essays (before and after you turn them in), and she's great at getting you and your classmates to effectively help each other.",
    "Although English 114 is primarily a writing course, choosing a topic you are interested in will determine whether you like this course or not. English 114 20 is Smells and was very intriguing. The reading was of a wide variety ranging from fiction to science research. It gave a very comprehensive understanding of the sense of smell and why it is so ephemeral and primal. If you're not sold by your interest in this subject, take this section, because Carolyn Sinksy is an amazing instructor. It is evident that she put a lot of prior time and thought into preparing this course. If you've ever been to a writing partner, she is just as great or even better than one. Just speaking with her for a few minutes always gives me a very good sense of direction in which I should go. There are four main papers for this course, one of which is a 10-12 page research paper. After each one is turned in Carolyn spends a considerable amount of time reading and understanding the paper. She puts a lot of thought in pointing out what was successful and suggesting areas for improvement as well as ways to improve. The methods and way she taught us to approach the college paper has been very helpful and these skills will prepare me for further college level courses.",
    "I highly recommend English 114 for Yale freshmen. It is great to learn how to write for Yale, improve your writing and meet fellow freshmen!",
    "It was a great class with an interesting topic! You don't think Smell is so in-depth with so many readings, but its actually quite interesting. I learned a lot about things I didn't know beforehand. The essays were do-able, because Carolyn helped us through, making step-by-step processes so we wouldn't be overwhelmed with the work. It was actually fun writing the essays! Take the course! You'll learn a lot about writing in a really quirky way.",
    "The course was much different than I was expecting. But different is a good thing because, in this case, it means beyond expectations. We delved much deeper into scent than I thought possible. Originally, I was expecting to just learn how to write about scents. I did that, true, but I also learned, analyzed, debated, and discovered the social implications, science, history, literature, and more of scent. Beyond this, it is fundamentally a writing course. I was pushed further into my writing more than ever. I also was taught some new tricks of the trade and granted a clearer understanding of complex constructs. Overall, it was very enjoyable and I foresee it to be useful in both my academic and life career."
