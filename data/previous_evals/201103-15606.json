   "comments": [
    "A disorganized course, but if you want a basic course on India's economy take this.",
    "lecture is good, but choose TA wisely",
    "A good course on the economic development of India over the last 20 years, as well as on policy implications for its future. Besides the insights Professor Mohan can bring to bear from his personal experience, it doesn't offer a ton beyond what you can get from books and\/or news.",
    "A wonderful survey of India's development trajectory since the reform era.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the country, its an extremely fascinating subject because there is a lot going on with respect to the economy.",
    "This was an interesting course from a guy who knew what he was talking about. The first part of the course, focused on India's economic history, is somewhat boring and soporific, but it's worth knowing to understand how India's economy today functions (in many ways, it's still bound by laws that are half a century old!)There really should've been a lecture on political context, though. I really don't know my way around India's democratic socialist political system or parties, and I kind of had to learn and form aweak impression as I went along. Professor Mohan may have been a technocrat, but now that he's retired from that life, I don't think he should be afraid to let his opinions be known in our class.It would've been nice if the lectures had been more organized, though, or some background was given for some of them (still not sure I know the significance of a capital or current account, or if they're actual accounts or what). We covered all of material, but we really didn't follow the slides that well, so you have to listen and take notes from that.",
    "This class delves into issues of economics on as important of a level as can ever be explained. How do you bring MILLIONS of people out of misery and poverty into happiness and material security? How do you reform a broken system that breaks the entrepreneurial spirit time after time? These are general questions, but the class breaks down into sections of the Indian economy that help contextual the arbitrary economics education we receive with models and statistics in various other classes.Also, there are a number of very-educated people FROM India in the class that are likely to be in your section. Talking to them about the development of their country is also VERY useful for learning in section also.",
    "This is a great class. It goes into all the issues in India, it's great to have someone who was inside the government at that time teaching the course. The reading isn't that bad though some of it is dense. Overall though, I really enjoyed it.",
    "Take it because you will enjoy learning!",
    "The class is well structured and if you keep up with it, you will come away learning a lot about India's economy. However, the expectations for the class are high so the grading and the workload is a bit on the tougher side. But, it's an excellent course overall.",
    "I think that lectures were boring and straight from the readings. Professor Mohan needs to make lectures more stimulating by using more AV. Also the reading assigned for each lecture was too much and should be shortened. Midterm paper topics should be released earlier because students are under a lot of pressure at that time and may want to start on these papers beforehand. Think twice before you take the class as you can get the same knowledge by just reading Panagariyas book.",
    "I would say be wary about why you are taking this class. If you are really interested in India and its economics, look around for other classes first and make sure this syllabus has been amended. However, to be fair, this class definitely has a great overview of the entire growth story.",
    "By all means",
    "If you want a great overview of the Indian economy, broad as well as deep, this is the class for you."
