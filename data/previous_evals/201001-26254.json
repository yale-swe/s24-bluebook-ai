   "comments": [
    "Excellent course on microeconomics. Very targeted to the needs of the health care professional.",
    "Difficult if you have never taken an econ course before. I wish there was more instruction on how to do the homework assignments themselves, in addition to the theory that was discussed more often.",
    "I thought the material in this course was presented very well. It was relevant to our other coursework, there were many examples to help make issues tangible and showed the value of economics in a larger context. I thought that the course should have contained more algebra\/numbers as we should really be getting used to more quantitive requirements.My major issue is with the difficulty and breadth of the course. I thought that the course should have moved faster, required more math out of us and gotten into more complex issues. I have taken some econ in the past but never a microeconomics specific course, most have covered some topics in micro and some in macro. This course did not present any topics that were completely alien to me although it did help me understand some I had learned several years ago. At the graduate level I would have expected examinations to be more difficult and for us to cover more topics in a more quantitative fashion.",
    "Very well organized",
    "Great course and professor.",
    "Strengths: Great professor and course content. The professor provides the students with very practical information related to the healthcare field. I had never taken an economics course before and was afraid that I would not understand the material, but Dr. Fletcher is very clear and effective in his teaching methods.Weakness: Office hours should not be on the same day as lecture for (both professor and TA). I did not have time to start the problem set after lecture and to come see the professor\/TA for office before the end of the day as well.",
    "I did not take this course.",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester, hands down. It's too bad Dr. Fletcher is leaving for the next two years, because he really made this course and made the material. Overall, highly recommend to all policy and management and anyone else who is looking to expand their skill set into the field of economics.",
    "While it was a bit too theoretical for me I enjoyed some aspects of it.",
    "Great course -- Professor Fletcher made microeconomics very accessible and interesting! He was always available for questions.",
    "The course taught the primary concepts of microeconomics. The lectures did not correspond to the weekly homework assignments fairly often, which was a frustrating aspect of the course.",
    "The office hours were not flexible enough. I don't see why both the professor's and TA's office hours should hold on the same day. This made me unable to attend any of the office hours.",
    "The topics are relevant to our profession and the pace is reasonable. I enjoyed learning about Micro but it was just an average class - nothing too exciting or memorable.Also, please pick one or two books. If you pick three books (which I don't think should be an option), at the very least pick entire chapters to read. Don't just pick small sections to read in three separate books - it's annoying and actually discourages reading.I do want to comment on how organized his v2 site is, though. There isn't any excess material (some professors post a million resources).",
    "This course is not taught in an intimidating manner. The professor and the TA are extremely very helpful. The exams are not very difficult and by the time you take them, you would be prepared.",
    "The course was a great introduction to microeconomics - it did a nice job of balancing the fundamentals with applied examples. I think I do better learning with algebra than graphs but that's just a personal preference.",
    "This class covers a lot of material very quickly, and for someone like me who was totally new to economics, a little too quickly. That said, it was well organized, the powerpoint slides were always posted before class (thank you!).The homework was often confusing (thank God it was credit\/no credit) and was nearly impossible to complete by using the lecture notes. It contained problems we were never shown, step-by-step, how to do. I learned more from reading the homework keys; the assignments had seemingly nothing to do with the lectures.",
    "The regular homework assignments were a strength. Sometimes the journal-based readings seemed excessive as I was just trying to understand the textbook-based elements of the class some of the time and not ready for the \"applied\" journal readings yet.",
    "The wealth of content in this course could have been better absorbed over two sessions per week rather than one. Individuals with prior microecon or finance experience could have placed out of this course to allow novice social science majors to benefit.The text and readings were interesting and I plan to revisit them with pleasure.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "I would diversify the types of assignments given. For instance, place less weight on final and assign a group project or individual paper. Take home final, short answer, apply-your-knowledge final may be more useful.Go over homeworks IN CLASS to better understand the material. Often times, the HW assignments did not directly align with what was taught in class, and discussing these assignments in class would have been useful to my learning.",
    "great breadth of microecon topics covered, easy to follow lectures, very useful for all levels of econ knowledge",
    "This course is a solid overview of microeconomic principles in the field of healthcare delivery. A lot is covered each week, so close attention is important, but the lectures are posted online for easy review.",
    "Overall good basic microeconomics course with a health spin.",
    "It provides students with some economic background and way of thinking and link the microeconomics with health care.",
    "Very good class, nice overview of the basics of microeconomics."

    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0I thought professor Fletcher did a good job of explaining concepts and keeping them relavent to our other studies. He was well prepared for class and presented us with materials we could read outside of class for further understandings. He was accessible for office hours and he and I spoke on several occasions.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Great guy",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Good preparation of the materials",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Very attentive to students' feedback in class. His exams are very fair.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0All positive. He is a clear, concise, no nonsense instructor. I found his class very enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0I thought he was good. The homework, lectures and tests all seemed a little disjointed; I learned mostly from studing old tests.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Professor Fletcher made microeconomics very accessible and interesting! He was always available for questions.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Jason Fletcher is very nice person and it was a pleasure to take his class. However, he did not necessarily explain concepts ver well. Rabya (the TA) could often explain things in a more clear and coherent manner than Jason did.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Dr Fletcher, is a fair professor. Puts effort to make his students learn. Exams were fair enough",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0He's nice and knowledgeable, but not particularly exciting.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0The instructor was great - I thought he explained concepts very clearly and did a nice job of engaging the class.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Decent instructor-- organized, answered questions effectively (usually with \"that's outside the scope of this course\") and good lecturer.My only complaint was that the course had changed and so the study materials we had for the midterm\/final were very different than ours, so I spent time studying the wrong thing...",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Jason was great - very clear with regards to his expectations and the homeworks were very helpful. I also felt like I knew what to expect on the midterm and final exam. His reviews were helpful. He was extremely clear when he answered questions in class. He always took the time to answer questions when people needed things clarified. His examples were great. I liked how he was able to tie things to healthcare when people asked about examples of how elements of microecon applied in the healthcare setting.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0I have a hard time evaluating Fletcher because I think he did a wonderful job, engaging with the class, presenting material well, at a fast pace, but I still cannot answer microecon questions confidently. I understand the concepts and I can perform math problems (outside of this class) easily, therefore I am confused as to why I didn't grasp Microecon with as much gusto as usual. I worry that this is reflective of Fletcher but I cannot illuminate why.Strengths: Fletcher was always in his office with the door open! This is wonderful since so many other professors do not practice the same open-door policy.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Jason was excellent in lecture, very clear, and easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Instructor was very energetic, showed a genuine excitement in the material, and tried to clear up any questions students would ask in class.However, there was a general disconnect between lecture slides, HW assignments, and exams. Connecting these in class would have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Jason was great! did an especailly good job of asnwering questions in-class",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Jason was good. He was very well organized to handle a very large class.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Dr. Fletcher is a very good instructor and the lecture is very informative. In order for us to remember better, he sometimes plays a game in the classroom. I hope he could upload the lecture slides a bit earlier in the future so that we have enough time to preview and print them out.",
    "Instructor: Jason Michael Fletcher \u00a0Very good and kind instructor. Generous with his time and very energetic in teaching students."

So I studied for the midterm, only to discover that there were none of those types of questions on the midterm. I studied completely the wrong thing and didn't do well on the midterm thanks to that session. But I did learn some.",
    "Rabya was a great TA. She provided great feedback on the homeworks and led an AWESOME review sessionfor the midterm. I wish we had one with Rabya again for the final!",
    "She was invaluable to me. Wherever I was confused with class, problems or concepts, she described it perfectly. I needed only 1 session with her to understand 3 classes. Her mastery appears to be reflective of prior experience with Economics, therefore YSPH would benefit from investing in more students\/fellows with similar backgrounds.",

I wish that there were more classes that had this impact on the rest of our studies, I wish that there were more economics courses offered and I wish that Professor Fletcher was not headed to Columbia University next year.",
    "Good",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course for any student in the MPH track. Economics is knowledge that you should know in general, and this course is a great class to attend and learn from.",
    "Highly recommended for all. Great class.",
    "The course provides students with a sound foundation in the concepts of microeconomics.",
    "A requirement for Health Policy concentration, except you can waive out of it.",
    "This course contains relevant and important information, but theclass itself is not particularly memorable or exciting. Read a book on your own to supplement the material and study weekly so each week truly builds on the last.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course - it covers the main topics we need to know as health care professionals without delving too much into the weeds",
    "Yes, it's a decent microeconomics overview, if a little too fast. It only sort of has to do with healthcare, which is good.",
    "Definitely would recommend to other students who would like a background in microecon in healthcare. Jason was great!",
    "A great and helpful course.",
    "This course is very good overview of microeconomics in health care setting. I learned a lot about economics term and concepts that are useful in understanding some of the public health literatures that deal with cost-effective analyses.",
    "will cover the basics of microecon and ties nicely with SOM classes and methods",
    "Overall good course. A bit large for a master's level course but since it was a somewhat introductory course it was fine.",
    "It's a very good course for someone has little economic background.",
    "Good overview of microeconomics if you haven't covered this material before. I would recommend the class."
