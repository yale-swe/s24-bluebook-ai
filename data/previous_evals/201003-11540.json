    "Question 9: Lab work (with the exception of the \"wood lab\" at the end of the semester) was available to students on an individual basis. I feel that more lab work (microscopy, for example) should be required of all students.",
    "Content is good to know, but learning it can be a challenge. Professor Berlyn knows everything and is a wonderful resource. That said, lectures can be a little obtuse and sometimes lack efficiency.",
    "Question 1: The readings for this course were roughly outlined in the syllabus, but the instructor did not provide enough guidance as to what readings to do when. Many of us were coming at the material from very different backgrounds and it would have been nice to spend 2 minutes per class discussing what readings would be helpful and relevant to what lecture. As it was, I felt lost in trying to decide what readings I should have prepared for the next lecture.Question 9: I think Brent and Graeme needed to better communicate about the nature, breadth and scope of the lab exercises. The lab exercises were very useful, but could have been better connected to the lecture material.",
    "1) For those who don't have previous botany background I highly recommend obtaining a basic botany text to read to accompany the course material and to use to prepare for exams. The main, recommended texts are at a level that can be difficult for those who don't have background.2) Unfortunately, most of the time I didn't know what topic we would be covering next in lectures and wasn't able to do reading ahead of time, which would have improved my ability to follow along in class.3) Wish I had started writing the paper earlier because I enjoyed the topic and would have liked to spend more time learning about it\/producing a well-crafted document.5) I think students were intimidated and not willing to provide suggestions, so it was hard to judge responsiveness because everyone was predominantly quiet and meek.9) Would have loved the opportunity to step out into the Marsh Botanical Garden or Farnham Gardens to related live plants to the topics discussed or look at some specimens in the lab."

    "The material covered was extremely interesting and covered in great detail.",
    "Professor Berlyn",
    "The vast amount of knowledge which came out during each lecture. It was often difficult to keep up with all the facts and interesting information.",
    "Graeme's lecture style was the best part of this course. He makes the lectures fun by peppering them with useful anecdotes. His overheads, while somewhat antiquated, represent a wealth of information that is unavailable anywhere else and I feel privileged to have been exposed to them.",
    "the concepts are incredibly relevant to my interests.",
    "1) This is critical material that is fundamentally fascinating and provides an important foundation.2) The oppotunity to take a class with a reknowned professor with an incredible Yale history.3) Pre midterm and final exam review sessions run by the TA.4) Lecture that explained the phenomenon of fall leaf colors and the process of leaf abscission."

   "comments": [
    "More required laboratory work.",
    "Making sure content is organized in an efficient, learner friendly format.",
    "The lecture notes need to be a bit more organised.",
    "I think the class could benefit from a few review sessions during the beginning or end of class after a difficult topic has been covered.",
    "The readings and the lectures need to correspond to one another in a more coherent way.The structure for choosing and then researching term papers could also use improvement. I enjoyed our final class where we presented the work we had been doing. However, I was unimpressed that many of my classmates had chosen topics that I found to be largely unrelated to our coursework. The term paper was a great opportunity to delve deeper into something from the class and I do not think that all the papers presented did this in a meaningfulway.",
    "the professor assumes a great amount of prior knowledge, and given the absence of prerequisites, the level at which he starts is unreasonably high. he should spend more time adequatly covering the fundamentals so that all students are at a decent starting point.",
    "1) Informing students what topic will be covered in the next lecture.2) Providing more feedback on the midterm so that it is apparent how to improve performance for the final exam.3) Amount of lab\/field time.4) Starting out with the fundamentals when introducing a new topic in lecture. Often things jump too quickly to the advanced aspects of the concept and this is often hard to follow if only because of the amount of vocabulary that needs to be learned."

I visited him in his office and in the Greeley kitchen a number of times for clarification. He is also very prompt in his email responses about paper topics and suggested readings.Brent did an excellent job. He set up a plethora of review sessions and was also very helpful in helping me select a term paper topic.",
    "very prompt and responsive.",
    "The TA did a good job offering and running review sessions before both the midterm and the final exam. This was critical.No additional out of class assistance was requested of the professor, although I should have."

    "This course is central to my program (studying the physiology of plants), and without it I would be severely disadvantaged. This course is vital for any would-be forester\/botanist, and is an excellent asset to those who are not seeking these career paths as well.",
    "Have to know about trees if you want to grow\/manage them.",

    "I want to manage forests and this course provided me with sound understanding for the structure of trees and how they got to be the way they are. Much of the material we covered (response to physiological\/environmental stress, reproduction, growth patterns etc.) has profound implications for management and Graeme subtly made this point again and again and I think he is correct.",

    "I am insterested in the topic.",
    "I do not have a background in the biological sciences and so this course was very helpful to me. Also, I was very excited to take a course with Graeme because he represents such a wealth of information regarding not only trees and how they work, but also the history and mission of FES.",

    "1. Be prepared for overheads- they initially seem cumbersome and antiquated, but they are actually quite effective and represent 50 years of top-notch learning and investigation.2. Get to know Graeme and the TA- both are very accessible, Graeme especially. He is always willing to discuss any topic. He has done work in so many fields that he is amazingly conversant and insightful in pretty much anything you are working on in your studies.3. Purchase the textbook- it is a keeper.4. Type your examinations.",
    "1) Get a basic botany text and do relevant reading before the lecture.2) Attend the TA run review sessions.3) Have the gumption to ask for the professor's assistance outside of class, especially for feedback on the midterm if it isn't clear how to do better.4) Start the end of term paper before Thanksgiving break.5) Talk to students who took the class the previous year and take their advice to heart."
