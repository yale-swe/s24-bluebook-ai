   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the different areas of CP as a subfield, and its development over time. Methodologically, I have become much more aware of the research design challenges involved when studying history and historical legacies in particular.",
    "The course was a good introduction to the canonical works in Comparative Politics and its assignments were an important primer on what to expect + things to think about for the upcoming field exam.",
    "A command of the basic themes and problems in the field of comparative politics.",
    "i got an amazing overview of CP topics.",
    "I acquired a whole lot of knowledge on a range of important topics in the Comparative Politics sub-field such as party systems, democracy and development, dictatorship, ethnic politics, civil war, state formation and state capacity among others.",
    "Greater knowledge of the key debates in Comparative Politics, and some of the landmark texts and arguments in them. Practice in the ability to research and present (relatively) short arguments in essay form on topics that were broadly unfamiliar from other parts of the sub-field.",
    "Exposure to some of the most important works in comparative politics. Refined skills for evaluating (both substantive and methodological) different types of scholarship.",
    "I developed a fundamental basis of the themes in comparative politics and a understanding of the missing variables even in some great works.",
    "A much better handle on the major debates in CP as well as some of the challenges inherent in studying CP.",
    "Learned about the core topics in comparative politics and engaged with many of the canonical readings in the subfield; benefited from regular writing assignments, some of which were designed to simulate a response to a qualifying examination question"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked that the course gave us a good overview of the subfield, including some of the classic readings. For improvements, I was not a big fan of the assignments consisting exclusively of exam-type essay questions. That is good to practice, but the marginal returns diminish after a few of them and it would have been nice to do a research-focused assignment as well. Another minor point is that class discussions often revolved more around criticism than around thinking about how research could be improved\/moved forward, though we occasionally did the latter as well.",
    "Strengths: A reading of the classics and key works in contemporary literature was as interesting as it was important. Its arrangement by theme and the use of the CP Handbook for an overview along with important chapters from these works was effective because it allowed students to get into the details of important work while maintaining a sense of the larger picture. We were under the guidance of a very engaging instructor who was able to draw out effective comparisons, concerns and questions for discussion from the assigned literature. Weaknesses: Though we were given the essay writing assignment twice, the expectations from these assignments were slightly vague\/ spread out. It would be nice to have one week's session dedicated to learning what is expected + best strategies to go about answering long essay questions, as it would be directly helpful for the field exam.",
    "I found Professor Wilkinson to be a great teacher and I think he led the discussions very well.",
    "Strengths of the course: (1) It familiarized students with a lot of the important literature in Comparative Politics, (2) Besides being familiar with the literature, the class discussions were helpful in evaluating competing arguments against one another, (3) The assignments (essays) provided good practice for writing and developing one's own original argument. I can't really think of any weaknesses, except, I wish there was more time during the classes to discuss the essays, as that could further enhance learning and help us improve!",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and would struggle to think of improvements.",
    "Prof. Wilkinson is an excellent teacher. He is extremely knowledgable, friendly, and facilitates class discussion effectively. Some of the topics on the syllabus were quite dull and seemed redundant (e.g. varieties of capitalism).",
    "The strength is Professor Wilkinson's knowledge and engaging understanding of the literature. It could have been improved with slightly more lecture and guidance. I would have liked to hear more in-depth analysis in the discussions.",
    "Our class discussions were very interesting, and often went in directions I didn't initially suspect. For the most part, I really enjoyed them, but perhaps the only downside was that sometimes they meandered a bit and did not let us get to all the issues raised in the reading. Still, I'm not sure I would suggest any changes.",
    "Strengths: clear, well-organized course; discussion was well-structured; readings were often engaging Weaknesses: course could have included more portions of the books on the CP reading list and fewer review essays from the Oxford edited volume"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they are interested in studying anything relating to CP it is a very useful overview.",
    "Yes - it is an important as well as interesting part of the CP sequence that engages deeply with the literature and primes students for the field exam.",
    "I will recommend this course to students who intend to take the comprehensive exam in comparative politics.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student. This course is designed to ensure that you are familiar with all the influential scholarly works in the Comparative Politics sub-field. The course is heavy on reading and you will have immense intellectual gains! The course also required writing three short essays and two long (exam-type) essays and those, I believe were quite helpful in preparation of the Comparative Politics field exam.",
    "Yes. It is an excellent survey for anyone wanting to orient themselves in one course with a broad overview of comparative politics.",
    "Yes, it is a must for any PhD student interested in the comparative politics track.",
    "Yes, especially for anyone who would like to work in or critique comparative politics work.",
    "Absolutely",
    "It's a great way to engage with core works in comparative politics and prepare for the CP qualifying exam."
