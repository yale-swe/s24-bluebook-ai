    "Absolutely yes. Shiri is wonderful and the material is virtually all interesting. This was a very low-stress class, but I learned so much, and really enjoyed it. I'm now considering a Judaic Studies double major because of this class. This is one of Yale's hidden gems. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Goren is wonderful and the course offers a really interesting perpective on Israeli culture through a combination of literary and scholarly texts as well as Israeli movies and TV shows. And professor Goren",
    "If you're looking for a humanities course where you watch great movies and TV shows, read good books, and have good discussions about them definitely take it. If you're looking to learn about Israel more historically and fact-based, this isn't the class for that, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't take it anyway. The workload isn't bad at all, everything you read or watch you wouldn't mind doing anyway (and in most cases are very glad you were exposed to), and most importantly, Shiri is wonderful. If you want to do any film or literature analysis, or learn about Israel from the inside, take it.",
    "I would recommend this course for other students. There's not that much work but you learn a lot, the reading is interesting and the class discussions are fun. The teacher is also great, and if this interests you at all, definitely,definitely at least shop it.",
    "Take a class with professor Goren, this one or another one, she's great!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone looking to expand their knowledgeof Israel beyond the headlines. For sheer engagement and variety, it's an unusually good class.",
    "Take it!! If you are even slightly interesting in the content of this class, take it! Shiri is such a wonderful professor to get to know. She is so so genuinely kind and wants all her students to do really well! I learned so much about how Israeli culture has evolved over the past few decades. Do note that this is not a history class, however, I did still learn a lot about the key events (and also other more tangential undertones ) through Israeli history. Part of what makes this class great, is that you are learning the history through books and movies that were written at or about the time period, so it is through character perspective and therefore much more meaningful.In a nutshell, for this class you will read a variety of novels and some short primary source articles from a course packet and also watch a handful of movies. You will write a few short response papers as well as a midterm and final paper (all very manageable). Also, at the beginning of each class, one of the students presents a few current events from Israeli news sources which is great for keeping you up to date about Israeli happenings.If you do take this class, try and go to office hour. Shiri is so sweet and you will definitely have a sweet conversation with her. She will also obviously be really helpful about whatever you're working on."
