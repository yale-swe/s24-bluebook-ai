    "This course covers Latin grammar. The textbook is a little strange, but the teachers know what to do with it. This course is a great introduction to Latin, although it is intended to be taken as the first step of learning Latin. I would only recommend this to those who intend to continue with Latin afterwards.",
    "yes, if they are willing to put in the effort",
    "Latin 110 was a great class to gain the basics of Latin as somebody who had never taken a class or really encountered the language before. For somebody wanting to start the language, I would definitely recommend the class. Coming out of the first semester, I know all the verb conjugations and noun declensions and a lot of grammar. Furthermore, I can apply my skills to real-life(ish) situations i.e. reading inscriptions on statues and translating the text of songs. At the end of the course, I was astounded by how much I had learned.",
    "If you want to learn Latin, Yale's Latin department is a fantastic place to learn it. The only question to ask is, do I want to learn Latin? What's the value to learning this \"dead\" language?",
    "Absolutely! A wonderful language, and Tom was a great teacher. You can read real Roman pieces by the end of the semester (albeit with the help of a dictionary).",
    "I would recommend it if you are ok with the work.",
    "It's a great class anyone should take if they have never learned Latin before. Latin's very structured and grammatically complex; so it could take a little getting used to for disorganized minds."
