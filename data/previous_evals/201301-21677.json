   "comments": [
    "The course was a very thorough introduction to music theory. It moves at a quick pace assignments can be somewhat tedious, but if you're willing to put the work in, it's very rewarding. Professor Bartal is also very enthusiastic and approachable.",
    "If you have no background in Music, then I do not recommend taking this class.",
    "I went in without knowing anything about music, and came out able to read and even recognize the chord progressions of a real piece of music. Fast-paced but not too hard. My instructor put a lot of emphasis on ear training, which is helpful in a way. But it will probably take more time than just in-class training to really recognize the intervals\/triads etc.. There will probably be people who play piano\/sing in an a cappella\/already know half of the course in this class, but as long as you do the work, however slowly at first, you will be fine.",
    "This course is really interesting and great for musicians who want to learn theory and anyone who wants to improve their fluency with sheet music and understand the function behind a lot of things. I took this course with no formal background in music. I do not play an instrument nor do I read sheet music. This course was significantly more difficult for me. Some sections require the homework, some do not. If the homework is required, it is super time intensive (starting with no background, I spent 2-4 hours on each homework set). If you do have a background in music, the first half of the class is probably pretty easy, especially if you're fluent with scales and arpeggios. Most of my friends who knew music and took the class thought it was simple and straightforward. I thought this was a really hard work intensive class that was like an intensive foreign language for me. Your class experience will depend on your background knowledge and which teacher you have.",
    "Take it. It's fun."
