   "comments": [
    "Introduction to Classical Mechanics. Yes.",
    "It was a very good course in graduate level classical mechanics, but unless you're a physics graduate student it doesn't make much sense to take it.",
    "Nearly the same material I learned in 2 semesters in undergrad, with a different approach occasionally (i.e. explaining canonical transformations from a simplectic approach). I'd recommend the course if the student wanted a review of classical mechanics.",
    "If one can test out of this class, I would not recommend taking it. I learned very little that I already didn't know form undergrad.",
    "Physics 500 is one of the core courses of physics and is an important piece of the foundation on which other topics rely. I would suggest taking the course and not passing out unless you have already taken a graduate level classical mechanics course and a reputable institution. Otherwise your knowledge will likely have holes in it and your foundation will not be as strong.",
    "Classical mechanics A to Z.",
    "I would reccoment Phy500 to an other student because it is a comprehensive course of classical mechanics.",
    "I would recommend physics 500 to a fellow student. It's great to see mechanics at this level because of its relation to quantum, stat mech, etc.",
    "Yes it's an important core course.",
    "A required course in CM.",
    "The course is a very well done overview on classical mechanics. I would definitely recommend this course because it gives you a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts in physics.",
    "It covers graduate classical mechanics. Besides being a requirement, I found it quite useful, and it provides a very strong foundation for further topics.",
    "I would recommend Physics 500 to other students."

   "comments": [
    "It introduced me to more advanced topics in Classical Mechanics which are not covered in the undergraduate courses.",
    "We did learn a handful of techniques that could be helpful in some fields of physics, but most topics only had weak applications. That said, it's still an important course to take as a physics graduate student, the work is an important foundation upon which more sophisticated techniques and topics are built.",
    "Classical mechanics absolutely adds to my knowledge of physics and shows how the field developed in the 1920's with the addition of quantum mechanics. I doubt this course will help with my dissertation\/research, however.",
    "Not much, honestly. Not many of us will use classical mechanics in their research.",
    "It really helped me with hamiltonian dynamics and Hamilton Jacobi theory. these were topics that I had not really seen before at an in depth level.",
    "I think it was very helpful for the Qual, but I might not use any of the topics of the class for my dissetation.",
    "I've learned a lot about classical mechanics. This course has given me a broader perspective of physics, how it has evolved and it's relation to quantum mechanics.",
    "Yes it would be very important in my research.",
    "I learned more deeply some concepts in classical mechanics, especially the connection to quantum mechanics through the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. It's hard to say that it did contribute to my research because it's a general course.",
    "It ensures a strong foundation for any further research.",
    "Besides providing preparation for the qualify exam I don't see how this course will help prepare me for my research. Classical mechanics is theoretically important, but not too applicable to what I do.",
    "Most of the material was familiar to me, but it was a nice refresher.",
    "Classical Mechanics will probably not be used directly in the research that I will do but the detailed explanation of Hamilton's equations and the Hamilton Jacobi equation helped me understand the parallels andcrossover between quantum and classical mechanics."
