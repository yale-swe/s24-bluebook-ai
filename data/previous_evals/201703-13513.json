    "An understanding of what agroforestry is and its impacts on climate mitigation and carbon sequestration.",
    "I learned a lot about carbon-sequestering agriculture practices and their potential in this course. The course empowered me with a much deeper understanding of the role of agriculture in climate change mitigation, introduced me to the old and new practices available to agroforesters, and presented me with many inspiring examples of organizations and role models.",
    "Broad-scale overview of topics around agro-forestry.",
    "Practical overview of what techniques can be used in carbon-sequestration using agroforestry and what the environmental and economic considerations for these techniques are as a practitioner.",
    "The content of the course was excellent. I really enjoyed learning on different types of crops and their carbon sequestration potential. The examples and case studies presented in the course were from different parts of the world, which gave me a global perspective on the application of different techniques. I developed technical skills that where applied in the team exercises, for example, the design of an agroforestry business.",
    "Wonderful class- feel competent in my understanding of Agroforestry.",
    "Broad understanding of the different plants and systems available worldwide for \"carbon farming\" - built understanding and awareness of the issues, processes, concepts within the field.",
    "This was a great opportunity to learn about the opportunities and obstacles to global agroforestry uptake.",
    "Thinking about agroforestry from a truly intersectional lens.",
    "I gained a wide range of information about different types of carbon farming, agroforestry techniques for different environments, new and possible developments in the agriculture industry, and opportunities and challenges for agriculture in a changing climate.",
    "I gained a broad overview of major issues in and around sustainable agriculture\/agroforestry.",
    "I became more familiar with the different techniques of agroforestry systems, as well as with their respective impacts in terms of CO2.",
    "Introduction to significant amount of information relevant to my interests."

   "comments": [
    "Well",
    "I thought the class terrific. It exceeded my expectations.",
    "Met expectations.",
    "They aligned closely with my expectations, although I would have liked the class to include more opportunities for students to contribute through sharing their experiences or discussing topics during lecture.",
    "The class exceeded my expectations. I was expecting a very technical course, but the practical style of the professor and the field trip gave the course the perfect balance between theory and practice.",
    "Yes, I gained a stronger understanding of agroforestry and was given the time and guidance to pursue my own specific interests within that field.",
    "Aligned very well with the skills that I had intended to gain from this class.",
    "Well",
    "I expected to learn mostly about carbon and offsets, but thankfully, the course had so much more.",
    "The knowledge I gained aligned pretty well with my expectations. It was a bit more of a generalized survey course than I had expected.",
    "The knowledge was a bit more broad rather than going into some of the science and ecology about agroforestry systems.",
    "The theoretical part was very targeted and comprehensive. The field trip that Eric organized at the end of the course was extremely helpful. I heard that normally the course had a field trip to Mexico, but considering Eric's life-situation, it is perfectly understandable that the field trip was less immersive than other years.",
    "It met my expectations as a thorough introduction to the topic. I had a great experience in this class."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: textbook, material, professor Weakness: PowerPoint slides. There was often too much information, too many details, which made it hard to take notes. They could be simplified and streamlined. Also, I felt like I would have liked a bit more context with every lecture. Sometimes we jumped right in and it was confusing to be discussing so many little details. I would have appreciated the opportunity to take a step back and consider the main point rather than focus on the little details.",
    "Eric Toensmeier's inspiring example, deep knowledge and competence, and contagious enthusiasm for the beauty and importance of his life's work is the greatest strength of this class. I found hearing him speak each Tuesday night both informative and inspiring.",
    "I have tons of respect for Eric- he walks the talk! He's knowledgeable about so many things in the agroforestry space. Very happy to have been pushed to write that final paper (as much of a hassle it was!). Thats a really valuable experience. Weaknesses: I would have loved the opportunity for more student discussion around these topics. For example, in discussing the value of meat-eating and grazing practices, it could have been interesting for the class to have a prepared debate, where teams on either side would read up on materials to support their stance and then have a fact-based debate. I also question the value of the modeling exercises: I would have preferred that academic studies were assigned as readings (grazing, value of woody perennials for carbon-sequestration, financing mechanisms- case reports on land leases\/payment for ecosystem services\/etc) with more time allotted for discussion at the beginning of class (and maybe even cold-calling for student-accountability).",
    "Strengths: Concise and practical presentation of agroforestry techniques and their uses. Weaknesses: Not enough opportunities for student discussion and contributions.",
    "Strenghts: - Useful content - The professor is very accesible, he is always available to give you feedback or solve questions - Interesting readings and team exercises - Field trip Weaknesses: - The class is too long - The schedule of the course. I recommend offering it earlier in the day. - I think this should be a full-semester class instead of a 6-week class",
    "Strengths: Warm, engaging, and open professor that I willing to answer any question and ensure that students understand the material. Weaknesses:Not a very strict structure, so if you want to learn the material you have to be committed to doing the readings on your own.",
    "Strengths - professor has decades of experience living and breathing (and planting!) the material. Great contacts, enthusiastic, and empowering.",
    "The lectures were very informative and engaging. The opportunity to write a research paper about a topic of our choice was wonderful. The homework exercises did not require much thought. I wonder if it would be helpful to develop more of a longer term design project that requires more intellectual engagement and research from the students. Though there are reasons this course could only be taught for half a semester, it would be great if it could be a full semester.",
    "It's a shame that the course was shortened, but I understand the circumstances. For the time we had, I'm not sure what else could be done to improve it.",
    "The course excelled in introducing students to different types of agricultural methods and crops, their pros and cons, and their suitable environments. Professor Toensmeier's book was a handy tool to have and a good resource to go back to for more in depth information. I thought the weekly exercises were interesting a well thought out. However, I feel that I could have gotten more from them if they were tied together more intentionally. For example, instead of picking a general climate, it would have been cool to pick a specific area, like the Himalayan mountainside or Wyoming, and to develop a carbon farming design\/land management plan\/business model for that specific setting over the semester through the different homework assignments. That way, they could build on each other and go more in depth while providing opportunities for students to develop more concrete, practical skills and deliverables.",
    "It would be great to include a discussion on the science and ecology about agroforestry systems.",
    "I would like the course to last longer, or at least to have a sequel where more applied things could be done. On the strengths side, Eric is incredibly supportive and always willing to stay longer to answer questions; he distills his passion about the topic in every class!",
    "The strengths of the course were the expertise of the professor and that he wrote the textbook, which is an amazing reference and toolkit for the field. I found very few weaknesses with this course."

   "comments": [
    "Take it! Agroforestry is a fairly new field, and prior to taking this course, I had no idea about how significant the carbon sequestration potential of trees is and how improving agricultural practices can mitigate climate impacts.",
    "take this, it is the most important stuff you can possibly learn at yale",
    "I learned a lot about carbon-sequestering agriculture practices and their potential in this course. The course empowered me with a much deeper understanding of the role of agriculture in climate change mitigation, introduced me to the old and new practices available to agroforesters, and presented me with many inspiring examples of organizations and role models. If you're interested in sustainable agriculture, it is hard to imagine a more inspiring person than Eric Toensmeier to learn from. His deep knowledge\/ competence and contagious enthusiasm for the beauty and importance of his life's work is the greatest strength of this class. I found hearing him speak each Tuesday night both informative and inspiring.",
    "The course offers a great opportunity to dig into a topic of your choice for the final paper.",
    "If you're interested in working in fields related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, food production, agroforestry, etc, I would recommend this class.",
    "Take it ! it is a great course and the professor explains the material in a very understandable way , he translates theory into useful\/practical material",
    "Great class, great professor. Take it!",
    "Take it!! Light workload requirement, incredible resources available to go deeper when and how you want.",
    "If you are excited about this field, this is a great opportunity to learn about exciting work occurring around the world as well as opportunities for important work not yet being done.",
    "Stay engaged and ask Eric questions as they come to you. He is great at responding clearly to student questions and it's helpful for the whole class.",
    "To enroll in this class already with a hint of what topic could be the one for the final paper. Eric provides a lot of support but I felt, since it was only a 6-weeks course, that it was too little time for me to think about the topic, find related bibliography and write a final paper. Oh, and also do buy the book! It costs like $50 on Amazon!",
    "A great course by a excellent professor. Take this course if you are interested in the topic."
