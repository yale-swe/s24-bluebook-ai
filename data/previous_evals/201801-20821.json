    "I feel that I gained a tremendous number of skills in terms of evaluating (and formulating) academic economics papers. I had never taken a paper-based Econ class before, but thanks to this class I fell like I have developed the major skills I need.",
    "In this class I learned how to better read and understand economic (specifically, econometric) papers and how to better critically evaluate them. Throughout the course, I learned how to evaluate the quality of quantitative analysis using data, and better understood the various econometric models that are common tools of empirical economics.",
    "Microeconomics approach to understanding challenges to china's transitional economy You also read a ton of empirical papers and piece together the economics intuition + research methods behind their results. Xiaoxue helps us to assess whether or not they are convincing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course format was wonderful. I loved the guided discussions. If at all possible, I would definitely keep the small class size. It really made for a wonderful seminar-experience. One slight weakness is that grading could feel slightly arbitrary. Or arbitrary might be the wrong word, all her comments always made sense. But occasionally it felt like Dr. Zhao was looking for something very specific as opposed to a more general grading rubric. But that's a very small comment.",
    "I thought that this course was very challenging. The papers that we were asked to read every week, and which formed the backbone of the course, were often extremely technically, and usually very long. Given that I only completed one semester of econometrics prior to this course, I found myself struggling to understand the particulars of the kind of empirical analysis that was being performed. That said, I thought that our class discussions of these papers every week were extremely interesting, and definitely helped me better understand what was going on. It was also challenging because the class was rather small (around ten or fewer students), which meant that there was nowhere to hide if you did not finish the reading or did not fully understand what was going on. I really liked it when the professor gave a mini-lecture at the beginning of each class to frame the discussion and give background to that week's topic. She did not do it every time, but I really enjoyed it when she did.",
    "Xiaoxue asks great questions that challenged me to look deeply through the readings. The class ends with a research project which is interesting but I might have enjoyed the option to write a paper instead. I would have stressed less about coming up with a clever research method and instead had a better opportunity to think about the economics issues raised in class."

   "comments": [
    "This was hands down my favorite Econ class ever, and one of my favorite classes ever period. Could not recommend highly enough.",
    "This class will challenge you to think critically about difficult econometric papers concerning China's economic development since the 1950s. At times, I felt out of my depth, but thought overall that the course was well taught and that the weekly discussions were very good. The structure of the course is much looser than other economics classes--it is up to you when you choose to write two short policy briefs throughout the semester, for example. On the whole, I would recommend this class, but be aware that it is extremely challenging if you are not fully comfortable with econometrics.",
    "Highly recommend if you're willing to put the work into the readings and assignments! Xiaoxue chooses great papers and is an insightful seminar leader. She also has high expectations, but you will definitely respect her so much you'll want to meet them. Whether or not you do is another questions haha"
