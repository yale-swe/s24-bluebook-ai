    "This was a really fantastic class. You will learn an incredible amount about Frank Lloyd Wright, the times in which he lived, architectural history and a breadth of other topics connected to these subjects, including Wright and feminism, co-ops, Louis Sullivan and more. I really recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about architecture in an intensive and topic-centric way. Professor Dupre is absolutely wonderful.",
    "Yes! What an interesting life and interesting architecture. Frank Lloyd Wright is an American great worthy of your study.",
    "This is a very interesting class for anyone interested in architecture. The material is interesting, and it is well taught. There is a lot of work at the beginning of the semester, but it doesn't stay at that level.",
    "TAKE IT. Even if you have no interest in architecture whatsoever, this class is like watching an episode a tv melodrama every week. Wright's life was fascinating and you'll never get bored. Professor Dupr\u00c3\u00a9 makes it all worth it. She is super fun, approachable and understanding. All in all, it's a great class and regardless of your background, you're sure to find something you'll love about it."
