    "standard latin level 2 course. I would recommend .",
    "I would only recommend this class to another person if they have the time and energy to dedicate to an intensive class for those who have just started out learning Latin. If you want to read Latin works, then this class will get you there at the expense of skimming over some of the grammatical concepts covered in the textbook. The grading is tough but doable if you can keep up with the daily meetings, but the quizzes and tests are hard, and require significant studying. Overall, this class will teach you a lot about Latin, especially by doing, and should be taken by those who want to learn Latin, not those who need to learn a language."
