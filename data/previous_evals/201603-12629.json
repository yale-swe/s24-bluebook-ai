   "comments": [
    "I was exposed to various accounts of mimesis in philosophy, literature, art, biology, etc.",
    "Every week I was inspired to further investigate mimesis, not only in the academic sense but also in my personal life. My brain was rewired and I began to see differently. The discussions and readings opened my mind to new ideas and perspectives-- some of which I doubt I would ever experience without this class.",
    "At its best, this course was a valuable exercise in supple, textually sensitive, deconstructive close reading. Even though the syllabus included quite a range of texts -- and even though their relation to each other, according to the class's thematics, was not always clear -- the general approach, regardless of whether we were reading Plato or Darwin, lent the class a sense of rigorous adventurousness. I appreciated that the instructor sometimes developed strong, counterintuitive critical readings of the texts we discussed (Auerbach provides perhaps the best example), even though at times we might have benefited from more patient efforts to elaborate basic arguments, at least as a preliminary to the more advanced, engaging discussions the instructor sometimes wanted to provoke.",
    "intellectual history of the concept of mimesis; a wide range of literary, philosophical, and historical materials;",
    "I made the mistake of coming into Prof. North's class thinking that I could \"use\" mimesis. It was the the all-appropriating, cannibalizing attitude of a methods seminar, applied from a discipline that thinks it can explain objects \"through\" texts and their ideas, deploying them as if they weren't autonomous in their own right. \"Mimesis,\" \"likeness,\" \"recognition,\" \"lighting up,\" \"sensuous and non-sensuous similarity,\" \"identity,\" \"portrait,\" \"perfect fossil record,\" \"fantastic, privileged objects in the universe,\"--it was only when I started really thinking through and weighing these terms, on their own terms, that I achieved anything close to success in the seminar. Yet, even then, I feel that in merely lingering on, or \"dropping,\" these words, I was frequently doing something superficial and unsatisfying. On the one hand, I feel like this kind of hubris and subsequent painful understanding might well be an early lesson learned by textual-critical scholars--who weigh and agonize over words, and speak with such beautiful precision and knowledge in seminar. On the other hand, I think that the course was valuable insofar as I don't work with texts but with pictures, and I wouldn't have grown to appreciate this scrupulousness otherwise. I still spoke clumsily, blundering my way through Prof. North's questions even through the end of the course, but I at least understood that I blundered, and how I needed to be more cautious and conscientious when talking about my intended specialization: \"realist art\" and its verisimilar, psychological portraiture. I felt a little bit of hope at the end of the term when a student in a separate seminar on color was presenting a pictureless paper dealing with aspect-seeing to the abject disdain of a room full of people who deal with images. Working through the problems of Prof. North's class had a perceptible impact on how I received problems of likeness in my own discipline. I question whether I can say anything lucid about aspect-seeing and color, but I'm very conscious of the fact that it is very easy to say whole lot that is muddled and unhelpful. As a place for institutional auto-critique, Prof. North's class was fabulous, and I even think I walked away with an apparatus that is not just an apparatus: a living toolkit that struggles against me as I work.",
    "The course offered a look at the pervasiveness of similarity and resemblance as governing concepts in the work of everyone from Plato to Wittgenstein."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "weakness: The readings are far too long to be covered in the class time available. It would be better to read fewer or shorter texts, or else specify before each class specific sections of each text that will be the focus of class discussion. All other aspects of the course were quite good.",
    "The material covered was incredibly expansive, and the scope of analysis small. A more cohesive syllabus, or specific one, might have fostered more class engagement.",
    "The texts are well chosen and cover a wide range of topics\/themes.",
    "i think one limitation of the course was an occasional reluctance among students to participate in discussions. I think this was sometimes just our own unpreparedness, but the course might have corrected a little bit better for this by, say, having student-led presentations (not necessarily of the dry, familiar sort -- maybe students could have brought in objects, artworks, artifacts to consider alongside a given week's assigned reading?), or by spending more time at the beginning of sessions to outline key arguments and connections, as a foundation for discussion, or even by making students bring physical copies of the assigned reading. (This last point might be wrong, I don't know. It was great to have all the reading provided for us, yet I couldn't escape the observation that students who either bought or brought hard copies tended to be more involved. I don't know if this is a cause or an effect, but either way it's worth considering.)",
    "Prof. North laid out his problems clearly, and was delightfully unapologetic about these being his problems. Each of the seminar sessions had a strong direction once it took a direction--our readings of the text tended towards, or were seemingly magnetized by the kind of work that the professor had already attempted on these texts. The most gifted students in the class very credibly contested these readings at times, receiving what I perceived as a concession, or acknowledgement on Prof. North's part. But I was not prepared to do this. From the terrified silence that gripped the seminar for the better portion of 6 weeks before finally beginning to thaw near midterm, I suspect that many more were also in my shoes. Maybe the professor needed to scare the likes of me off, somehow, to create a more vibrant classroom. I feel like I was dead weight that dragged down the critical wizardry of a few students, but was genuinely determined to hear out the professor's thoughts to the very last, as I honestly felt that I could pick up something here. I'm not sure, at the end of the day if this is a strength, or a weakness. It was not a typical seminar environment. There was strain on the part of everybody, embarrassment on my part as I clawed at the problems the professor fielded. I always felt on the tip of saying something correct (there was a \"correct\" thing to say, here). But I didn't drop the course. When we transitioned into literature, I felt some relief, as I was dealing with a work of art--textual, certainly, but still art--again. However, a whole new mass of thorny interdisciplinary problems and useful boundary lines and etiquette arose. We weren't interested in the historiography of \"The Portrait,\" but \"the portrait\" and I had to work at checking myself here, staying on task. In all, I stayed in Paul's seminar because I wanted to try and do things Paul's way, or die trying. I was glad to sweat and feel some fear, and I'm sure not everyone sweated and was frightened. If it was easy, I wouldn't be learning.",
    "Like any thematic approach to coursework, there we're moments I wish we could have gone deeper with the ideas that surfaced on a particular week. But for those of us coming at this material\/idea for the first time, it was the perfect speed and degree of investment in each reading."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It provides an excellent, if challenging, introduction into the history and theory of mimesis in western literature and thought.",
    "Classroom discussion could be better fostered. Many of my above rankings reflect that, perhaps unfairly as the fault here rests on many of my classmates.",
    "You should take it simply for the readings.",
    "I have encouraged at least a dozen graduate students to take this course. It changed my personal practice, my vision, and the way I process information regarding resemblance and mimesis. I would take this class again if I could.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, but with caveats. I thought the class in general, as I already suggested, was primarily valuable because of the way in which it encouraged us to read philosophically. Students hoping for a more synthetic, comprehensive, or encyclopedic coverage of the concept \"mimesis\" might therefore have left the class feeling frustrated. Because of the disparate assignments, too, students with a particularly strong local interest in this or that portion of the syllabus might also have felt frustrated by the brisk treatment of particular authors, books, or movements. I think, for example, of our class on Derrida: clearly Derrida's own thinking about this subject strongly informed the instructor's mode of analysis, but in the event Derrida's arguments were quite rapidly glossed. All told, though, I would recommend this class to a student interested in the general problematic and in the method of addressing it.",
    "Yes definitely. It was incredibly stimulating and is a class that benefits from being cross-listed and having students from all different departments participate."
