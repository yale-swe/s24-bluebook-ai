    "You read tons of cool stuff, and write only 2 essays and give a presentation. Not too bad of a workload but the reading is pretty constant. You do improve a ton over the semester though, which is exciting, and the readings are great. Sanjabi is also really sweet (she seems scary at first but totally isn't!) and was a pleasure to get to know in class.",
    "A really interesting review of literature in French. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people in the class treated it as a \"fifth class,\" and kind of as a \"this is a nice way to not-lose my French,\" rather than the rigorousness required to maintain a language. As a result, no one in the class really did the readings, nor did much of the heavy-lifting required to know and truly interact with the texts themselves. I hadn't wanted to take it as a fifth class, but ultimately had no incentive to read rigorously because there would be no classroom discussion. My french has remained at stasis, and I read some interesting texts, but I think a more rigorous classroom environment would actually teach you french, should that be your aim.",
    "A survey course of French literature from medieval poetry to the present day. Very much worth it to take if you are going to take any other French literature classes at Yale. It is not that much reading per week but it is (almost) all very interesting. Good base course for any other L5 or Lit French courses, as well as general history of French literature.",
    "Read a bunch of French fiction (plus a tiny bit of non-fiction), then practice talking about it in class. Write about it occasionally. Basically, just a chance to expose yourself to a lot of communication In Frenchwritten, spokenand use it as a model for your own communications In French.",
    "French 170 with Madame Sanjabi was an excellent course, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rarely do you ever happen upon teachers who are simultaneously engaging, warm, humorous, compassionate, brilliant, understanding and insightful, but Madame Sanjabi was a combination of all of these. This is a wonderful French class to start out taking at Yale if you have tested into this level, even if it is your first year. The material covered was interesting and thought-provoking, although it was covered pretty quickly (as is to be expected for an introduction to French literature). We read authors like Sartre, Michel de Montaigne, Duras, Voltaire, etc. There are two papers, which can both be modified and submitted for the chance at a better grade, a presentation, and a final oral exam. It is a very fair and manageable workload. If you're considering an L5 French class, definitely, definitely try to take French 170 with Madame Sanjabi.",
    "Best introductions to french literature ever!",
    "French 170 gives an overview of French literature. It doesn't have the time to go too in-depth into any one subject, but it's a great springboard into French literature as a whole. I would recommend the class to anyone who's interested in expanding their knowledge of French literature and of the western canon as a whole.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone who has a reasonable grasp of French, loves literature, and wants to improve their French over the course of a semester without exhaustive focus on grammar.",
    "A very good introduction to French literature as it evolves over the centuries. Sanjabi demonstrates how both the topics of thought and the French language itself change over time and how that is reflected in literature. By the end of the class, you will be better at interpreting literature and your French vocabulary will expand significantly. I would definitely recommend this class to another student for the reasons above.",
    "An overview of important French textswhich, notably, includes many female authors."
