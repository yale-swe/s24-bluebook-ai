   "comments": [
    "As a math major, you have to take it. Try not to take it with Margulis if you can help it, but it's fine even if you can't. The material itself is beautiful, but I don't feel that the course does it justice.",
    "Your typical undergraduate complex analysis course taught by whatever unwilling senior math professor was forced by the department to do it this semester. The textbook (Stein&Shakarchi) is very good, though, and the subject is quite beautiful.",
    "Definitely take this if you want to be a math major! Professor Margulis might not be the best lecturer, but the material is absolutely fascinating. At the end we even proved the Prime Number Theorem! However, the class suddenly became very confusing when we got the gamma and zeta functions, probably because of their complex nature, but the final result is none-the-less awe-inspiring. The three exams were all pretty fair.",
    "The subject matter in this course is really great--some say it's one of the most beautiful parts of mathematics. It's also essential in studying a lot of other fields, so for math majors it's a must.Professor Margulis's approach is straightforward and clear. For the most part he's complete about the proofs of the theorems, but occasionally he kind of skirts over the details, which to me was a little bit frustrating. His lectures are easy to follow, but they are sometimes a bit dull--his enthusiasm for the subject is not always outward.",
    "Good class, just be ready to do a lot of work and learning on your own.",
    "Margulis is hard to understand at times but he's really nice and approachable. The class overall isn't too difficult and the subject is actually really pretty. Margulis follows Stein and Shakarchi pretty closely so flip through that book if you want an idea of what topics will be covered.",
    "I assume this is a pretty standard college Complex Analysis course. If you're thinking about taking it, you probably have to take it anyway. If you're just interested in learning a bit more about a cool branch of math, definitely consider it as well.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this class. Complex analysis is an extremely important field of mathematics, and it is basically mandatory for math majors. I came in knowing only the basics of what a complex number were, and you leave with a solid understanding of the main results and methods of complex analysis (now whenever you see complex numbers in other classes like physics\/algebra, etc, instead of freaking out like everyone else you're relieved since you know them so well). That being said, you should know some basic real analysis coming into the class (knowing basic topology like open\/closed balls, compactness and equivalence theorems like Bolzano-Weierstrass, etc, is helpful). Margulis is a pretty good instructor; sometimes lecture leaves you kinda confused but after a few lectures and after reviewing the textbook your notes make perfect sense and you understand why he covered things the way he did. The books, Lang and Stein\/Shakarchi are both really good so get both and use both. He tries to make the course straightforward and fair; he will give you practice exams and a practice final, all of which are pretty close to the actual exams (although this year the course definitely went faster and was harder than in previous years, and we covered the complex gamma and zeta functions and even proved the prime number theorem!)",
    "Math310 is your basic introduction into complex analysis with a few lectures on more advanced topics. In our year, Professor Margulis chose to briefly cover conformal mappings, gamma functions and riemann zeta functions at the end of class. Overall, the class was very manageable. Problem sets took 3-10 hours each week and were doable, but grades were a bit arbitrary. We had two textbooks for our class and a few of the problem set questions from one textbook had answers in the second textbook. The exams were fair, but not easy. Most of the exam questions are either technical calculations which are very similar year to year or questions from the problem sets. Margulis gives you the previous year's exam, so you know what to expect. The final, however, was very different from the practice final and that threw a lot of people off. The students in this class are pretty intelligent, so the median grade for the midterms were pretty high, so I wouldn't expect a curve in this class. The lectures are not very exciting, but Margulis has really clear lecture notes and will leave time for questions during class. His lectures follow very closely from the Stein and Shakarchi textbook with a few differences in proofs, so you can always get a second or more detailed explanation from the textbook. Overall, a good introduction to complex analysis. Also, you don't NEED Math301\/Math300 for this class, but it gives you added intuition and might make concepts easier to understand."
