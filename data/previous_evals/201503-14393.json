    "I would take \"agriculture\" out of the name of the course. This is all about wine, specifically. It seemed like the assignments, for many groups, took much longer than necessary. I think people didn't expect to have to spend as much time working of some of the group projects.",
    "The teacher doesn't like giving long lectures and generally prefers group assignments and discussions (which are great), but he is a actually a great lecturer, so he should spend some time doing that too. Also because most of the class didn't have any background knowledge on the wine industry the lectures were very helpful.",
    "As a non-SOM student, I was hoping to get a true education in intro to responsible business. However, rather than being taught skills, we were made to learn on our own in groups which I did not find effective. The business students in my group homework often took over the responsibilities of the business analyses, so I did not learn these. I did not find effective the in-class group projects either--I would have preferred to learn directly from the professor. Overall the group assignments and non-instruction classes were too many. The workload was pushed too far to the end and each assignment was very demanding, and I did not feel I had been taught the skills or knowledge to complete them.",

   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the wine business and sustainability issues\/practices within the industry, which was very interesting to me. The assignments helped with learning more about actual wineries.",
    "The depth into which we explored wine operations. Iluminating the difficulties with understanding \"value\"...the nebulous-ness of the idea is very challenging, especially when using dollars as a measure. The nature of the beast, I suppose. Its good to be able to see the realities of the challenges.",
    "the topics",
    "The assignments and class discussions were fun and very interesting. It was also really nice to learn something completely different from our other courses.",
    "-Quantitative skills learned for quantifying sustainability initiatives -Analyzing companies based on their public information to assess sustainability relative to industry -Understanding how agriculture does sustainability -Guest lectures were insightful and ecouraging, as I was able to see how sustainability is addressed In Practice; particularly Diagio Breweries & _____Family Wines guests - In class activities were a nice way to break up lecture; keep doing that, but maybe make groups smaller or only have students presents in class at alternating intervals\/randomly 50% of groups present...to allow smaller groups, but not affect presentation time.",

   "comments": [
    "I thought that the assignments were less explained than in the oil and gas half of the class, and I think that the calendar schedule of the class made completing the assignments more difficult. I would have like to have had more time in class understanding what the professor expected out of the deliverables.",
    "Group work in class could be valuable, but it is also easy for people to \"hide\" during those activities.",
    "the assignment timing",
    "My only suggestion is for us to have more time for assignments since we had to rush a lot in the end. For example, it would be better in my opinion to cancel the true value assignment (or do a in class exercise) and spend that extra time on the business plan.",
    "-smaller groups in class -The end of the semester was a little chaotic; assignments were on top of each other --though we voted for that. Still let students vote. It was busy but I am glad we did not delay presentations\/final assignments.",
    "More instruction and less group work. Less intense workload would make it more educational; the size of each assignment meant dividing up group work rather than working on it together, diminishing the educational value of working in a group.",
    "Projects should be more spread out.",
    "There were WAY too many in class group projects. I got far less out of those exercises than I did when Todd would just lecture. To make in class group exercises work more smoothly they need to be very focused and with a lot of assumptions already made so that we can go deeper into a single topic instead of superficially through a spectrum of topics. I got more from doing the group projects as an entire class. IT kept us more focused on the topic."

I think that future assignments could be a bit shorter and have more guidance, so that they could be completed independently or with a group of just two or three, and that would make the assignments more valuable to the class.",
    "It can be very frustrating when people prioritize work differently, and tend to want to do the bulk of the work near the end of the deadline. This is very different from my methods. It was a challenge, and always is\/will be.",
    "Great to combine the different skills Very time intensive to meet with the whole group over and over again",
    "Group projects are very hard to deal with generally. I was lucky my group worked well together for the most part, but for the one project the teacher chose our groups for us it was terrible.",
    "I learned some from my teammates in terms of business language and concepts, but the downside is that group assignments (especially when large) often mean dividing up work rather than working on it together, diminishing the educational value of working in a group. i.e., a business student went off and created a waterfall chart, so I did not learn how to do so, and it was not something we learned from the instructor.",
