   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course under the pretenses that you aren't grade-centric. They are barely mentioned in this course, so if you're someone who needs to get that A, take this credit\/D or don't take it. Otherwise, an interesting and challenging experience.",
    "If you want to write EVERYDAY, then sure.If not, absolutely don't take it.",
    "You write. Because you like to write.",
    "Yes: the writing you do is so different from any other writing you do at Yale. I took three literature courses on top of Daily Themes so I ended up writing about 120 pages total this semester, but the 60 pages I wrote for Daily Themes was completely worth it. I have no regret whatsoever for having taken this course: I wish I could take it again.",
    "Yes, take this class if you can get in. You write a short 250-300 word theme for five days of the week. You get your writing muscles fired up and ready for action, and the guest lectures are really cool as well.",
    "A great class to take Pass\/Fail, take it seriously if you are already a writer and want to develop better writing habits, not to learn how to write though, not very useful in that regard.",
    "Absolutely. I'd suggest that they make sure they can handle the schedule of writing, but otherwise any student would benefit from this class.",
    "YES! Its a great class and its really useful (no matter how much or how little you feel you know about writing). I'm Premed and it was a \"requirement\" but I learned SO MUCH (and I would take this any day over an \"analytically heavy\" writing writing requirement)! It was fun (though tedious at times). You just have to be diligent about your daily writing!",
    "really really great class, definitely take it if you are at all interested in creative writing. some weeks are a struggle, when you don't like the themes and can't think of anything to write for them. but when the themes are interesting it makes the whole week awesome. you really improve over the semester and learn a lot about yourself as a writer. grading could be arbitrary because it's all based on themes (no midterm or final) but my midterm grades seemed fair to me.",
    "The opportunity provided by the class is a unique one, and one you will never find anywhere again, really. It forces you to write 300 words for 5 days a week. Plus, you meet with a tutor once a week to focus on your writing. At first I was skeptical that the class would make me a better writer, but I have to say it did. It really was a struggle for the first couple of weeks, but once I got into a rhythm, the class was fun! I looked forward to writing my themes. That being said, you get as much out of the class as you put into it, and your tutor largely determines your class experience. If you have the time and want to commit yourself to improving your writing, it's an invaluable experience. I am so glad I took it.",
    "You know what you are getting into if you take Daily Themes. Five themes a week for twleve weeks. Take it if that's what you want...",
    "The best writing class at Yale",
    "This is one of the greatest classes at Yale. Lecture once a week, one short meeting a week with a tutor, and the rest is on you. A fun way to get into the habit of writing daily. I feel my writing has improved, both in its clarity and its individuality, through this class. Some great guest lectures by amazing professionals. Might be a hit or miss depending on tutor, but I haven't heard any complaints.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's challenging and a lot of fun. You learn a lot about your writing, and a lot about yourself. I would suggest taking it as a second semester senior as a CR\/D class.",
    "It's a lot more work than you think it will be, but after it's over (note: I'm writing this after it's over) you'll be really glad you did it. Writing every day makes you a better writer whether you like it or not.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to force you to write, but it won't necessarily improve your writing--the prompts are a little odd and my writing tutor at least didn't give helpful advice. Still, great lectures, and you produce a lot more writing than you think.",
    "Yes. If you are willing to work hard and want to improve your writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Performance of the lecturer aside, that is probably the least important part of this course. What matters is the writing you do every week, the themes they give, and the writing tutor you meet with.",
    "Daily Themes is an incredible course, if it comes at a time when you're ready and willing to get the most out of it. It was the prod I needed to start writing every day, and it ended up working very well with the pace of my schedule. Expect to spend about 10 hours per week writing themes\u0097if you're like me, you'll forget that it was homework, but if you find writing very tedious or stressful, then you'll have a shitty semester.",
    "If you want to write a lot, do it. If you don't want to write a lot, ask yourself why you don't. This course has the potential to change the way you go about your life and become a more creative person. Worth it.",
    "This is a great course if you want to explore the options available to you and begin to develop your \"identity\" as a prose stylist. The course covers a number of different modes and techniques in writing. What's important is your own effort; you get out of it what you put into it. If you don't take the themes seriously or try to challenge yourself with them, you won't develop much. If you work at them, you'll find you really enjoy seeing yourself accomplish different things, and you'll discover what your strengths and weaknesses are. The lectures aren't particularly educational or necessary, but they are helpful in getting you to begin thinking about your next week's themes.",
    "Daily Themes is a great class for anyone with an interest in creative writing. The work is manageable, and the opportunity to work with a personal tutor is invaluable. A fantastic course.",
    "Take this course if you want to write every day, and not always about things you would otherwise choose to write about. For someone who wants to write in any capacity, it is great practice.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It'll be hard, but it's so worth it!",
    "My theme on Daily Themes:Everyone should take Daily Themes. It's a lot of work writing every day and will sometimes even feel like a lot of work, but if you remember that it's about experimenting with writing -- trying to write about things that you don't usually write about and in styles that you've never tried before -- and not about writing a polished, publishable 300-word piece five days a week, you'll enjoy it thoroughly. My favorite part of the course was the lectures. I loved getting together with a group of students who liked writing every week, hearing what some of them had written the week before, talking about famous pieces of writing, hearing legit-as-hell writers like Caryl Phillips and Michael Cunningham talk about writing, and of course listening to Professor Hammer make his Professor Hammer jokes. I also loved meeting with my tutor to talk about life and sometimes even writing, too. To be honest, I went through a period of hating this class because I felt like I wasn't learning how to be a better fiction writer or a better poet or journalist and I didn't know what it meant to be able to write a good theme and I didn't even know what a \"good theme\" was, but Daily Themes made me realize that writing's not about that. If you take this class, you will realize what writing means for you and have the chance to let it become that. Just take it, man. Don't overthink things.",
    "Yes - great class! Be prepared to grow a lot as a writer and person. Can be tedious at times, but worth it for the sense of accomplishment you have upon completion.",
    "If you want a consistent way to write and a structured way of getting feedback, do it- tuned me into \"a writer,\" for sure.",
    "For students interested in writing, but also for students not interested in writing but interested in the art of reflection and creation, Daily Themes will be a rewarding project. It is an experience whose meaning accumulates up until the very end. It doesn't climax in some epiphany about writing. There's no magic answer, no secret formula you learn, except to keep trying to look for one by writing every day.",
    "Great chance to write. Highly recommend. Boring lectures.",
    "Dude, if you walk around with beautiful phrases floating through your brain but can't imagine writing a short story take this class. Writers and word lovers will, probably, enjoy it the most, so unless motivated by passion and excitement, I say look elsewhere.",
    "If you're willing and excited to write for an hour a day, do it. That's all it takes, and you will thank yourself later for taking on the challenge of producing creative work at this kind of a clip. It might even be fun for you.",
    "It's a great course that doesn't ask too much. You might come up with a lot of terrible writing, but there are some gems and the discipline it cultivates is definitely worth it.",
    "If you like to write and want to get into the habit of writing regularly, take this class. It's a lot of work, but I think taking Daily Themes helped me to find my writing voice, and of course, it's wonderful to have a tutor to give you feedback on every piece you write.",
    "The course's value is entirely dependent on your writing tutor and how much effort you put into each and every theme; you won't get much out of going to lecture and hearing quotes read to you. Assignments are enjoyable and allow you be creative, but writing 300 words a day, five days a week gets pretty tough towards the end of the semester. Motivation is key. Still, it'll definitely make you a better writer.",
    "Great way to get your self in the habit of writing And to improve on specific techniques. A lot of work and lecture is boring but a lot of fun.",
    "Take it. The lectures are awesome, though they aren't really necessary in a sense.You'll become a much better writer... and you'll be involved in a super awesome Yale tradition.Make sure you get a good writing tutor!",
    "Write daily. Low stress. Satisfaction.",
    "yeah, it's pretty cool. not a ton of work either.",
    "Take this class because you want to write every day, and you recognize that nothing else will make you do so. Take this class because you'll get to be creative and explore different styles of writing that you've never done before. Take this class because it can be therapeutic to write about whatever's on your mind. BUT. Do not take this class for the lectures, because Professor Hammer is deadly. Seventy-five minutes will never pass more slowly. Also do not take this class if you want to be inspired by the daily prompts. Many of them suck, and they only get worse and worse as the semester progresses. Lastly, be wary of getting a bad tutor. I had one and the whole semester was extremely frustrating and now I'm writing a bitter course evaluation, but some sound really great and helpful. This course is what you make it.",
    "Take it, if only for the fact that writing (nearly) ever day is an incredibly beneficial practice.",
    "Quit whining and take it. Although the prompts aren't always ideal, forcing yourself to write is an intellectual exercise that doesn't seem as noble as, say, reading Heidegger or whatever, but it's a very important skill! You'll get better at writing faster, and that'll help you in all your classes. The class depends on your putting effort into it, but if you do you'll probably be rewarded. I'm leaving with several things I can work with in the future, as well as a valuable resource in my tutor.",
    "Daily Themes is AMAZING. Take it if you want to challenge yourself, to improve your writing, and to have a blast doing so. Some say it depends on your tutor, but I honestly found that, even though it was my tutor's first time doing Daily Themes, it's completely what you make of it. If you're willing to work hard and work with your tutor to improve the way you even approach writing, you will have an amazing experience in this class. 100% recommend--it's my favorite class at Yale by a mile.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. I remember reading these same evaluations when I was shopping and ppl sounded too excited... but it is totally worth it. Very chill and personal, nothing like any other class you would take at yale, lots of personal growth. as with anything, you get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this. It's a lot of work day-to-day (250-300 words sounds deceptively small) but you get a lot out of it. Daily themes is also a good way to experiment with different forms of writing, if you're used to doing nonfiction and are unsure about fiction, or vice versa, or just want to try writing more.",
    "Daily Themes introduces you to as many genres of writing as possible and forces you to write five days a week. You get out of it what you put in.",
    "YES. At first I thought it would become a chore, having a writing assignment due every day, but in the end it was so worth it. My writing has improved dramatically; I've taken other creative writing classes but this was by far the most helpful. Matt Hunter is an excellent TA. The lectures were occasionally boring, but Langdon Hammer is fun to talk to. Guest lecturers (Michael Cunningham, Anne Fadiman, Cynthia Zarin, Caz Phillips) were excellent and helped me decide which of their writing classes I want to take in the future.",
    "You write 250-350 words daily. This took me about an hour a day since it's quality over quantity.",
    "NOT WORTH IT. Sounded awesome and is a great idea for a class, but poorly executed. Class time was too long and felt unproductive and repetitive. My tutor was nice, but not helpful at all. Waste of time. Only benefit is a that you get to write a lot. You will improve from practice, but definitely not from instruction.",
    "Take this course if you want to improve your writing style. It won't be easy to stay on track and complete all 60 themes and some nights will be harder than others, but it will be an extremely rewarding process.",
    "I didn't learn from this class in any of the ways that I hoped to. It was a chance to write. Beyond that, the lectures were uninspired and my tutor was unable to communicate constructive feedback. You provide all the substantive material in this class. The instructors offered very little in the way of actual instruction.",
    "Daily Themes is totally defined by what you want to get out of it. I had a fantastic time writing the five themes a week because that is what I reallywanted to be doing; however, if you are already an experienced writer, then the supports of the course (lectures, tutors) itself probably won't do as much to push you further as the mere act of writing everyday. I would definitely recommend it, but only to someone who is self-motivated and passionate about writing- not someone who is hoping their tutor will turn them into Ernest Hemingway by magic.",
    "It's a Yale institution. I'm not sure it deserves the hype it gets, but I was also taking it cr\/d\/f, so maybe did not commit fully to it. You write five times a week. I often got to the end of a really long day and remembered I hadn't done my theme--worst feeling--it's best to get into a routine of when you're going to write them, such as at breakfast.I think your experience depends largely on who you get as a tutor.Recommended, if only for the guest lectures and getting into the habit of disciplining yourself to write more!Not the dramatic improvement I got from ENG 120, but very specific things improved exponentially, like my ability to write dialogue.",
    "Take it!",
    "Wonderful wonderful wonderful! Beautiful formula for a course, awesome prompts, soothing lecture, rewarding meetings. The prompts I found difficult challenged me to think\/write differently. Story time with Lanny was one of my favorite moments of each week this semester. It was inspiring to watch and listen as he brought each author's words to a different sort of life, then thought aloud about their words for our benefit. This was tremendously productive for me. The guest lecturers were also well chosen and inspiring. I grew enormously as a writer. I would take it again and again, if I could, though I hope to use the time-management techniques gained here to make time to write now and in the future ..."
