    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albert was a true good manager of discussion-based sections. In fact, it felt more like a mini-seminar than section. He allowed opinions and contributions, while at the same time keeping control of the flow and goals of the class. In enjoyed his interest in law and its intersection with religion.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albert really wanted to encourage group discussion The challenge in the way he did that is that he wouldn't edit and moderate the discussion well, usually resulting in one or two people running the discussion section while most of the others were largely silent.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albert made section stress free, but relevant. Had a strong command of the course materials. Very accessible. Was a good TF!",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0I really appreciated Albertus' demeanor in class, he clearly enjoyed our discussions and encouraged a deep engagement with the texts. He made sections enjoyable and was very accessible and helpful as I was discussing my paper with him. I would encourage Albertus to step in more often in class discussions, ensuring that the class stayed on track and covered all of the readings instead of letting us get off on tangents.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Approachable and encourage diverse viewpoints. Could be more directive in the teaching role.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albert's sections always seemed to be a bit disorganized. He seemed to be reasonably well prepared for class, but he did not always maintain control over the classroom so as to enable productive discussion. I would myself many times wondering why we were spending so much time on unrelated material to that week's discussion. He was a nice guy and respected students, but his ability to articulate expectations and keep focused on the topic at hand left something to be desired.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albertus was a very exciting teaching fellow. His sections always had a levity that made subject manner very enjoyable. He was a very caring individual to his fellow students. His help to me waas invaluable to completing the work of the class.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Mr. Horsting was not prepared for sections, was not responsive to communication, and knew the subject matter at a minimal level.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0- very welcoming and available - sometimes the discussion was unfortunately misleading given out of topic comments or personal opinions (of students)",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0A strong section leader. I liked how Albert stated from the outset that he saw himself as a facilitator rather than instructor. I think that gained him a lot of respect. (He's actually too modest about his accomplishments in theology which he never really mentioned.) Our section was not super-engaged but I think that has to do with (1) the timing early in the morning toward the end of the week, and (2) the fact that most students have to take the class as MDivs, rather than choosing to. Albert also gave great feedback on the paper topics and made clear he was able to meet and talk and help as much as possible. Overall a great job even if our section's discussion was a little meh.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Mr. Horsting was supportive, responsive, and inspiring. He could speak more authoritatively in class and push students into more engaged discussion.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albert was very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albertus was very helpful one on one. Our section needed a strong, seasoned hand given the mix of views and individuals, and I found it to be less helpful than I would have liked. I was a little confused about the teaching fellow's expertise in the subject material, as I think he indicated it was not his direct field of study.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albert was very kind and always prompt in responding to needs. I didn't feel a strong sense of consistency in our section. That might be because we missed so many sections and never were able to develop a regular pattern. My section was filled with many people who loved to share their opinions. which, at times, produced a helpful environment that thoughtfully engaged with the texts. More often than not, though, there were a few personalities who dominated the space. I didn't think Albert did enough to manage this aspect of the section.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Discussion in section was often cut off at the point at which it became interesting because Albert was determined to discuss every reading. I think some of the discussion could have been more helpful if it were more free-flowing.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0My TF Albert was great at facilitating discussion, even though section could be a challenge at times. He challenged us to try to understand the material without rushing to judgment.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albertus was adept at bringing us more deeply into material for the course. He engaged the section with his questions and opened section and the material to our own questions. He was patient and receptive to these questions and facilitated section discussion well. His own engagement often encouraged my own.",
    "Instructor: Albertus G.A. Horsting \u00a0Albertus Horsting was very polite and knowledgeable. He encouraged the students to participate in class discussion and he respected the opinions of all. Albertus did not show partiality but welcomed differing opinions. He put a lot of the class content into context that made it easier for assimilation and recall.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Leo was well prepared and thoughtful in engaging the class on issues addressed in the text. He helped the class get more deeply into the texts while having fun doing so.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Always prepared for section - almost too prepared! It was refreshing to have a TF engage with the course material so much. I really appreciated his dedication to the course and us as students. Leo was always open to comments, questions, and ideas from us as well, which made coming to weekly section enjoyable and engaging. He was also very prompt with emails and grading assignments, which I appreciated. His feedback on my course paper was also very helpful. I am glad I had him as a TF - he did a wonderful job!",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Leo encouraged discussions by cold calling individuals and setting up small group and large group conversations. The section time didn't really allow for students to bring their own questions about the reading as there was always a strict outline of questions that the TF brought to class. Most of the time the TF walked around the room which was a bit distracting and felt parental in nature. It would have been nice for him to sit down and join the conversation instead of monitoring whether we were taking notes. It is nice to have a variety of backgrounds in the class but I think it would have been more helpful if the TF had a religious studies background or a divinity background in order to better relate and assist students in writing assignments and make practical connections of the reading.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0He was always accessible. Very responsive. Very engaged with the coursework and the students.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Well prepared, engaged with conversation, helpful, kind.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Leo was a geat TF",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Leo was a very capable section leader, though his style was a bit challenging at first - a bit like entering law school! As the semester progressed, though, his style adapted to the class, the discussions were broken into smaller groups and synthesized in summery discussions, which was a useful approach. Clearly Leo has a passion for teaching, a passion for history, and I was quite pleased overall with his engaging and enthusiastic leadership.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Enjoyed your teaching style with the exception of the \"get to know you activities\". With a course of this style, I would prefer to maximize our time taking deep readings of the text.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0I appreciated Leo's leadership of section. He asked good questions and engaged the group. As a suggestion, some additional straight up teaching of context would have been useful. Enjoyed it.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Leo was good about making sure everyone spoke and no one dominated the class. It would have been helpful if Leo had clarified and streamlined the main point of each lecture or historical person that we studied to solidify our learning.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Leo had a dynamic style of leading section. He always came well prepared and was on top of the posted comments which was appreciated. He made an effort to remember each student's name and was able to call out individual contributions to the postings. An area for improvement would be to make a deliberate effort to invite a more balanced participation from students. All too often, it was the same overzealous male student(s) who would be allowed to dominate most discussions leaving just a limited space for the other team players to contribute. Overall, Leo coordinated the sessions well and offered some good take home points which helped in preparing for the exams. He was a pleasure to work with.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0I enjoyed having Leo as a TF. Compared with the TFs of last semester, Leo was very well organized and had a plan for what he wanted to accomplish in our sections. He kept to the schedule and tried various formats for how we discussed the material to find the best model that worked for our group. I appreciated his desire to get the students connected with each other and to have us learn something about our classmates. Much of what we were discussing this semester was sensitive and Leo did a really good job facilitating conversation in a respectful way.",
    "Instructor: Leo Patrick O'Toole \u00a0Leo was excellent. He was well-prepared and helpful. He did a great job facilitating discussion."
