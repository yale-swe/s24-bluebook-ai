    "Take this if you can get a spot -- you'll learn a lot from a diverse group of fellow seminar mates and a highly knowledgeable and engaging professor.",
    "Literally take this course or regret your entire time at Yale. It is difficult to get into given the demand but if you get a spot my God take it, show up, do the readings, and give it you're all! You will not be disappointed. It is such an honor to be taught by Professor Joseph and I strongly urge anyone reading this to commit one semester while at Yale to taking a class with him.",
    "Great history course with even greater discussion",
    "Phenomenal. I would absolutely recommend this class to every single student at Yale. Mexican history is not only fascinating, but also integral to understanding US politics and US-Mexican relations. This is a must take.",
    "Mexico Since Independence is a great survey course of Mexican History. Prof Joseph is an authoritative figure in the field and thus is very knowledgable on many areas of Mexico. While the class is presented entirely in English, Prof Joseph is available to guide you toward useful and informative Spanish language sources. If you get into it, start working on your final paper early!",
    "It is an overview of Mexican history since its independence. The class emphasizes the period of the Mexican Revolution but covers around 200 years. There is a lot of reading and material, two papers and a presentation. The material is so interesting and professor Joseph does a great job of presenting many perspectives and interpretations.",
    "Definitely recommend this class for students willing to put in the work and who are interested in history!",
    "Take HIST 358J if Gil Joseph lets you in. Mexico Since Independence is now one of my favorite seminars at Yale. Not only did I learn so much every week from the readings and from the infinitely wise and knowledgeable Gil Joseph, but I also learned what isn't (yet) in the textbooks thanks to the exceptionally diverse and well-informed cohort of students that Gil Joseph put together. You will have tons of work every week, but believe me it will be worth every minute.",
    "Fantastic class!!! Professor Joseph knows good pedagogy and makes this class feel so relevant and important. Good seminar discussions, manageable assignments. Amazing opportunity to engage deeply with Mexican history.",
    "YES!! TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Joseph actually cares about his students, and leads a great discussion with compelling questions. Learning a history of Mexico is essential to living in the U.S. (these histories explain each other) and there is really are few better ways to engage with it than this class. I'm mexican and learned more in this course than in my many elementary\/middle school history classes. Important questions. Great visiting speakers, because Prof. Joseph really cares about providing those opportunities."
