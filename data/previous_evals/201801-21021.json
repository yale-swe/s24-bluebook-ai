    "I learned how to critically assess media representations and government policies in a more skeptical and effective way.",
    "I had almost no prior knowledge about the subject of the course before taking this class, so I learned a ton about how the U.S.'s involvement in the Middle East, how Muslims are treated in the U.S., how black American Muslims impact history, etc. I also learned how to push myself to ask deeper questions and not be scared to speak up in seminar.",
    "I felt I learned a lot about the lay of the land in terms of representations of Muslims in America that I just didn't know before, both historical and present-day.",
    "This class pushed me to think critically of myself and my beliefs in a way that no class I have taken at Yale has before. It taught me to take long-held beliefs that I have had and never had to defend because I was surrounded my like-minded people and actually try to explain and argue for them.",
    "Learned how to synthesize cultural studies and history to more accurately contextualize and analyze relations between the West and Islam. I developed a more in-depth knowledge of foreign affairs and how they inform a general understanding of America and the Middle East.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of representations of Muslims in America, as well as the policies and ideologies that informed them. I also learned how to better analyze and think critically about these policies and representations"

   "comments": [
    "The strengths were that it made me think every day and completely changed my perspective on the U.S. and its international affairs. A weakness was that some of the reading was a bit too long and dense.",
    "The course was really exciting to attend, classes were always super interesting. The reading load was so heavy that it was basically impossible to get through, and that showed in class discussions.",
    "It took us a while to be able to have productive discussions where people were willing to state and defend their opinions. Once Professor Grewal talked to us and shook us to be more awake, we were able to do it, but that would have been beneficial earlier on in the course. I did get a little lost in what we were doing each week and could not keep tabs on the larger goal, so some refocusing\/zooming out every so often would have been appreciated.",
    "The course has an incredible selection of readings, but they oftentimes the reading load was a bit too heavy. Students could give each reading the detail and attention they deserved with a lighter load.",
    "The readings are amazing",
    "Sometimes a little all over the place but the class is extremely up to date, making it extremely interesting and engaging."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No. This course offers an interesting perspective on American intervention in and representations of the Middle East and Islam. However, it teaches pretty much nothing about what the Middle East, Muslim culture, or Muslim theology is actually like, instead focusing heavily on criticizing America for its policy\/values. The material and class conversations are extremely biased. There was little room for actual debate or critique of the one-sided articles, books, and essays, which mostly had a negative bent toward America and did not examine any Middle Eastern policy from the Middle East itself.",
    "Yes. This is a must take course.",
    "Yes! I was challenged in new ways and learned a ton about an interesting subject!",
    "Definitely take this class if you have time to spare to do a lot of reading. It's a challenge to keep up with but Zareena is brilliant and the class is totally worth it if you can manage it",
    "I absolutely would. This course is relevant to every student at Yale, not just students interested in Islam. It was extremely valuable to be in a classroom dicussing really hard topics and being pushed to be honest, open, and critical.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course!",
    "Yes. I thought I already knew something about the subject matter, but my mind was consistently blown."
