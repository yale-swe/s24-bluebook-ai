   "comments": [
    "Theorizing Racial Formation gives on an understanding of ways we have conceived of race, both domestically and globally. Undoubtedly, this class should be taking by other students because this class complicates one's understanding of race.",
    "This course is a wonderful introduction to the field of African American Studies. The reading for this course spans multiple disciplines, and you will often be asked to think in ways that are unfamiliar to you, based on your disciplinary background. I found that the breadth and depth of the course challenged me to sharpen my analytical skills and to find language that could speak across multiple registers. The assignments for this course were a great opportunity for thinking about my individual scholarly interests and practices.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student because it is foundational for anyone who is even remotely interested in conversations on race.",
    "Theorizing Racial Formations is an interdisciplinary course that opens up a number of ways of understanding how race is addressed in a number of disciplines. For this reason, I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in issues of race\/ethnicity in their scholarship."

   "comments": [
    "This class forced me to develop a master's thesis\/dissertation topic, because of that I'm incredibly thankful. Some of the course readings will be cited in my literature review as well.",
    "This course introduced me to the interdisciplinary\/multidisciplinary approaches of African American Studies, and to the history, context, and major debates of the field. It offered me space to think broadly about my endeavor into African American Studies as a field and profession, and gave me the opportunity to focus on my particular interests and research. The work I did for my prospectus project in this course may become part of my dissertation, or, if not, will have served as an invaluable entry into archival research and planning.",
    "This course lay foundational thinking across several fields and trainied me from the start to look outward to other disciplines in order to frame my own research and do the work justice. Indeed, this course led me to a topic and to a kind of interdisciplinary thinking that I think will be the seeds of my dissertation.",
    "As one of my first courses as a graduate student, I appreciated the courses truly interdisciplinary breadth especially as someone who has had limited exposure to social science courses. The assignments (journal review, prospectus) were much more helpful than traditional seminar papers and set me up well to think about how to approach my academic projects and understand intellectual conversations. I feel like I am very well-equipped to do further research on my subjects of interest thanks to the format and structure of the course."
