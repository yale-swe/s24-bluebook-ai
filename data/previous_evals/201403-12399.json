    "The class is pretty high-level (lots of grad students, etc.) but you'll learn tons. Definitely check the syllabus and see if you're interested in the books, though - that will make or break the semester. Readings are of good length: normally around 50-60 pages a week, plus supplemental papers and things. Discussion is good and thought-provoking. Three reading response, one large final paper. Take it with Darwall",
    "\"Recent Work in Ethical Theory\" was a philosophy seminar that covered three of the most prominent books published this year (2014) in metaethical theory. If normative ethics asks what we should do, then metaethics asks what it is for something to be a reason for us to do something to begin with - and this course covers some of the most recent work in this field. I found the material pretty boring, since I'm more interested in the normative questions. The seminar was a little big and sometimes could get unwieldy (over twenty students, about half grad and half undergrad). Darwall's a good discussion leader and always willing to have a good laugh over some cheesy but funny philosophy joke, plus he's quite helpful to any students who seek it. Overall, I'm glad to have gotten my brain whirring about metaethical questions - but that was probably accomplished after the first class, and I'm not sure I got much else out of the course after that.",
    "Before deciding to take this course, make sure you're very interested in the specific topics within ethics being covered. A good idea is to take a quick look through the course texts before signing up. There's only one section before reading week ends (at least in my year), and that doesn't give a great picture of where the course is going, so make sure you're interested in all the things the course gets into. Professor Darwall is wonderful, although section can be a little dull if people don't bring in interesting ideas to discuss. The workload is manageable, but as you don't get grades on your reading responses, be prepared to have no idea what your final grade might be during the semester. All that being said, this course gives you the best opportunity to engage with contemporary ethics, with a great professor. So I'd recommend it, for students with a sincere interest in the particular topics within ethics being discussed, and who have taken at least one philosophy seminar before.",
    "This is an excellent course in basically every way. The readings are interesting but class discussions are even better, especially since you get to hear insights from grad students as well. If you do the readings thoroughly and put a lot of effort into your reading responses and final paper, you'll be able to get a lot out of the course."
