   "comments": [
    "The sequence and syllabus was really interesting however, I would have liked to have heard more lectures from Peggy. After the 5th week, the students would give the lectures which were at times disconnected with the weekly readings, and if Peggy had given a weekly introduction, it may have been clearer. The two page weekly reading response and journal was unmanageable. I often felt like I was reaching to make connections on material that I was unfamiliar with. A shorter question based response would have been more appropriate.",
    "Not sufficiently rigorous, or perhaps too ambitious. I would have appreciated a clearer presentation by the instructor during the early weeks of the semester of a basic framework on which students could then build; as it was, the course felt piecemeal. In general, more teaching by the instructor and less listening to one another present on topics which we were not yet really qualified to assess with any precision. Expecting a coherent analysis not only of cultural conditions but also of economic theory was asking a lot, particularly for those who were approaching such material for the first time.",
    "the subject of the course is very much triggering and in my personal experience this was the first time that I was pursuing a serious attempt to investigate it. I found more exciting the first part of the semester, when the professor was personally providing a lecture: this process, later substituted with sometimes vague and pointless presentations by students, was extraordinarily classificatory not only of the readings associated with those early lectures, but also with broader contextual issues.I found the syllabus well proportioned, as long as the assignments. I personally struggled a lot with reading responses, understood by the instructor as just a verification of an apprehended notion rather than a chance for personal conceptualization.",
    "This course covered a lot of material and it was laid out in an organized and sequential fashion.",
    "Thoroughly organized. It would have been beneficial to invite guests and specifically, a person who has an expertise in the economics."

    "I learned so much more from this class than I anticipated, however I felt like the discussions were lead by the students who were further along in their academic program. The language they used often mislead me and their internal relationships made it difficult to interject conversations.",

   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was valuable and interesting, but also stressful and time consuming. I would only suggest students to take this if they had a lighter course load.",
    "I valued this course because I never realized how nuanced and varied the term \"Marxist(sm)\" was - I always assumed it to be a frightening dogmatic ideology (mistake #1 right there) that was pretty much the same as Communism\/Socialism. Not only was I totally unaware at how it has assumed different meanings in different contexts, but I never realized how much Marxism has infiltrated our profession, our academy, and our very way of conceiving architecture.I attribute this epiphany to the simple question that Peggy would frame for us with all the readings: \"What is at stake for this author?\" It enabled us to think of the way that different thinkers over the past 150 years position themselves vis-a-vis systems of production and consumption.While Peggy's own biases might have surfaced on occasion (this is NOT a bad thing - it was actually quite helpful), I think that her encouraging us to explore this question without a set thesis was beneficial for our processing and analysis.",
    "The value of this course is medium.",
    "None - I believe this course is rigourous, but its intellectual intent is a bit mixed.",
    "High value."

   "comments": [
    "Peggy is a wonderful instructor. She is knowledgeable and avalible and encourages the best work of her students.",
    "Instructor could perhaps have presented with more passion on a subject to which she had clearly devoted a good deal of thought.",
    "The teaching method is very rigorous and disciplined, but at the same time extremely capable to attire student's attention and focus. However the broadness of the subject makes it impossible for the instructor to offer a compelling overall vision. Sometimes the exclusively architectural discourse wasn't enough to understand a reality shaped by cultural, political and economical trends. I would have preferred more intervention from the instructor especially in the second half of the semester, compensating student presentations.",
    "I hope Peggy realizes what a phenomenol lecturer she is. The first several weeks of the course were exhilerating, and I couldn't believe her ability to process and teach so much information in a short period time. It was also clear to us how genuinely engaged and interested she was in the material - if we asked a question to which she didn't know the answer (albeit, a rarity), she seemed troubled and we could tell she would want to look up the answer after class. Her passion for the material was blatantly obvious.I think the most interesting and rewarding way that this materialized was via the student presentations. They were, quite simply, the most well-researched and well-thought out class presentations I have ever seen by a group of students, and I can only attribute this to the bar that Peggy set during the first two months of the class. I literally spent more time on mine than on studio that week, including two \"desk crits\" with friends in the course - and I wasn't the only one.",
    "The only comment I have is that I wish Peggy did more of the teaching. She is incredibly smart and clear, and I really was hoping that she would lead the class a bit more. She, instead, acting more as a respondent, and the majority of the class was taught by the students. In general I wish that this format was changed in all the seminars.",
    "None - Professor Deamer is unwilling to read her own students papers. Either this is just a sign of lazyness or that she doesnt care. Either way, I dont think I have ever been more offended in my entire life - What type of pseduo-half wit professor thinks she is above reading rough drafts? Not to mention to give such a task to another student who is unable to command any respect. Although Professor Deamer has a very accute mind, and this course started off on a great note, it dissolved into a bizarre flea market of ideas.",
    "Very effective teaching methods, I wish the course would be offered over two semesters with the first part being a primer and the second being one to firmly develop papers\/positions with research etc.",
    "peggy is amazing and brilliant. she deserves similarly amazing and brilliant students. i wish i had been a better student."

   "comments": [
    "I would have liked more focused discussions on the readings because I didn\u0092t always know about the tangent topics and often felt lost when I had done all the reading.",
    "Smaller class size (i.e. fewer student presentations&therefore more time for teaching).",
    "I would personally avoid to propose student presentations at the last week of classes, reservingthat occasion for personal conclusions by the instructor. Furthermore I'd suggest to regulate the length of student presentation to a reasonable measure, orchestrating them in order to leave enough time for discussions or personal lecturing by the instructor. Finally, I would suggest the instructor to pretend a sort of mid-term review of final papers. That's because, if the aim of the papers are their publication, I believe that more than enough of research has to be done. I personally struggled a lot with it, because after the review of the first draft, I decided to change direction to the paper, while enlarging and continuing the research for it, leaving finally not enough time to accomplish it decently. One help could have been come from an anticipation of such task already in the middle of the semester",
    "My only suggestion is that I thought that the weekly readings were sometimes a bit high, and it prevented me from spending as much time on my journals as I would have liked. I think the journals were a good idea, but I think the reading load might want to accommodate this a bit better. That said, all readings and journal requirements were clearly listed on the syllabus so I knew what I was up for.",
    "See above.",
    "Professor Deamer is a good professor, despite my previous negative criticism, she just needs to rethink how to go about this seminar. I have no doubts that should she reteach this seminar it will be a wonderful course. Something about this course was both incredbile and dispointing.",
    "Offer Arch and Capital 01, the Arch and Capital 02, giving students the ability to more rigorous and consistently engage in topics and research.",
