    "Don't take this class unless you have to. If you are interested in a general computer architecture-like class, cpsc 201 is far better. This class is just not that great. Grading takes multiple months, because there is no grader and all work must be graded by the professor. I have no idea how I am doing on labs, which make up 35% of the grade for the class. Psets are either extremely tedious or require research. People often complain about some math classes just becoming advanced algebra and grading based on algebra screw ups. Well, this class takes that concept to a whole new level, because now you aren't even doing algebra, you're just writing massive tables of 1's and 0's on a piece of paper. Class uses a new textbook but is LITERALLY taught straight out of a different one that they used to use. Labs involve a lot of hand copying vhdl code, which you are never formally taught how to use. You can't copy paste because he takes screenshots of the code. Final project then requires you to do a lot of VHDL coding from scratch, which you haven't been practicing much at all. Exams are a time crunch and therefore don't really test your knowledge of the material (although in this respect cpsc 201 is the same.) Overall, you will learn things, but it was an unexpectedly bothersome journey.",
    "EENG 201 deals with a lot of cool ideas and basically the fundamentals of how microcontrollers work, but you might have to do some studying yourself (if you haven't taken CS 201). The material is very doable, but be sure to keep pestering the TAs and TFs when you don't understand something.",
    "EENG 201 provides an introduction to electrical engineering. There are weekly problem sets, weekly lab sessions, two midterms, and a final exam. The labs are scheduled for two hours, but take much longer. Be prepared to go back at least once if not twice during the week to finish the labs. I would only recommend EENG 201 if you are considering becoming an engineering major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student; it was very interesting and I think even someone with no experience in the field could enjoy it.",
    "I found the class interesting, so I would recommend it, but it is a lot of work. The material is very difficult to comprehend, but once you finally do it becomes easy. This made the homework hard and time consuming, but again, once you finish it, you can easily see how everything works. Jakub is an incredible teacher because he really cares about his students and wants them to understand and be passionate about the material. However, sometimes it was hard for him to understand how difficult the material could be to people with no electrical engineering experience, which made labs or homework occasionally harder or longer than they should have been. It's a little stressful but worth taking.",
    "The class overall was very easy; the content was not particularly challenging. However, Jakub was not the best teacher, and while he did occasionally care about teaching the class, his lectures and assignments were extremely disorganized. Reading the textbook was not useful whatsoever, and labs were not timed as it felt like he had not even done the lab to test out how much time it would take within the time slot allotted for lab. For example, we had labs at night and in the afternoon every week in 2 hour block-periods, and some of the labs took over 4 hours. Furthermore, there were two midterms in the class, and at the time of taking the second midterm, we had not gotten the grades back for the first midterm, any of the labs, or even any of the homework. Note that this is after the drop period for the class. That being said, the course material was very interesting, and I did end up learning a lot, though the process of taking the class was unnecessarily miserable. However, it is required for the EE major, so I guess, just bear this in mind heading into the class.",
    "I took this as a non-major because I was curious about computer hardware, and I found it very useful and even fun. The labs take longer than you may expect and you'll have to spend extra time on your own to finish them. They can be enjoyable though, like the lab where you program a soda machine. Homework is weekly and takes around 5 hours, not too bad. Exams aren't difficult either. However, this makes the curve pretty competitive, so if you're taking this for fun, it's best to start Credit\/D\/Fail. Prof. Szefer is one of the most dedicated teachers I've had here. He'll stay late after lab times to help students finish up, spend extra time outside of classes to help debug code, and have lunch with students to get to know them. There were some organizational and logistical issues at times, but I think this class will continue to improve as he keeps teaching it.",
    "Interesting course material. Lectures were difficult to follow (lots of diagrams and Professor Szefer isn't exactly the most confident public speaker). Lecture notes were not online. The course DOES NOT FOLLOW THE TEXT BOOK. The text book was, frankly, a waste of money. I would say I learned 15% of the course material from lecture and then %85 from wikipedia\/the rest of the interwebs. Labs were interesting but professor Szefer clearly had not done them himself and had no real conception of how long they would take. Tests were very reasonable. All in all it was a good course with a few frustrating moments.",
    "If you are interested in Electrical or Computer engineering this is a really good course. It is quite demanding and has a lot of work (especially labs), but it is totally worth it. If you are a beginner in programming (as I was), you may have some difficulty at lab, but the TF and the professor are super helpful and explain everything",
    "EE201 is all about how computers come together from more basic components. You will do a lot of programming in a strange language called VHDL. We will eventually write the code for implementation of a processor and an FPGA board. It's pretty neat. This class at times did not have enough office hours. There was a very variable amount of works. Sometimes one lab assignment took about fifteen hours, but most took between 2-6 hours. Good class.",
    "I would recommend, but the course is only good for the last 2-3 weeks, the first part is just ridiculously easy stuff.",
    "You should definitely take this class if you think computers work through magic.",
    "I would recommend this class to any CS major as it is HUGELY helpful explaining what goes on behind the scenes. For our final project, we build a simple microprocessor. Before this class I wouldn't even know where to start.",
    "I would recommend this class to people that are serious about electrical engineering. It teaches a lot about the devices commonly used today.",
    "I don't care if you're a History, Poly Sci, Interpretive dance majorTAKE THIS CLASS. You'll learn so much\/understand so much more about computers, and Jakub explains things in an easy to grasp manner. Not an easy class but ridiculously easy on the grading. Couldn't call it hard either though. Highly recommend.",
    "A useful class that will take up large amounts of time.",
    "Good foundation to computer architecture. Pretty easy for most of the semester, but not a lot is taught in class and the problem sets require a lot of independent learning. The labs are a nightmare and the last two will consume your life with little support from the professor and TA. Also, be warned that Professor Szefer grades on a negative curve. The material is fairly easy and everyone in class gets close to full credit on everything, so it was an unpleasant surprise at the end of the year to discover that half of us would be assigned a B automatically. You will have to out-compete your classmates for every point.",
    "Pretty fun class. Easy and interesting. Be wary of being thrown into the water without knowing how to swim when it comes to the labs, though.",
    "It is a good course. Professor Szefer is extremely approachable. The material is good. The labs vary from horrible to exciting and the soda machine was overhyped. Exams are fair and match courswork very well. Homework is also fair. Do the extra credit, or you will be sad when you see your final grade. First time at Yale I have seen grades being curved down.",
    "EENG 201 is a good way to get a grasp on computer hardware. If you are interested in engineering or computer science, I would definitely recommend the course as it will give you a better appreciation of computers.",
    "Yes, although some changes need to be made to the course as outlined above.",
    "Yeap, I highly recommend this course.",
    "An okay course with pretty interesting content that allows you to finally understand the insides of a CPU (not completely, but at least you'll learn what the main components are, how clocked circuits operate and how data is stored in memory and computed upon using arithmetic logic units). I'm not sure I would have taken it if I weren't keen on doing Electrical Engineering or EECS as a major however - lectures are not very engaging, psets often tedious, and labs are time-consuming, if sometimes fun. But hopefully this will change in future iterations of the course."
