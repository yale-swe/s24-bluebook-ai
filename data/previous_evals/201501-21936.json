    "Truly a mixed bag. The first half was great ... well organized, interesting, and usefull. The second half was confusing, poorly organized, and theoretical. I would overall recommend the course for the vast amount of information it covers, but I would not expect it to be a very enjoyable experience.",
    "Much harder than necessary, do not take if not required by your major. Expect the problem sets to take 6-12 hours and the averages of the tests to be around the 50-60 range.",
    "It's a tough class and I wouldn't recommend it unless you genuinely enjoy math and are willing to put in a lot of hours on the weekly problem sets. That being said, getting the right answer to a problem on a problem set was definitely way more satisfying than in any other class. The math is really cool once it works out, but there are usually a lot of tedious steps along the way. The first midterm was reasonable, the second was a nightmare, but overall the class is manageable if you put the time in. Definitely go to TA office hours and review sessions!",
    "If you want to learn how to solve differential equations for applied math or applied science, this is a great class for you. There's quite a bit of work, but you won't really master the material without it. The material is, in my opinion, not that hard. As someone who did pretty well, I would recommend that when you do problems for practice, just start with a differential equation and try to get at an answer using your memory from lecture. If you can't do it, look at your notes for the first few steps for solving the problem (this should really be all you need), and without looking at the solution, try to reproduce the solution. Until you know the problem from the ground up. Then the method for solving it is pretty much yours. On a test, you won't necessarily be told \"use (such and such) method,\" so being able to recognize why methods are useful in certain contexts is very important.",
    "A challenging course, it is nevertheless manageable if you are willing to start psets when they're assigned and are diligent about reviewing the material in advance of exams. Linear algebra is not necessary, though it is helpful when it comes to understanding some of the concepts. The TA's are great, and Charles Ahn is a very good lecturer. Plus, in the end you will have learned math that gives you important skills and a richer understanding of the physical world.",
    "A standard class in solving differential equations. The worst thing about this class is that they change professors mid semester which is simply not fair. You shop a class, and you decide to take it based on the current professor, and suddenly two months later, someone else is teaching it. I would highly recommend this course if Ahn is ever teaching it again. Ahn teaches brilliantly, and it seems effortless\/second nature to him - it is clear that he has experience teaching this class, and his notes are more organized than the book itself. I enjoyed the latter half of the course much less than the first, just because Prof Stone was much less structured in his approach to lectures, which I found to be very disorienting. If you're taking this class, you probably have to be taking it. You will learn how to solve a ton of differential equations, and overall, it is a good class. One thing, though, the problem sets are absolutely brutal and are due every Thursday - that essentially means you'll never go out on Wednesday nights. They also take an atrocious amount of time during the week, so I would not recommend this class with a schedule that's very pset heavy.",
    "This class is definitely challenging but you will come out of it having earned a lot. Ahn is super great. He is very clear and does tons of examples. Stone is a super nice guy but it is harder to follow his lectures. The problem sets are challenging so you have to be on top of your game. The exams were difficult but not unreasonable. The averages were low but with the curve you'll be fine if you study.",
    "Take it if you have to, interesting material and well taught with Prof. Ahn, but terribly taught with Prof. Stone. Definitely a ton of work.",
    "This class is bonecrushingly hard, but you knew that already -- take this class if you have to for a prereq, but if you just want to take DiffEq, the math department classes cover less content and are significantly easier. Be prepared to spend too many hours each week on the problem sets, and be sure to take this class with friends.",
    "I would not recommend this class, especially if any part of it is being taught by Professor Stone. If this class is required for your major, make sure you take it with a decent teacher. Professor Ahn was a fine lecturer, but not as good as I expected him to be; he also assigns a lot of work, and his tests are difficult. Professor Stones teaching, though, was by far the weakest part of this class. I do not think I took away anything from his portion of the course. If you are interested in simply learning differential equations, take MATH 246. It is a much easier class with a lighter workload, and given the poor quality of teaching of this class, you will probably learn much more from taking it in the math department. The problem sets in this class, even the easy ones, took at least 6 hours, and by the end of the semester, they probably took an average of 10 to 12 hours. Part of the reason they took so long is because the material was not taught well in the lectures, so a lot of it had to be learned outside of class. Also, I would not take this class before taking linear algebra; although it is not a prerequisite, the class did use a lot of linear algebra, and the people who had not taken it struggled in those areas.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS 194 to a fellow student, however with the stipulation that the interesting course material comes at the cost of a lot of work.",
    "It's a lot of work. You have to go to class and take notes because it will get very confusing on your own. A lot of time goes into this class and you have to be willing to put in that work. This class will put your math skills to the test but in my opinion it is worth it.",
    "It is difficult, but not impossible. I would not recommend the class to someone who did not require this class for their major; however, it is a manageable class.",
    "Way more work than you will do for any other class, and most of the stuff you will have to learn on your own. If you have to take it, I recommend that you really make the time for it.",
    "Take ENAS 194. You need it to be a credible scientist, engineer, or mathematician. Do not take this class as exploration. It is easily going to be the hardest class of your semester. Be prepared to commit several days a week to psets. Do not take this course with other intellectually challenging courses. Find a group to study with. You'll need it.",
    "ENAS 194 is as work intensive as everyone makes it out to be; problem sets take upwards of three or four hours (at least, so always try to start them early), and exams can involve tricky manipulations (mostly the second midterm this semester). Besides starting problem sets early, reading the text can help a good deal, especially with the more difficult topics in the second half of the semester. To prepare for exams, go beyond the examples covered in class and\/or the text -- the difficult problems on exams are difficult not because of the concepts, but because of little twists or details that are added to the questions. Hope for Charles Ahn as your professor for the entire semester; Professor Ahn taught the first half of this semester, with Professor Douglas Stone following, whose teaching can only be described as subpar. As an fundamental math, I would recommend ENAS 194, but be prepared for a significant workload (although most students taking the course are taking it as a major requirement).",
    "Unless you must, do not take this class. It is incredibly hard and time consuming.",
    "ENAS 194 is an insanely hard course. At the beginning the concepts were not terribly hard but especially towards the end, the material just became extremely difficult to understand. The work load is not a lot, but the problems on the problem sets can sometimes be unnecessarily hard and long. If you don't need this class for your major, don't take it.",
    "A very intense class, especially when you start working with series solutions, partial differential equations, and Sturm-Liouville equations. The psets are a lot of work and you should start them early, though they really ensure you know the material. For the more difficult topics, having a good instructor is essential-- if not, going to class is a complete waste of time. Overall, a difficult class, though one in which you are assured to learn a lot.",
    "I definitely would recommend this. Although it was required for my major, it was great because I learned a lot of applicable things. It also helped me out in every one of my other classes including linear algebra and physics. If you take this class, EXPECT AT LEAST 20 HOURS OF WORK PER WEEK.",
    "Difficult material and long problem sets, but interesting!",
    "Great course. Learned a TON, learning was accelerated, and compelled me to be disciplined because the problem sets were incredibly long. Could have made some problem sets easier by not introducing as many tricks and obscure math relations. One of the best classes I've taken here because I learned so much. Be warned though that the problem sets and tests are incredibly hard.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's much more difficult than its worth otherwise.",
    "ENAS 194 is a class that will teach you ordinary and partial differential equations and their applications to engineering. The class not only teaches you how to solve these types of problems but contextualizes them in a way that shows how they will be used in engineering fields.",
    "This is an extremely difficult class. ONLY take this class if it is needed for your major. And if you have to take it, try to take it with people you know so you can work on psets together.",
    "A lot of work. You probably have to take this class. If you don't absolutely have to take it, done.",
    "ENAS 194 is a VERY TOUGH CLASS. You will certainly learn a lot of math, but be prepared for 3-day Problem Sets and really hard exams.",
    "I would recommend Diffeq because it is really important and interesting, but I would also warn students not to take it in a heavy semester because it is so much work and so much information stuffed into one semester.",
    "A beast of a class. You'll learn a lot, but this class will consume your life. Make sure you know what you're getting in to. And if you're not a physicist or an engineer, be warned that the class is not taught with you in mind. In general, I'd advise checking out the math department's dif eq class before committing to this one.",
    "Hard.",
    "Take this class if you're ready to be challenged and really want to learn differential equations. If it is part of your major, and you have to take it, put work into it. Do not leave the Psets for the night before they are due, you will not finish them. Good luck in the class, and don't freak out if you feel like you did very badly on a test, because chances are that everyone else did as well.",
    "It's by far one of the most difficult and work intensive classes at Yale. I wouldn't recommend it unless it's necessary for a major",
    "It's an incredibly difficult course, but it's applications are very useful. Be prepared to spend many many hours on psets and studying for midterms--it's the sort of class that reaches a point where a 1-hour review session only provides enough time to hand-solve one problem.",
    "This class is as ambitious and rigorous and one will find at Yale. First and foremost, this class is a ton of work. Psets take anywhere from 10-15 hours to complete and the amount of material covered in the class is near ridiculous. However, all this work does pay off in the end. If you devote yourself to this class and the material you will come away with a strong knowledge of differential equations and their applications, and you will also be a significantly better problem solver. If at all possible TAKE THE CLASS WITH PROF. AHN. Ahn is the man. The split professor teaching in our class resulted in a very sharp contrast between the first and second halves -- Ahn taught the first and lectures were highly effective, Prof. Stone taught the second half and lectures were a complete mess. The contrast between the two halves was very apparent. In every way the first half was highly organized, well taught, and satisfying, the second half fell very short. Frustration, unorganized lectures, and confusion were the themes dominating the latter portion of the year. In a class as rigorous as ENAS 194, the second half was very very difficult to manage and keep up, especially as the harder material is introduced in the latter part of the course. Despite the shortcomings of the end of the course, the overall experience of the class was still a very positive and satisfying one.",
    "To fellow engineers: you probably are required to take this course. To other majors: only take this course if you are very FAST at math, otherwise, you will suffer. When I think of ENAS 194 with Charles Ahn and Doug Stone, I think absurdly long problem sets (10-15 hours of work), good lectures from Ahn, bad lectures from Stone. Before the last two weeks of class, I always felt that it was important to go to lecture. The lecturing professor switched from Ahn to Stone halfway through. Ahn was great and Stone was good for the first few weeks and bad afterwards. There's my experience in ENAS 194 in a nutshell. I have heard that other professors teach the course with shorter problem sets. I would recommend taking it with them if you are not super quick at math.",
    "ENAS 194 was a challenging, yet essential, course that provided an introduction into differential equations. Most engineering majors have ENAS 194 as a prerequisite, but I would also recommend this course for Physics\/Geophysics\/Astrophysics, etc majors. The topics learned in this course will have invaluable applications to higher level research. Additionally, this course ties several different areas in math--linear algebra, calculus, complex algebra--together with applications to physical problems (wave equations, damped oscillatory motion, forced oscillations). Overall, I found this course very valuable, and would definitely recommend it.",
    "Prepareto suffer",
    "Take linear algebra first. Study every chapter with a tutor from the beginning if you don't understand the lectures and make sure you get it.",
    "The course itself is great (challenging definitely, but do-able if you have the time), but watch out for who teaches it. Please don't take it if Prof. Stone is taking it, save yourself the trouble.",
    "ENAS 194 is a difficult class make no mistake. I feel like it is definitely not impossible, but it will take a lot of work. The material can be understood with the aid of a good teacher. The hardest part of this class was the difficulty level of the psets. Be prepared to spend several hours on them each week. However, I definitely feel like I learned differential equations in this class and was very interested in all of the applications.",
    "This class is not taught super well, is a LOT of work, and makes you want to bang your head against the wall so many times over the semester. It covers a lot of topics, and one way or another - you do come out knowing a lot of stuff, but the ride isn't painless. Take one of the Math Diff Eq classes over this if you're looking for the basics, or be prepared to shell out a lot of time for this course.",
    "The hardest class I've taken here, and I've learned almost nothing. Do not take unless it is required for your major. If you do end up taking it, do not take during a semester with 5 classes, and probably don't take it as a freshman at all. Psets in first half take about 10 hours a week, psets in second half take 15+ hours. Make sure to go to review sessions, as the TAs are often better at teaching than the professors. Get ready for a confusing, painful, and time-hogging commitment that will leave even formerly math-loving students almost in tears.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this class, you probably have to do it. It will be hard, and challenging, but not entirely impossible. Hopefully you get to take it with Professor Ahn. If Stone is teaching BEWARE - it will be torture. Go to the review sessions. Go to office hours. Make friends and check p-sets together, and then the class won't be the worst. The tests will be pretty much impossible. Clear out your Tuesday and Wednesday nights, because this class will be all that you're doing. If you dedicate enough time, the class will be okay, but be prepared to work hard.",
    "Doug Stone is not a helpful professor. The psets take between 15 and 25 hours on average with some weeks being more. Charles Ahn writes quickly, but his explanations are clear and thorough. While studying for my final I struggled to find any clear or helpful information in my notes while Stone was teaching.",
    "You've heard about it. You know it's going to be a hard course. But in my opinion the hardest part is not to understand the material in itself. The hardest part is to get yourself to go to every 9am lecture, every TA session and office hour appointment, and to start each pset many days in advance. But if you do all those things, I assure you that you will learn the material and do better than 90% of the class. It's not necessarily a hard course, but it requires a lot of work.",
    "Almost all engineering majors at Yale are required to take this class. If you are exempt, take this class at your own risk. If you are under this requirement as I was, grit your teeth and bear with it. When Professor Ahn was teaching the class, it was challenging but we were still learning. The lectures were invaluable, and the notes were clear. The homework was long but not undoable. Once Professor Stone took over, classes became a blur, and the notes became almost useless. Less people started showing up to lecture. The homeworks became incredibly hard as we walked in to end-of-the-semester material already on shaky legs. On top of it all, the problem sets average 10 to 15 hours a week, with a fair amount of head scratching and smashing heads on tables. The only grace of this is three dropped problem sets a semester, and you WILL need them. For those genuinely interested in the topic, I understand, but the work and stress of this class is simply not worth it. Please consider taking the MATH equivalent, or taking this Credit\/D\/Fail. For all my other engineering majors, best of luck. Also if you do take the class, GO TO REVIEW SESSIONS. Ankit Disa was our TA, and he taught the material better than either of our professors did.",
    "I would summarize this class as a COMPREHENSIVE intro diffeqs class with application. I would only recommend this class to people who are certain they will end up being engineers.",
    "Chances are, you're taking this because you have to. If not, turn back. Please. There is no reason to take this inevitable hit to your GPA unless you absolutely need to. If you need to take this, you'll get through it with the help of friends in the class and the helpful TAs. Truthfully, I found the material really interesting. It lies at the base of a great deal of fascinating scientific phenomena. The inherent difficulty of it can't be avoided though.",
    "If you're considering taking this, you're probably a physics or engineering student. If you aren't, probably don't take it. I've heard that the MATH diff eqs is easier than the ENAS version, so if you have the option do it; this isn't a very good class. This is a hard course. You probably can't do it alone. Go to office hours, with a TA if you're uncomfortable with the professors (Ahn is cool, though I'd be nervous to see Stone alone), and you might even make friends--you'll probably be seeing these classmates again in later courses.",
    "Very tough and challenging but rewarding and totally doable, especially with a professor like Ahn.",
    "This is a really well-taught class that will train you in solving differential equations analytically. The teaching staff is very passionate about the material and provides you with tons of resources to learn. The PSETs are a ton of work, but you'll learn so much crazy stuff by the end!"
