   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any freshman, no matter what your interests are. The topics are extremely interesting--not just the basic Pilgrim\/Revolution topics that you think of when you hear \"early America.\" Many were completely new to everyone in the class. However, they were all extremely accessible. The format of the class means that one class per week is a lecture and the other is a discussion, and that allows us to get a good background on the topic before we do the reading and discuss it. Professor Dubcovsky is an amazing professor who really cares about the subject and her students, and she makes the class discussions feel very comfortable. The class will also teach you very important library skills--you take field trips to a number of libraries and museums, which is incredibly interesting and useful. I will absolutely use the skills I learned (for instance, how to access Yale's incredible archives, or research databases) in many other classes. Finally, the assignments consist of weekly reading and a weekly posting online--very manageable. There are three essays, two shorter and one long final paper. The final paper is amazing because you really have free reign to choose a topic that interests you, even if we didn't cover it at all in class. Professor Dubcovsky walks you through it and makes sure you are on track to succeed. Overall, this was an excellent class, especially if you have any interest whatsoever in history!",
    "This is a great course, especially if you are thinking about the history major. You really learn the ins and outs of the department. It really helps to learn how to write a history paper early on in your time at yale. You get a lot of good exposure to the resources at Yale and Professor Dubcovsky is great and really approachable!!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in history. Class was one war or rebellion per week and then a discussion about that conflict. very student led and beneficial to get more experience in History classes.",
    "Absolutely\u2014I would strongly recommend taking this freshman seminar! Professor Dubcovsky introduces students to all the resources that Yale has to offer. If it were not for this course, I would never have had the opportunity to explore Rare Book Collections, the British Arts Gallery, or the stacks at SML. This course will be show students how to analyze and successfully integrate those resources into papers. War and Rebellion in Early America also takes you though events that are often skipped over in regular US History Courses. From captivity journals to proceedings of conspiracy trials, the readings for this class are also very immersive and absolutely interesting. In addition to traditional lectures, this course is very discussion oriented. Students learn from their peers and engage in enriching discussions about various historical events. Overall, this class has been one of my most favorite at Yale thus far.",
    "This is a course of a particularly grand scope, covering several hundred years of Early American history. however, the course is structured to focus on several key moments and flashpoints throughout the larger epoch, meaning it is usually very manageable. A reading and writing intensive course, Professor Dubcovsky will also press students to ensure they both develop and adequately defend ideas about each individual subtopic. This is a great introduction to the research, reading, and analysis aspects of history courses at Yale.",
    "HIST 023 is an incredible freshman seminar that spends about half the semester on conflicts in early America (think pre-Columbus to colonial America), and the other half of the semester on exploring Yale's extensive library resources and undertaking a research project on a topic of the student's choice (that may be wholly unrelated to the readings done in class). I would CERTAINLY recommend the course to another student, as it provided an amazing orientation to the numerous document collections at Yale (Manuscripts and Archives, the Beinecke, the Yale British Art Gallery, etc.) that I'm certain will give students a leg up as they continue their studies. I greatly appreciated the effort Professor Dubcovsky put in to scheduling days at the library facilities, and found those days to be particularly useful. The course allows students to not only think critically about early American history, but to engage with the amazing resources that Yale has to offer. I utilize the skills I learned through this seminar in each of my classes constantly and have no doubt that they will be immensely useful over the next three years. Thank you.",
    "I would recommend it if you like engaging with primary sources, learning a lot about Indian history, early America, etc. The workload is alright, but make sure you can commit to spending a lot of time researching for your final paper by planning ahead and asking for advice or help with researching.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The professor is wonderful and really cares about her students. She specializes in colonial south Florida. She teaches her students the process behind writing a successful history paper."
