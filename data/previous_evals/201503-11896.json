    "Definitely take it. You write a short story (and smaller weekly assignments) and read some absolutely amazing works of fiction! Professor Sexton is great at leading discussion, although at times I wish he had given more feedback on my writing. The workload is really variable--prepare yourself to read 400 pages of Jane Austen one week, and then two 15 page short stories the next. The last 5 weeks are all just workshopping each other's short stories, which was very fun and not much work. Great low-key class. It's not easy to get in, so you have to demonstrate that you'll be passionate about writing and that you're not just taking the class as a fun extra thing.",
    "ENGL 134 is an awesome creative writing course. There are weekly writing assignments that work on some particular part of the craft, and there is a final short story that is workshopped by your peers. It's interesting to study famous writers and see what can be learned from them. Overall, ENGL 134 is a great course.",
    "ENGL 134 is sort of split mid-semesterfor the first two months, you read a different novel or short story every week, as well as write a 500 word exercise, in order to talk about the various aspects of craft presented in a novel (which each novel focusing on a different element). The second half of the semester, you write a ~10 page short story, which is then read, critiqued, and workshopped by the rest of your classmates. I would recommend this class to anyone who has wanted to write fiction before but has been hesitant to do so up until this pointits a great way to get into the craft elements without feeling pressured to write the next great American novel.",
    "This class is a gentle introduction to writing fiction, and I loved it. I went in to it without much prior experience, and for me this class was a winning combination: you read great books and talk about why they're good. It couldn't be a better intro creative writing class. Take it!",
    "English 134 was a thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening study of classic fictional texts and their authors' style of craft, coupled with a fiction writing component. I would highly recommend this class to beginner fiction writers who are looking for a low stress, formative course. The workload is about equally divided between reading and writing, in case the class' title was a little misleading!",
    "This is a fine course. If you're looking for an excellent creative writing carouse, I wouldn't take it, but it was pretty good. Not for advanced writers, but fine for people like me who don't know what they're doing!",
    "I would recommend English 134 to a student who hasn't done much creative writing in the past and would like the opportunity to learn the basics. It is definitely not the best creative writing class, however, if someone has minimal experience in that field and would simply enjoy the opportunity to write some short stories--I definitely recommend it.",
    "The strengths of a creative writing class are, like we expect, the improvement of our creative writing skills and understanding the story structure. And the inevitable weakness of such a class is the grading system, since I believe as long as you have improved that's what you should be graded on - effort, as it is in the case of visual art classes. That's how classes in the creative arts work out and I'm disappointed it wasn't the case in this class. Professor Sexton was a great teacher, and definitely helped me get a better grasp of how to write stories. I wasn't very happy with how there were some stories he clearly favored over others, which isn't a problem if he explains it according to what he's taught us, but it seemed like more of a preference of style. For example, it was clear that despite teaching us a clear story structure we should check our stories against, he was fond of the more internal conflict type stories that approached this structure in subtler ways. Unfortunately it was difficult to alter our stories that heavily to match his tastes since we had already unveiled our general plot structures in our first draft submissions. Let's just say I was expecting more from a class that had been pretty competitive to get into. If you want to take this class I strongly recommend taking it Credit D before seeing whether your style matches the professor's and go for the letter grade halfway through the semester.",
    "Once a week, one or two readings per week with a 500 word assignment, and then the second half of the semester is all workshopping. I would recommend as a fifth class, or an intro writing class to prepare a short story for submission to higher level classes.",
    "It is a cool way to get to write a story, although I'm not sure I would recommend it. Much to much reading and not enough writing."
