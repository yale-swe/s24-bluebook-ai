    "Take it! If you have any interest in education reform, you will not regret it.",
    "Hello students. Look at your classes. Then back to this. Then back to your classes. Then back to this. Sadly, they aren't Public Schools. But if you start working on your application for Public Schools now, this could be your class. Look down, now up. You're sitting in class with JBS and twenty other brilliant students who are extremely passionate about public schools and politics. Look in your hand. Back over here. It's a casebook, with 200 carefully curated pages on school finance. Look again. The casebook is now diamonds. Anything is possible when you take Public Schools with JBS. I'm on a horse.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Apply early and often, and if you get in, take it. Never will you feel like your time is wasted because JBS has constructed an environment where anything short of your best is pretty much taboo.Interest in education issues is recommended, but not necessary. You talk a lot about the politics behind it, which is applicable to any issue, and you get to be in a class with some of the smartest people at Yale.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. This course is excellent in terms of the material, the people in it, and the professor.",
    "Yes, do it. As everyone says, there is a lot of work, and you will not be able to slack off, but it will be worth it.This is without a doubt the best-taught seminar at Yale. It is sort of amazing: class discussions are a thought-out series of exercises that allow you to work through the issues; the readings are packets of 30-40 articles and supplementary materials compiled in one easy-to-read file by the professor (and updated incessantly); the midterm is a 45-minute chat; etc. etc. You will not find someone at Yale more committed to teaching well.Don't let the course name mislead you - the fact that this is about \"politics\" does not mean it's your average poli sci course where you talk about how various interests play on the political process. Rather, this is about public school governance, and the intricacies of how you create change in the country's schools. There is nothing theoretical in this course (or at least nothing theoretical except insofar as it helps create real policy). Which makes it extremely unique among polisci seminars.Just take it (if you're lucky enough to get in).",
    "YES. Absolutely! You must. Not only will you learn about education, you\u0092ll learn how all of the rest of your classes at Yale should have been taught. Be ready for high expectations, a rigorous professor, well-planned classes, engaging material, a healthy dose of humor and camaraderie among classmates. Simply, the best. #JBS.",
    "As always, JBS brings together the most motivated students, the most important material, and the best-crafted pedagogy. All Yale seminar leaders should take a hint from how this class is structured--small group conversations, reading and preparation enforced through mutual accountability.If you can only choose one, I found the material more interesting in the spring version of this class (schools and policy), though.",
    "Best class at Yale, except for maybe Public Schools and Public Policy, and MAYBE Blacks and the Law if it comes back with Norcott. Just take it.",
    "PLSC 260 is one of the best classes at Yale. 13 cases, 20 brilliant students deeply interested in education, and 1 professor who actually knows what excellent constructivist pedagogy looks like. You must take this course.",
    "PLSC 260 is a rigorous course with dynamic pedagogy that really opens your eyes to the issues that those in our public education system face every single day. I would highly recommend this course. For those critical of public education, you will be able to constructively brainstorm ways to fix the system. For those supportive of public education, you will only further renew your commitment to fixing the broken system. To all those interested in this course, you will learn more than you can imagine, find yourself seeking more opportunities to grow your knowledge, and challenge your preconceived notions. This is one course in which you can change your opinions without reservations and without judgment because your perception is rooted in such thorough discussion and exploration.And did I mention that you'll probably make great friends through this course and opt to have your study group sessions over an ice cold beer late at night? What's not to love?",
    "Take it. This class is amazing.",
    "?Public Schools and Politics\u0094 is one of the best courses at Yale. The course is special for who teaches it, how it is taught, and who takes it with you. John Bryan Starr, or JBS, is a pleasant, grandfather-aged professor who will startle you with his tireless dedication to preparing course materials and reading and responding to your written work. JBS is a master pedagogue. The course is structured such that all students are pushed to perform to their greatest ability and improve. Each class meeting concerns one case (there are 11 cases in total, with topics such as \u0093Politics of School Finance Reform\u0094 or \u0093Politics of Mayoral Control of Public Schools\u0094). Students begin the week reading a 175-page casebook that includes roughly 50 pages of theoretical foundation, 25 pages of background on the case, and 100 pages on the case itself. Early in the week, students then meet in small groups (required), to discuss the casebook and prepare clarification questions for class, which JBS then answers. Each student individually completes a reading response prior to class time. Class time is itself very structured, with discussion topics broken into puzzle-like pieces that students work on individually in small groups before reuniting to discuss with the class as a whole. All students participate. Following class, students evaluate their performance and each other\u0092s online. A revision to your reading response, which benefits from the new ideas you should have gleaned through discussion, is then due. And, you\u0092re on to the next casebook. Of course, this leads to the third great part of the course: the students who take it with you. They are all willing to do this work together and in the process of doing it you will grow to know one another very well. At the end of the course, JBS takes you out for dinner and it is great.",
    "This class is unlike any other at Yale. Each class is spent in \"rounds\" where the students break off into different groups and tackle different questions that the professor asks. The classes are more about putting students in groups and having them solve problems using the information they've learned from the readings (rather than a professor just sitting there and seeing who did the readings by summarizing\/discussing them).You shouldn't take this class if you're not interested in public education, because the workload can be a lot if you don't care about it. But if you are interested in education, there is no better class at Yale.",
    "I don't think I'll ever stop appreciating the amount that I learned from my classmates, the casebooks, the assignments, and JBS. Talk about an education.",
    "I recommend this course (and 240) more than I've ever recommended another course at Yale. It is a rigorous evaluation of the politics surrounding education reform in the United States. Everyone at Yale should take this course. It embodies everything a liberal arts class should be.",
    "TAKE IT. Absolutely positively take it if you can get in. You can't ask for a better professor than JBS, and and you can't ask for a better-designed or better-run course than his two public schools classes. Take both if you can, so long as you're interested in the topics. This class is all about creating a community of learners, and learning from each other, and workshopping ideas, though, so if you want a Yale seminar where you just argue from your preconceived notions and don't listen to classmates, don't take this class."
