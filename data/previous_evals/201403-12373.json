    "Good course if you want get straight to the mathematical details (i.e. multivariable calculus, gradient, curl, divergence, etc) of college physics without having to endure potentially hand-wavey explanations. Possible even if you haven't done AP physics, especially if you like mathematical explanations. On other hand, potentially repetitive if you've already done both E&M and Mechanics for AP Physics and understood the content well.",
    "As a non-physics\/math major I thought I'd take the class to challenge myself. Be prepared for freshman geniuses and people who have already seen and or mastered most of the material. Baltay is a good lecturer, but occasionally presumes a lot of prior knowledge. Workload is very light, but if its your first time being exposed to the concepts it will require a lot of studying. Midterm is fair, but be prepared to study your butt off for the final.",
    "I would not recommend this course. If you want to be a physics major I would recommend instead either take PHYS 200 or just skip to PHYS 410 depending on your math background. Two main problems with this course stick out to me. One is that the lectures themselves are bad. The professor actually comes into class, copies his notes onto the blackboard, and leaves. He often makes mistakes when he does this too but no one can ever speak up so that he will listen. It doesn't matter because he always gets the final answer right- its written in his notes. The second issue with the course is that it goes too fast. Not in the intense you-just-have-to-learn-fast kind of way, but in the today-we-are-doing-harmonic-motion-next-week-we-are-doing-Lagrangian-mechanics-and-the-following-week-we-are-doing-relativity kind of fast. You don't actually get time to discuss any of these cool topics. He just goes over the basic idea and moves on- you never see it again. This is just a survey class with some hard problems in it, the actual classes are listed in the 400s. Also, it might look flashy to have Quantum and GR in the second semester, but the first semester is boring. The psets are manageable in one or two sittings. If you do end up taking this class- you DO actually have to know that equation sheet he tries to scare you with at the beginning of the class. You do not have to know multivariable to the depth that MATH 120 will get you, but you do have to know every equation on that sheet (this probably won't be apparent until the final when he throws a bunch of hard questions on a sheet).",
    "At the beginning of the semester, I was choosing between PHYS 260 or 200 or 180. I am a chemistry major and it's been a while since I took physics in high school. I kind of wanted to take an easier class, but when I shopped 200 and 180 I was so bored, whereas 260 was pretty challenging for me but was a really really interesting class. I think I made a right choice by taking 260 instead, even though I struggled a lot and I was probably the least talented physics student in class. If you spend enough time studying and ask TAs questions, this course is doable and you actually learn a lot.",
    "If you have the math background for it, or have taken physics before, definitely consider taking 260, especially given the nightmare that some other physics courses can be. (For example, physics 200 doesn't even have lectures; you watch the lectures on your own and then take daily pop quizzes in class). But 260 is great, I learned a lot and the course wasn't too stressful.",
    "Basically this class is good if you really like math and physics.",
    "I had only taken a non-calculus-based mechanics class prior to this course, so it was definitely a little bit tough for me. It is very fast paced and makes heavy use of multivariable calculus, but the work load itself is fairly average and the physics concepts are standard. I would recommend it to prospective physics majors.",
    "I would not recommend physics 260 to another student. However, if a student wants to major in physics, they really have no other choice. I hope that this class does not discourage too many prospective physics majors.",
    "Great introductory physics course - Professor Baltay is truly a great lecturer. Math 120 can be taken with this course, but some of the mathematical concepts from this course may have to be self-taught as it will not be taught in Math 120 until later on in the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 260 to anyone who is interested in learning more about physics than just the general equations. It goes very in-depth into the subject material. However, PHYS 261, the following class, may be much more difficult, so students should look at both parts of the course before signing up.",
    "Must take course for physics majors. Interesting, essential material. Graded equitably. Psets aren't that bad, but you must know everything presented to you in class and in the book for the test.",
    "It involves some very complicated and difficult subjects, but not a huge amount of work. Only take the class if you are very comfortable with multi variable calculus and concepts such as stoke's and divergence theorems. Even though it is difficult, it is so worth taking the class.",
    "PHYS 260 is a fantastic class and I would recommend it to anyone who has the background for it. I'd taken AP Physics C in high school, so I felt prepared for this class. I thought it moved at just the right pace, and I've come out of it feeling that I've gained an important understanding of physics. The homeworks are not too burdensome and the tests are fair. Baltay is great, and is another main reason that I'd recommend this course!",
    "\"Say we have a charged potato...\" In all seriousness though, I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great introductory physics class for those who have taken AP Physics C or the equivalent in high school.",
    "Physics 260 is a good review of mechanics and e&m, with some new interesting things thrown in, and I would recommend it if you have the requested qualifications and physics background. It's possible to take with Math 120, especially if you have some familiarity with multivariable calculus.",
    "Very solid course to take after AP Physics C. Reviews basic concepts then stretches them much further. Also a nice introduction to Lagrangians and relativity. If you don't have the mat background, would strongly recommend self-studying it all sooner rather than later. The final is brutal so watch out for that.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that Physics 260 is basically a full year of AP Physics C taught in one semester, with a few extra topics and formulas that are not taught in AP Physics C. This means it is a fast paced course and would be extremely difficult to keep up with if all the material were brand new. So I would recommend this class only to a student who took AP Physics C and had a strong grasp on it. I wouldn't recommend this course for an EXTREMELY strong Physics student either who took AP Physics C, because most of the \"new topics\" (not taught in AP Physics C) that are or sound really cool are taught in Physics 261, not 260. The only cool new topics covered in 260 are Lagrangian Mechanics and Special Relativity and the rest would seem like review to the brightest of kids. (Personally I appreciated the review of Mechanics and E and M because the class allowed me to understand it with many new layers of depth ). So I would recommend that the brightest of kids self teaches themselves Lagrangian Mechanics and Special Relativity and then takes 261 where the bulk of the \"cool new topics\" will be taught. I would most certainly recommend this class to a student who was strongly prepared in AP Physics but is not a genius either.",
    "Physics 260 01 (the first semester) goes over many of the topics you may be familiar with from AP Physics or its equivalent, but rather than presenting formulae and expecting the student to take them on faith, it takes a more thorough, twofold approach. Wherever possible it offers fully rigorous mathematical derivations in parallel to the tangible examples and thought experiments that provide the intuitions for problem solving and conceptual understanding. This equal attention to general and specific solutions is in my view the most rewarding aspect of PHYS 260 so far.",
    "You should probably have a class that has covered mechanics, EM, and MV in the past or else it will be very easy to get lost and confused.",
    "A possible summary of physics 260 is a rapid review of some physics concepts seen in advanced high school classes, but with the sprinkling of some new things never seen before like lagrangians.",
    "Phys 260 is an incredibly fast paced and difficult class. Only take it if you love physics and you're good at it; in that case you will have fun and learn a lot.",
    "First thing's first: 230 is not necessary to take this class. In fact, if you don't already know multivariable\/vector calculus, it's probably better to take 120. Baltay will try to scare you off during the first class, but don't be intimidated--it's not that bad. Make sure to work with others on the problem sets, though, because if you get stuck on a problem you pretty much have to ask another student for help. The midterm and final are fair, but definitely prepare for them.",
    "If you have a good math background, this class can be fairly easy. The class is very math based. This class is just an introduction to classical mechanics, E&M, and other things. If you want more in depth knowledge about these things, skip this and take a classical mechanics course, and\/or an E&M course and such. The workload isn't bad, you have about a p-set a week, and they're not bad.",
    "Physics 260 is not the best class I have ever taken, and I would only recommend you take it if an intro physics class is required for your major. However, if you are looking for a fun class to take outside of your major, then this is not what you are looking for.",
    "Physics 260 was a great course. It was a fast-paced introduction to mechanics, relativity and electrodynamics. There was certainly some review from high school AP Physics, but we went much further in to depth and covered several completely new topics. It was nice to take this course after a multivariable calculus course (I took 120 and 225 last year and am now a sophomore) and as such, actually understand some of the math underlying the physics. As for the instructor, Professor Baltay is truly amazing -- he turned even the driest subjects into interesting topics; and he went fast enough through them so as to save time for the more interesting material. And some material was truly fascinating -- you derive E=mc^2 and look at some pretty cool, yet advanced E\/M theories. The homework was completely reasonable (roughly 10 problems per week) and the exams were pretty fair. I've learned a lot and I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Physics. Looking forward to 261 next semester!",
    "If the student was interested in physics and knew calculus but didn't have a specific area of physics they wanted to focus on, I feel that they would probably enjoy physics 260, learn a lot, and gain some perspective in which areas of physics they would like to explore further. I'd recommend they bring a jacket to class.",
    "TL;DR: PHYS 260 is awesome! Take it. The lectures are fantastic and the grading is not too hard. And MATH 230 is an amazing course, but is not the only option, and it is fine to take MATH 120 instead. PHYS 260 is a great course. It covers Mechanics, Special Relativty and Electromagnetism (EM) in a rapid though absurdly clear sequence of lectures. Prof. Baltay is a great professor. Funny and easy-going, he truly engages in bringing as much content as he can to each of his lectures. *GRADING The grading consists of weekly psets (25%), one Midterm on Mechanics (25%) and one Final (50%). The level of the Psets and tests is way easier than the level of the lectures. Then, if you get the lectures and do well on the psets, you should not worry about your final grade (indeed, most of the students get an A). *WARNING: MATH 230? During Reading Period, Prof. Baltay will highly recommend that students in PHYS 260 take MATH 230 as its Math counterpart. DO NOT WORRY. I took MATH 230 and it is an awesome, challenging course, but could not be less necessary for PHYS 260. It is perfectly fine to take other introductory Math courses (E.g. MATH 120) alongside with PHYS 260. Indeed, if you don't want to take MATH 230, just don't take it.",
    "I would recommend this course but only to someone who is very interested in physics. The topics are advanced but also interesting and the coursework is not too taxing."
