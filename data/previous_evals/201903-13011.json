    "I learned an immense amount in this course of my roots in Latin America. I was able to participate in a learning environment that explain things beyond the said curriculum or syllabus. From seeing limited-access films, to discussions on the histories and struggles of Latin American countries, to conversation about current struggles and continuous political cycles that discriminate and marginalize that are still in place--the course gave me a comprehensive view of Latin America life, culture and politics through the comparative nature of films.",
    "This is a unique class not only at Yale but elsewhere. The topic, the access to the films that are taught, the opportunity of learning from one of the most important scholars on Latin American film, culture, political history, and thought, made this course and unique and invaluable experience. The way the course is organized allows the students to have a comprehensive understanding of Latin American film in close relationship to the politics and the debates that were taking place at the moment not only in the continent but on a global scale. This course provides an outstanding frame for thinking Latin American film and culture in their own terms, without imposing models of thoughts of any kind.",
    "Professor Fradinger's class gives a comprehensive view of Latin American cinema, approaching the main titles and manifestoes, and focusing in a seminal period of film production in the region. The classes were illuminating and showed that Latin American filmmakers were addressing the same questions, and were in dialogue with each other while trying to engage with the history and politics of their own countries, pointing to the relations between global and local."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The immense strength of the course is its horizontality--its fully comprehensive approach to various topics concerning Latin America (from language, to image, to text, to tune). I would highly advise other comparative literature courses to be of similar nature, especially when regarding a specific region, as exemplary of how to feel immersed in different culture through a literature (i.e. film approach). However, I think the classroom could have served of less \"personal narrative\" so that we could engage with the films stronger on certain weeks--though I acknowledge that this is more dependent on the types of personalities that sign up to take a mentally, emotionally, and physically radical course like this one.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course is that it did not have any weaknesses. The course is well organized and the screenings make available movies that are rarely shown in the United States. The discussions were rich and very open since Professor Fradinger created a safe space where every opinion, idea, thought was understood as important and, therefore, respected. It was exceptional how Professor Fradinger was able to engage everyone in the discussions and how she managed to create an inclusive dialogue that is not to be found anywhere on this campus. What is more, she encouraged all of us to think in our terms, never imposed any ideas or opinions, rather she let us discuss and engage with each other's ideas and positions so that the knowledge was built on an exceptional collective experience."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course for the content and professor Moira. This course feels like its own world in the midst of the Yale bubble, in the best way possible. It's a highly immersive experience that requires mental and emotional devotion which harnesses a great learning curve.",
    "I would unquestionably recommend this course to another student. This is a unique opportunity to learn about a widely understudied topic, especially at Yale, but also it is a great experience that creates community and friendships. At the academic level, this class will open totally new ways to understand not only Latin American cinema, but culture, history, and thought. The in-depth knowledge that Professor Fradinger provides is a chance that no one interested in Latin America or in cinema, in general, should miss. At a personal level, this class was an oasis. If the rest of my classes at Yale are generally hostile spaces, where tension is felt in the air, and where the rigid structures of the most traditional education govern, Professor Fradinger's class was a space of freedom and learning through collective experience and an inclusive environment.",
    "Yes. Particularly from the 1960's on, cinema is one of the strongest components of Latin American culture, addressing contemporary issues, and serving to not so much to convey messages, but rather to urge people to think. Besides, it has been often served as a point of convergence from other arts."
