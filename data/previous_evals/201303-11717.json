   "comments": [
    "Econ 121 is much more rigorous than the intro micro class at yale and AP Micro. It sucks, but it's a necessary evil if you want to be an econ major. In my opinion, the pests are the worst, but the midterms were more manageable.",
    "prof samuelson knows the material and knows how to teach it. class is all about developing models and then applying them in psets. prof makes elegant powerpoints and tries to make real-life scenarios in psets. psets can be confusing - 50% of time is spent decoding problem.",
    "Take if you're going to pursue a degree in Economics, otherwise it's too big of a time commitment and mental strain to really be worth its weight.",
    "I realize that many students will probably say don't take this course unless you plan on being an economics major, but the mathematical insight into economic models Professor Samuelson gives is both useful and interesting. I would recommend the course to expand your knowledge on microeconomic concepts even if you are not an economics major. The workload is not that bad: weekly problem sets (except after an exam), two midterms and a final.",
    "Buckle up kiddos. You're a prospective Econ, Global Affairs, EP&E major. You've made it through the intro courses and are ready for the required higher level micro course. Congratulations. You've made it to the \"weeding\" course. What makes this a weeding course you ask? The fact that it is taught at 9 freaking AM, impossible weekly psets and incredibly dense and incomprehensible material. Find a smart friend, a good tutor, or something extra to make it through. See you on the other side compatriot. Moral ofthe story; the people who check \"no\" under the will you use this course for credit for your major are insane. There is no reason to suffer through this course unless you have to. And let's face it, you probably have to.",
    "If you're required to take this class, definitely take it with Larry. He's clear and articulate. Although the material is hard, if you pay attention in class and do all of the problem sets, you will mostly understand the material. Intermediate is an important foundational class, so it's good to be in a class that will at least teach you something.",
    "Yes. Professor Samuelson is one of the best Intermediate Microecon professors around.",
    "Everyone takes this class as a req for some major. It's tough, and you have to do it.",
    "Lots of math, might be difficult to understand initially but the professor focuses a lot on the economics behind the math, which makes it more manageable.",
    "It is unnecessarily hard, if you are good at math (switching from a mathy or engineering major), you will be fine. If you aren't too comfortable with math, this class may be a struggle. I would recommend it only if you have sharp math skills.",
    "The content is relatively straightforward; Samuelson is brilliant but very inconsistent as a lecturer; and the workload is normal for this kind of class.If you're taking this class, it's probably required for your major. The general consensus seems to be that Samuelson's class has toughergrading but better teaching than the other options; but since by definition nobody ever takes ECON 121 with two different professors, I recommend that you don't put very much faith in that little bit of so-called \"conventional wisdom.\"The thing with this class is that Samuelson is one of the most intelligent, rational, and clear speakers on the face of the planet. This shines through during review sessions...but he loses all of that grace as soon as he starts giving a prepared lecture. His PowerPoint slides meshed awkwardly with his speech, leading to a fair amount of confusion. And the problem sets are absolutely riddled with typos and accidental ambiguities (not the kind of intentionally difficult questions that would be appropriate for an econ class). The psets are also lopsided: the theory will take about 15 minutes to solve. The complicated algebra might take five hours.You'll survive this just fine, but it's a shame that the Yale economics department doesn't work harder to make these introductory classes more relevant to the actual world around you.",
    "If you are interested in understanding the mathematical models behind all the economic concepts rather than just seeing which way the demand curve goes, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "If you're an econ major and have to take this class, I recommend that you take it with Samuelson. He's a good lecturer and is super helpful if you have questions or need extra help.",
    "Take it for the econ major, and take it with Samuelson.",
    "This will be a challenge. You will have a problem set per week that is pretty impossible, without very clear instructions and very very very difficult math. You will spend around 8 hours in the worst problem set. That does not make it easy to understand the concepts, which are not hard, and complicates the general understanding of the subject. The midterms are relatively easy, doable, and fair. The TAs usually do not help. The professor is good and enthusiastic, but jumps to conclusions extremely fast. The slides jump from A to Z without explaining in the middle, and that does not help understand the process through which students are expected to solve the problems. If you absolutely have to take it, go ahead.",
    "It's not a lie when people say this class is dry and lots of work. Prof. Samuelson, while not the most interesting lecturer, did a good job of conveying the information and stopped often to ask the class if they had questions. Wouldn't recommend the class if you don't need it, but Samuelson is a good choice if you do.",
    "What you would expect an intermediate microeconomics course to be, Professor Samuelson is great though. Just ensure you have a good teaching fellow.",
    "I enjoyed this class. It was pretty math heavy, but the class as a whole was very straightforward. The psets also took a fair amount of time each week.",
    "Look, you have to take it if you're here. If you're not required to take it, don't, because you're not going to learn a lot of really useful economic skills. That being said, it's not terrible, and you'll learn a lot.",
    "If you're an econ major you have to take it. If you're not, there are other probably more interesting econ classes out there",
    "9 am is brutal. That is really all there is to it. Samuelson is a good lecturer... if you can stay awake. Most of this class is literally going to be taking a random utility function and optimizing it. Not the most stimulating course, though it is more interesting than most people make it out to be.",
    "Yes, I would, but only if he or she has to take this class.",
    "Larry S is the man. tough psets, but definitely worth it.",
    "Chances are that if you're taking the course, you're an economics major so you have to take this anyway. If you're trying to decide between this class and Micro Theory, take the latter only if you're very comfortable with math.",
    "Only if you want 10 hours of homework every week...",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you have it. Difficult, small curve, time-consuming problem sets.",
    "It was awful. It was intro micro with some calculus and convoluted processes of solving problem. The lecture notes weren't very clear and the 9:00 am time slot is not too great either. The psets were just too hard as well. There aren't any redeeming qualities.",
    "Skip the 9th pset - you can drop one, it's horrible and it won't be on the final.",
    "only if it is required",
    "Actually, there wasn't much of a need to attend class. (I don't recall ever going to class this semester, for example. 9am lessons zzz.) You can learn everything from the slides. You just need to be fairly competent at algebra and calculus. It's a compulsory class if you're an econ major though. Samuelson strikes me as a very helpful, conscientious kind of prof -- he answers every question on the classesv2 forum, no matter how irrelevant it might be. Tests are easy except for the final, which was not overly fun.",
    "Solid class. Not too hard if you have a good study group to do the PSETS with (they take 10+ hours a week). Tests are straightforward if you do all the practice midterms. Not much math background required.",
    "One of the toughest classes of the Econ major, you just need to get through it. Pay attention and learn as you go, its tough to catch up if you fall behind. The problem sets were overly difficult, find people to work with. I recommend paying more attention to past midterms\/finals when studying as the slides covered very little of what was on the exams.",
    "Difficult, but worthwhile if you put in the time. It's a requirement for economics majors and does make people doubt if economics is the right major for them. It's a good course and I've heard you should take it with Samuelson.",
    "First 2 midterms are easy, final exam is hard. Last 1\/3 of the course is really where things get tricky.",
    "Take the class if you only need to.",
    "Better to take intro micro first before taking this course. Problem sets are tricky, but usually based on what's covered in lecture notes.",
    "If you have to Intermediate then take it with Samuelson!It will be as pain free as possible.",
    "One thing I cannot emphasize enough about taking this class is that you should definitely TAKE IT WITH A FRIEND (or as many friends as possible), because it makes it a lot more bearable and less daunting.",
    "Very difficult requirement of ECON major. Take only if you have to.",
    "Not enjoyable, but not too difficult. Be sure to shop for TAs because some are extraordinarily bad while others are helpful.",
    "Recommended for econ majors only. You spend a semester maximizing utility in different ways. Have fun.",
    "Take it if you have to or have a deep interest in microeconomics, otherwise don't. Professor Samuelson is a good lecturer who explains the material well, but be aware that the problem sets are quite challenging.",
    "Only if you need to. Professor Samuelson is a good lecturer but the problem sets were overly tedious. Also, the curve is extremely skewed - almost impossible to get an A but really hard to get anything less than a B. Don't completely discount taking the spring version of this course.",
    "Yes. It's required for a number of majors, but great and interesting material nonetheless. The key is to understand the takeaways of each lecture, or you'll just get caught up in all the numbers and variables.",
    "Definition: everything you learned in introductory microeconomics but with more math. Passionate, good lecturer with very helpful lecture notes. Difficult problem sets.",
    "Only if it's required.",
    "Econ 121 was a logical progression from Intro Micro and focuses heavily on mathematical concepts. While several different topics are covered, almost every topic is centered on utility maximization\/cost minimization, and that technique can be applied to almost every topic. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't need it for the major, but that's only because more time is spent focusing on the math behind concepts than on the concepts themselves, and I'm sure there are better classes to teach the concepts to someone who is simply curious or wanting to learn about the them.",
    "An introduction to the mathematical techniques of Microeconomics - multivariable calc highly recommended - Prof. Samuelson's eagerness for the subject is contagious, and he goes above and beyond to make himself available to students",
    "I would only recommend this class to econ majors--otherwise, it just seems like a lot of work and stress for little reason. That said, econ121 is not impossibly difficult, even for non-econ majors. If you want to take it as a pre-req for other classes, don't be scared away by all the negative evals from previous years.If you have to take the class, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR SAMUELSON. His lectures are very clear and straightforward, and he is very very willing to help you understand the material. Problem sets are definitely more math-heavy than either the midterms or the final, but if you get started on them early enough, you can visit an econ tutor to get help. This year, the midterms weren't too difficult, but the final was a little tricky. As long as you go consistently to lectures (there's no assigned textbook to read), you should be fine.",
    "This course is the worst course I have taken at Yale. I did better than average in the class, but Larry is an absolutely terrible professor, the workload is way too high, and the students are all very stressed out about the class. The only reason you should ever take this class is that you are a prospective Economics major. Otherwise, avoid this class like the plague. The lectures and problem sets\/tests have nothing to do with each other. Larry lectures for an hour about basic and intuitive concepts and then the problem sets can sometimes be over 10 hours long and have nothing to do with what he taught. The same goes for tests. I would not recommend this course to a fellow student, but considering that you are probably taking this course as a requirement, you have no choice. Sucks to be you.",
    "; I really liked this class, but Samuelson gives way too much work. He also is a raving conservative rightwinger--something to bear in mind. I swear we had an entire pset on why social security is evil--he's like Newt Gingrich or something",
    "It's a requirement for the econ major, but if you're not an econ major, looking for a general economics class to take, I'd recommend ECON 121. The intro classes don't involve calculus, so they're a bit too simplistic, if you're looking for just one course.",
    "This class is definitely really, really hard. Although there is only one problem set a week, they take a long time and the material is very challenging. Larry Samuelson is an awesome professor, though, so if you take it, take it with him! The class is hard, but there are some really cool lectures and some of the concepts are pretty interesting.",
    "Do. Not. Take. Unless you're an econ major, in which case, by all means take it with Samuelson.",
    "Take it! Professor Samuelson is an excellent instructor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just listen to what he has to say, and you should be fine. The class, however, is difficult. The concepts are hard, the problem sets are long and complicated, and the final exam was a monstrosity. The section should have been much more effective than it was. But you do learn a lot of fascinating theory, which is taught very well indeed. I suspect that you have to take it for your major. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would still suggest that you give it a shot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult, but good.",
    "A really, really, really unnecessarily difficult course that you just need to get through. You will not learn anything and you probably will never use anything you \"learn\" in the class. So... no, I would not recommend this class.",
    "This course is pretty dry. I'd describe it as intro microecon but with multivariable calculus, which doesn't make it much more difficult. If it's at 9am, take micro theory (unless that's also at 9am) or wait until the class is not at 9am to take this. Professor Samuelson is a great professor, so that's a big plus, and the problem sets aren't too hard. If you don't want to be an economics or an economics and mathematics major, don't take this course (but who takes this for fun?) Otherwise, it's not the most fun class, but it's not gonna kill you.",
    "Intermediate micro unanimously is quite tough. I especially would not recommend it to freshmen- most of the freshmen I met in the class said the material was far too advanced and overwhelming for them. The problem sets were very difficult and often contained material that was not covered in class. Luckily the curve is fair, but unless you are very interested in math\/proof-based theoretical econ or need to take this class for your major, I wouldn't take it.",
    "Take this class if its required for your major.Its harder course material, but it's pretty well taught. The homework's are a major pain and will eat up hours of your weekends. However, the exams are very fair, and with a reasonable amount of work, you can get a good grade.",
    "Very tough course, but obviously necessary for Econ majors. Take it with Samuelson, and do the pests on your own.",
    "Take it if you want to major in Economics; otherwise, don't.",
    "As the semester goes on, the number of hours it takes to complete a p-set creeps scarily close to double digits. The number of nights pulling out your hair steadily magnify. The number of bad econ jokes you unconsciously crack multiply until they taint your social interactions. Previous evaluations do not lie: this is a tough class, intended to make hopeful econ majors contemplate the utility of death. But even so, I would venture to say that this was a tough class, but also a great class. Professor Samuelson is a great lecturer and an all-round great person. No question is a dumb question - and even if it is, he will find a way to reframe it so it feels like you just asked the most brilliant question in the history of economics. He takes the time to answer any number of questions during lecture, maintains a forum to answer more questions on classesv2, and personally attends all the exam review sessions rather than just having a TA staff them. I have no grounds for comparison (thank god, I suppose), but if you do decide to take Intermediate Micro, I urge you to take it with Samuelson.",
    "Only take this if it is a requirement of your major otherwise it's really time consuming and stressful.",
    "Honestly, it is not as bad as rumor has it to be. If you are an Economics major, you kinda need to take it, so since you don't have a choice anyway, you might take it with Professor Samuelson. For those non-Econ majors, you might find it rather tedious but it isn't impossible.",
    "Take it if you need to. otherwise, it's pretty boring and difficult.",
    "Yes.",
    "Mandatory",
    "1) Intermediate Micro is not nearly as bad as most people will tell you. It was a very manageable class. (That is coming from someone who's probably average in econ and math).2) Larry Samuelson is great. I don't know who else teaches the class, but I'd definitely recommend Samuelson.",
    "Take it if you have to. Pay close attention to the first unit as the techniques learned will be used for the rest of the semester just with different applications. Practice midterms and finals will be the best way to study.",
    "If you enjoy Econ and do not mind math, absolutely.",
    "It's micro Econ. It's hell. The psets are horrible. There is no curve. But you have to take it.",
    "It is a good class for econ students, but I won't recommend it to students who are not econ majors. It's enough to learn the stuff in Intro Micro. For econ students, the explanations behind the basic theories are quite important.",
    "If you're an Econ major, obviously, but if not, no. Apart from maximizing functions subject to constraints using Lagrange multipliers (which you can learn better in a multivariable calc course), you do not learn much in this course that you don't learn in intro micro. If you're an Econ major, then you must. I would recommend Prof. Samuelson, though 9am was brutal for this kind of class.",
    "This class is necessary but kind of fun in a weird way. Samuelson was incredible. He somehow made intermediate micro interesting which is difficult to do. He was very clear and helpful and we all appreciated it. Take it with him!!!",
    "As a required class, there is not much to get around it, but it certainly solidifies intro micro. The topics are explored in detail and lengthy algebra, but prof Samuelson is great.",
    "No.",
    "more difficult and more math-based than intro. not super difficult if you are capable in math and basic calculus. not super interesting for non-econ majors",
    "gotta take it for econ, but the struggle isn't awful. just bear down and stay on top of the course.",
    "Intro Econ with more math. Purely neoclassical.",
    "If you are not an Econ major\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 NO",
    "You're taking this because you have to I assume? But prof Samuelson is great. Go to class",
    "A bad course. All you do is learn how to use one method to solve maximization problems. I found intro micro very interesting, but this course is not, as it rarely effectively connects what you learn to the real world, which is disappointing since nearly anything can be connected with microeconomics. There are an insane number of typos. Some typos interfere with understanding what is trying to be said (like when reviewing lecture slides), while others are ridiculous, like writing \"pubic goods\" on a lecture slide.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you're extremely interested in economics and looking for a bit of a challenge. The problem sets are not as bad as they're cracked up to be. Professor Samuelson is great.",
    "This class requires a lot of work, but if you put in the time, the material can be understood. Prof. Samuelson is a great lecturer who keeps you engaged at all times and makes you more interested in the material. That said, the material is not inherently that interesting, so I would only recommend this course to those who need it for their major.",
    "If its a prerequisite I'd recommend obviously, but otherwise probably not.",
    "On bad days, it seemed like the idea was to represent a complicated situation with a simple equation and then manipulate that equation at random for an hour. On good days, it was a well-organized class that provided a basis for further classes in economics.",
    "yes good class",
    "Econ 121 was a step up from Econ 115, and was not too much harder than it. It gave a manageable theoretical framework for ideas in Econ 115. Very good in general.",
    "Overall it was difficult, but well-taught. Samuelson is a good lecturer, but he moves quickly and packs a lot of material into each class. Section could have been more helpful had the TA's reviewed material a bit in addition to just answering questions about the problem sets, which many people hadn't looked at yet before section. Take it if you have to. It's not particularly enjoyable. Take it with Samuelson too because he is great with the material.",
    "Yes. Samuelson is an excellent and engaging teacher. He wants his students to learn, and that is visible in his lectures.",
    "Take it with Samuelson - he's definitely the most engaging Econ teacher that I have had at Yale.",
    "Good class.",
    "Absolutely not, unless you need it for your major. Actually, I really have no clue why you would take this class if you don't need to. It's pretty much just solving intro micro problems using basic multivariable calc, really boring stuff. Problem set every week, and they can get fairly long and involved. Samuelson is a decent lecturer and seems to genuinely enjoy helping students, although he's a bit inconsistent with the difficulty of assignments. The first two midterms were easier than the problem sets and the final was much more difficult than anything covered in class or homework.",
    "Yes , I would recommend the class. It is difficult, but very interesting",
    "DONT TAKE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE FORCED TO! Its very difficult.",
    "It's hard! But it's good. You'll learn a lot.",
    "If you have to take this class, take it with Larry. You will have to work hard but if you out in the effort this class isn't bad at all. Overall I enjoyed it.",
    "Yes if you really liked intro micro",
    "I would recommend it. It's a hard class, yes, but it's really rewarding. The problem sets are hard, yes, but they're doable if you have a good study group and the TAs don't grade very harshly at all. The exams are very fair and you have access to 6 previous years exams to practice. You won't learn very many new economic concepts in this class, but you will learn more mathematical techniques to help you analyze the economic concepts you already know. And of course, you should take the course because of Professor Samuelson. It's such a pleasure to be in his class. He's always accessible for questions (although his office is kind of far) and he puts a lot of effort into his lectures. He even personally holds review sessions for us before tests. His lectures are also slightly funny, which is great. Most of you would not venture here if you weren't econ majors, but if you are an econ major, you should definitely not be afraid to take this class.",
    "Only take this class if you need it for a major",
    "Hard. The psets will drive you crazy. The curve is ridiculous. But in the end I guess it's worth it",
    "Samuelson was an amazing professor, a great lecturer who really cared about his students as opposed to professors teaching intro classes who never really cared about students in their class. Overall, the class was tough, but still interesting. I recommend taking it for credit if you can.",
    "A deeper, non theoretical study of microeconomics. I would recommend the class only to those considering the economics major.",
    "I totally recommend this class. I found Professor Samuelson's teaching to be absolutely great, I loved the lectures, never missed a single one despite them being at 9am on Monday after the Pset was due. It only hard if you leave the Pset until Sunday!! If you do a problem a day, it's a piece of cake!!",
    "This class is incredibly challenging. The material is very dense and the curve, especially with the class this semester, was unforgiving. Samuelson is a good teacher, but if you are concerned about your GPA, I highly recommend taking it in the Spring when the curve will be more in your favor. As far as section TF's go, do your best to get Dongkyu. He's amazing and has awesome powerpoint slides that were a HUGE help for the psets.",
    "Take it if you have to. If not, you'd be a fool to subject yourself to this class that is at once difficult, boring and useless.",
    "I would say it is an intensive study of some of the most baseline economic models. It is a lot of understanding economics through math and math notation. I would only recommend this class for people thinking of majoring in econ. Otherwise I'd recommend introduction to microeconomics because you get all the same basic concepts but with less math and difficult PSETs.",
    "a Take this class only if you're an econ major (you know you have to). Really. Unless you're naturally really good at economics, Intermediate Micro will be painful, as it is for most students. You can take it with Professor Samuelson, who teaches the material quite clearly. Although this is a difficult class (take a tutor early on if you need one!), understanding the material is awesome and it is really useful (and necessary) knowledge if you are considering econ grad school in the future.",
    "If you are an econ major, then you will definitely have to take this course. However if you take it with Samuelson, you'll probably have a greater grasp of the material, because he lays out the course material in a very logical, methodical manner.",
    "It's a very tough class, but the material is important, and Samuelson is a great professor to take this class with.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone in a major for which intermediate micro is a requirement (e.g. Econ, Global Affairs development track). The course is well-structured overall, but lectures had a tendency to get haphazard with the amount of information being introduced, and Professor Samuelson didn't do the best job of emphasizing and applying the most important concepts in concrete terms (i.e. with example problems or calculations). The problem sets and exam questions were frequently worded rather poorly, so there was often confusion surrounding how to go about answering them. Combine that with the fact that lectures were at 9AM on Monday and Wednesday, and this class ended up causing me (and most other classmates) a good amount of grief this semester."
