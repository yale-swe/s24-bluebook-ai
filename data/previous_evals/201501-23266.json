   "comments": [
    "The reading list is tops, and Professor Cole reads the poems so beautifully. be aware that the class is Judaism through Poetry not Poetry through Judaism, so the discussion is less close-reading of poems than I expected.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in either Judaism or poetry, or anyone who might be looking for an avenue to engage their spiritual questions grounded in the judeo-chistiisan world view.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in Judaism and\/or Poetry -- you don't have to be super passionate about both to learn a lot. This semester was the first semester it was taught and so things necessarily shifted around a bit, so be aware that might happen to you, too. Overall, the course involves looking at the tradition of Jewish Poetry with a very wide-range of material and timeline, and I really enjoyed learning more about the texts we studied. I found every week's discussion so engaging and really enjoyed every chance I had to deepen my understanding of the material through writing. The material is tough but totally worth it!",
    "Absolutely recommend. One of the best courses I have ever taken. It is a privilege to be in Peter Cole's classroom.",
    "This class will expose you to a wide variety of Jewish poetry and teach you to question what those two words (\"Jewish\" and \"poetry\") even mean! I get the sense that Cole's classes are usually comprised of one component of people who know each other from Slifka, and then others...so if you'll like this class dynamic, go for it.",
    "Great class! Will change how you think about judaism whether you have a background or not.",
    "This was potentially my favorite course I've taken at any level of education. And I mean that. When I think about where I was as a thinker when the course began verses when it ended, I'm amazed at how my capabilities have evolved alongside my understanding of poetry and of Judaic thought. Professor Cole is a captivating lecturer, a master of his craft, and very nearly a human encyclopedia of the history of Jewish writing and the field of translation. The workload was manageable, even in spite of the course packet full of poems and essays that make you want to spend an hour with each of them. In general, I'm excited to continue deeper into this fascinating field as my Yale experience progresses, and I'll be forever thankful for what I've taken from this class and from Professoe Cole. This course is a hidden gem, a must-take whether Jewish, Christian, of any other religious belief or interest, or simply for any passionate reader of poetry."
