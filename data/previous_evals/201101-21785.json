    "Yes, you should definitely take it, especially if you are looking for an effective way to look back on your time at Yale and contextualize it in a 300 year narrative.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in understanding the institutional history of this place. You'll also learn a lot more about how Yale fits into the broader picture of American history, and how Eli's presence extends beyond the Ivory Walls. The workload is very manageable, and the reading mostly optional. Come to class each week prepared for 2 hours of story telling with occasional discussions.",
    "My favorite class this semester. Professor Gitlin is incredible.",
    "If you are interested in viewing American History form a different lens then TAKE THIS COURSE. It is about much more than just Yale it is truly a class about America and does a great job with American social history of the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "I would recommend this course absolutely! It is so fun and so interesting and not too much work.",
    "yes",
    "American history course examined through the lens of Yale. Wholeheartedly recommend this course.",
    "Take this class. Take it. Especially if you're a senior.",
    "Absolutely. This is no doubt the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "A class that every Yale history student should take because it puts Yale in context.",
    "Yes. It really makes you appreciate Yale a whole lot more and is an interesting seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student."
