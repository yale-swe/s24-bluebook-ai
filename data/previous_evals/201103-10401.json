    "If you are interested in using a milling machine, band saw, lathe, CNC machine, and your hands and want to have a really cool miniature steam engine at the end of the semester, take this class. If not, then don't. Pretty simple.",

    "This class did not deepen my knowledge of my discipline or profession but it did make my discipline much more bearable.",
    "This will allow me to construct parts I need for my research projects quickly and safely and has given me a greater understanding of the thinking that can be done to greatly increase the ease of manufacturing of machined parts.",
    "This course allows me to use the machine shop to make my own devices for experiments, saving me and my adviser money and time that would have hadto be spent finding and ordering custom tailored parts."
