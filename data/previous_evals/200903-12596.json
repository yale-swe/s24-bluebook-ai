    "Good class, easy grade. If you study, you'll get a good grade and the readings are for the most part interesting.",
    "HSHM 240 was a fascinating course. The method of teaching is pretty normal (section and lecture) with the exception of the history lab which is awesome (you get to build stuff!). I firmly believe that the material of the class (science revolution) is essential knowledge for any educated person. We have so many assumptions about the time period that are just wrong. I also think that this class will be very interesting (and even helpful) to science majors who have to consider the politics\/context of their work, since it deals with the formation of scientific disciplines, acceptance of ideals, etc. Professor Bertucci is very friendly and supportive. Her lectures can be kind of confusing, though. The trips to the Beinecke and Medical Library were awesome and totally worth taking the class. Having access to Newton's notes, Hooke's Micrographia, and many other rare texts push this class from a \"very good\" to an \"excellent.\""
