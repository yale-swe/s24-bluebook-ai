    "I learned how to evaluate academic materials in the field of medieval studies and in the process was exposed to many different artworks and ideas regarding medieval studies and art.",
    "This class gave a fascinating overview of the ways that othered people have been represented. Professor Jung has a wide scope of knowledge and a lovely sense of humor, and she guided class discussions with grace and enthusiasm.",
    "A better understanding of othering in Medieval art and a greater appreciation for its productions. I also better understood the visual and literary means by which artists constructed divisive paradigms that excluded religious, racial, and behavioral \"others\"",
    "A wonderful way to develope a better and more sensitive understanding of medieval visual culture",
    "The course provided an extremely varied and interesting view on the visual representation of the racial other and supernatural within medieval culture. Jung provided a good degree of primary sources, direct interaction with sources, and varied and interesting assignments. Overall the course was incredibly insightful and allowed to the rise of representing race and other such things, which are of great interest to me.",
    "I learned all about the 'other' in Medieval culture and how others were perceived and depicted in artistic representations during that time. The readings that we had access to were incredible and I truly learned so much about medieval art history and how Christian society addressed 'others.' I learned how to write a good review of a book and how to visually analyze a piece of art work well."

   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course- focusing on a different \"other\" group each week- is very strong. Sometimes the reading material is overly dense, but the primary sources were very insightful.",
    "I thought the format of the course was perfect. I did think that the level of work turned out to perhaps be more than the professor intended. Because she opted to assign many short papers rather than one large paper, the workload ended up be greater.",
    "Wonderful discussion, readings, and writing assignments. I would Haven loved the opportunity to do individual research. Also I would Haven valued faster turn around now on grades and written feedback.",
    "Strengths: Varied sources, excellent and skilled instructor, solid variance in topics, assignments were manageable and spread in a helpful and effective way to time manage Weaknesses: Because of varied topics didn't allow for the nuance necessary in talking about some issues, the course could have benefitted from a different student make-up",
    "Strengths include the great discussions in class and the incredible access to resources that we had. I thought Professor Jung could be a bit more engaged with the students one on one."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you have a passing interest in the medieval world and how nothing has changed (more or less) for the pass couple hundred years.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, but beware of the high workload. Because the professors assigns many short papers rather than few large papers, the workload is very constant and ends up actually being greater. Aside from this concern, the materials of the course is unbelievable interesting and quite comical at times. Professor Jung is an expert in this field and a real joy to learn from. She is exceedingly kind, caring, and intelligent.",
    "Yes!!!!!! Amazing course.",
    "Yes, so interesting even I feel if uou are an medievalist",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Medieval society and religious studies. I would warn them however, that is it not a class that is graded lightly and requires a lot of hard work in order to succeed."
