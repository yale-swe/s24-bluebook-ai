    "Good. I learned how to critique scientific articles and learned the scientific basis and background of parasitic diseases that affect the world today.",
    "it is perfect!",
    "Vary diversified and great topics, speakers and papers selected for discussion. Creative final project.",
    "Loved how it was laid out. One thing I would have enjoyed would be more of those jeopardy like quizzes to reinforce the fundamentals from each lectures. Really liked the critical papers, but sometimes I felt like I was forgetting the basics of the parasites because I was too busy writing the papers and didn't have much time to just study the material.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Though my background is in invert bio and parasitic infections are one of my specialty areas, I learned a lot from the course material. This class improved my ability to critique scientific articles in writing and discussion days promoted an engaging atmosphere. Both professors were also more than willing to explain unfamiliar or difficult concepts or consult about readings that were dense or hard to understand. They always contributed to class discussion and were frank and open about their experiences as academic researchers. The feedback we received on written assignments was always specific and constructive, and my grades on critiques improved as the semester progressed because of it! This course also made discussing and critiquing scientific papers less intimidating and afforded a great opportunity to sometimes speak directly with the paper authors themselves. The final project was a fun exercise that allowed for some creativity. I got to see an interesting variety of proposals from my classmates in other disciplines. Overall a fantastic course!",
    "Really enjoyed it and at the same time I learned a lot. I feel a lot more confident in my ability to critique published research. I am really happy with the amount I learned about parasites and am inspired to learn more."

    "Definitely take this class. You will learn more about various parasitic diseases and learn how to critique scientific papers. Great class overall.",
    "This is a very interactive course. Great material and lot to learn. Totally recommend it!",
    "Fun class if you want to get a feel of the cutting age research in parasitology.",
    "Casual, but exciting and stimulating. Would really recommend if you are interested in getting better at critically reading scientific literature that maybe out of your comfort zone. The diversity of the students (all in different departments) was really fun. People gave much different insights on things depending on their background.",
    "Whether or not you're interested in parasitology, this course is a great forum for practicing critiques and discussing scientific papers. The professors are wonderful, and you'll get a great overview of a variety of parasitic infections through multiple public health lenses.",
    "This course is an excellent to both learn about parasites and how to critique research. You learn a lot but at the same time are not overloaded with busy work. I absolutely recommend this class!"
