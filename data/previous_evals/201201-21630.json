    "Take it if you are a Comp Sci student for an elective. It's very interesting and taught by Professor Abadi, who's awesome.",
    "Easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Prof. Abadi is tremendous! Our class consisted of reading classic papers on DB's in the first half and reading modern papers in the 2nd half, and discussing design\/architecture\/etc. I learned a ton from seeing how people optimized systems to respond to different needs, and this class really showed me what an exciting field databases is. Definitely take this course!!",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it can be very rewarding. You'll learn how most of the major components of a database system work, and what the tradeoffs are in different database systems. You study and implement different parts of a database, and the final project allows you to have a real-world impact in a novel area of databases.",
    "Great class, very systems oriented. The first half is lecture style and provides a fairly detailed overview of all the major elements that make up a traditional RDBMS. The second half is more seminar style, you read papers of large data management systems before class and during class you have a debate. Midterm is very difficult, two problem sets, paper reviews for second half and a final project. It was a little more work than I expected but very rewarding. Professor Abadi is an absolute leader in the field and knows A TON. Take the class.",
    "Fantastic course, one of the best CS electives. Take it. Dan is a industry leader, while also being a uniquely brilliant lecturer. You'll never be bored, and this stuff matters!",
    "CPSC 438 is a great class--it made me truly passionate about databases! Prof. Abadi is fantastic, and databases are really awesome. If you liked 323, this would probably be a good class for you. As a warning, it's a fair bit of work, though it is a somewhat different workload than many other CS courses because it's rather reading intensive, and you actually do need to read the scientific papers.",
    "CPSC 438 is a great class. Data presents a lot of interesting problems, which makes databases extremely interesting. Prof. Abadi is wonderful.",
    "A great course to understand both classical Database architecture as well as the more modern architectures in use today."
