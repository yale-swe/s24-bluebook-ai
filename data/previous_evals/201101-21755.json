   "comments": [
    "Yes. Great course.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. But even then, the lecture will be better.",
    "Take it if you want to make sense of economic events happening around you!",
    "If you're considering an econ major, take this class (not hte lecture). If you don't get in on the lottery, try to get in anyway. Sigga was pretty open to taking extra people in her class.",
    "Economics 111 is an introductory course into macroeconomics. It teaches the fundamental principles of macroeconomics. I think it is a great class for anyone to take, not just someone interested in economics, because it teaches concepts that can be used in everyday life.",
    "I would recommend it. It's the best way to take Intro Macro. Sigga is fantastic. Macro is not the most fun nor is it the most easy thing. However, with Sigga, I got the guidance I needed and learned a ton actually about what's currently going on in our economy and how it got to be that way. There's a lot of material in the class, but I'm confident I'll be better prepared for Intermediate. I also just enjoyed how the small size of the class enabled an intimate class environment.",
    "Definitely. It's a course that teaches things everyone should have some knowledge of, and it does it well. It is more mathy than I expected (it should definitely count for a qr credit).",
    "Yes, I recommend it.",
    "Awesome!",
    "I wouls strongly recommend macroeconomics to another student. I thinkit well-taught and interesting and not too difficult. Having said that though, I do believe that it really hard to get an A due to the curve, but nevertheless going back I would still take it as a seminar because I just learned so much more. It has made me consider Econ as a potential major. Also, if you do decide to take macroecon, TAKE IT WITH SIGGA! She is phenomenal.",
    "If you like economics, go for it. People seemed to enjoy this class well enough. My problem was that I really wanted to like the course, but I think Econ simply doesn't interest me enough. And it's hard to show up to class when you know you'll be counting down the minutes. Also, the course is technically a seminar but is taught like a lecture--essentially it's a lecture where questions are more welcomed. Be advised.",
    "I took the Micro lecture and then this macro seminar and loved the seminar 10x more. Simply learned that much more in the seminar.",
    "Sigga is a great person but not the best lecturer. I fell asleep a lot. You have to do a lot of the learning on your own, but she posts all the slides which is a huge help. Only do it if you want to major in Econ.",
    "This class was alright. If you want to learn econ, then take it, but I wouldn't take it just as a random interesting class. The topic itself is quite interesting, but the teaching isn't amazing, and you might have trouble if you don't have a background in economics.",
    "I definitely would. The class is definitely more of a challenge than the lecture, but I feel I know more now than my friends who took the lecture.",
    "Yes. It's an intro class, you need it! but be prepared for long hours of problem sets and confusion.",
    "I highly recommend this course for anyone interested at all in economics.",
    "Yes. Because the seminar classes only have around 30 people, it is much easier for us to ask questions both in class and out of class during offices hours so it's a very good choice for people who are really interested in economics. But also bear in mind that most people who chose to take the seminar are pretty intense, so you are expected to work hard for it.",
    "Take it with Sigga. Brilliant course, mind-blowing.",
    "I really enjoyed this course with Sigga because I really like macroeconomics and Sigga really knows her stuff. Sigga's helpful and she's a great professor. The class became more interesting towards the end when we learned about finance and some of the causes behind the most recent financial crisis.",
    "I thought it was a good class if you already have a background in macroeconomics. If the subject is new for you, it is probably better to take the lecture because Sigga assumes a fair amount of prior knowledge. Also, people in the seminar are serious about doing well so the curve will be difficult. Only take it if you really like and are comfortable with econ."
