   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend. Readings are very interesting as supplements to the lectures. Lectures are easy to follow, questions are encouraged, and the class has a very seminar-like feel. Only one midterm, and three quizzes that are straightforward and relevant to the information learned in class. Very organized and well-planned class overall.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who has a broader interest in public health. The title of this course is deceiving in its specificity. Anyone interested in major public health would find this course very interesting. It was taught like a high school course, with a regular work schedule. The paper at the end was difficult. However, you will come out knowing a lot more about mosquitoes than you might want to know.",
    "It is a mediocre class- much harder than other nonmajor sciences, and obviously much easier than a real science class. Only take if you really are passionate about Malaria. Otherwise, get a book from the library on it...",
    "Yes, if you can get in (about 15 people are accepted from dozens of applications, I believe), I highly recommend this course. It is not a gut or an easy A, however. You will learn actual science, complicated science at that, and be required to absorb great amounts of information. The rewards, however, are much greater than that of the other non-science major science classes. You'll come out with a great understanding of some of the major epidemics in the world - the role pathogens and vectors play in them, the actual scientific processes involved with infection\/disease, why certain interventions work\/do not work. You'll have 3 difficult quizzes, a midterm, and a final science paper (about 10 pages). Professor Belperron is kind and approachable.",
    "This is a great science class, especially if you're interested in development. It is not always an easy science course (which can be nice too). The quizzes are hard, but don't make up much of your grade. Plus, I really enjoyed the final project and the energy of Prof. Belperron.",
    "yep, if you're interested in the material. the 3 quizzes are hard, but the final paper isn't too bad. prof belperron is really nice and really wants you to do well.",
    "It's a overview of how malaria and lyme disease are affecting humanity, and how we're trying to deal with these and other vector-bourne diseases. This class is very far-ranging, and there's a lot going on but Professor Belperron makes things pretty clear and makes sure that you're keeping up. There's a good deal of information to keep track of, but it's all pretty logical and interesting, which makes it easier to follow. I would recommend this class, especially for people who are trying to ease into the hard sciences at Yale and are less confident about their hard-science skills.",
    "Great science class; it's pretty interesting. Don't think you can skip the seminar though - I skipped one to go out of town, it was only after that I realized the material made just about no sense without Professor Belperron discussing and explaining it. The workload is totally fine - three quizzes, one midterm, a presentation, and a paper. The quizzes\/midterm are pretty hard, and studying before them is definitely necessary, but as long as you know the material you should be fine. The paper seems really long at first (it's 6-10 pages, 11 pt font, .5 margins) but once you've done the presentation and gotten the guidelines for what to write about it's definitely doable. I'd recommend this class as a science credit to anybody.",
    "Awesome course! Prof. Belperron keeps class straightforward but interesting, and is very accessible. I have no bio background but found it easy to engage with the material, and I learned a lot about vector-borne diseases, which are really quite interesting. The workload is very manageable and the tests require studying but are totally fair. Definitely go for this if you have an interest in epidemiology but aren't a \"science person.\""
