    "A challenging survey of Nubian archaeology. Be prepared for a lot of reading, some of which is difficult to understand without a background in Egyptology. Overall, an important course to take if you are interested in African archaeology and the role Nubia played in Africa's past.",
    "The Archaeology of Nubia I covers the theories and debates pertaining to the ancient cultures of Nubia from earliest prehistory to the end of the Egyptian Second Intermediate Period. I would cautiously recommend the course to another student interested in the topic as the information is of vital importance, however, I would caution that the student should be prepared to spend a lot of extra time attempting to synthesize the information presented."
