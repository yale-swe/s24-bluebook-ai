   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this course and learned a lot!",
    "-good mix of topics-in general, very different information than what's presented in other classes--makes for a well-rounded education in EMD or policy-enjoyed group presentation topics--would be fun to have more time to debate\/discuss after presentations-manageable workload-all assignments returned in timely manner; graded fairly-hospital tour was an excellent opportunity-enjoyed the guest lectures, especially the ones about the microbiology lab and occupational health",
    "The strengths of this course were the lectures and case studies. The hospital tour was also a great aspect of the course. The guest lectures were great because it was useful to hear from other professionals in the field. It would be great in the future to have more case studies to discuss among students in class.",
    "I really liked this course- very informative and applicable to quality improvement work in hospitals, epidemiology, and other fields that we are going to work in.The one thing I would improve is to have less \"technical\" readings about differernt types of diseases and infections and more \"application\" readings about how infection control, surrveilance, and prevention efforts are actually managed in hospitals.",
    "This course was great. It was much more policy based and less microbiology based than I expected, which ended up being just fine with me as I already have a strong micro background and virtually no policy background. You really don't get what you learn in this course from any other class at YSPH. It's a great background in hospital epi and infection control, especially for anyone thinking of possibly working in a hospital.",
    "I really enjoyed this course - especially the hospital tour. Having this early on in the semester was helpful, as I've never been in a hospital before. The lectures and homework were very straightforward, and I always knew what was expected of me. Great course!",
    "This course is extremely detailed and would be very useful for someone who is interested in entering infection control as a career. Since I don't think I will be moving in that direction, the usefulness of this course to me is somewhat limited. Perhaps a broader overview of the course in the early weeks will help other determine if they are truly interested in this field."

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0She was very receptive to students and extremely knowledgable about the subject material!",

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Drs Dembry and Banach were fanatastic--both are very knowledgeable, helpful, and approachable. Great class",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr Dembry and Dr Banach are both very knowledgeable about hospital epidemiology and they bring a lot of experience to the class. I liked the way they explained clinical concepts to the class and their use of real-life examples were very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Not only is it great to have instructors who are experts in the field, but it is wonderful that they share so many insighs and anecdotes.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Drs Dembry and Banach were great. They were both very knowledgeable about topics and always prepared for class. Slides were well organized and made sense and were available before class. Assignments were clear and valuable to learning the subject. Feedback on assignments was really fast, which was much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Very approachable and responsive. Great instructor!",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Both professors (Dr. Banach and Dr. Dembry) were fantastic. Dr. Dembry is extremely smart and approachable. She is also a great lecturer. I think if more lectures were conducted by her the course may have been more interesting."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in understanding how hospitals\/healthcare settings are designed\/prepared to handle disease outbreak and general hospital admissions. I learned a lot from this course and am very happy I took it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially to those in EMD or policy tracks.",
    "Yes I would strongly recommend this course especially to students who are interested in infection prevention and control in the healthcare setting.",
    "Gret course for someone who is interested in working in any kind of infection\/quality position at a hospital.",
    "Yes! If you think you might be interested in this field, take this class. It's not too challenging, but not so easy that you are bored or frustrated; the pace is very good for MPH students. The assignments are also interesting and help you learn the topics. There were also some great guest lecturers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in working in a hospital environment. This is a very different course from any other class I've taken at YSPH, and there is little overlap with other classes.",
    "This course is a detailed look at the methods used to limit the spread of disease in a healthcare setting. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in infection control."
