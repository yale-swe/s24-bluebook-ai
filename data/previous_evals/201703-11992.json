   "comments": [
    "I learned how to conduct close readings of political theory and to connect and contrast authors' arguments with historical developments and present-day phenomena.",
    "In a narrow sense, this course gave me an in-depth knowledge of Tocqueville's writings, a chance to explore other modern political thinkers such as Montesquieu, Rousseau and Pascal, and a greater familiarity with the French liberal tradition through reading Constant and Guizot. More broadly, this class helped me to become a better reader of textsexploring ambiguities and tensions within Tocqueville's arguments and using his writings to explore larger questions in political theory. Tocqueville provides a unique framework to consider political institutions, and this course left me with the ability to apply this 'Tocquevillean lens'.",
    "skills to read Tocqueville in depth greater understanding of political theory insight into Tocqueville's ideas on democracy, religion, race-relations, etc. in America Context to Tocqueville through readings by his contemporaries Persuasive writing skills",
    "This course was a close reading of Tocqueville's Democracy in America, which provides an unique experience as most political science or political philosophy courses cover multiple authors or multiple texts by one author. The ability to close read and really understand one political thinker's theory in such an in-depth way is really helpful if you are studying political philosophy, but is also a helpful skill set when applied to other texts.",
    "This course has left me with a holistic understanding of the political thought of Tocqueville. By reading all of \"Democracy in America,\" as well as Tocqueville's influences, contemporaries, and later writings, I learned what it means to approach the thought of a single author. More specifically, I gained a greater understanding of Tocqueville's theory of democracy and the roles of religion and freedom in society."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths include Professor Garsten, who leads class discussion very well and draws on an enormous well of knowledge to push the conversation forward. Although it took a while to receive feedback on papers, I felt that his comments were really helpful in crafting and refining my arguments on subsequent essays. I wish that discussion could have been more exploratory - we often delved into one topic for an entire session, overlooking other important parts of the reading - and more dialogue-based.",
    "The syllabus for this course was well-constructed, though obviously it felt like we could have spent more time on each reading that we did for the course. I thought the focus of the first half of the course on Democracy in America made sense. Still, I have some suggestions on how to adapt the syllabus if this course is taught again. I think some sections of The Social Contract might have been a better Rousseau reading than the Second Discourse. We had trouble discussing the Second Discourse in relation to Tocqueville, and it seems like Tocqueville as a liberal is responding more to Rousseau's conception of democracy\/the general will than to his conception of the state of nature. I also wish we had had time to read Marx and Mill, in part because I think that these are thinkers with whom the class already had some familiarity, which could have led to a rich discussion revealing new aspects of Tocqueville's thought. I would have substituted these readings for Beaumont's Marieour discussion of Marie was particularly weak, and the format of the book made it difficult to place it in dialogue with Democracy in America. I was hoping Marie would allow us to focus on a discussion of race, but it didn't really contribute much in this regard. Another notable absence from the syllabus was Tocqueville's writings on Algeria, which I think could have led to interesting conversations about Tocqueville's views on race (why is he so critical of chattel slavery but generally supportive of imperialism?) and the limits of Tocqueville's liberalism. From looking at Jennifer Pitts' collection of Tocqueville's essays on empire, it seems like this reveals some of the implications of his focus on greatness and on the protection of individuality in democracy (i.e. I don't think that assigning a couple of those essays would simply be a way of showing students that Tocqueville was racist in some typically 19th century ways). Likewise, it could have been interesting to assign a few fragments from the Souvenirs alongside The Old Regime. Lastly, it would have been helpful to get a list of recommended secondary readings, though I of course understand that the goal was for students to focus on close reading.",
    "Strengths: an ability to read a book in depth for an entire term. Ability to write papers about the same book. Very straightforward discussion and class structure; discussion began with an effective lecture that was well-timed and left enough time for discussion. Enjoyed the session in which we discussed paper topics. Weaknesses: feedback to papers were slightly delayed, leaving students less time to review their mistakes before the next paper.",
    "The course is offered to both undergraduate and graduate students, which allowed for really interesting discussions with many different perspectives. Professor Garsten also helped facilitate discussion and did a really nice job of alternating between lecturing and mediating discussion\/participation. The workload is also spread out nicely throughout the semester.",
    "The syllabus of the class was well done, and I think the one seminar a week approach is effective. I loved Professor Garsten's brief opening lecture on the material, but it could be longer. Sometimes, student input would carry on for a while without input from Garsten. Also, the reading of Tocqueville selections were divided by section in the book, but that would make some weeks have proportionally more pages than others -- sometimes we were unable to cover central ideas in great detail. The two small and one large paper combination was also fine, and an excellent exercise for concisely developing ideas, but earlier feedback on the smaller papers would have been nice."

    "This is the best course I've ever taken and I could not more highly recommend. If you are a citizen of a democracy (or a citizen anywhere, for that matter) you should take Tocqueville with Professor Garsten. This course will change the way you view the world -- Tocqueville is such a powerful, comprehensive thinker and his insights on democracy will shape the way you view politics, literature, philosophy, and our social norms. In Professor Garsten, \"Democracy in America\" has a professor that can truly unlock the wonders of Tocqueville's thought. Garsten is a brilliant seminar leader, guiding our class through the complexity of DiA. Additionally, although he is too humble to tell you this, he is actually mentioned in the most popular version of Democracy in America; Garsten worked on the book's translation and is cited as an \"indispensable help\" by the editors. DiA is exciting in and of itself, but Garsten makes the work even more lively and inspiring. In sum, take this course. Do the readings. Go to office hours with Garsten. You will NOT regret it.",
    "I would -- Tocqueville is a fascinating writer with a host of interesting ideas about government and society, and Professor Garsten is great at helping us investigate those complex ideas. While class discussion sometimes stalled and got a bit off track, being exposed to Tocqueville work (including The Old Regime, not just Democracy in America) gave real insight into the breadth of his thought.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, particularly students interested in political theory or American politics.",
    "Yes, for anyone interested in political theory, Tocqueville is a classic. I think that the discussions were very good and I learned a lot in class. There were a couple opportunities to also discuss how Tocqueville were related to other thinkers, but most of the class was focused on Tocqueville and his Democracy in America.",
    "This was the best class I have taken at Yale. Rarely will you have the opportunity to do a close-reading of a text in a political science course, so being able to do so for Tocqueville's Democracy in America was great. I would recommend this course to all students, even if you have not read much political philosophy.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would fully recommend the course. After reading \"Democracy in America\" in its entirety, I think it offers deep philosophical insight into many aspects of the world today. Professor Garsten offers even rarer insight into understanding many aspects of Tocqueville's brilliance."
