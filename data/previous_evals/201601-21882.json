    "Hard.",
    "I would recommend this to any student that is a Mech E or similar major looking to expand their understanding of mechanisms for heat transfer in fairly practical settings.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless you have to. The concepts are not difficult, but they are presented in a very difficult way to interpret. The professor doesn't give any context for his derivations or examples and just starts writing on the board. Only after he's talked about the mechanisms of heat transfer do you have an inkling of an idea how this fits into the greater context of the course. Homework problems are of average difficulty and the exams are not too bad. You can find better courses to satisfy the ME major (if you are not ABET).",
    "Beware. MENG 389 is not talked about a lot, but from my experience it is probably the hardest course in the major. Don't let it sneak up on you like it did on me. Other than that it is a good course!",
    "This is another one of those tough engineering classes you probably have to take for your major. It is very mathematical and fairly time consuming, but the professor is almost always willing to meet and even encourages it. Go to the review sessions and put in the time and you'll be fine.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS UNLESS YOU EITHER a) really really for some reason like heat and heat transfer, or b) are an ABET MechE and have to take it. Although the material itself was not difficult, and was actually fairly interesting at times, the class was very disorganized, and the professor is not good at teaching.",
    "I personally struggled a lot in this class, but there is a ton of support, and the professor is great. He's so supportive, and holds homework sessions twice weekly, as well as office hours every single weekday. If you put in the time, you will be fine. Take advantage of all the support - he truly cares and wants you to do well.",
    "MENG 389 will provide an introduction into basic heat transfer topics. The course lectures are sometimes difficult to follow, but diligence and meeting often with Dr. P will really help you get the most out of the course. There are weekly discussion sections in which Dr.P will review the homework questions. In additions, he holds office hours often to answer questions on the psets\/ discuss the project."
