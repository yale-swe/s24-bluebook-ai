    "I learned a lot about theory and chord such as the Neapolitan and augmented sixth chords as well as a refresher on sonata form and part writing",
    "Since I'll probably take another theory class after this, this class was very helpful in showing me that one really needs to practice and internalize the material immediately and consistently. 210 didn't require that as much from me, but 211 did (though I didn't follow through as much as I should have), and I'm glad to know that going forward.",
    "Very useful and comprehensive chromatic theory",
    "I gained a better understanding of the theory behind functional harmony, especially in the context of four-part choral composition, as well as the chordal theories outside the tradition of functional harmony. I also gained experience composing short passages and pieces within an assigned framework."

    "Assignment schedule clear, Brian was great!",
    "I enjoyed the weekly assignments, which were helpful in pushing my creative abilities because they got progressively more specific and more challenging throughout the semester. But I wish the discussions we had in class could have moved faster and covered more material."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend if you care about music theory, try to get Brian Miller",
    "The projects in this course are fun, just don't leave them to the last minute. Start early and go to office hours. Don't underestimate the homework assignments; they may look short, but require a lot of thought and take longer than you'd expect. Really try with the assignments and the modulations of the week, because those are your opportunities to process and internalize the material. Put a little effort into staying on top of this class and it'll be fun; treat it as a gut and you'll be unnecessarily stressed.",
    "Very interesting and useful, especially the chromatic harmony stuff.",
    "At first I was skeptical of taking this course with a grad student, but if you get Brian Miller, it will be great. The class can be a bit dull at times. I really just took it so that I can take music lessons for credit. Even though they were tedious at the time, I think the compositions were the most valuable part of this class. Even though I was sure that I wouldn't be able to compose a song in the style of schubert, have faith, by the end of this course, you will be able to do it!"
