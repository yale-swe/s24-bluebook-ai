    "I learned how to learn french. At the beginning of the class, I had minimal exposure to french language and culture. By the end of it, I not only knew grammar, it leaves me confident that if I carry on with trying to learn french, I could do it without much difficulty.",
    "You learn French very quickly",
    "I learned so much French! Basically all of French grammar. My speaking, listening, writing and reading developed so much over the past few months! I knew no French before this course, and could barely get by the first few days, but I know feel not only totally unintimidated by the language, but also that I could go to France and get by.",
    "After only one semester, I have a good handle on understanding, reading, writing, and speaking french. Obviously not fluently, but significantly more than I expected I would be able to after only 3.5 months.",
    "This course introduces you to almost all of the French grammar paradigms, as well as lots of basic vocab. A super great introduction to French.",
    "I learned a great deal of French vocabulary and grammar, developed my comprehension, speaking, and writing skills, and overall feel quite confident to enter into L3.",
    "French",
    "Developed both a good working knowledge of foundational French grammatical structures and a knowledge of vocabulary related to many everyday scenarios (relative locations of places, food, etc.).",
    "Basic french grammar and vocab",
    "I learned not only the course material, but also how to manage an intensive class at Yale.",
    "It is language course with slightly different techniques that you would encounter outside. I have developed significant improvements in speakin, reading and writing in French.",
    "A foundational knowledge of the French language!"

    "Professor Sherak is caring, considerate, and goes above and beyond to accommodate your needs. And I love this course for that. But, I wish, in class, participation was distributed more evenly. Since this is a language class, getting opportunities to speak (or attempt) French is essential, especially in a group settings. One thing that disappointed me a bit was that students who participated at the beginning of the class, will be mostly likely to always be given an opportunity to speak more and their mistakes would be more tolerated. That was not productive for students who, like me had a tough time at beginning. Even towards the end when I thought I had improved a lot, I wasn't offered enough chances. I don't want to be overly critical of Professor Sherak; there was only so much she could have done. And I am satisfied with the class overall.",
    "You work very rapidly",
    "Its hard to think of weaknesses for this course. Its a lot of class time, but French class was one of my favorite parts of every day. And there honestly wasnt that much work outside of class. Madame Sherak is both the best teacher I have ever had and an absolute gem of a person. She will fully support you and want to get to know you and mentor you. She had teaching French (and this course) down to a SCIENCE. She also makes the course so fun! You also get to interact a lot with the students in the class, and I made many good friends :)",
    "A course like this is really the only way to learn a language. It's a lot of work, but all of the work informs the other assignments and leaves you with a comprehensive sense of the language. Madame is amazing, and you get so close with the class by virtue of spending so much time with them. If you want to learn french, do this class!",
    "This course goes FAST, which is both a pro and a con, depending on what kind of language student you are.",
    "I really enjoyed the pace of the class. The workload was heavy, but the rigor was just right. I quite enjoyed all the activities we did, including going to a Creperie, the art gallery, sharing recipes, and doing skits. I also really appreciated that Madame Sherak gave a talk on study abroad, and brought in the L3\/L4 teacher to talk about intensive French part 2. I also really really appreciated that Madame Sherak would also return our tests and assignments pretty much the next day, and that she spent a lot of time giving us all personal feedback. The only thing I didn't like was the deviations from the schedule (skipping 2 of the lessons), but I also understand that there were some schedule constraints.",
    "It was a great course",
    "The French-in-Action curriculum is well-done and is conducive to establishing a solid foundation in French. Unlike many other pedagogical methods, the French-in-Action curriculum treats French not as a translation of English but, rightfully, as a language in itself. French words and concepts are introduced not by translating them into the familiar English language but by showing situations and contexts in which the word or concept applies this is able to communicate the nuance of many French words and expressions that do not translate directly into English.",
    "Very fast paced, get through a lot of material but if you don't keep up you get lost quickly",
    "The intensity of the class was both its biggest strength and weakness. Having to stay engaged was difficult, however the constant exposure benefitted me in the end.",
    "If you can keep up with the level of work required, you are guaranteed to learn French. You get regular feedback on your improvement."

   "comments": [
    "YES. Don't take just L1 or L2. Take this class. And take it with P. Sherak!",
    "Yes",
    "YES! If you enjoy learning languages and have even a slight desire to learn French, I would recommend this course. I had already completed my language requirement when and I took this course just because I was interested in learning French. Im so glad I did, because I loved it and the course has fueled my desire to pursue French. This course is so well taught, and the intensive language-learning model is so satisfying.",
    "If you want to learn french, absolutely take this class. It's as close to full immersion as you can get without actually doing an immersion program. If you find a rhythm, the workbook exercises and weekly compositions become routine and are manageable. (And if they're not, just talk to Madame - she's truly there to help students and just wants us to learn the language.)",
    "If you are up for a challenge, yes. It is fun and rewarding, but you have to put in the work.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student, but only with the caveat that it will require a lot of time and effort. By the end, you will feel like you have gained a basic mastery of French, and gain a satisfaction of how much progress you made over one semester, in ways that regular L1 or L2 might not give you. However, you also must commit to putting in a lot of time. Madame Sherak makes sure that we enjoy the whole process, but there is hard work to be put in nonetheless.",
    "Yes! It is a great way to learn French.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, but only for those who have a strong grasp of English and\/or a Romance language. If your grammatical ability in English is well-developed, you'll find that the course moves at a fairly comfortable pace, as French grammar is often quite similar to English grammar, and there are many English\/French cognates. The curriculum is well-designed, though a bit limited, and it facilitates student learning. I found that the students who tended to do the best in the class (in conversation, in grasping new grammar quickly, etc.) tended to have either some Romance language background or a very strong understanding of the technicals of English grammar. I would not recommend this course if you do not have a very strong grasp of either English or of some Romance language, as you will probably get more out of the slower (but still quick) pace of the standalone L1 and L2 classes, which cover the same material but at a greater depth.",
    "Yes, but only if they are very good at learning languages and want this to be their top priority for the semester.",
    "Absolutely, if you either want to learn French quickly or feel that you need a challenge then FREN 125 is a match for you.",
    "If you want to learn French know that this course alone is not enough. If you have time and intend to go all the way to final levels of French. This is a solid way of start.",
    "Absolutely. It is fast-paced, but you will walk away from a semester of this course with more knowledge of the French language than you would believe possible."
