    "This is not as much an evaluation of the course of Italian or the language itself since, if you've come this far, you already know that you want to take Italian and have thought carefully about the reasons why (the fascinating culture, the amazing country, the groundbreaking film, art and literature, etc.) but more about the instructor, since one of the bigger choices you will have to make is when and with whom to take this class. Chris Kaiser is one of the finest in the business. He is compassionate, empathetic, enthusiastic, and caring, and animates the material with a clear desire to be there with you he loves to see his students learn and grow through the struggle of language, and as such creates an environment in which they can prosper. Like all things, you get out of this class what you put into it, from your competency and understanding of Italian to your grade (he's a totally fair grader). The difference is you will have a teacher who will show you (and make you want to) put in and get out more. If you go Italian, go Kaiser.",
    "Italian 110 is an intensive introductory course to the language and culture of Italy. This is a wonderful course for learning the basics of Italian- I would definitely recommend this course and the entire Italian department for the fulfillment of the language requirement and beyond.",
    "If you are at all interested in learning italian, take this class. after only one semeser, I have learned three tenses and can carry a coherent, if a little slow conversation in italian. If you are just trying to get a lang. requirment out of the way, this course is a good option too as it is not too difficult. just dont bog the rest of the class down if youre not going to take it seriously."
