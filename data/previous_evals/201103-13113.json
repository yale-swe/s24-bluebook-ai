   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in Kantian philosophy, analytic philosophy, epistemology or metaphysics, you should definitely take this class. I grew immensely while reading the Critique in such detail. It is really nice to be able to actually dive into one work and not stay at the surface. The ideas of the Critique are definitely worth the struggle with the at times incomprehensible text.Prof. Franks and our TA Kelley Schiffman were both really great and helped a lot! Take it!",
    "A tough class, but you get a VERY good understanding of the material from it. Would recommend to philosophy students or very tenacious armchair philosophers. My only criticism is that it sometimes took a while for prompts to be released, leaving us with less time to think about our final papers than was perhaps optimal.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. Professor Franks is incredible. The reading is also very manageable.",
    "The Critique of Pure Reason is one of the hardest texts you will ever read and the grading is stringent, so only take it if you're thirsting for a challenging philosophical adventure.",
    "Only if you're a major. It's important to understand Kant's project, which you certainly do after taking this course, but it can be very frustrating and seem unrewarding at times. If you put in the effort in reading the book and understanding the arguments, it will be much more worthwhile. Although the other reservation I haveabout this class is that it is often harshly graded. A comparable paper for any other class would easily receive a letter grade higher, in my experience. Having a lot of experience with the history of modern philosophy will be very helpful in this class. This class, more than some others, makes far fewer relations to contemporary debates within philosophy now.",
    "If you already know you like Kant, you'll enjoy this class just because it's a chance to closely read his works. And the main secondary reading, the Gardner book, is fantastic. But if you are unsure if you like Kant going in, this class certainly won't inspire love for reading it. Franks is a great scholar, but his lectures were often circuitous and a little tough to follow as he seemed to get lost in his thoughts and to referencethe interpretations of a bunch of different Kant scholars in the process of explaining one of the points. The planning of the class was a bit rickety as well, with some essays falling right on top of each other. On the other hand, I think this class will be better next year because some of the problems seemed to be class planning problems that will be fixed with experience.",
    "Don't take this class just for fun-- I took this credit\/d\/fail merely out of personal interest, and I found that I did not have time to do the work that makes this class worth it. Basically, only take this if you're willing to go all out preparing for it."
