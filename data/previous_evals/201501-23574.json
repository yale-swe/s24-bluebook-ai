   "comments": [
    "Overall this was a great class. The fieldtrips were fun (though there were a lot of them). I also really appreciated the break in the middle of class, along with the tea and coffee. My main criticism of this class is that Prof. Ashton often goes off on long tangents, really making it hard to stay focused on the lecture and the materials. Related to this, I thought there was too much talking at many of the field trips. It seems like the field trips should be used to actually do things, rather than just listen to more lectures. Less talking, more doing. Students can only absorb so much information at any time, so there's not much point in talking for so long.",
    "Q 11: Sometimes difficult to tell what portion of lectures are important to write down, I appreciate the humor but one of the more challenging courses to take notes in",
    "fast paced course with a lot of lecture time and field trip time. a lot of information to master in this course",
    "I'm less interested in management, so place a slightly different value on the course than most students. However, I still think it does have a high value.",
    "Better for the class to be conducted in the fall in view of the many field trips and the typical terrible weather during the winter-spring period.",
    "Sometimes the lecturing was a bit circuitous. The tangential comments could be fewer.",
    "I missed one class, and while I had the online readings and materials and studied those, I still felt like I missed a lot from the lecture (that was on the exam!). It was hard to know what I had missed.",
    "Highly recommended to any student who will make decisions effecting ground-level management of forested and non-forested terrestrial areas. Did away with a few of my misconceptions about timbering and conservation of protected areas and left me with a solid base of applicable skills. I feel like I can walk into a forest and make basic, competent recommendations for its treatment.",
    "Ashton - his lectures could be improved; sometimes he can ramble on and on, but part of the benefits taking classes with him is that you get to listen to everything he knows"

The concepts covered from forest ecology, forest dynamics, botany to forest management to specific uses, such as recreation, water supply and quality, aesthetics, wood and others. The practice is very important to give the students the opportunity of applying the knowledge gained in class.",

    "Clarity of material, shouldn't be expected to go on all 7 field trips",
    "the field trips should work to better prepare students for the prescription exam. we should practice exercises that will be tested on the prescription.",
    "The initial field trips were actually quite a bit of lecture and so calling them field-lectures as opposed to field trips might be more appropriate. That way you don't get people's hopes up. Mark's encyclopedic knowledge of silviculture and wealth of enthusiasm and experience can also hinder comprehension at times because there are so many concepts being covered at once that it is hard to distill concepts and see with clarity through the diversity of ideas and examples being discussed. Scheduling - please try not to rearrange field trips on short notice to cover missed material in lectures. Field trip coordination - it might be nice to have everyone's cell phone numbers, or to organize a whats app or group me group so that people can communicate more effectively on field trips. This is ideal for TAs to do. Move TA review sessions to a different time slot so that they do not conflict with lunch talks.",
    "Giving up 6-7 days for field trips a semester is difficult. That, in essence, is an additional week of class.",
    "A periodic overview and summary of key concepts and terms, and how those related to one another and past\/future material, would have been helpful. There was so much great information, but sometimes key concepts got buried along with information that while interesting, wasn't as practical\/useful. I also felt that the exams could be improved. I felt that there was a disjoint between what I understood to be the key concepts of the class and many of the exam questions, which were often focused on trivial or random bits of information rather than demonstrating the main takeaways. Lastly, I really appreciated the silviculture prescription exercise and exam. I felt like this was one of the most useful concepts of the class. I would have done more of these practice exercises in different settings (urban as well as at Yale Meyers) and for different management goals (e.g. water and wildlife conservation) instead of just timber.",
