   "comments": [
    "You will learn how to effectively put together a historical research project and what pitfalls to avoid.",
    "Yes and no. If the class becomes more organized, definitely yes--there is a lot of important material to cover in there. But I do feel like there were several weeks where I just didn't learn much. More emphasis on how to actually go about archival research might be useful--we really didn't talk about Trachtenberg that much...",
    "This course helps you do two things. First, have confidence to approach historical sources, second, learn how to use them in a way that is efficient, critical and valid for the purpose of social scientific research designs. I would definitely recommend the course to grad students in sociology, because anyone who doesn't will either lack these critical skills or miss the chance to have an in-depth conversation about them.",
    "Definitely. It's a fantastic course with reading relevant for students in all the different subfields."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciate getting to work on a research paper that I would like to go farther with.",
    "I'm firmly convinced that historical methods are the way to go, at least for what I'm interested in doing. As a general comment, I think one of the most revealing discussions was with Matt Kocher--it pushed together the world of historical methods and the world of statistical inference in a way that I think is really, really important. That's the lesson I wanted to be getting out of this class, and I think its a really important one--thinking of these fields as clearly distinct is a bad idea, because archival\/historical methods may be critical to justify your statistical approach. Just a thought. Thanks a bunch Sigrun!",
    "The course will definitely help me for one or more of my dissertation chapters, as I plan to work with historical sources. Importantly, it also helped me to evaluate existing research better.",
    "I really hope to improve my skills in historical and archival methods as my studies continue. I really came out of the course with an appreciation for how hard it is to do great work with this method, but at the same time, how great the work can be if this method is used well. I honestly wish there was a second part to this course, because there is only so much you can cover in one semester."
