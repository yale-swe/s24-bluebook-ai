    "The course introduces topics and methods useful for working with and understanding light matter interaction. The fact that both classical and quantum physics approaches were introduced gave a well rounded review of the topics.",
    "Basic knowledge of physics for light matter interaction",
    "In this class, I learned how to use coupled mode theory to explore many interesting light matter interactions. It's remarkable how easy it is to apply this formalism to many different types of problems.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that students with less background of the subjects might find some parts of the course fast. Some background in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and solid state physics gives the opportunity to understand higher level understanding of the phenomena and their interpretation, and not just go through the technical aspect of calculations.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were well prepared The class notes handed out were thorough, clear, and very useful The homework was very well connected to material covered in class and was intended to teach A possible way to improve: A small portion of the material was relatively straightforward and could have simply been left in the notes instead of derived in class. This could give a little more time for the more difficult material in the course as well as for extra topics."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to physics and engineering students interested in the topics covered, as it gives several approaches to understand the physics underlying light matter interaction. I would recommend taking courses, or reading some background material in classical and quantum mechanics as background to the lectures.",
    "Yes, the class was both engaging and pragmatic. I anticipate that I'll use many of the techniques from this course throughout my research career."
