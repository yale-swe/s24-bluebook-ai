    "English 114 as a whole is a great way for freshman to strengthen their writing and even the playing field, so to speak, for students who did not receive a strong writing education in high school. It is definitely a must-take.",
    "I recommend this class if you want to improve your writing skills and are interested in technology or childhood (I liked it for the technology aspect). However, if you just want a WR credit, this class is not easy and I would not recommend it for that reason.",
    "I would definitely recommend Engl 114. It taught me how to write university-level papers, all while learning about the lives of children (and our personal lives) in this digital age. Although the work level was sometimes demanding, all of the homework was intended to help us in preparing our drafts or our final papers, so it was never mindless work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for a fellow student. I would say that this class really teaches you introductory writing and makes the connection towards more high level scholarly work if that's what you're interested in. It also delves into children and technology from a unique perspective.",
    "English 114 seems to be a great class for those looking to improve their writing, but suffers from a lemons problem students with a solid writing foundation, who would be able to add much to the class, often avoid this class. This makes the class, which has a heavy focus on peer workshopping and discussion, less rigorous than I would hope and, unfortunately, I didn't feel that professor ameliorated the situation. I started the semester absolutely loving Heather. I had heard great reviews from other students and professors so was excited when i got a spot in her section of 114. However, as the semester continued, I found that we were having to do more and more work that seemed to be getting less and less relevant to the skills we were supposed to be learning. As stated in the syllabus, ENGL 114.07 seeks to cultivate your creativity and empower you as a persuasive, engaging, and lucid writer. Further, professor Klemann often encouraged us to think of the audience not as just her\/the grader, but as some greater public (for instance, the readership of a scientific publication). However, when she encouraged me to change certain pieces of my P3 including parts which my P3 partner, various college writing tutors\/ former and current ENGL 114 professors, and I thought were strongest I listened to her. That is to say, when a tension arose (to follow the specific advice of changing my paper or the general advice of writing for a wider audience, for instance) I landed on what I thought would be the safe side and made the change."
