   "comments": [
    "very good",
    "I like this course! Learned a lot.",
    "More practical will be better. Lab part is perfect, but sometimes I feel the lab and lecture are not so connected.",
    "good",
    "the labs were educational, but frustrating, sometimes. The in class part wasn't super helpful, and maybe we could learn more about the math behind the statistical analyses that we do with the software.",
    "The labs were more useful than lecture.",
    "strength: good introduction to the course and the softwareweaknesses: final assignment was not very well thought out, seemed off the cuff and not representative of what was taught throughout the semester-labs seemed rushed-would have been better to have more in-lab time",
    "The labs were useful for learning how to use GIS. The lectures were interesting but did not really help to learn the program. They were very conceptual and I often felt like I didn't understand much of what was described. There was a disconnect between the lecture and the lab.",
    "The lectures and the labs were disjointed and the objectives of the course were not clearly defined.",
    "strengths: great content, good labs, applicable, great skill to learnweakness: time of the class (too early)",
    "Good combination of lecture and lab sessions. Lectures were a lilted bit dreary but provided necessary theory for the lab assignments. Overall, very good class.",
    "I think the course material itself is very interesting, and the labs are very helpful.",
    "It was good.",
    "The lab is a definite necessity because while it is good to hear about the different aspect of the program in class, it is more beneficial to get to practice using them and the GIS program.",
    "I learnt a lot through this class",
    "Lab instruction was helpful in understanding the lecture material. Could provide more instruction or background for labs ahead of time.",
    "The biggest weakness is the time: 8:00AM. It's an interesting class, but anything at 8:00AM is terrible. Everything else is good. The lab sessions are very informative, lectures are straight and to the point, and the assignments are reasonable.",
    "This is an organized and well taught course. Labs can get very long sometimes, but the skills we learned are invaluable. I am more confident in using GIS than ever before.Class is too early and gets long and boring. Most students zoned out half way through class.",
    "The lab is great, but the lecture material is not always super helpful. More emphasis on practical applications and how to interpret maps\/outcomes would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: The weekly labs were well-run and very helpful in learning the basics of using ArcMap.Weaknesses: The lectures were not helpful in teaching applications of GIS in public health. They focused more on the theoretical and mathematical aspects of GIS. Which...was not useful when it came time to actually apply practical skills that we had supposedly learned in lecture to the final project.",
    "This would be much better as a class meeting 2x a week in a computer lab so that students could follow along with the lecture and work through the program. I don't feel like I learned as much as I had hoped to going into this class. A comprehensive understanding of when to choose what sorts of spatial statistics to use, the pros and cons of each, why certain things work and certain things don't was lacking.This class has so much potential but the way in which class time is used and the type of materials covered could be much improved.",
    "The lab component of the course was the most useful. I wish the lectures had been more driven by practical application.",
    "good class, useful information, but the lecture and lab seemed like two totally separate classes. also, this is a weird thing to \"complain\" about but the midterm exam was really really easy. the final project was also set up in a way that we weren't really able to do too many interesting analyses on the data.",
    "I think the lab component of the class was the most useful part. The lecture was good, but I think I will remember more from the hands on part.",
    "Have labs which help me practice skills learned in class. However, labs were a bit difficult to follow. A lot was covered and it was too fast for me.",
    "This course was an interesting introduction into the GIS software. The lab sections aligned with the material learned in the classroom, and we typically were able to get the majority of lab material completed during section. The weakness of the course seeemed to be the variability in TAs. The TAs who went through the lab step-by-step and explained what was expected for the assignment were most effective.",
    "Lectures were dry and hard to follow, labs introduced analytical techniques but did not encourage exploration of the program or development of proficiency without detailed instruction.",
    "This is definitely useful as an introduction to GIS, and I'm glad I have this skill now. Sometimes the lecture and the lab seemed a bit separate, and I wish we had learned how to do a few more things in ArcGIS.I also think the final project should have been revised a bit. The objectives and expectations were not made clear, and so many groups spent a lot of time simply readying their data (and then having to redo it when they realized it wasn't what was needed) and less on the maps; this was a class on GIS, not data management, so the final project and its data set should have better matched that.",
    "This course is very relevant to any person in public health",
    "-Labs were great-Lecture was less helpful, too much time was spent on GIS theory, the class got much better on the end when we focused on specific statistical methods-Lecture was dry and hard to pay attention to as we had no context for the material until we got our lab assignments. I would suggest holding it in a computer lab (but still have regular lab) and integrate short examples into the lecture-Midterm was very easy, and didn't cover a lot of the material that was presented in the first half",
    "The course provides students with a solid foundation of GIS. While the lectures provided a theoretical understanding of GIS tasks, it would have been more helpful to delve deeper into ArcGIS software functions and processes.",
    "Great class. The material was applicable to a wide range of topics and the labs were very helpful.",
    "I enjoyed learning GIS and have have better knowledge about the program after this course.",
    "The class structure (1 lecture, 1 lab per week) was a strength.I did not find the textbook very helpful.",
    "Good course. Lab heavy. Lecture were too early.",
    "strengths:learned the basics of GIS software and the basics of the types of analyses you can do.weaknesses: not enough hands on work that was independent of labs, lectures went too slow, could have learned more in the first couple of lecturesDo not feel that I am proficient in GIS",
    "The lectures were informative, but sometimes the examples were not updated. The TAs were not equally as competent and often clarified lab assignments in the last day or two before due dates, which required many assignments to be redone if completed on a reasonable schedule. The content and potentially useful nature of it was the greatest strength of the course.",
    "Good. I really learned a lot from the class and I think I will be able to bring this skill with me into the workplace. The class could have started a little later (2 hrs for an 8Am is rough!)",
    "if the data for final can be tested first and clearer instruction can be given at the beginning that will be great.This class is super useful and great for future work in epidemiology.",
    "The final project was a little unclear...could have done with more instructions.",
    "The strengths of the course were teaching basic methods of spatial analysis in GIS, and providing the framework for the theoretical aspects of spatial statistics. I did not particularly like the textbook that we used for the course. I did not feel that it was a good resource to supplement the class material. It was a good book for providing both theoretical aspects and instructions on how to use the GIS software, but it often didn't go enough into depth for my liking.",
    "Strengths: The labs gave us an opportunity to get hands-on GIS experience and see how raw public health data could be displayed to convey information clearly.Weaknesses: While Dr. Holford did a good job explaining the material, the subject matter in the lectures was a little dry. It might have been nice to spend more time looking at and interpreting maps in the lectures.",
    "STRENGTHS: The two hour weekly labwas a great chance to gain hands on experience using GIS for structured projects and to ask questions. The final project was a great chance to apply the skills learned throughout the semester, and the presentation day was a fun chance to display our hard work and to see what other students had worked on for the final project. WEAKNESSES: Some of the material in the lectures was a little advanced, but this did not jeopardize my overall understanding of key concepts. IMPROVEMENTS: none"

    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford is very approachable and a soft spoken professor. He is knowledgeable. His slides are clear and easy to follow. His teaching style is dry, which is understandable because this class focuses on technical skills and computer software programs can get very tricky and hard to explain.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford is clearly very intelligent, but it was sometimes difficult to reach him. The dynamic of the class should change and be more interactive. Students would benefit from working with him in GIS during class time in an interactive fashion.I don't feel like many of us understand the ins and outs\/nuance of GIS nor were we exposed to enough materials to demonstrate the kinds of things that GIS can be used for.The idea of doing a final project was great but the way it manifested itself was frustrating. There were lots of directions given last minute and a different set of data or a set to which we could have more readily applied things we had learned in class would have been better. Also, there was very little initial communication about when everything was due.",

    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Strengths-pushing about the fundamentals behind maps and the analysisWeakness: at times the lectures could have been combined, especially the first few. I understand the history is also important, but for a class that meets only once a week, this could have been taken out to optimize class lecture time. More hands on time would have been great as well to understand the components of the software. The same could have been said about the labs-the first few were so basic but then it became much more difficult in a short span of time that could have been spaced out much more efficiently.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0The instructor was always prepared and is very knowledgable, but sometimes provided examples that were not updated.",

It was much more useful when there were presentations about what we would be doing before we completed the lab.However, sometimes we were not told what was expected of us to receive all of the points on the lab. For example, having to cite the source of the data within the maps or include very specific statements in the descriptions where not told to some of the lab sections.",

We once had a substitute TA teach our lab and he was fantastic, we all agreed everything was more clear and we learned a lot that day.",
    "The TAs should check the project datasets before they distribute the project work and datasets. Many students had to switch topic last minute, which significantly limit our ability to do comprehensive analyses of underlying social factors.",

    "2 \/ 3 of the TAs were amazingly helpful. I just wish they had held more office hours each week.",
    "The TAs were really difficult to get in touch with. Each TA should offer different office hours throughout the week so that more people can work with them. The TAs also need to work with one another to make sure they discuss with one another what will be graded and how it will be graded. There was inconsistency among what the sections were shown how to do and what sections were told to turn in that resulted in students from certain sections being less prepared for completing the labs or that led to students losing points on labs.Owais substituted and taught our lab once and it was so different. He did an excellent job working through the program and explaining what we were doing and why we were doing it. He did a great job as a TA and was helpful in making sure everyone understood the purpose of the lab.",

He went through the lab exercises step-by-step, explicitly discussed what to include in our lab assignments, and provided discussions on how the material connected back to lecture. He was always responsive to emails and questions.",
    "Owais Gilani -Excellent TA. He provided, in addition to the necessary components to complete the lab, tips and tricks that made working with GIS easier. Very good at explaining what we were doing at each step.",
    "Kathryn--not the best. She was fine, but often went quickly through sections and when students were having troubles, instead of helping them through, she would ask them to wait, continue with class, and then answer the question at the end of class; students then missed the rest of the lab, not being able to progress beyond the earlier obstacle. I also got the feeling that she felt frustrated and\/or resentful of having to answer my questions--really not the attitude a TA should have (or the feeling she should give students).Additionally, her section was all about going through the process of completing the lab. I didn't realize this fully until Owais lead one of our labs and did an excellent job of explaining the significance of what we were doing; after that class, I felt I really understood what was happening in that lab, and benefited the most from it (give that boy a raise!).",
    "My TA was very helpful, she knew how to answer my questions and was always available to help.",
    "My TA was very helpful, she e-mailed me back immediately if I had a question",
    "The TAs were great. However, I did not appreciate receiving emails from the TAs a few days before the labs were due (after I had already submitted my lab) with changes or new expectations. In the future, it would be helpful if all TAs were on the same page and communicated the same expectations so correction emails were not necessary.",
    "Catherine Lerro did a great job! She moved through the labs at a good pace and answered any questions we had.",

I would recommend this course to another student if they were looking for a basic introduction into GIS, but to also investigate GIS courses in the School of Foresty as I have heard great things about those courses as well.",
    "Although this is a solid introduction to GIS, I did not get as much out of it as I would haveliked. I think my time would have been better spent attending the GIS workshops and playing with the program on my own.",
    "GIS is a useful skill to have, if you want to be able to do spatial analyses. The class could be improved, but it does teach you how to use the program, as well as some of the background theory of what's going on, which you can't get from a mere manual of how to use ArcGIS.",
    "I would recommend it to any student in my department and I really wish that GIS was required for students in EHS.",
    "I feel like this class was effective in teaching the basics of GIS, and I would suggest this to anyone in Epi or Biostats, as GIS is a marketable skill. However, the lectures go into a lot more detail than is needed for the application of the knowledge, and if someone was choosing between a lot of classes I would suggest to skip this class and take the GIS workshops offered by Stacy Maples.",
    "This course will provide you with a solid foundation to ArcGIS.",
    "Very useful class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend it.",
    "If you want to learn GIS take this Course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I feel very confident using GIS at this point and am excited about applying what I have learned in the class to other projects.",
    "The course will only teach you the basics of GIS and you will feel fairly proficient. However, you will need additional course and\/or an independent study to fully utilize the basics of mapping and GIS in a way that could be deemed proficient in the program.",
    "I would recommend this course with reservations. The course content is very interesting, but it was extremely annoying to have to redo assignments nearly every week.",
    "Great introductory course. I learned a lot of skills that I am sure will help me in my PublicHealth profession.",
    "yes , it's a great course to improve your understanding in field epi.",
    "Useful if you want to go into public health jobs, definitely makes you stand out if you having working knowledge of GIS.",
    "This course gives a good overview of the applications of GIS in epidemiology and public health. We learned how to analyze spatial data and draw conclusions about trends at a basic level and how to create meaningful maps using the GIS software. I would recommend this course for someone who might use GIS in their research but is unfamiliar with the program.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn how to use GIS. It is a really useful skill to have, and this course provides the theory (lecture) and practical experience (lab) to feel comfortable using the program. I only wish there were more advanced GIS courses!!"
