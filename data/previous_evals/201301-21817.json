    "This was by far the most intellectually rigorous class I've taken at Yale thus far. The syllabus is wonderfully planned, and the model of the class works just as strongly. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of feedback on my blog posts, since that was meant to be the \"writing\" component of the class, though wasn't incredibly dejected because I got so much out of it in every other way.TAKE THIS CLASS! It will stretch your thinking in ways unimaginable, and leave you feeling like a more knowledgeable feminist every day.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I am not a WGSS major, and this was actually the first WGSS class I have taken, but I still felt that I was able to contribute to discussion and get a lot out of the class. Although I would recommend it, most of the people in the class are WGSS majors so be prepared to not know some vernacular. But everyone is great about explaining references etc. so I wouldn't let it discourage you from taking the class.",
    "Theorizing Sexual Violence will definitely change the way you think about sexual assault, even if you feel like you know everything there is to know already. It's good for people who have taken plenty of WGSS classes and people who have never taken them before but are willing to have a lot of their assumptions about the world challenged. Also Melanie is SO GREAT. But you probably already knew that.",
    "A balanced sampling of theory, anthropology, and cultural studies dealing with a sexual violence spectrum. As much (if not more) attention is given to intervening in rape culture as identifying\/naming sexual violence. The workload: about 4 scholarly articles of reading per week, 8 blog posts throughout the semester, a 5 page paper based off an in-class presentation on one day's reading, an intervention project (actually stage an intervention in sexual misconduct at Yale) including a paper, and a final 10 p paper. I would absolutely recommend it! Getting to work with Melanie is a great experience, and hopefully the course will continue to attract a great group of students like the classmates from whom I learned so much this semester. Also, you learn a lot but it's not too stressful!",
    "This is a great course. There's not that much theory, but it does help you to contextualize and think through sexual violence very effectively. There's an intervention project where you design and your own intervention against sexual violence on campus - some groups do almost no work, others a lot. CHOOSE YOUR GROUP WISELY. There's not that much reading, and the class discussion is generally good. Melanie is fantastic, and working with her is a great reason to take the class. For upper-level WGSS folks: this is a good class, but there will be a lot of people there who are new to WGSS. If you're looking for a theoretically challenging seminar, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a great class that's lots of fun and interesting, stick with this.",
    "While some previous WGSS know-how is probably helpful for this class, if you're interested in the subject material, don't be intimidated - take this course! The readings are manageable in volume and most are incredibly engaging and oftentimes challenging because of their content. You WILL learn a lot, and you will find yourself confused and upset, but Melanie is a great class leader and particularly good at finding positive notes and productivity in tough places. The intervention project and self-defense class are also really interesting and a lot of fun!",
    "Great class.",
    "YES DO IT. Melanie is so wonderful and brilliant and knowledgeable and also the chillest professor in the most important ways. She cares about you learning and thinking and contributing, not about grades and deadlines. And you will think and learn and contribute or else you will feel like the biggest tool.",
    "This class influences all of its students to take a hand in the Yale culture in ways more profound than many other courses offered at Yale. I feel as if I have become a better person by being in this course, but not by the readings and classroom discussions (which are always thought-provoking and frequently intense), rather, by the way that it influenced me to question myself and think critically about my place in the University and the world.TAKE THIS COURSE. It is the most beautiful display of how complex humanity can be."
