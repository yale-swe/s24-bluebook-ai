    "Intensive German is not so much a class as a lifestyle choice. Second semester is definitely less stressful, though! Once you finish with the grammar textbook, the rest of term is devoted to reading and speaking in German. Still easily several hours of work a night, but at least you're not freaking out over tests any more. And for the love of god, don't be late to class."
