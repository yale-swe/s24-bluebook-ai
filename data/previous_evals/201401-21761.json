    "ART 341 is the next level after ART 141\/142. In this class, you work towards completing a short film (3 to 7 minutes). You begin with some workshops on cameras and final cut, then move onto creating scripts for film, then spend the last part of semester to film your videos. I would definitely recommend this class to people interested in creating videos.",
    "A lot of work but probably the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. At the end of the semester you are left with tangible new skills, not to mention a film that you can call your own (from conception).",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend ART 341 for anyone who is seriously interested in film production. If you aren't passionate about your project, it will flop and you won't take much away from the class. However, if you put in the time, you will make important mistakes and end up with a film that, despite its imperfections, feels quite satisfactory.",
    "Want to make your own movie and get feedback on it in an academic setting? Take this course. It's fun. Even if you have previous filmmaking experience, take this course to learn how to be a better filmmaker (better camera angles, clearer editing)."
