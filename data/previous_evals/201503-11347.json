   "comments": [
    "HSAR 500 is an introduction to the most relevant literature and their methodologies in the history of the study of art history. I would recommend it to any art history student or anyone seriously interested in the study of art history, as it provides a gateway to the professional practice of art history. The texts we read in class are the foundational texts for modern art history and thus are assumed in most scholarship.",
    "I would not have taken this course had it not been a departmental requirement, and would only recommend it to students with an interest in more traditional art historical theory working specifically on painting\/works on paper.",
    "Basic introduction to applying the methods of art history to primarily pre-modern and modern art with limited attention to the ancient and medieval worlds. Focus is heavy on German schools of thought and individuals with whom the professor has involved his research.",
    "Methods is a required class, but I think it can be useful and even fun. It's a great opportunity to look at artwork that may be totally out of your field, and to engage with ideas that may push you out of your comfort zone. I think the historiography element of the course could and should be much stronger.",
    "HSAR 500 01 is what it claims to be, and although a required course, I would recommend it. It moves through existing methodologies in Art History and by the end left me feeling like there is still much to contribute and much to be done in the field."

   "comments": [
    "This course exposed me to the foundational texts of modern art history as well as their methodologies. It will contribute substantially to my dissertation and research.",
    "I am pleased with my new abilities to apply certain methods to research for term papers as well as have more productive conversations with curators. Overall- my background has grown immensely from taking this course.",
    "As stated above, I wish we had learned more about the historiography of art history, rather than just applying the methods that we dissected. Otherwise, I think the course was helpful. It was also a treat to take a class with all of my fellow first year students.",
    "I think it is a great crash course that attempts to describe a rather unruly discipline. If anything it leaves me feeling like the boundaries are a bit more fluid than I imagined, and slightly hopeful for the contributions I could, possibly make. In terms of dissertation research, I can't imagine beginning work on my project without having encountered the texts we read in class.",
    "The course helped me to explore canonical methodologies of art history. The course helped me to connect to other theoretical sources and refine my research interests."
