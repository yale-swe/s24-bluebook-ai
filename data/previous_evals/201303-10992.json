    "This is a course that you should only take if you have to, so I couldn't really recommend it. Although the labs themselves are quite fascinating at times, the lab writeups consistently took over 10+ hours a week, and contained a miserable amount of data analysis. That being said, it is a rewarding class in terms of learning about a host of physical systems, and it is MUCH better than P205L, but the amount of time the lab writeups took is not fair for receiving only 0.5 credits. Definitely take the superconductivity lab, and although the Nuclear Lab is cool (and an easy experiment), the lab write-ups for both weeks take forever.",
    "You'll spend hours and hours and hours writing each lab report, plus three hours in lab a week, plus the grading can be pretty tough (though it might be curved for a morereasonable final grade, I have absolutely no idea what my grade will be).Try to do it with a good partner, somebody you know. The experiments are frustrating to figure out.Pros:No final exam, which is very nice.Some of the experiments are really cool (J3 you use a big linear accelerator, the superconductor one, bending an electron beam with magnets).It's required for the major...If you've gotta do it you've gotta do it.If you don't gotta do it, don't do it.",
    "Much more fun than 205. Take it.",
    "If you weren't thrilled with 205, don't worry: 206 is much more interesting and educational. You get to choose which labs to perform out of a (generally very interesting) list of offerings, and oftentimes you'll learn about new concepts (such as superconductivity, logic gates, or data analysis for particle accelerators) you might not encounter otherwise.",
    "The labs in this class were fun and some of them ended up being applicable to other classes and areas of interest. The lab reports were long and not fun to write. Acoustic resonance and the nuclear scattering labs are easy to do though scattering has a long write up. Superconductivity is fun because you get to play with liquid nitrogen.",
    "Good class to take if you're a physics major\/interested in physics! Don't take it if you aren't interested in the material but don't want to take 166L with the rest of the non-majors. The workload is 1 15-page lab report per week, so it's far more than the 1 page lab reports of 165L&166L. The experiments are far more interesting than 205 though! You get to pick which ones you want to complete, which means that you can say bye bye to circuits FOREVER (if you wish). You stay with the same partner for all of your labs, so try to pick a section with a friend. As far as the labs to pick, DON'T DO THE MILLIKAN OIL DROP EXPERIMENT! According to both the professors and the students, no one has gotten it to work. You should pick the Nuclear Scattering lab, because you get to use the proton accelerator in the basement of SPL and you learn more than in the other labs. Also, if you're looking for an interesting but easy lab then do the Superconductivity lab. One last plus: there's no ;ab practical! Get started on data analysis for the writeups early, though; you'll be crying and wishing you did if you only start the night before.",
    "Physics 206L is a much more rewarding class than 205: expect to put in much more work, and get much more out of it. The choices really let you tailor the experience to your interests, and some of the experiments were extremely cool\/satisfying. Charge-to-mass-ratio, Digital Logic, and the Particle Accelerator sequence were all fun. Conservation of Momentum was TERRIBLE. Lab reports are a lot of work, devote a couple of hours per week to them and make sure you know your TF's expectations.",
    "Way better that PHYS 205L. In fact, it almost makes 205L worth taking, although if you are taking this course both labs are probably required anyway. The 206L labs are actually interesting and you aren't forced to stay 30 minutes to an hour over your normal time in Gibbs trying to finish an assignment.",
    "As usual, it's required for the physics major or for pre-med requirements, which is probably why you're taking the course. This course is much more fun than the previous PHYS 205L because you get to choose labs. Much better in that regard, although there are lab reports this time, which sucks because you have to write one every week. But trust me, if you're genuinely interested in physics, you'll appreciate this course and the ways it teaches you to perform self-guided physical experiments and analyses.",
    "Better than 205, I liked that we got to choose our own labs. Also labs could be done in shorter time than classtime. Some lab report analyses took a while though",
    "This lab is totally different than 205. 205 was three hours of hell every week, but I found 206 to be much more relaxed and even enjoyable. There is a good amount of work outside the lab time. Lab reports take probably 4-10 hours, depending on the lab and the amount of detail you put into it. However, I learned alot in this class. I was very satisfied with my 206 experience.",
    "No, haha. Too bad you probably have to take this. Luckily you don't have a final!",
    "I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get their hands dirty with some seriously cool physics. One word: superconductivity.",
    "Never. This class has an absurd amount of useless work. If you want to devote your life to typing mundane observations from dull experiments that you have no personal attachment to, take this class. If you have any interest in physics or anything else which requires time outside of this class, do not take this lab.",
    "Physics 206 lab is actually pretty great. You pick 9 experiments to do for the semester, and there is a good variety of selections. After completing a lab, you have to write a complete lab report, and this often takes a while. However, it's much better than 205L, because you can actually put a lot of time into your work instead of being forced to scribble data and conclusions as quickly as possible during the 3 hour lab period. Also, the grading is a lot less arbitrary than 205, because the TAs carefully grade your lab reports and give constructive, consistent criticism. You'll definitely learn a lot from this lab and get to do some pretty cool experiments along the way",
    "Lab notes were rather hard to follow still, like those of 205, although the labs were definitely more interesting. Attempt to start lab reports early, i.e. write the introduction and procedure before each lab and data analysis and conclusion after lab, to avoid pulling all nighters before they are due. Definitely do the particle accelerator and Kater's pendulum labs.",
    "The only reason to take this is if you have to. It's better than 205L because there is no final exam. The reports vary in difficulty depending on the lab. Also I assume it depends on the TA you have. I had a great TA who was clear about expectations and helpful.",
    "Very different from 205. You and your lab partner pick which labs do to from a list, and type up lab reports rather than just turning in a half-organized notebook at the end of lab. Both of these allow you to focus on topics you'd like to study more, and also give you some practice with scientific writing. It's a cool class to take, even if it's not required.",
    "It was sweet. The lab reports were kind of long, but OK if you get started on them early (read: not the night before). But some of the labs were super dope. Superconductivity, the electron charge to mass ratio, and the proton accelerator lab were really cool. You probably will do better if you write your lab reports in LaTeX... I guess it's a good skill to know anyway so why not learn it now.",
    "This lab class is NOT a half credit of work. I often spent more time on this lab than a number of my full credit classes. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this class. The labs are not the simple 205 labs but rather are properly modern labs, including superconductivity and particle physics. The lab report do take a huge amount of time and are frequently 10 pages or so; however, this class is a great exercise in technical writing.",
    "Do not base 206 on your experiences in 205. 206 is better in practically every way, especially with regards to the experiments. Be sure to consider doing the Nuclear Scattering and Superconductivity labs.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. I did not like this course at all. I saw many evaluations saying that the experiments in this course were much more interesting, making the course more interesting, but I completely disagree. First, the reports are ridiculous, there was no reason to regurgitate information on the lab report introduction, I would think that what matters is the analysis and conclusion only, but there was a lot of weight given to procedural parts that just slowed everything down.More importantly, the format of the experiments is the same: do what the instructions tell you to do and then write about why your numbers are the same as the ones you expected to get. There is very minimal thinking involved, and it doesn't matter how cool the experiments are, because what you do is so far removed from the point of the experiment, you can just blindly follow directions, that it is still not a valuable experience. I think that a class more focused on experimental design would be much better because in order to create an experiment to accomplish a goal, you have to understand the components of the experiment and what is actually going on. This also seems to be more like what scientists really do.",
    "Phys206L is INFINITELY better than 205. Don't be deterred from taking it if you hated 205. In 206L, you have a lot of latitude to choose your own labs, and it's a lot more chill overall. There are a lot more labs that you can see the real-world applications of, such as the digital logic and electronics labs. The lab reports were quite fairly graded. Overall, I enjoyed PHYS206L, though it was a little more work than I was anticipating.",
    "Again, it's intro physics lab part two. You'll take it if you have to. Don't if you don't have to."
