    "Yes, even better than Chinese in China",
    "A requirement, any way you look at it. It's how you get better at Chinese and it's also how you can fill your language requirement. If this is your first Chinese class at Yale, the homework and speed of learning can be a tough adjustment. You just have to accept that the first month is going to be hell, especially if you've taken time away from the language. But, after that, it evens out and you really start getting comfortable with your Chinese language skills. It meets every day, which can be a time-sucker, but it is what it is. Overall, it was more enjoyable than not (most of the time).",
    "It's a great class but a lot of work. I would definitely recommend it--it really improves both your written and spoken Chinese and is very well taught."
