   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of work, but you emerge much more competent in the French language. I recommend it.",
    "Take the course if you want to keep your French up, but don't excpect any fireworks.",
    "I would recommend french 150 if you can handle the workload. There are a good number of tests and papers and at some points in the year the reading each night is very long.",
    "Feels like highschool French- not what I wanted out of a level five college course",
    "It is a grammar, writing, and speaking course and I would recommend it for students.",
    "Yes! It definitely improves your French. The grammar is approximately the same as AP French, and everything else is a step up, so you (like me) last took AP, it's a great transition class. Well structured, well taught, etc. Workload is heavier than average (3-7 hrs\/week) but very consistent; no huge time-consuming surprises.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for a fellow student.",
    "French 150 is an advanced language course that seeks to improve your French from all angles. There's a ton of homework, so if you want to take this course just as a refresher and not for intensive skills improvement, consider taking it Cr\/D\/F. You'll watch movies, write essays, give presentations, read books, do grammar exercises, etc. etc. Grammar review is targeted and not comprehensive. All French, all the time. I liked it because I really wanted to improve my French, but I could tell that classmates who were just fulfilling a language requirement were frustrated by the workload. Pick a fun professor to make it bearable."
