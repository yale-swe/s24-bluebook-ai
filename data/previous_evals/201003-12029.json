   "comments": [
    "This is a class that is good for people who are: good from learning from a book, proactive about asking questions, good at waking up early, self-driven and self-directed, and coming into the class with a clear idea of a project they want to do.If you need a lot of structure, detailed feedback, and hard-core accoutability OR you have no idea what project you want to do, you will have struggles in this class.Also, if computer errors, computer malfunctions, or just plan computer struggles make you angry, frustrated, etc., this class is not for you. You need A LOT of patience to enjoy ArcGIS. The problem sets\/weekly assignments take hours and hours and hours.",
    "Not worth your time. If you want to learn GIS, find another way--this class isn't the way to do it.",
    "I would definitely recommend GIS to another student because GIS is a very powerful tool for analyzing data. However, be prepared for frustrating hours spent in front of a computer screen waiting for it to load\/crash\/give you error messages. Also, some people come into the class with prior GIS knowledge, which can seem very intimidating. Within the first month, it seemed like the spectrum of final grades were already determined. From very early on, you realize that the quality of your work is graded in comparison to other people as oppose to improvements of your work overtime. If you're someone who comes into the class without any prior knowledge of GIS, on every assignemtn it seems that you're always one step behind that person who already knew more. This can add on to the frustration of the class because you can work your butt off, devote all your time to GIS, and never feel like you're done catching up. With all that being said, GIS is the modern map making technology and when your maps look good, you're also extremely proud.",
    "The course requirements are pretty minimal (although the provided resources are extensive), so to really get a good grasp on you need to go above and beyond what's directly asked.",
    "GIS is a really useful tool, but fantastically frustrating to learn. Although there are times when you will get into its rhythm and be able to work through problems and apply functions with a lot of forward momentum, the majority of time will probably be spent trying 500 different ways of inputting information to make a certain function work. Therefore, I'd really, really ONLY RECOMMEND TAKING THIS CLASS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A DATA SET WITH WHICH TO WORK, and are therefore looking to analyze\/manipulate info in a way that will be meaningful and worth your time. Otherwise, the frustration will probably overshadow the utility (which is huge) of the program. Professor Tomlin is amazing and very responsive (although usually not in New Haven), but it's still very difficult working through problems on your own- make friends with Stace Maples, in the Sterling Maps library.",
    "A lot of the answer to this is above...I would recommend GIS to a student who knows that he or she wants to be using this software in some capacity in his or her professional future. However, for someone thatjust wants to understand GIS out of curiosity or on a rudimentary level, be prepared for a lot more than you bargained for.",
    "Take the course if you want to learn a practical skill, a rare thing at Yale. GIS is important and also pretty fun. The notes are thorough, the professor is engaging, and the project, if you pick a good topic, has the potential to be really interesting.",
    "GIS was extremely frustrating while at the same time, it was one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken. I spent more time on the final project on any other assignment I've done at Yale (the key difference between a paper\/exam class and a computer class using a program that's still very unintuitive is that whereas you can spend 24 hours writing and come up with a decent paper, its possible in GIS that you spend 24 hours working on something and in the end have it not work).I would recommend that you take it ONLY if you have a very tangible application that should get done. The most frustrating thing about the course is that its very \"go get 'em.\" As opposed to a traditional computer programming class, this class is designed with the idea that you already have a project in mind - think about a Java or C programming class where the professor just says that there is a final project that you should complete - most of the programming code and techniques you will have to learn on your own.",
    "Take GIS - its a great course that really teaches useful, marketable skills. You choose a project and learn the skills in relationship to your project, which allows you to really invest in something and personalize it.",
    "A course in which you learn real skills. I started taking this class C\/D in part based on recommendations from previous years and concerns about the workload - that turned out to be a mistake. The work is definitely a time-suck (run your renderings on the faster computers in CT Hall or the FES comp lab) but if you find the material interesting at all, you'll want to be putting more time into it so you can appreciate more of what is going on in lecture."
