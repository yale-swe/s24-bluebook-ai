    "None",
    "How to memorize lots of biology terms and pick up the important ones.",
    "I learned important concepts in biochemistry, and I also learned how to apply concepts and ideas I learned from organic chemistry to study this subject.",
    "A deeper understanding of the intersection between human biology and Organic Chemistry in a meaningful way.",
    "Learned how to make a bunch of relevant molecules in biochemical cycles in the body. Meshed orgo and bio together, which was pretty interesting",
    "I learned the principles of biochemistry including processes such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis pathways.",
    "I gained so much insight into biochemistry and felt that I left the course with a lot of knowledge on pathways, mechanisms, and reactions that are medically relevant and crucial to my field of study. I am now confident in the amino acids, fascinated by allosteric regulation, and appreciative of all the ways our bodies derive, build, and degrade compounds.",
    "good knowledge and understand of biochemistry",
    "Fundamental concepts of biochemistry, how to cram an astronomical amount of content into my head as quickly as possible",
    "You learn a ton of biochemistry. My favorite part was learning about hemoglobin.",

    "Learned a lot of intricate details about the chemistry behind biological processes.",
    "I am now pretty familiar with DNA and RNA mechanisms, metabolism, and synthesis of fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides. This is your standard undergrad crash course of biochemistry --- there's going to be a ton of material, but it was presented in a less painful manner than I'd expected by focusing on big picture concepts and connections between big fields. The course teaches you how to contextualize mechanistic behaviors (especially for carbonyl chemistry) you learn in orgo).",
    "I loved this class so much. The information was incredibly interesting and I learned so so much about biochemistry and analyzing scientific problems\/data as a whole. I would recommend this class over MB&B biochem to anyone because of the lack of a final. There is a ton of information and the class is very challenging but Breaker is a great professor and makes it very interesting.",

    "i learned to memorize Breaker really needs to be more clear about grading and class organization. I mean the fact that the TAs were not there until after the 1st midterm mid-Septemeber shows you how little breaker cares about his students. He also needs to be clear about the dean's excuses. Also, he needs to organize this class, the TAs, and review sessions better. Also, there's a lot of memorization for this class not a lot of understanding. One thing that would be better is if there are weekly quizzes, this would encourage students to learn as they go and be more on top-of-the stuff. Also, there could be problem sets for this class that could count as a grade--this would make those of us that do not test well as an opportunity to learn in a different manner as would quizzes. Honestly, this is just a problem for MCDB in general and this class and breaker needs to do some soul searching because if you are failing your weakest students, you are failing to educate all of us. it's all of us together or nothing. I know some of my friends were doing horrible on the tests, and they deserve to have a professor that simply takes more. More could have been done by the professor to engage the student. In physics171, Morchie reaches out to you and helps you get out but Breaker really needs to step up and be a professor. I'm shocked at how one becomes a whole STERLING professor by being this bad at teaching. Damn, really shows you where this universities priorities are---in the research about some random riboswitches rather than educating the next generation of scientists\/physicians.",
    "A LOT of biochemistry obviously. And by a lot, I mean a lot. This course moves very fast, so every lecture you learn a ton of new information. I also learned about how mechanisms from organic chemistry are used in biology. I love chemistry, so this was the highlight.",

The second part of the course focuses on metabolic processes such as the breakdown of glucose and building nucleic acids, fatty acids, and amino acids.

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Breaker is really nice and a very knowledgeable teacher. The tests were all very fair and based on the information that we were taught. Sometimes though it felt like we were bombarded with too much information and I think that he should have slowed down at times.",
    "The course was very arbitrary with countless sets of reactions thrown at us during lecture that were never tested on. The big picture was never reinforced, which really discouraged me.",
    "The way that this course is taught makes it difficult to figure out what part of the vast amount of material students should study before tests. In addition, due to the speed at which the teacher went through the material, I don't feel that I will remember anything I have learned or be able to apply it to anything a year from now. However, the slides are generally well made and clear.",
    "Strengths: less of an emphasis on rote memorization than MB&B, pretty good lectures (except for Engelman's lectures), more of an emphasis on medical applications, less of a week to week workload (no psets, no quizzes) and no final. Weaknesses: Because there aren't any psets, there's no way to evaluate how you're doing except for the midterms that are 25% of your grade. Additionally, that means there's no way to practice except for the practice exams. Ideally, there should be short, optional psets with the answers given so students can check on how well they understand the concepts before the exam rolls around. This year might have been an exception, since it seems like the TAs in the past have been fairly supportive, but since the class grew twice in size, Breaker had to recruit TAs at the last minute, and some of them clearly have not reviewed the material recently\/don't know what's going on in class and just act condescendingly towards the students. Furthermore, please, please, please provide practice exam answers in the future---how are we supposed to learn from our mistakes, especially if there's only ONE chance for us to practice per unit? In general, I think the term 'pick your poison' applies to the biochem courses at Yale pretty well---if you're really interested in biochem and want a solid, structured foundation (that may be harder)---pick MB&B. If you don't really love biochem and want a class that's easier to adjust to (even if that means fewer opportunities to practice for exams and more volatile test results), pick MCDB. Also, if you're not sure about the \"no final\" thing---let me tell you, you definitely do not want a final. There's WAY too much information, and unless you plan on only having one other final or no other finals, it'll be really difficult to review everything.",
    "Professor Breaker is very passionate which is nice, but this class goes WAY too fast. This class also says only organic chem 1 is required, but it definitely needs orgo 2 as a pre-req. There was plenty on our exams that a second term of orgo was needed. This class has too much info packed into a single semester.",
    "Strengths: the class only has 4 exams and no final, and each exam is not cumulative so you can focus on each unit at a time. I thought the class was engaging, and opened my eyes to many biochemical principles I had never learned before. I also think that Professor Breaker is so enthusiastic about the subject that it makes me appreciate how fascinating biochemistry is. Weaknesses: we cover a LOT of material in only one semester, so many things are briefly introduced but we do not go into greater detail. In some ways this was good because you only needed to know some stuff at a certain level. But it was at times ambiguous on what stuff you needed to know for the exam or what you didn't need to know.",
    "It exists, so that's a positive. I need to take it to get into medical school, which is fine I guess. Don Engelman's lectures frustrated me to no end because I had to wake up to walk to a new room to sleep because they were so terribly unengaging. Ron Breaker connected with us better, but there was too much content for the fourth exam",
    "Strengths: The concepts were quite interesting and merged with ideas I learned in organic chemistry, so it was overall very cool material! Weaknesses: Sometimes there seemed to be an influx of unnecessary details, which made concepts overly confusing.",
    "Strengths- The class is taught very well in my opinions and I found the TA sessions to be helpful. It is a lot of material in general but Prof Breaker does a great job of not making the class solely about memorization, and I found that the tests were a fair assessment of the material. Beware that this class has four tests each worth 25%, so you have to stay on top of the material because there are no weekly problem sets or quizzes.",
    "It was a bit difficult sometimes to know in how much detail we needed to know specific mechanistic details and such, so there was a lot of memorization",
    "A strength of the course is that Professor Breaker is a great lecturer who keeps students engaged and presents material in a clear way. His review sessions were very helpful and he always stopped to answer questions. The exams were all fair and reflected the material taught in class. The only weakness was that for the last two exams there were a lot of specific mechanisms presented and it was difficult to determine how much detail we would have to know for exams.",
    "A strength of this course was definitely the professors - they were understanding, friendly, approachable, and had a decent sense of how much material we could handle. At times the mechanism and memorization felt a little rushed and was overwhelming, but the exams never asked any unreasonable questions. Both professors spoke clearly, were confident in their lectures, well organized, and I loved their exam review sessions. The even, clear, calm way they handled a bunch of hyper premeds makes this course a strong MCDB choice.",
    "Helpful slides Breaker slides were difficult to understand at times",
    "Strengths: Prof Breaker is a good lecturer Weaknesses: Only 4 exams, nothing to supplement your grade. It is kind of nice because it means there is basically no work for this class (unless you count reading, which basically nobody does) other than the week of the exam, but it also means you have no practice applying the material, no feedback regarding your understanding of the material, and no idea what will be emphasized on exams (and the level of detail required). We flew through the material and it was very hard to determine what level of detail was required for the exams, making studying for each one incredibly exhausting. Definitely much harder than the intro bio courses and the curve can be pretty harsh, considering (basically) everyone is an intense premed who knows what they are doing by now.",
    "Strength is that Dr. Breaker has a kind heart, but he is totally not understanding of how much work he is throwing on us and stress. The TA's knew less than the students (except for Alyssa and Connor who were helpful). There was no resources not even answer keys to practice tests.",
    "Strengths of the course included Professor Breaker's enthusiasm and love for biochemistry; it made lectures much more engaging. The tests were mostly fair and the course was organized. The four non-cumulative exams were a good system because there was a lot of information for each exam. Weaknesses included the sheer amount of information to be learned, and Professor Engelman's lectures, which were a little disorganized and confusing. More practice questions in the form of non-graded problem sets could be useful for future students.",
    "this class isn't forgiving. if you do poorly on one exam your grade is really shot. and there just isn't a way to redeem yourself, which i find unfair. a lot of professors now are understanding that sometimes it takes students longer to understand material. here, if you can't keep up (it goes very very fast), might as well drop the course.",
    "The content is taught very well, but there is an incredible amount of detail",
    "The class is structured around concepts, but there is so much detail on the slides, and little advice on what is actually necessary to know. I wish that the professors had been more transparent about this. For example, many of my classmates and I memorized every mechanistic detail for glycolysis for midterm 3, as Breaker recommended, but after the exam he said he hadn't expect us to do so... things like that. Essentially the class rewards people who can cram a ton of details in that you only saw two days ago and spit it back out on an exam two days later. The 4 lectures taught by Engelman were choppy and didn't flow well with the rest of the class. Other than that, Breaker was pretty great, and you're getting a whirlwind tour of biochem without a cumulative final.",
    "I thought it was a great class! The only weaknesses was that a few of the TAs were very incompetent. Professor Breaker is a GREAT professor.",
    "The entire grade is based on 4 exams, no homework\/practice resources - makes it hard to keep up with the material unless you take initiative (can be favorable or not) Guest lecture is not necessary - stick with one professor through the term Professor cares about material, but sometimes it is presented in a convoluted way and\/or it's difficult to figure out what is actually expected for you to know",
    "Strengths: Well organized, clearly taught, interesting material, connections to broader applications Weaknesses: tough to predict what material will be tested, test grading involved very specific key words which was very frustrating",
    "It could be improved if: the review sessions were run better. If there were weekly quizzes to keep you on top of work. If the mode of the exams wasn't a 94.",
    "eh--okay as they get. Breaker really needs to be more clear about grading and class organization. I mean the fact that the TAs were not there until after the 1st midterm mid-Septemeber shows you how little breaker cares about his students. He also needs to be clear about the dean's excuses. Also, he needs to organize this class, the TAs, and review sessions better. Also, there's a lot of memorization for this class not a lot of understanding. One thing that would be better is if there are weekly quizzes, this would encourage students to learn as they go and be more on top-of-the stuff.

I'm shocked at how one becomes a whole STERLING professor by being this bad at teaching. Damn, really shows you where this universities priorities are---in the research about some random riboswitches rather than educating the next generation of scientists\/physicians.",
    "I think this course is already as streamlined as it's going to get. Yes 4 midterms feel like a lot, but not having a cumulative final is truly a blessing. One area of improvement is maybe Prof. Breaker can spend less time recapping concepts from the previous lecture. He would do this sometimes and it felt like that was a bit of a time sink.",
    "The grading structure of this course is a little bit wild. It's four exams. No homework; it's on you to keep up with the material. Your success depends on how well you can cram, or how well you keep up with the material. Lectures are very dense, and some take a lot of work outside of class to fully understand. Professor Breaker is great, though.",
    "The only part of your grade is 4 exams. There was too much crammed in at a time. Not that much help is offered.",
    "It is a lot of material, but that is to be expected. Honestly, it was well-organized and I don't have many complaints. Maybe I would have liked more feedback on my learning, but that is difficult in such a big lecture, so potentially make more sections so that I would have been able to attend with my schedule.",
    "The strengths are that there are 4 midterms that aren't cumulative, TAs are very helpful, and lots of feedback is given or you can get it if you want. There is no homework and just the 4 tests, so it is manageable until you have a test. Weakness is that each test covers a ton of information, like a TON. Memorization only partially works, you need to actually understand it. Other weakness is that you can't take a makeup exam, you can only take a comprehensive makeup final if you miss a midterm which is inconvenient.",
    "The lecture is huge, the topics are surface level, and the course is extremely memorization heavy even though we are told it is not.",
    "Strengths were the instructor. He is a great lecturer that made biochemistry actually comprehendible.",
    "Breaker was a great lecturer but Engleman was a bit dry. I think the review session were also super helpful.",
    "The course is overloaded with content and lecture Powerpoints were never finished in one lesson. It became increasingly rushed towards the end and we were increasing unclear about what exactly we had to memorise when it came to the biosynthesis pathways. The Engelman lectures were absolutely terrible to get through.",
    "I like how there are only four exams. The fact that these exams are non cumulative allows us to focus more on the topic being learned at the moment. This means that there is also no busywork. The material was very interesting, and Professor Breaker is very clear in his explanations. One thing he does well is he refers to specific things in the diagrams such that if I closed my eyes and wasn't looking at the lecture slide, I would still know exact what he was referring to. His slides are very well designed. One weakness that I see in this class is that it is very hard to get to know the professor. I feel like Professor Breaker should try to make himself more available to his students so that they can get to know him. He should hold his own office hours like other professors do. I understand he's very busy, but just something to take into consideration. The exams were fair and clearly written, unlike those in other MCDB courses (looking at you MCDB 202).",
    "strength: taught extremely well by the professor Weakness: I wish the slides had more words sometimes. I had to write a lot of notes out",
    "Interesting content, but a lot of rushed content near the end of the course",
    "This course material is fairly distributed over four non-cumulative midterms, so it makes the learning process a little easier. But there is still much material covered per midterm, so studying for each has to come early. One major weakness of the course is that if a midterm is missed for any health, or job-related reason, the makeup is a cumulative exam administered during finals period, which seems like an unfair punishment especially for those who truly have no control over having missed a midterm.",
    "At times the class seemed a little haphazard, but nothing unbearable.",
    "It's not a bad course, but sometimes it's a little dry. I also really appreciate that the professor doesn't make us memorize mechanisms, but we spend so much time on mechanisms in class it's often really unclear what we need to know and to what level of detail. The organization of it into four midterms and no final was really good though, and it was easier to study the material like that.",
    "The strength of the course is Professor Breaker. He is a wonderful lecturer, very passionate and good at explaining. You can tell he loves Biochemistry and wants us to love it too. The biggest weakness of the course is that studying for the exams is the worst experience imaginable because it is impossible to figure out what we have to know and what we don't. Nobody can give you a straight answer. The TA's have no clue. Even by the fourth exam we still had no idea how to study for these things. They were a bizarre mix of very general and very specific questions. What subjects we had to know in detail and which we didn't was a literal gamble. Also Engleman is a very poor and boring lecturer and the class would greatly benefit from having just Breaker teaching.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was Prof. Breaker's enthusiasm for the material and the fact that there's no final unless you miss an exam. Not having that really takes a load off of your finals week. However, that being said, it is very stressful to have exams make up 100% of any grade so it's important to keep up with the material and go to section if possible.",
    "As someone who has also taken the MB&B Biochemistry (and dropped it halfway through) I can say this class is much more organized. The TAs are a gigantic help, and Prof. Breaker is an excellent lecturer who is very invested in trying to help students learn in one of the harder classes Yale offers. However, Prof. Breaker didn't answer emails or have regular office hours, but the TAs picked up where he left off in that regard. There wasn't much feedback and grading was pretty strict (questions are 'information dumps' in a sense).",
    "Strengths are the interesting material, informative TAs, and the lecturing ability of Professor Breaker. The weaknesses were the lack of assessments other than exams, which would have helped with more consistent engagement with the material, and the complicated and unclear lectures of Professor Engelman. It could be improved by not being as ambitious about how much detail to cover for topics, as we did not have time to cover some of the topics planned on.",
    "This course is extremely well organized and the tests are very fair.",
    "I didn't like how there were two professors teaching the course. Even though each was an expert in their respective fields, I feel like either one by themselves would be knowledgeable enough to teach the entire course.",
    "Strengths: PowerPoint notes usually contain all of the information that we need. Professor Breaker is wonderful at repeating important concepts throughout different lectures to really drill in what we need to know. The tests are very fair in that most of the questions do not ask obscure information. Weaknesses: Although the PowerPoint notes contain all of the information necessary, they are not necessarily the easiest to dissect. Some reactions were laid out in odd ways that made them difficult to follow, and some slides were so jam-packed with information that it was hard to know where to start following the information. I would recommend splitting the information into separate slides so that there is not a lot of text and diagrams on the same slides. Another weakness is that there were no answer keys for the practice exams. When we asked TAs, some of the answers sounded like guesses which were not very reassuring. Even for tests, Professor Breaker did not write answer keys for the exams which meant that TAs were able to grade them via their discretion. This caused some questions to be graded more harshly than other questions. Furthermore, for the first exam, Prof. Breaker thought the answer was something else (which a lot of students had put down since he taught it that way), but the TAs only accepted another answer, and no points were given back.",
    "This course is well organized to provide a basic introduction to biochemistry. The lectures were the primary strength of the course. Lectures move at a reasonable pace and are designed to keep everyone on the same page, regardless of their background in biology or chemistry. A weakness of the course is the lack of other grades outside of exams. Because the course covers a broad swath of content, it was hard to know how to prepare for each exam. The same strategies and lessons learned from the first exam, for example, could not be applied to the second, which covered a distinct set of topics.",
    "There is a lot of information to learn in this course. It was helpful to have access to the slides on Canvas and be able to bring them class and take notes directly on them. The workload is very light with just 4 midterms. I think the fact that they exams were not cumulative helped tremendously to study more effectively and focus on\/learn just a subset of the material at a time. It was nice to also have discussion sections held by TAs outside of class for reinforcing material discussed in lecture and to ask questions. It was also convenient to be able to attend any one of the sections throughout the week. I think one weakness of this course is that it was hard to keep up with the material since the entire class consisted of just 4 midterms. I sometimes wished there were weekly or bi-weekly PSETs to not only prevent students form falling behind on understanding the material but also to take some of the grade percentage away from the 4 midterms. Having the entire grade for the course come from just 4 exams felt overwhelming at times when studying for them. Although organic chemistry is a pre-req for this course, many students come from different organic chemistry backgrounds and I felt that the professors often quickly went over or didn't even explain some organic chemistry concepts\/mechanisms expecting students to already know.",
    "MCDB Biochem is memorization heavy, there's no way around that fact. I think the course could be improved by quizzes or problem sets--some way that students can check their progress against what's expected of them. Also, it would be nice to have a clearer and more transparent grading structure. I'm still not sure how our grades are going to be assigned, and whether or not the class is curved.",
    "There were many strengths to this class. It covers a ton of material, but the parts that we need to memorize, as opposed to just learn from\/see the patterns, are clearly defined. The more difficult sections of the material are gone over multiple times, and throughout the class, we are reminded of the connections to past topics covered. This was very helpful in learning because it presented Biochem as a few common patterns, pathways, and processes rather than many many separate topics. Also, the structure of four discrete exams and a makeup cumulative final was very helpful, because we got to test our knowledge in chunks before moving on. The only weakness was that there wasn't much feedback from TAs on incorrect answers on exams, but that is minor as we have the opportunity to reach out afterwards if needed.",
    "It would be better if in lecture, the professor did not dwell on topics that will not be tested, but the lectures were very clear and easy to follow.",
    "It was very well taught, but there was so much material, so I wish a study guide could be provided for each test.",
    "Strengths: the professor. As many others have said, Prof Breaker is an engaging, enthusiastic lecturer. It's obvious he loves the material and loves teaching it--and his curiosity is almost infectious. Also, no final exam was quite nice. I actually enjoyed not having homework. Weaknesses: A lot of time (I studied a week in advance, and barely covered all the information) poured into studying for each of the midterms. A study guide provided by the instructor about important points to focus on would help a lot.",
    "Major weakness - the curve. Students here are high performing and the averages on the midterms are ridiculously high.",
    "strengths: professor breaker is a great professor who is really good at explaining biochemistry concepts and breaking down ideas into their key component. I felt like i learned a lot. weaknesses: towards the end of the semester the pace of the course increases exponentially and we learn a ridiculous amount of stuff in a very short amount of time.",
    "more structured review sessions, maybe some other form of weekly homework or quizzes for a small amount of points to help ensure that students stay on top of material",
    "Professor Engelman's lectures were not enjoyable; I would have preferred that Professor Breaker taught those classes, as well. There was a lot of information to memorize, and review sessions were always at the same time and very last minute (the day before the exam), so students like myself were not able to make it because of schedule conflicts.",
    "Strengths: only 50-minute lectures though even that felt like too much sometimes, optional section, no final Weaknesses: content was very confusing, not that effective in teaching biochemistry",
    "The weakness of the course definitely is the time constraint. As it is a year's worth of material condensed into a semester, it leaves the students slightly overwhelmed, managing more material than is possible without acquiring the biochemical understanding that this course is supposed to deliver. Also any teacher that is not Breaker was a significantly worse lecturer. Finally the lack of psets and short midterms fail to reinforce the biochemical intuition they are trying to instill. I believe the problems are mostly tied to the structure of the course and the timing of the course itself",
    "Strengths: Professor Breaker Weakness: Grading and expectations on the tests",
    "This course was amazing!!! It was so well organized, and Professor Breaker did a great job making the material engaging and understandable.",
    "The strengths are that the professor is great, but the course can be improved by not being so dry at the end of the semester. Granted, it is biochemistry, so I don't know how much can be done in this area.",
    "Overall, I think this is an extremely strong course. Professor Breaker is a good lecturer, the material is interesting, the format of the course good, the midterms very fair. I particularly liked the fact that the course focused not on memorization but application and thinking. I think the biggest downside was the TAs. They were all MPH students, and I know they're very talented people, but they didn't seem to have a super strong grasp of biochemistry (presumably because their research is related to public health). In other biology courses I have found sections and review sessions very helpful, but in this case they were not.",
    "The professor was often unorganized, and seemed very confused with the material which is pretty funny since he was supposed to be an expert. The strength of the course is its structure of 4 midterm non-cumulative exams.",
    "The professor was very good at teaching. However, there was too much information to internalize in such short time.",
    "The course was well taught, however, there was no clear expectations for the exams. The class was mostly memorization, however, the level of detail for which we were supposed to know the information was very unclear.",
    "The course was very organized which I liked. Sometimes the slides were not very detailed so it was tough to follow if you were re-looking at the notes on your own time.",
    "To improve student engagement, I think there should be assignments apart from the exams where you have an opportunity to be tested on the material. I think this would help students retain more instead of promoting the habit of simply cramming a few days before the exams, only to forget everything the day after the exam.",
    "The only factors which contribute to grading are four exams. The first two exams covered a lot of concept-based material, and I found studying for them to be quite straightforward. The second two exams, however, covered a lot of pathway- and mechanism-based material, and I found studying for these exams to be confusing and at times quite overwhelming. Professor Breaker often said that he did not want us to memorize the exact pathways, just \"understand\" them, and the density of the materials seemed to make pure memorization nearly impossible. However, many of the questions on these exams did require memorization. I think it would be helpful to try to clarify what needs to be learned or how to study the material for future semesters. I also think it might be a good idea to have periodic homework questions so that the exams aren't the only grades for the entire course.",
    "Strengths of this course included the lectures, the slide materials, and the TA led sections and reviews. Weaknesses of this course included that there were no problem sets or other assignments outside of exams to help you learn the material.",
    "It was taught really well; the lectures were phenomenal. There was a lot of material and it wouldve been helpful to clarify what was most important to know outside of review sessions.",
    "Strengths: Prof Breaker's enthusiasm, the breadth of the class Weaknesses: Prof Engelman's lectures, the randomness of the TA's grading at points",
    "the course is well taught. the review sessions with the TA's can be improved in order for a more critical analysis of the material.",
    "I think that this course could be improved with regards to the method of testing. I think weekly quizzes would have helped me learn the material better",
    "There is a lot of material and it can be difficult to memorize\/understand it all. There are 4 midterms and it would have been super helpful if there had been weekly quizzes so that you could get used to the types of questions asked on the exams.",
    "Very disorganized.",
    "A weakness of this course is the fact that all of biochemistry needs to be shoved into one semester. As a result the students have a rather broad understanding of biochemistry and do not have a lot of the details memorized\/understood. The problem with this is that the details were all provided but then we were told not to memorize them as only the broad important topics would be tested. Lots of students struggled with knowing what was truly important or broad enough to study. Don't provide details unless you test them",
    "A strength in my opinion is 4 non-cumulative exams. It makes approaching biochem much easier.",
    "I think this course does a great job at giving a surface level overview of primary biochemistry topics. However, I do think because the course attempts to cover so many topics the lectures can feel extremely rushed. Professor Breakers review sessions before each exam were very helpful.",
    "This class involved way too much memorization. I understand there are some basics that you have to know to understand the inner processes we are expected to learn, like DNA molecules and amino acids structures. But this class focused on so many details of mechanisms that it was unreasonable to have to know. Although the professor tried to make it so we would not have to painstakingly know every detail, the method in which processes were gone over made it very unclear what the overall picture was for many topics. Specifically, the carbohydrate unit should be reworked, and the fatty acid degradation\/synthesis along with phospholipids should be relooked at as well. The beginning units were explained in big picture, and I think the details of glycolysis\/krebs\/ETC were explained in a bigger context. The other units were just endless detail of mechanisms and it was very unclear what the message was. Also the fact that deans excuses mean you have to take a cumulative final is unacceptable. There should be make up exams for people that are in the hospital! Additionally, I think it would be helpful to have five quizzes throughout the semester (each 20 points) and at the end you can drop the collective lowest 100 points score (either one of the four exams or the five quiz grades. Otherwise there is just so much pressure on the students for each exam. Especially when deans excuses aren't accepted properly.",
    "Teacher is very good, although knowing what was going to come up on the exams would have been more helpful ahead of time.",
    "hated it so much- material was great- teaching was terrible, had a really hard time learning what was expected of me, and found exams to be very unpredictable- like I would do amazing on one page and then fail the next- very poorly designed and taught course. And you wouldn't even know why you got an answer wrong because you would just write whatever the prof told you and then get like 10 points off for some crazy obscure fact u were never taught or even saw in the readings.",
    "One strength of the course is the non-cumulative exams throughout the semester. Another strength of the course is the dedication and the availability of the TAs to go over what we learned in lecture. One weakness of the course is how much information in the lectures is testable, especially in the later part of the semester. Another weakness of the course is how there is no answer to the previous tests they release due to the fact they do not answer their own test questions prior to giving it to the class. This could be improved by narrowing down the topics (or specific details) of what we need to learn for the test.",
    "Weaknesses: seemed to cover a lot of material in a lot of detail, but not require that we actually know it. So instead of going over some super cool mechanism in class, wed be told to look it over later (which, how many people did?) and end up focusing on super broad sweeps of pathways. Strengths: Breaker is very enthusiastic about the class and obviously cares about the material. Pretty straightforward to follow along with. Doesnt need to be super engaging ; if youre very interested in the material shop the MB&B version.",
    "Weakness: class sections should NOT have been established after schedules were due. It was extremely inconsiderate.",
    "strengths: good precursor to the subject, weakness: no leeway to mess up in exams",
    "I did not retain any information from lecture. The sections were not hlepful. The lack of psets or any outside work was nice but did not aid in our learning.",
    "Nothing between midterms to make sure we were on top of the material."

   "comments": [
    "For most people this class is taken as a requirement... would not recommend taking this class just for fun.",
    "Nope. Not unless you have to. One of the worst (if not the worst) core MCDB class I have taken.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're required to take it, as they go through so much material so quickly that you don't actually learn anything by the end besides how to cram-study.",
    "Ughhh that's a hard one. If you have to take biochem, then yes. I think it's a more relaxed course than MB&B and not as cutthroat (but still hard---your week leading up to the midterm is going to be hell, though the rest of your other weeks will be super chill). If you don't...maybe not. The worst parts about this course was the lack of chances to practice\/receive feedback and the TAs. But in general, Breaker is one of the better science lecturers I've had at Yale, and he seemed nicer from the professors in MB&B, based on the one class of MB&B biochem I shopped. Also, not every lecture was incredible, but in general, I definitely learned a lot, and some of the concepts in the class were super interesting and amazed me.",
    "NO. This is easily the HARDEST I have taken at Yale. It goes way too fast, the material is soooooo in depth, and Professor Breaker expects you to not only understand the information but be able to apply it to something you have never seen or heard of before. You need so much time to take this class and with other pre-med courses it is almost impossible to spend the time needed to study for the exams. Its also hard considering your entire grade consists of4 grades all worth 25%. There is no grade boost at all, so you have to do well on every test or else you are not set up to succeed.",
    "Yes! I liked this class because Professor Breaker is engaging and you get a good introductory overview of many biochemistry topics.",
    "If you have to take it then yeah I guess",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students unless it has been improved structurally and its syllabus revised with more care and support system.",
    "I would recommend this course to another premed student because there is a low workload and the concepts are fairly straightforward to study. However, if a student is looking for a more detailed exploration of biochemistry with more engaging lectures, then I would recommend that the student take MB&B biochemistry.",
    "I would! I really enjoyed the class and did learn a lot.",
    "Course was interesting and combined knowledge from orgo in a biological setting",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because the material was interesting and the workload is manageable as long as you keep up and don't only study right before the test because there are no psets, only exams.",
    "As far as MCDB courses go, I really enjoyed Biochemistry taught by Breaker and Engelman. I loved both instructors, loved that one instructor (Breaker) covered most of the lectures, I loved learning chemistry that was more medically relevant than Orgo. I didn't mind studying for exams, loved the no weekly assignments, didn't think the memorization required was awful or impossible. It's such a basic foundational course that I can't see any reason not to recommend it. Frankly, I know it can be taught much more terribly.",
    "Yea. Whether you are premed or interested in science, it was a fun class where I actually enjoyed learning",
    "Not really but it's required for many",
    "No, don't take biochemistry unless you have to. Maybe take the other class offered. At least there you have resources for help.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially over the MB&B version, due to Professor Breaker's great teaching style and the amount of information to be learned.",
    "I would recommend if you have to take it or are very interested in biochemical principles.",
    "If you're not sure whether to take MCDB or MB&B --- the exams for MCDB are all short answer (no fill in the blanks), and require some degree of logical\/novel thinking and problem solving, but most of it is mentioned in class so you aren't going in blind. Plus, there isn't a cumulative final, which meant the final week of class was rough, but also means your reading period becomes significantly better. The last 2 metabolism midterms had ridiculously high averages (the mode was a 94) but that's also because 1\/5 of the class dropped by the deadline. Review your notes after every class to keep up with the material (there is an exam every 3 weeks), and try to preview the last and 2nd to last lectures before the exam ahead of time, and you'll be fine.",
    "Yes!! TAKE THIS CLASS OVER THE MB&B one. There is so much information to learn so not having a final is very nice.",
    "Yes, to a student who needs to fulfill a requirement. I'd recommend shopping both biochem courses, though, and seeing which one suits you better.",
    "Yes! Such a great class. I loved that Professor Breaker included a lot about medical relevance of the science he taught.",
    "Yes, if you want to fill a requirement, this is a good biochem course to take and (in my opinion) probably preferable to MB&B biochem (which is a whole year). The course is well organized and Professor Breaker is a very clear and focused lecturer. The material can be interesting and Prof. Breaker does a good job of bringing in outside applications. It's not the most thrilling topic but definitely prepared me for the MCAT biochem and I learned a lot of genuinely interesting things along the way. The class has four midterms, each 25% of the grade and non-cumulative, so the workload is actually quite low if you study quickly. If you spend a good bit of time preparing for exams then it is average or above average workload. The tests are a bit frustrating, since it is very hard to predict what will be tested. Some tests were almost all memorized mechanisms or structures, while others were largely conceptual. The grading looks for very specific things and key words so it can be quite frustrating. However the overall grades are fairly forgiving and the material is not super hard, there's just a lot of it. They may announce a discussion section after the first few weeks, but it is really optional. Overall a solidly well-taught course with reasonable assessments and grading.",
    "Yes, because most likely you have to take a biochem class anyways. pick your poison between this and MBB 300. I would recommend the MBB, it just didn;t fit in my schedule.",
    "yes-- take this one over the MB&B one but really be prepared to memorize a lot of shit for the exams. Breaker says he doesn't wanna make it about memorization yet he makes people memorize so much for every exam. Idk if there's a way to learn biochem without memorizing a bunch of stuff, but more application of the material or a situation would be better. Making is applied would be more interesting and useful to a group of young scientists. eh--okay as they get. Breaker really needs to be more clear about grading and class organization. I mean the fact that the TAs were not there until after the 1st midterm mid-Septemeber shows you how little breaker cares about his students. He also needs to be clear about the dean's excuses. Also, he needs to organize this class, the TAs, and review sessions better. Also, there's a lot of memorization for this class not a lot of understanding. One thing that would be better is if there are weekly quizzes, this would encourage students to learn as they go and be more on top-of-the stuff. Also, there could be problem sets for this class that could count as a grade--this would make those of us that do not test well as an opportunity to learn in a different manner as would quizzes. Honestly, this is just a problem for MCDB in general and this class and breaker needs to do some soul searching because if you are failing your weakest students, you are failing to educate all of us. it's all of us together or nothing. I know some of my friends were doing horrible on the tests, and they deserve to have a professor that simply takes more. More could have been done by the professor to engage the student. In physics171, Morchie reaches out to you and helps you get out but Breaker really needs to step up and be a professor. I'm shocked at how one becomes a whole STERLING professor by being this bad at teaching. Damn, really shows you where this university priority is---in the research about some random riboswitches rather than educating the next generation of scientists\/physicians. But I guess, this speaks to the Yale political economy as a whole, where you have a bunch of rich kids from well off high schools doing well and the rest of us have to catch up often with very little resources. Thus, if you are from a disadvantaged background, watch out, get extra help, start reviewing as soon as the lecture ends, record the lecture and play it back and teach yourself the material. Do the practice test in a test-like setting and go to the review session. Start memorizing the amino acids, nucleotide bases, and ATP NOW as you are reading this, if you are thinking about pre-med\/bio. You future depends on it. despite these challenges, you will survive and thrive because you have it in you and because you, another wide-eyed first generation, low income, women of color student, I believe in you. you can do this Good luck!",
    "Yep. Having 4 noncumulative midterms is truly a great way to run the class. I recommend this course over the other one.",
    "Yes, if you're committed to keeping up with the material. You'll learn a lot, but grading can be fluky.",
    "No, it was really hard and I dont feel like I learned much.",
    "Yes, it is mandatory for pre-med kids.",
    "Only take if you have to or are really interested in biochemistry. It is a ton of information and is not easy. It is manageable if you stay on top of the information and start studying like a week in advance.",
    "Absolutely not. The material is surface level and complete memorization. For a science course at a university that emphasizes creating the next generation of thinkers, this is embarrassing. One of the worst courses, if not the worst, that I have taken at Yale. Do yourself a favor and skip this.",
    "Yes, it is a great biochemistry course especially if you want to take MCAT. It gives you almost all the information that you need in one semester.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. I really enjoyed the clarity of teaching. There's no busy work, just four exams that make up your grade. The averages on all the exams are extremely high. I'd even go so far to say that this class is a gut, but an interesting one at that! This is one of the easier courses that I've taken at Yale, and one of the few classes that actually make being premed enjoyable. Breaker is a wonderful and funny professor, and his exams are fair. The material is awesome; biochemistry is amazing! Easy, enjoyable, and fulfilling A!",
    "Yes if you have to take biochemistry this is a good one. There are only four tests and that is it. If that scares you, take the other biochem.",
    "Yes, but only if you're prepared to dedicate a fair bit of time to memorizing content. And only if biochemistry actually interests you.",
    "I would recommend this course to any person with pre-medical aspirations. This course seems to align nicely with the knowledge necessary for the MCAT.",
    "It seems like this class may be a little more chill than the MBB version.",
    "Honestly biochemistry is a requirement, but this isn't a bad requirement.",
    "Only take it if you really have to. If you're choosing between MB&B and this one I'd recommend taking this one if you want a lighter load for your semester and for your finals. There's no homework besides studying for the exams and section is optional so there really is no work except reviewing the lecture notes and preparing for the exams.",
    "I would recommend this class over the other biochemistry class - Profs. Breaker and Engelman are excellent lecturers.",
    "Yes to any pre-meds and others interested in biochemistry. This is an ambitious and interesting course that gives a lot of detail about many essential life processes and does not require a great deal of time as there are not assignments. However, one has to be careful to be constantly reviewing the material or else exams can be very difficult.",
    "Yes - Professor Breaker is a great lecturer. He is extremely clear and paces the class very well. The tests are very fair and having four non-consecutive tests throughout the semester broke up the material really nicely. Good class for premeds, MCDB majors, or NSCI majors!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially over the MB&B biochemistry course if you are not an MB&B major. This course covers all the important topics that you need to know (for MCAT, etc.). Even though it was fast-paced and we skipped over some stuff, it was very enjoyable and I did end up learning a lot. The lack of homework also helped this this semester because of the lack of time I had.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. MCDB300 provides a strong introduction to biochemistry. Professor Breaker cares about making the lectures engaging, relevant, and educational. While the course moves fairly quickly, each lectures move at a reasonable pace. The exams represent the only grades in the course, making them a point of stress but their non-cumulative design makes them fair.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student considering taking a biochemistry course. It was not my favorite MCDB course to take, and was not very engaging, but I did learn biochemistry. There is a lot of information to learn in this course, but the workload is very light with just 4 midterms (all cumulative, no homework\/PSETs, and no final exam). I think the fact that they exams were not cumulative helped tremendously to study more effectively and focus on\/learn just a subset of the material at a time. It was nice to also have discussion sections held by TAs outside of class for reinforcing material discussed in lecture and to ask questions. It was also convenient to be able to attend any one of the sections throughout the week. However, it was hard to keep up with the material since the entire class consisted of just 4 midterms and lectures were at 9:25am M\/W\/F. All the material on the exams came from the lectures, so it was important to attend all of them to take notes. I sometimes wished there were weekly or bi-weekly PSETs to not only prevent students form falling behind on understanding the material but also to take some of the grade percentage away from the 4 midterms. Having the entire grade for the course come from just 4 exams felt overwhelming at times when studying for them.",
    "Based on what I've heard from my friends in MBB Biochem, I'd definitely recommend the MCDB version. Either way, it'll be a tough class that you just have to grind through-- but having no final exam is such a blessing. I also feel like our material is more digestible, but that might just be my personal preference (unlike some of my classmates, I actually like Breaker's lecture style).",
    "Only if you have to take it. The benefits of this course are that there isn't final and that all four exams are non-cumulative.",
    "Yes! It was much less painful than other large STEM lectures I have taken, and the tests are written and graded fairly. Biochem is daunting because of the amount of material covered, but Professor Breaker does his best to emphasize what is important and interesting.",
    "Yes, if it's still Ronald Breaker teaching this class then definitely take this over mb&b biochem. The tests for this class was straightforward, and the professor stated that 50% of the class will receive either an A or A-, which is great if you are premed.",
    "This is a difficult course so I would only recommend this to those who are pursing a major in STEM or are on the pre-med track. It's a hefty time commitment.",
    "It's a lot of work so probably not",
    "No - take MBB. We move way too fast here.",
    "Students probably take the course to satisfy a requirement. I would not recommend this course to another student. The only grades are the four midterms, which means you really have to study for them. While not too difficult, I thought grading was harsh at times. Even if most of a question was correct, if one part was incorrect a zero was given. Also many times there was no reasoning as to why only partial credit was given. Class is early on MWF and many mornings you wake up and not want to go.",
    "Yes I think that I learned a lot in this course. Professor Breaker is great and Im glad that he is now in charge of the full course. the material is interesting but also challenging. I would say take this class knowing that at the times of the midterms you will have to put in a lot of effort to memorize and learn the material",
    "probably required for you. I took this as opposed to the MBB one because I find it easier to relate to and understand concepts if they are presented in a more applied\/biological way, as opposed to a more theoretical\/chemical way.",
    "if you have to, choose this over mb&b because you can get biochem over with in one semester. also, there is no work for this class (no psets, etc.) except for four midterms, which make up your entire grade. that means the only time there is a high workload is when midterms come around. i highly recommend studying at least a week in advance because there is a lot of material. also, make sure you take good notes in class and pay attention to what Professor Breaker emphasizes as key takeaways.",
    "Breaker was amazing. englemam not so much.",
    "No, of course not. People take this course because they need to and if that's the case then so be it. It won't be fun but you'll get through it. Everyone dies together in this class at least.",
    "No, I would probably recommend the year long course if you are actually interested in learning biochem.",
    "Yes! I loved it!",
    "If you are willing to study hard and really think about the material being presented go you, I definitely recommend taking it. It is my favorite science class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course only to a student in which the class is required. For pre med people I would definitely take this class over MB&B.",
    "I would. Overall, it's a well-run course; Professor Breaker is good. I really liked the format of the course (four midterms, no final) and the style in which the midterms were written (less emphasis on memorization, more emphasis on thinking).",
    "Only if biochemistry is necessary than take this one. The curve is better, the grading is better, and the structure is better. The professor is much worse but its a small price to pay.",
    "Good way to fill the biochem requirement especially if prepping for the mcat",
    "I would recommend this course to another because the professor is very good.",
    "Yes. It makes you learn a lot about biochemistry and I feel the information actually stuck with me more by having 4 tests throughout the semester since there was no cramming involved in my studying.",
    "Overall I would because the material is very interesting and I think generally the course material is well organized. However, I would warn future students of this class to work hard consistently so that to avoid the impossible task of retaining 4 weeks of material in the 2 nights before the exam.",
    "I would only recommend it to students who need it as a prerequisite or have a particular interest in biochemistry.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested in a broad introduction to biochemistry or if they need the course for their major or another requirement.",
    "If you need this course for a requirement, take it. Otherwise, dont.",
    "The challenge of the class for the professors is to convey a ton of content to a very large group of people - thus, the large lecture format and the four test grading scheme. Prof Breaker is enthusiastic about the content and about explaining things effectively, though Engelman seemed less interested in teaching. Grading felt somewhat arbitrary at times, and test questions sometimes seemed to want very specific answers (a function of the TAs who were grading it).",
    "yes. It is good for pre-med tracks and MCDB majors",
    "I would recommend this course in the place of the year long biochemistry course.",
    "If you have the option between the MB&B version and the MCDB version, I recommend MCDB",
    "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this course.",
    "If you're interested in learning how things actually happen in your body, take it. It's interesting. Most people in the class are there because they have to be there.",
    "As a student majoring in MCDB (or just pre-med), you probably have to take some biochemistry class. Although I don't really have a lot of insight on the MB&B class, this biochem class wasn't the worst. MB&B is a lot slower in terms of content, but the class does include homework and an exam during finals period. Since your grade comes from the 4 exams, that's where most of your time spent on this course will be focuses on. There is a LOT of information that is covered on the exams, but they mostly focus on more general concepts rather than minute details of the mechanisms. If you took molecular biology (MCDB 200) before, it helps A LOT with the first part of the class as well as studying for the exams. Go to Breaker's lectures because his explanations can help for the most part, but Engelman's slides are basically just a reiteration of the slides (he teaches only 4 lectures; honestly just get through them).",
    "5.5\/10 would recommend. Once again, it really depends on how much you engage with the class, but I often found the inconsistency in the level of detail we went through in class and the things we were supposed to know for evaluations frustrating. Especially towards the end, it felt like we were just going through metabolic pathways just to say we now knew how to synthesize all the amino acids without actually learning anything from the process.",
    "I only recommend to people interested in science. Professor Breaker was incredible !",
    "No. I would only recommend this to those that require the class."
