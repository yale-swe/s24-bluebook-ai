    "Great material, great professors, Madame Burton is especially amazing. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course! Kathleen Burton is a star! I also, honestly, feel like I have learned so much this semester and it has made me fall in love with French. Take it!",
    "again, try to get burton if you take this class.",
    "Definitely would recommend, a smooth continuation on French 130.",
    "Great class, liked the readings (although some were depressing)..especially Sac de billes, in the last unit. Definitely take it! Very structured.",
    "Daily grind, but it works.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class whether it is needed for a language requirement or just to improve your french. You will read many short stories and two novels. I found most of the short stories interesting and both of the novels were very enjoyable. The class atmosphere was my favorite out of all of my Yale courses. I enjoyed our discussions about each story or book."
