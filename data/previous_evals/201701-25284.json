   "comments": [
    "I learned an anthropological and evolutionary biological approach to human culture. I specifically learned a form of cultural evolution as put forth by Prof. Tomlinson in his latest book, derived from one of his past books and works. The course strengthened knowledge I already have.",
    "Examining the origin of modern humans through the lens of biological and cultural evolutionary theories.",
    "This course helped me understand the way in which firm scientific reasoning and a mindset of investigation can assist the humanities in answering (or asking) questions about how humans relate to one another and the world around them. This course also helped me blend scientific and more popular writing styles into an essay that stays true to the science but that makes assertions that may be understood by all.",
    "I learned how to read and critically assess evolutionary history\/ theoretical scientific papers.",
    "I learned to engage with scientific texts about issues relating to evolution, and how to synthesize writings across a wide variety of fields.",
    "I have a really incredible grasp of the new research and thinking of Evolution as it relates to humans in particular. Completely changed my outlook on the subject, and it seems to crop up often in my everyday readings for class and pleasure.",
    "An expanded understanding of the state of current evolutionary theory, an appreciation for semiotics \/ linguistic theory",
    "scientific evaluation of historical or philosophical notions"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Tomlinson advances a very specific, but accurate, view of human evolution. While we did discuss other viewpoints, most of the course was geared towards proving his hypothesis he had begun the course with. This means that often our discussion section would turn into a lecture if he thought we were off track from his argument. This course could be improved by turning the class into a lecture with a discussion section. It's very clear to me that there's no need for discussion and for the most part the class simply needs to learn the facts.",
    "This course's greatest strength was its broad scope that narrowed slowly over the course of the semester. The pacing was tremendous! Every week felt like something new. This course's greatest weakness was also its scope, albeit for a different reason. It was difficult, sometimes, to understand the hard science to any level of usability. A bit narrower scope with the hard science may have made it easier.",
    "Strengths - enormous diversity of reading material, brilliant instructor, plenty of opportunities to ask questions and engage with readings during seminar, very reasonable workload, essays were very focused (unusal for an HSHM class) enabling me to engage deeply with the subject matter I loved that the class was structured around various chapters of Professor Tomlinson's book Culture and Human Evolution. I also liked that we began the semester with Darwin's On the Origins of Species (the heart of evolutionary theory) to establish a meaningful baseline. Weaknesses - some of the readings were very difficult (especially Deacon's Beyond the Symbolic Species), 3-4 people dominated the seminar discussion each week Areas of improvement - perhaps more group activities where we can talk with classmates about the readings and fill in any gaps (e.g. dividing the class in to groups to summarize each reading at the beginning of each seminar)",
    "The readings are pretty interesting and the professor is really engagingthat being said, it isn't much of a seminar in how it was structured. Professor mostly talked at us, and then students would address more-or-less low level comments directly to the professor.",
    "various approaches to one central theme sometimes too difficult for non-major students and could have more explanations and lectures rather than an all-discussion style"

   "comments": [
    "This course is going to be different for everyone who is interested in the material. If you're taking the class for a science credit, be prepared for some novel science concepts. If you already have a science background, the course can seem slow at times.",
    "Yes definitely. This class gives you the interdisciplinary perspective in thinking about the question of human origin. Great for those coming from humanities, social sciences and science background.",
    "Yes! Take this course if you're looking for a SC credit OR if you're interested in how the humanities and hard sciences can be combined. The readings are rigorous, Prof. Tomlinson is brilliant, and the syllabus speaks for itself!",
    "A truly fantastic seminar. As a second-semester senior, I can confidently say that this class is a \"Yale gem\" in its interdisciplinary scope and brilliant instructor. The readings covered a broad scope, from Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" to linguistic papers, to scientific and theoretical works. Some of the readings were a bit dense, but Professor Tomlinson did a fantastic job of clarifying any questions. Professor Tomlinson is a true renaissance man! He is so knowledgable about so many different subjects. Our syllabus was structured around his novel Culture and the Course of Human Evolution. My favorite part of seminar was listening to Professor Tomlinson talk on (and on) about his insights into this field. The work load is a bit lighter than the typical HSHM seminar. We were assigned 3 papers throughout the semester (one 4-5 pages and two 7-8 pages) with a specific prompt. Otherwise, weekly readings (around 100 pages) but it was very easy to get away with only skimming through some parts. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone even broadly interested in the intersection of science and the humanities.",
    "Yes, interesting subject material and Professor Tomlinson is great.",
    "Take it!",
    "Very interesting class for any major, but might be better if you take it after finishing several intro courses of anthropology, philosophy, biology, and archeology."
