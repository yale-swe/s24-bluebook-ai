    "This class is going to completely depend on who is teaching it, so I can't be much help. Sorry!",
    "Really interesting material, and finding conformal maps is fun enough to become a hobby. If you take it with Kapranov, don't expect to be challenged -- the tests and homework are very easy. However, Kapranov is brilliant, and I found that I got the most out of this class by doing the problems in the (optional) textbook and talking with him about them. That said, I always find office hours to be the most productive part of any class.",
    "Graduate Complex Analysis. Although you cover legit things in lecture, in terms of homework and exams, this course is very little work and very easy. But you will get things out of this course if you go to lecture!",
    "It is a good continuation of 310. With Prof. Kapranov we repeated some of the more difficult ideas covered in 310 in a clearer way and also learned new things such as Riemann's Open Mapping Theorem and a little about Elliptic Functions. The lectures are hard and challenging, but with Prof. Kapranov the homework and the exams are both extremely easy.",
    "I would definitely recommend MATH315 to another student. The workload is low and manageable and the lectures are well taught and engaging. However, there isn't much opportunity to apply the material because homework is so infrequent. Overall, this is a low-stress way to learn intermediate complex analysis topics.",
    "Yes. Fascinating continuation of the 310, covers the \"highlights\" of Complex Analysis (conformal mappings, Riemann-Zeta function, elliptic functions, etc.) Satisfies the graduate-level course requirement for the Intensive math major."
