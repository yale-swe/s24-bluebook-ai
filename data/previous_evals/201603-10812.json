   "comments": [
    "This class was a perfect complement to both Bioethics and Law, and Issues in Bioethics. We covered, more in depth, the topics of assisted reproduction, physician assisted suicide, vaccination, and health care, among others.",
    "A lot of great background\/contextual information about key bioethics issues, and how they played out in US history\/politics.",
    "This class provides the skill of making a multifaceted bioethical argument. For each topic covered in the course, we analyzed it from a political, economic and ethical perspective. The papers for the class developed the same skills.",
    "The course is great for getting students to think about key concepts in bioethics. Before taking the class, bioethics was a broad subject that recalled associations with hackneyed debates over abortion or stem cell usage, but the course, while addressing the basic arguments that one would find most common, delves deeper into examining some of the theoretical frameworks and the more distinctive, \"mind-stretching\" threads of reasoning and justification. Some topics, like surrogacy arrangement contracts and the exploitative implications that they may entail or the right to genetically alter children to carry certain disabilities, were particularly new and refreshing, and personal guidance on the final paper allowed for in-depth examination of topics interesting to students individually. Greater depth in understanding the current economic and political regimes for various controversial issues was greatly appreciated."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- Prof Latham was a great, easy-going lecturer\/seminar leader. We read some really interesting books\/articles too. Weaknesses -- The other students in the seminar weren't engaged, which really detracted from the quality of the discussions.",
    "Excellent course, excellent readings, excellent teaching!",
    "Overall this was a a great course. I feel I learned a lot and Professor Latham is wonderful and brilliant beyond words. I would have liked a little more structure to the course. Perhaps reading responses or something to keep everyone accountable for reading the books. Also, there was no real schedule for reading the books, so it was difficult to know which material was meant to be read for each class. Also, I wish Professor Latham had provided more detailed feedback on our assignemnts.",
    "One of the big strengths of the course is the diversity of the topics addressed. It allowed for a lot of flexibility in discussion, and the books that accompanied each section were all excellent picks that shed a lot more light on the nuances in the topics. The obvious potential weakness that comes along with the way the course moves through a different topic every 1-2 weeks is that there's no chance to really dive into the detailed regulatory and policy perspective of certain issues, but this isn't as big of an issue because I feel like the hard policy questions may fall a bit outside the goals of the course's design."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another political science major at Yale. The subject matter is interesting and professor Latham does a thorough job with each topic, leaving us with a great understanding and some probing questions.",
    "Yes if you can be sure that the other seminar participants are legit\/will do their readings.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Absolutely -- this has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. If you've taken any of Latham's other bioethics classes and enjoyed them, then this is a must take. Really interesting readings and always great discussions.",
    "Take this class. Latham is so knowledgeable about bioethics and health care in general. He is particularly great as a thesis advisor so take notes incoming seniors. If you are writing a thesis as PSCI or EP&E major, this is the man to do it with it. He rocks.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student. It was a privilege to learn from Professor Latham who is a genius. My only hesitation is the lack of structure. But you will learn a great deal regardless.",
    "Yes, would recommend. Take it for the chance to think about a lot of interesting issues in bioethics, and to learn unexpected dimensions of those issues that popular media doesn't get into. Also, Prof. Latham is a wonderful speaker with a good sense of how to portray the intuitive frameworks behind concepts that get to the core of the ethical questions within issues. Just getting to listen to his evaluation and summaries of ideas is very useful."
