    "It's great that we get the opportunity to take voice lessons for full academic credit here. Don't miss out on this opportunity! You have one lesson per week (about an hour) and you sing a few pieces for a \"jury\" at the end of the semester. It's mostly classical, so if you're not a classical singer, it'll force you to become familiar with a part of your voice that you didn't know existed (which was a very cool thing for me.) Take it!",
    "If you are a singer in any way on Yale's campus, definitely take this class. It is fun, and does not take up a lot of time. Plus, you learn a lot :)",
    "voice lessons. Yes. Every singer should take it.",
    "Take voice lessons at Yale!! It's a relatively easy credit but you'll make substantial progress in your vocal technique and will be very proud of how quickly you'll grow as a musician and vocalist. Also, if you get David Leigh as a teacher, you're tremendously lucky-- he's a brilliant guy and a wonderful person to work with."
