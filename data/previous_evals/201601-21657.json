   "comments": [
    "This is a great overview of literature spanning many different time periods and almost all the pieces are amazing. It is quite a lot of reading (about a novel a week) but many of them are so good that it doesn't feel horrendous. Otherwise, the workload is definitely manageable and Prof. Dimock is amazing. Take it!",
    "This class is very interesting if you can manage the heavy reading load--12 novels in 13 weeks. Only two papers to get a WR credit seems like a gift, and overall the class is very laid back. As an Applied Math Major, this course offered a nice change of pace.",
    "Literary Cities is like a lot of other freshman seminars, I would say, but it is distinguished by the nature of the syllabus and the style of Professor Dimock. The class is a great way to improve one's skills of literary analysis and meet other interested and interesting freshmen. The workload, while generally time-intensive, is not prohibitory or unenjoyable. I would strongly recommend it to any other students with a general interest in American literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's not as much about the cities as I thought it would be. Rather it uses cities as a central theme to tie the syllabus together, but it is an amazing class. If you have good people in the seminar, discussion is always exciting. Don't miss the opportunity to have Professor Dimock in a seminar setting.",
    "Literary Cities is about the quality of your own reading. If you think the syllabus looks interesting and are willing to invest the time (it's quite a bit of reading, a book a week), I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "I absolutely would. Not a particularly difficult class, although some weeks the reading was very heavy and hard to finish. Also incredibly fun and interesting.",
    "A great course filled with reading and interesting discussion.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. The class has a great reading list that I think students will benefit from reading.",
    "Definitely a lot of reading - usually a book a week - it pays to get ahead early in the week, or even in the semester. The writing workload is fairly light - two papers - and seminar discussions are a lot of fun. Professor Dimock knows her stuff but keeps students at the center of the discussion, putting a lot of value on student ideas. The syllabus has a diverse range of styles, authors, and viewpoints, especially later in the semester, so you'll be exposed to an interesting range of texts. Definitely worth taking if you have time for the reading."
