   "comments": [
    "After taking this course, I feel better equipped to get through unfamiliar texts and gain a sense of understanding of them through repeated readings and analysis.",
    "Thinking critically, managing reading and how much thinking goes into a full workload.",
    "Before taking this class, I thought I knew how to write papers. And now, I'm still not sure if I get it. I've always been told that when you write a paper, you should develop a thesis and support it with your own thoughts and with selections from the assigned texts. I I learned that humanities classes require a different kind of \"support\" in their papers. It isn't enough to just support your thesis. You have to talk around a lot and almost have mini-arguments with yourself in order to address all possible sides of the argument. I also learned how to really get into close reading of a text for a humanities class. Before this class, I'll admit that I sometimes would only read a piece once and then come to class thinking I was ready to discuss it, but for a seminar of this caliber, you have to read and reread and look past the surface of the text.",
    "I learned to read texts objectively and analyze texts without necessarily bringing in background biases\/knowledge. I learned to tie texts together and find similarities and differences.",
    "This course made me think a lot about the relationship between the human and the divine, and about what makes something scriptural. I still don't have any conclusive answers (well maybe some), but it really made me think about different perspectives on how we can interpret messages in the Bible and elsewhere. What was really cool was that there seemed to be an overarching narrative built by the different texts we read. Starting from a Kafka excerpt and ending with a chapter from the Talmud, it was fascinating to see how everything connected beautifully.",
    "I really learned how to communicate abstract concepts in a practical manner. This definitely made my writing better and improved my essay writing process.",
    "I learned to more fully develop my thoughts into abstract and arguable ideas.",
    "I learned how to look at Scripture without putting it into historical context. I learned how to read, and draw from, the words in front of me without any other forms of engagement."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course had a strong selection of texts with common themes that made for an interesting evolving perspective on questions that humans throughout the ages have asked. The workload was fair, but I could've used some more guidance in terms of expectations for papers. Some seemed to benefit from the small and open class discussions on our texts and the themes, though I did not like the lack of at least some structured discussion.",
    "Strengths- it really stretches your mind in sometimes painful but incredibly broadening ways Weaknesses- it can feel overwhelming and like a lot, but once you get into he swing of things it works out.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it really emphasizes the importance of close reading, and it is a good introduction to writing humanities papers. The only weakness I can think of can't really be fixed, it's just what happens when freshmen from different kinds of backgrounds come together in one class. Some students have a greater knowledge of scriptural texts and might be able to discuss them at a deeper level, so others have the responsibility to educate themselves and \"catch up.\"",
    "A strength of this course was that it was mainly student discussion based, and the professor only aided the discussions.",
    "This course, being a seminar, replies upon your engagement in the class. Doing the reading was a must, though you could not do the readings sometimes and still be able to make a comment off of what others were saying. You are required to speak every class. It had a good structure, and there really were no weaknesses.",
    "The course is great for exploring lots of ideas concerning human truths. If this is an interest, it is a great option. However, the discussions can get a little too broad. They can be hard to relate to each other and the texts. It is definitely up to the student to consolidate all the ideas discussed into a thesis useful to themselves.",
    "The class discussions are very engaging and you form either a very good bond with your seminar family or a very dysfunctional one because of the passion that some people have for a topic such as Scriptures. The course is very reading-heavy, but it is not overwhelming."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would advise a student who is interested in individual textual studies to take this class. I was hoping to glean more in terms of the philosophical basis of the various religious and secular traditions we examined, as we focused explicitly on the texts. If you are looking for a class on religions, perhaps look elsewhere, though this could be a good start for developing the skills necessary to analyze sometimes dense texts.",
    "It's a wonderful opportunity to discover and read some amazing authors. It also challenges you to look at the works in a new, unencumbered light, allowing you to find new meaning and shake old assumptions.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student because the texts we read are a wonderful mix fo secular and scripture. Encouraged a close reading of texts. Challenged me to compare philosophies. Broad essay prompts that required thinking. Well paced.",
    "Take this course if you're really good at discussing abstract concepts and throwing around seemingly out-of-the-blue ideas from scriptures that the average person may have never picked up on. If this doesn't come naturally, keeping up with discussion will be a challenge for you, and you really have to pay attention to follow some concepts that may sail right over your head. If you're a more concrete, facts-based person who is used to writing papers with a solid thesis and supporting it with the texts, getting good grades on papers will also be a challenge. There's a certain \"other\" quality you have to have to be good at writing humanities papers, and if your brain is more hardwired for science and facts, it'll be hard to find that quality. Not to say that it's impossible, but doing well in this class will just come more naturally to some people than others.",
    "Yes. It taught me how to argue a thesis and how to make up a thesis.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are philosophically minded. It's not a class that gives you any hard answers by any means, but instead is oriented to making you think about the issues presented. If you aren't the type who likes to grapple with metaphysical or philosophical questions, this might not be the class for you. But if you are, I'd highly recommend it.",
    "If it is not for your major, I would still recommend this class because the professor expands your mind to things you would never have thought about without this class."
