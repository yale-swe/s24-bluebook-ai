    "I would summarize it as an introduction to the major issues, discourses, and methodologies in current ethnomusicology as well as a brief history of the development of the field. I would recommend it to other students, with the disclaimer that the work load can be all over the place.",
    "I would recommend it to fellow students who are open to the topic at hand. It is a difficult class to go into if you are not willing to connect with the material and the scope of the field.",

   "comments": [
    "Having taken this as a first year, I'm still trying to figure out a lot about the kind of work I want to do, but this course was extremely helpful in moving in the right direction. I am much more aware of the kind of work that ethnomusicologists do, the issues that appear in current ethnomusicological research, and how it relates to the outside world. The most positive aspect of this course is its ability to get you to think deeply about the implications of music research. I consider myself a much more thoughtful scholar-in-training as a result. As previously noted, the only negative was the lack of organization.",
    "The interdisciplinary focus of ethnomusicology is very important to my own studies as I wish to focus on marrying two separate subject areas for my own research. Studying the history of the field and how the field currently functions has allowed me to think through some issues for my own research."
