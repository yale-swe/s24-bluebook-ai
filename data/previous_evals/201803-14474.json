    "This course has NO weaknesses. Don't think. Just Take it. Professor Robinson does a marvellous job of giving you feedback and genuinely wants to help you improve your writing.",
    "A major strength was the feedback I received on each of my drafts. I do wish that we were able to submit the full first draft of the final essay and obtain feedback on that as many of the other sections did. Besides that, there were not necessarily any other weaknesses from what I could tell.",
    "This course is very well taught and executed. The flow of the material and the assignments was very fluid and manageable.",
    "The discussion based seminar was engaging and the class provided a lot of opportunities to get feedback. It might be better if the whole class participated in discussions rather than just a few students.",
    "Some essays had vague guidelines. It might be by design but really tripped me up in the beginning."

    "YES. It is an amazing, thought-provoking, entertaining, and extremely rewarding course. Do take it if you can get the chance. You'll learn so much much about writing, and about finding and polishing your own voice",
    "I would. Censorship and the Arts is a hidden gem among all of the thirty-something 114 sections. In general, Robinson was relatively understanding and flexible in terms of deadlines, and listened to student feedback fairly well. Overall, he was great prof who designed a great course, and I definitely recommend his section.",
    "Yes, great class.",
    "Yes TR is an amazing professor, workload is light and you learn a lot",
    "Yes, of course. If you can take 114 with Professor Robinson, do it. He's an amazing professor, so kindhearted and in love with what he does. It's not a terrible writing credit by any stretch of the imagination.",
    "Yes, it is a good course if ou want to become more confident in writing.",
    "Yes. The professor was incredibly funny and knowledgeable. You'll have a good time."
