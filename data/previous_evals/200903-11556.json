   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There is an equal proportion of vocabular to grammar, which means by the end of L1, you already have the ability to speak basic conversations.",
    "Gives students a great foundation in writing, reading, and speaking. Definitely would recommend - really no complaints!",
    "great way to take a language in a small setting. After having taken Spanish at yale, I really appreciate this. there is a big difference between having 16 students and only having 5 students in a class.",
    "Modern Greek 110 is a great introduction to the Greek language. It's pretty easy, especially if you have even the slightest Greek background beforehand. Maria is fantastic, funny, entertaining, and very understanding and lenient. The quizzes are really easy, too. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning Greek."
