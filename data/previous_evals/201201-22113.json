    "Great experience. I really appreciated the opportunity to devise my own project tailored specifically to my interests.",
    "Independent work. You have to want to do it and keep yourself on task.",
    "yes, if you have an idea of what you want to do. it is a really good course that gives you freedom to really explore ideas that you could not in class. it gives you the chance to work on a lot of \"miscellaneous\" ideas you had. teaches you time management and also how to really set goals and deadlines for yourself.",
    "Our semester was unique in that we had a group of six people interested in continuing painting, but a painting class wasn't offered at our level that semester. It was a good experience- basically a more independent painting class that meets once a week. We had a couple critiques throughout the semester, and each presented on artists we were looking at. If you're looking at this you should have an idea of what you want to accomplish over the semester and set goals for yourself.",
    "Depends on the teacher, and obviously you need to be self motivated",
    "I would recommend this to someone who knows at least more than generally what they want to investigate, can find a good adviser, and feels confident they can keep themselves motivated and producing (good) work without the pressure\/driving force of the typical classroom setting. I feel like the motivation is the hardest part of the independent course, but if that is overcome, the course can be as great as you can imagine it to be."
