   "comments": [
    "It aligned very well.",
    "Significantly exceeded all expectations-and those expectations were high.",
    "They above and beyond met my expectations. This was one of the best classes I took at FES and I feel so fortunate to have taken it. Loved it!",
    "This class was beyond my expectations. There is no assumption of prior knowledge, and you learn a ton!",
    "My expectations were quite high coming into this class, but they were exceeded. This class is one of the best ones I have taken at FES so far.",
    "Well",
    "Above and beyond my expectations!",
    "Well",
    "My expectations for this course were met. It expanded on previous knowledge from other classes and also opened up new topics to continue exploring.",
    "The course was very thorough in explaining these techniques.",
    "Strongly aligned with what I expected--the course lectures and the field trips were as outlined in the syllabus.",
    "I thought the course was too broad in scope. I wish the course focused solely on New England, solely on natural regeneration methods and solely on the values that forest managers must manage for- and how best to do so! (water, wildlife, timber, recreation, carbon). Because the course was global in perspective and because the course attempted to cover so much- all of ecology (soils to meteorology!), natural regen, nurseries, values, agroforestry, etc, (here and everywhere) I came away with generalizations that felt a bit hollow.",
    "Very well. An excellent class.",
    "Very well",
    "They aligned very well with my expectations.",
    "It fell far short of my expectations. I expected to learn the ins and outs of silvicultural techniques, but there was way too much material jam-packed into the semester to go too deep into anything. I understand why the course is taught this way and I do think that it makes the course accessible to more people, but I expected advanced, high-level, focused information about silvicultural techniques, as opposed to broad, introductory topics.",
    "Low",
    "Very well. I had high expectations from this class, and it exceeded them! Worth every hour put into it!",

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the best parts of the course were when we were doing hands-on group work in the woods. I think the field trips could overall be much more focused on hands-on group work vs. lecture and standing.",
    "Only strengths: engaged students, present company included, in a myriad of topics that involve forest management. The field trips were great and provided field examples of many of the concepts discussed in class.",
    "Strengths are that so much excellent material is covered. Most classes were fascinating, the field trips were wonderful and it was very comprehensive. I have no suggestions for how the course could be improved. Mark has it nailed down to a tee.",
    "There is a lot of class time...so much. I think it could be condensed, and some field trips could be half day as opposed to full day trips.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Ashton is amazing, and he has this course down to a total science. Big thanks to him for teaching this course year after year, we benefit immensely from him.",
    "The field trips are very hands-on. The lectures slides should have more notes [just the key points] instead of just pictures. This could help for review and especially if you haven't followed the explanations well :)",
    "All strengths! I only wish we had a more specialized\/advancef silviculture class for MF students only.",
    "Strengths: course content, field trips, lecture content Weaknesses: class usually runs late, Mark can get lost down rabbit holes which makes for interesting but long lectures",
    "I appreciated the amount of field time in this class; it's definitely necessary for the material. Sometimes I would have liked more of the field time to be spent on just walking around and talking about what we see in the forest, versus on exercises. I recognize that the exercises are good for reinforcing the concepts, however.",
    "I wished that the course was more interactive. For example, during the pruning field trip, it would have been been great to practically learn how to prune trees.",
    "The field trips supported the lectures and provided an experiential learning opportunity to go with the classroom sessions.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Ashton really cares about his students. Strong sense of silviculture community. Some really enjoyable field trips. Good textbook. Weaknesses: Vague scope\/broad\/basic. Lecture could use more student discussion\/engagement. Some field trips seemed like we were driving a long way to accomplish something that could have been demonstrated right outside of Marsh. Would love fewer lectures, more field time.",
    "Workload is definitely not to be underestimated, but there are several modes of teaching employed that infuses much-appreciated flexibility in learning. Field trips helped me to appreciate and consolidate the concepts learnt in class; to visualise them in real-world scenarios.",
    "Huge volume of material that's hard to entirely cover over the course of the semester. All good and important, just a lot.",
    "A strength of this course was the exams. Which I have never said before but I thought they were fun, challenging, relevant to my interests, and pretty accurately tested the breadth of my knowledge on the topic. I also thought field trips were particularly informative and engaging.",
    "The instructor teaches all of the information very well. It could be improved by cutting out half of the material and really diving into the other half. The field time was great, I know this is impossible but I'm going to say it anyway - more field time would be hugely beneficial.",
    "I learned more from the reading than from the class and field trips.",
    "Turn this into a 6-credit course called silviculture and forest ecosystem management (similar to management plans really) with the incorporation of growth and yield modules. All the material in this is so wonderful I wish I could devote more time to it!",
    "Its strengths are course structure and wholeness of contents. Students have many ways of learning the material being covered and that is very much useful and appreciated. There is much to be improved however in the timing among slides during lectures and on many of the slides themselves (see 11 below), which should be re-photographed and redrawn. Also, field exercises could be better organized so that they are fair to all students and that everyone actually does something in the end. It's somehow too relaxed and that is good and bad at the same time. Also, the field trips could be scheduled differently along the semester, as I felt they were too crammed up at the latter part and that was a bit counter-productive (I even missed one!). Also, silviculture breakfast seems counterproductive and lends itself to a clique-mentality. I would really review this unofficial component of the course. Not all traditions should be blindly followed.",
    "I loved the field trips and sensing Dr. Ashton's passion for what he was teaching. I also like how he made learning about silviculture very applicable to learning about the environment (including agriculture) more broadly. I think I flipped lecture style might be more appropriate and give greater time to being in the field or for more Q&A in class.",
    "Strengths are the field trips, class community (silviculture breakfasts!), the civility of having free tee and coffee offered in a morning class, the great lecturing from Dr. Ashton. Weaknesses are that it's just a ton of content and time.",
    "Guidance\/explanation of the thought process for writing a silvicultural prescription",
    "The course content is great and lectures are fairly engaging, but the highlights for sure were the field trips. The course could be improved by having somewhat more organized lectures without feeling like the content is being rushed at the end of class."

   "comments": [
    "Watch videos (x2) before the course to get an idea of what Dr. Ashton will go over.",
    "You must take this class.",
    "I would advise a student to take it if they are considering it. Some would urge it's best your first year, but even my second year it was still great.",
    "Take it! If you are not an early riser, you may have trouble getting to class, bu you can always watch the video lectures online. Don't get behind, though, as there's a lot of information to cover.",
    "Enjoy! It is great. Go to every lecture.",
    "Don't take more than 12 credits or more than 4 classes for the semester.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Take it even if you're not a forestry student! It's fascinating",
    "I've heard Silviculture described as the one class a non-MF(S) should take if they want to do something forest-related while at FES. I would echo that statement.",
    "It is a fundamental course for the Forestry program.",
    "Great background course in natural science themes and forestry for environmental managers.",
    "The field trips mainly consist of standing around watching Mark talk. Would recommend doing the first and last field trips, the Yale Meyers one, then the tree nursery for sure. As for the class lectures, many of us were grateful for the online recorded versions because Mark talks in circles quite a bit. Fun, but not efficient or consistently clear.",
    "An excellent class! A great course for non-forestry students who want an digestible initiation into the field, since the course touches on several topics that are taught more in-depth at the school (e.g. Forest Health, Forest Operations, Stand Dynamics, etc.). Individual workload can be heavy in terms of weekly lectures, readings and field-trips, but there are very few assessments which makes it manageable overall. Professor and teaching assistants were always positive and super helpful with explaining initially-heavy concepts, and the lectures and field trips are fun!",
    "Learn to identify main points and not get carried away by extra info.",
    "Be present for every field trip and study how all the concepts apply to silvicultural prescriptions.",
    "If you've never taken a forestry course before, take this one. You'll hear about all kinds of awesome, incredible things and learn a lot. If you have, don't expect to cover any advanced material, but still definitely take the class. You'll learn a lot and have a great time!",
    "YES! this course is a must-do for any FESer interested in land and natural resource management.",
    "Definitely take it. An FES classic, not to be missed.",
    "This course is a must and highly recommended, be it for foresters or for MEMs. Do not be discouraged by the time commitment, it is entirely doable.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Be mindful that every one of your Fridays in April will have a fieldtrip on it.",
    "Read the textbook! It's a pleasant read and will clarify the material from class. Also, I'd recommend considering this class a heavy load when planning out your semester due to the field trips",
    "If you don't have a background in forest science and don't plan to work in the field, consider auditing the course! You'll be able to have access to all the course materials without the added stress of keeping up with all the course requirements."
