   "comments": [
    "Great class. Would recommend.",
    "This is a great class for a getting a surface level understanding of some of the important issues in healthcare. The workload is very reasonable (don't have to do readings), only have to prepare a 2 page policy brief, a midterm and a standard seminar paper to close.The class environment is very relaxed, you become friends with everyone including Howie. Definitely a joy to attend class. Even for someone with no inherent interest in healthcare econ, the material was interesting. The only caveat is that sometimes it was hard without any background in the field to keep up with discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend it. It was definitely my favorite class this semester. The reading is a little dry at times, but you don't actually have to do it, although you get more out of class if you do. A lot of the times, the optional readings are better than the required one.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT!It is a great course taught by an expert on the topic. He treats you like \"family\" and is always available even during his busy schedule (he is a practicing radiologist, is head of the MD\/MBA program at the med school, and teaches two courses!).",
    "Great class. Not only do you learn A LOT, you also get to know the people.If you are AT ALL interested in learning about the economics of healthcare delivery, information technology, malpractice insurance, the pharmaceutical industry, etc., this is the class for you. It sounds like a lot, but it really doesn't feel like it. The workload is easily manageable. There is reading every week, but very little (and it's always interesting and pertinent). Other than the final paper, there are just two short reading responses on a reading of your choice (barely a page) and a quiz (go to class, and you'll do well [also, Howie is a very forgiving grader because he considers the class \"family\" by the end :-D]).The final paper seems like a lot (10-15 pages), but you have a huge amount of freedom in choosing your topic. It honestly can be on anything that deals with the economics of something health-related so, pick a topic you enjoy, and it doesn't feel like work at all.The only downside of the class was that we would occasionally only get through half the scheduled information during a given class because we would go off on so many tangents. The tangents were usually worth it though.",
    "Great class -- good introduction to some of the seminal issues in Healthcare Economics. Wide latitude in pursuing topics you like for your presentation and final paper. Only disadvantage to the class is that there's a TA who pretty much takes note of everytime you speak -- class participation is pretty important, so if you're unable to constantly be on your toes and volunteer to speak, this might not be the best class.",
    "Not only is this class great, it also counts as an econ seminar with a sparing amount of dull graphs and models.",
    "Take the class. If you're an EPE major, take it. You're lucky. This is why you applied to EPE, to get into classes like this. If you're not EPE, beg to get in. Talk about some connection to someone you have and hopefully your sob story will work on him. Get close with the TA and hope he'll have mercy on you if you go long on your presentation.",
    "Great course - Howie is great. There's a fair amount of time spent on student presentations and things like that, but it's fun most of the time and Howie's really smart\/knowledgeable. Doesn't cover an incredible amount of material, but you get a decent understanding of health econ. You won't be able to get into it unless you're a junior or senior Econ or EP&E major, but he offers a lecture course that covers the same material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any econ major! Regardless of if you are pre-med or not, this class will affect the way you think about health care.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone with any interest in our healthcare system will gain a lot from this course.",
    "Definitely, it's a great class - you learn a lot about a very topical issue on a factual and theoretical level. Not work-intensive at all besides a final research paper\/presentation, though it tends to be a bigger seminar so you have to be kind of belligerent about getting your discussion points in. Howie is the man, super awesome guy.",
    "Econ 467 covers private and public health insurance, the pharmaceutical industry, and other major topics in healthcare. Every student has to do a policy brief, which is just a 2-page essay summarizing the topic along with a chance to express your perspective. Classes are mainly lectures, but everyone can participate and\/or ask questions. At the end, we have to write a 10-15 page paper and additionally do a presentation on the topic for the class. We can basically do any topic that we want, as long as it is in someway related to healthcare, so it is a great way to research a subject in which you are interested.",
    "Absolutely. Great for any econ or ep&e major",
    "great course - i came in wanting to learn more about the health care industry and definitely did; i think you can get a lot out of it no matter how much you know. take it if you want application of econ to life."
