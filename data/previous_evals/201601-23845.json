   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend Making of the Modern Middle East to another student. It is not the easiest history lecture you will ever take, but Professor Bsheer is great, the class is taught well and the readings are interesting and well-pitched. The exams are intense and really do require a thorough knowledge of the material, but if you go to all the lectures, do most of the readings, take good notes and study before the midterm and final, you will be fine. You will emerge not with a comprehensive understanding of the Middle East and its history, but a satisfying understanding that will allow you to understand current and future phenomena there and elsewhere. The course also focuses quite a lot on more theoretical sides to the region's history, such as nationalism, ethnic cleansing and orientalism, which is very interesting in both this and other contexts.",
    "Great survey course of the Middle East. 1 midterm 1 final and section. Learned a ton about middle eastern history and common misconceptions associates with it. Changed my own perspective a lot.",
    "I would highly recommend this class -- it's not a ton of work, and it provides beautifully framed insight on a region that you are definitely going to be hear about in stereotyped language from politicians and media. It's unlike 90% of the courses you'll find at Yale about the Middle East in that it is highly self-conscious and critical of Orientalizing discourse that will plague any policy class you take.",
    "Took as a credit\/d, and recommend that for anyone looking for the baseline of how the nation state system began in the middle east, how modernization has succeeded and failed, and the relationship of Islam to politics.",
    "Difficult, fast-paced but very provocative You get out of it what you put into it. The readings largely do not overlap with the material from lecture. However, it was often hard to keep up with them.",
    "A history of the Middle East focusing on the 20th century. The class was more about general themes than specific history. A lot of reading.",
    "This class will give you a good introduction to the history of the Middle East from the late Ottoman period to the present. Don't take the class if you already have a good understanding of the history, but if you're like me, and you didn't really know anything about the Ottoman Empire, Ataturk, Nasser, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, etc., this class will give you the background you need for further study. Definitely read the Gelvin - Professor Bsheer lectures directly from it. Overall very enjoyable, and a reasonable workload.",
    "A great course for understanding what we think about the Middle East and why much of that is wrong; it really sheds light on the modern Middle East and how it truly is modern, not some bastion of Oriental authoritarianism that can never be uprooted.",
    "despite being a survey class, this course was incredible. what an intelligent synthesis of information. i was not sure if i would be taking the class but i am so glad that i did. i feel on very firm ground with the subject matter moving forward. if youre at all interested, take this.",
    "I think this is a course every student at Yale should take. One should not write policy, or write about current events in the Middle East until they have taken a history course with Professor Bsheer.",
    "TAKE IT! Professor Bsheer is just incredible. If you want to understand why the Middle East is where it is today, then definitely take it. Absolutely incredible!",
    "A good survey course of modern middle eastern history. I would recommend this course to students that haven't had a chance to study the middle east in an academic context before, as it will give you a very solid background on the broad history and some important issues, although being a survey it doesn't go in to a ton of depth on everything.",
    "Take it! This is important material to know but learn a little bit about middle eastern history before hand because a lot of the class is biased.",
    "A solid survey course on Middle Eastern History.",
    "Recommend for everyone!! Even if youre not interested in the region, this course is great. It talks about an important and forgotten part of world history, and makes you question many things! Very very good, eye-opening course. I recommend everyone takes it.",
    "Yes. Excellent history course.",
    "Take this class. Work load is very manageable and topic is very very interesting. Some people may be annoyed that more time isn't spend on current events in the Middle East. However after taking this class I really appreciated all the background because it gives you a great sense as to where events such as the Arab Spring\/anti-colonial sentiment\/etc originate from and draw support from. Exams are hectic to get through as Prof Bsheer demands a lot however there are only two exams and section (no papers). Readings are interesting and Gelvin book is a great read and the basis for this class. It will be a class that you will have very much appreciated taking.",
    "If you're a non-history major, definitely worth taking Credit\/D.",
    "The Making of the Modern Middle East is an exceptional course. Studying the history of the Modern Middle East this semester with the brilliant Professor Bsheer has deepened my understanding of the Middle Eastor, rather, North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and West Asia, to use more accurate and less Eurocentric terms. The first half of the course covers eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Ottoman (and Safavid and Qajar) history, focusing on the advent of modernity and its challenges. The second half looks to the First World War, the twentieth-century formation of modern nation states, the origins of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (do not miss these lectures!!), and to the context of the twenty-first century Arab uprisings. Although the course is only introductory, Professor Bsheer insists that her students look critically at the past and understand the processes that have shaped the contemporary form of the region. She complicates the narrative of the Middle East as ruled by political Islam and authoritarians, dispelling Orientalist and contemporary tropes. This knowledge is valuable not only for students interested in history and politics but for anyone who wants to understand the modern world. Do not miss out on this class!",
    "A great class if you're interested in learning about what shaped the Middle East into what it was at the start of the \"Modern\" period. The readings (and professor) are great, and the insight this class gives are invaluable."
