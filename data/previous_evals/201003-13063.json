   "comments": [
    "talking about the ethics of the messy international questions we read about every day makes you realize how screwed up our world is. very cool, right.",
    "This class is a great way to apply theoretical concepts to the key issues in our world today. It was the most compelling and worthwhile course I have taken at Yale so far that dealt with international affairs or politics. It expands your thinking and really goes beyond the surface on issues that you will hear about every day in the newspaper.",
    "Excellent course that makes you think about internationally and ethically significant topics. Opens up your mind to further thought on the topic.",
    "Lots of readings. Good way to begin thinking within various ethical frameworks, but often the material is very difficult.",
    "Good course, but don't expect much in the way of intellectual diversity among the authors you read (they range from liberal to leftist).",
    "Evaluates the moral justification for the actions of individuals and states in international affairs. The material sometimes drags, but is ultimately very thought and discussion provoking. The lectures are not too engaging, but Pogge is an impressive moral specimen and gives a good, in depth treatment of these difficult questions (though, admittedly, he's pretty biased and really orients the class in one direction).",
    "This class was based a lot about morality and ethics in the international system. Although it was interesting at times, it was not a class that I would recommend to a fellow student because it seemed to drag on at times.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and its strengths were definitely the course material (which I felt relevant and engaging) as well as Pogge's lecturing style, which helped make the social and civic material more didactic and not just a philosophical guilt trip. However, sometimes, I would have liked more time to clarify the readings in class. Lectures on the background of the reading were good, but it was hard to divide the time in lecture effectively without repeating important points and cutting out other points.The professor has a wealth of knowledge, a fun, dry sense of humor, and keeps you in class a biiit overtime so you get what you payed for. As for weaknesses, it seemed like the different lecture topics got rolled into one, or the structure of lectures was not as crisp and organized as I would have liked. Though the material does need repeating, some analogies were carried on for a bit too long.However, still a really good experience overall.",
    "Fine course, far too much reading though, makes it a little more stressful than it needs to be.",
    "More of a philosophy than international studies class.",
    "The material is really important. If you think about this stuff or you think you should or you want to know what some really smart people think about them, you should take it. The lectures can be dry and the readings can be long and dense (4 lengthy essays per week), but I've come out with at least an idea of the approaches I can take to answer these questions.The amount of philosophical experience expected is minimal, but you will do philosophy. This is absolutely a philosophy course.",
    "An above-average lecture course. You'll learn about global distributive justice, the moral status of state borders, and just war. Pogge is a really awesome individual - he's a leader in the field and it's a privilege to learn from him. We also had GREAT teaching assistants (Gaurav, Gilad, Tiemnu) and they really added a lot to the experience. If you can get one of them, definitely do so.",
    "PHIL 180 is a great course, the material is great, the discussions interesting, the structure good and the grading fair. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Really cool class on Ethics. Material's good and not too heavy, Pogge's lectures are great. If you can get Gilad as your TA, do it. He's the man, and makes the class way easier to understand\/fun to participate in.",
    "This is a great intro course. The lectures are a bit redundant with the readings, but the readings are vital to an understanding of the discipline. For any political science or philosophy major, I recommend taking this course.",
    "It was a great course. Every single reading except possibly a bit of the readings on just war was incredibly interesting and worthwhile. The course structure was also very sound. It is good for Poli Sci as well as Philosophy majors. Go to lecture just to hear Pogge talk!",
    "You will get the most out of this class if you're on board with Pogge. But even if not, as clich\u00e9 as it sounds, the ethics of global affairs will be an incredibly important subject for this generation. Worth thinking about. Be advised that there is a fair amount of work, especially with the final paper AND exam.",
    "Take this class. It's fantastic. The lectures are short, the readings are interesting, and it's not too much work. You'll come away from the class with a stronger beliefs about equality, what you owe poor people, immigration, war, terrorism, and torture. Not only will your beliefs be stronger, but you will understand where these beliefs come from and determine why you hold them. Make sure that you pick a good TF, because the one that I had made the class even better than it already was. Pogge is really cool, and the lectures were engaging even though they were early.",
    "Good class. Most of the stuff is pretty interesting, but not all of it will blow you out of the water. The TA\u0092s were great though, as was Pogge. If you want to have some great teachers and you are fairly interested in moral philosophy, do take the class.",
    "I really disliked this course for a number of reasons. First, it was too much of an intro course and a survey course. It requires a lot of work. It isn't very rewarding. It doesnt deal with either the philosophical issues or the poli sci issues in enough depth.I'd highly recommend against taking this course",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in learning how to develop and defend arguments rather than specific facts and figures. It's certainly not for everyone - I know several people who lost interest because it was too \"theoretical\". I personally found it highly relevant to my studies, as I have been learning about issues such as immigration and torture for a couple of years without understanding the various arguments surrounding these issues. Taking this course provided a much more multi-dimensional understanding of these issues, and I'm very glad I took it.",
    "I would recommend this course. You explore theories of global distributive justice and just war and the knowledge gained is very enlightening.",
    "Incredible Course. Prof. Pogge is amazing, Gilad Tanay is the best TA I've ever had, and the material ought to be required for graduation. A must take!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students if they are interested in global ethical issues- especially one's responsibility to the poor, terrorism, and immigration.",
    "This class is a very hands on application of philosophical principals. It applies ethics to really potent matters in the world."
