    "Would definitely recommend it, especially if you are interested in the history of India as we learnt about the mindframe of the people as opposed to just the History, and even the history was very different as it was not centered on Gandhi at all, rather it was everything but. Very enlightening class.",
    "Take the class if you're really interested in Hindi or need to clear a language requirement but don't have too many expectations about gaining something from this course.",
    "Overall a great class to take - informative, laid back, and taught by one of the coolest professors at Yale. The course deals with the sociopolitical problems facing India in the post-independence moment and their representations in literature and film. A good chance to read literature you might never encounter otherwise.",
    "Hindi 158 was a great learning experience. Seema Ji is a wonderful teacher and is fully engaged with the specific topic she is teaching. The readings aren't too difficult and the homework is tailor-made to accomodate each student's respective ability. If you are eligible for Hindi L-5, take it."
