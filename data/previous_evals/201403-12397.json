    "PHIL 451 is going to shake the foundations of your thinning on God and belief in God. Its going to broaden your understanding of philosophy of religion and what it means to have faith. If you want a class that will truly change your worldview and cause much reflection, take this course. Seriously, take it.",
    "As far as I'm concerned, take anything that Gabriel Citron teaches. There are not so many philosophy courses that address some of life's biggest questions while staying focused and rigorous. Professor Citron is a dynamic seminar leader, gives a lot of thought to the material he presents, and is invested in being accessible to students. He rocks.",
    "Amazing course. A loss if a person doesn't take a course so exceptional.",
