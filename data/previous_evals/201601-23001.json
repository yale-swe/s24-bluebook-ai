    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class",
    "Great course, particularly with Professor Maralani. Very useful stuff and you gain a basic familiarity with Stata. The material helps you think about data and drawing conclusions from data in big-picture ways in addition to providing students with the knowledge to read, understand, and minimally use a set of common regression models.",
    "This course is an extension of Socy 580. While doable if you didn't take Soc 580, it is easier to follow and understand if you do. For a student who is wary of statistics, this course makes it far more accessible and utilitarian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. The course is useful to any student interested in understanding and applying intermediate quantitative methods in sociological research."

    "This is a thank you note as well as a class evaluation. Prior to taking SOCY stats, I never thought I was capable of doing anything quantitative. Now I have so much con",
    "This course taught me the methods I will likely use to complete my senior thesis, and has been extremely helpful in that regard.",
    "I intend to use mixed methods in my own research. Therefore, this coursework is very important to developing my quantitative skill set.",
    "I found this course to be very helpful in terms of increasing my knowledge of and skills with quantitative sociological research. As a consumer of quantitative sociological research, this course has helped me to become literate in the regression tables that are published in articles and think more critically about the theoretical assumptions that are made in published research. As a quantitative researcher, this course has helped me to become more confident in my linear regression skills, as well as provided me with hands-on practice with more intermediate quantitative methods I hope to apply in my research."
