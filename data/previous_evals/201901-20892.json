   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about how to think critically about food and the labor that produces it. It made me think about the oppressive systems I'm complicit in upholding.",
    "Coming to the class having taken several other classes in ER&M and AFAM, I felt that the class was very helpful for my intellectual development in applying conceptual frameworks and theoretical criticism to daily lives and highly-specific cases.",
    "This class revealed an immense amount of information concerning the workings of the U.S. food system (from working conditions, to consumer complacency, to unjust international trade policies, to the insufficiency of many current alternative food movements and much more).",
    "The readings and discussions from this were amazing. Throughout the semester I came to learn how to engage with not only the physical object of the food itself, but the narratives and issues surrounding it.",
    "I gained more insight into the intricacies of issue of both race and migration, especially in the complex interactions we all have with these subjects through food. This class provided an amazing lens to look at a complex issue.",
    "This class allowed me to think of beyond the binary of consumption or production, which is really important. You learn about the entirety of the food chain, but also the people and ideologies behind each."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The work and discussion gets a little repetitive, but readings are very interesting!",
    "There were numerous points in the class where we would watch videos or movies, and that honestly felt like a waste of time. I would prefer to either have lectures or more discussion instead of watching movies. While the content of the movies were interesting, it would have been more effective and efficient if they were assigned as homework.",
    "I thought that nearly every unit was full of really interesting and important texts and themes, so it pains me to say it, but I think that I would have preferred a little more depth (especially with historical texts on labor\/migration\/racialization) in exchange for a little less breadth.",
    "No weaknesses; all the readings and their diversity was amazing. Discussions in class were thorough and enlightening. Every aspect was awesome.",
    "The readings for this course were incredibly interesting, and the discussions were captivating.",
    "Strength: Readings, Different Mediums of Scholarship (art, film, scholar, etc) Weakness: Class Discussions I think class discussions would be more productive if the classroom changed, but also if discussion posts were required to be posted afterwards instead of before. This would allow students to reflect on what others were saying in class and also address the things that were not brought up or didn't get into deep enough. Although the discussions were very nuanced, it's very easy to agree with each other on the topics, and I'm wondering if there's a way to create more challenging discussions or weekly topics (like Claire Jean Kim and speciesism).",
    "Professor Tran was great at facilitating class discussions, however two hours of discussion could get a bit overwhelming at times. While I appreciated the weekly student-led presentations these usually resulted in class discussions. Maybe more small group work could add some variation to the class."

   "comments": [
    "Content of the class was very interesting, I learned a lot of new things and really appreciated the thought-provoking questions. Although at some point, it sounded like we were discussing the same thing over and over again.",
    "Yes, it's a great class to familiarize yourself with food in a social justice context and it makes you think critically about yourself and New Haven and Yale and all that good stuff",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to any other student, as long as they have any interest in the core themes. Professor Tran is an excellent instructor and human being and I learned a lot from her and the other students in the class.",
    "Absolutely; this class is great both for people who are looking to pursue a career in food systems and for people who are just interested in learning more about the US food system.",
    "Yes!!! If your consider yourself a foodie this gives you a way to really engage with the food around you. Even if you dont, the migrant and colonial narratives that make up the histories of food are resounding and so something interesting to learn.",
    "Absolutely. I learned so much, and it wasnt too stressful. I loved the course, the subject matter, and the professor.",
    "I think if you haven't taken an ER&M class before this is a great one to start with.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in the food industry, agriculture, or environmentalism. Its a very discussion based class with only a few assignments so doing the readings is very important. But all the readings are all super interesting and span many different topics relating to food. I learned way more than I ever thought I would about the production, consumption, and the cultural histories behind our food."
