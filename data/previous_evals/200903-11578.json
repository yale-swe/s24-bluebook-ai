    "This is a pretty rigorous course, but worth it if you're studying psychology. You'll learn a lot.",
    "This is one of the best courses at Yale, and also one of the courses with the most work. If you're a psychology major, you must take this class. If you want to learn about children or want to work with them, take this course. You will learn more than you thought would be possible in one semester.",
    "It is relatively a lot of work for section, which is not a huge part of your grade. The debates in section are interesting but would be better if they included everyone for more of the time. You really do not need to read the text if you go to class because he gives essay questions for the exam so you can look up things you need when studying. Take it if you are interested in developmental - a decent Credit D class",
    "Good class - take it if you are a psych major for sure, and if you're non-psych and like this kind of stuff anyway. It's not a terrible amount of work, although the assignments are quite regular.",
    "I did NOT enjoy this course.I took it Credit\/D, which I think was a great choice, because it meant I didn't have to go to class or section very often, and I certainly didn't have to read the horribly written and organized \"textbook.\"Keil is a very unorganized lecturer and I don't think he has much of a concept of what it's like to be a student in his class. He doesn't bother to keep us engaged and he doesn't really seem to care whether or not we can understand the material (or his sentence structure).If you do have to take this course, take it Credit\/D and do not go to the lectures. And if you can help it, take a class that will actually engage you and teach you something meaningful. Developmental Psych is important, but it is meaningless in this setup.",
    "Yes, absolutely take it if you don't mind the workload. Having weekly responses due on Saturdays at midnight, a midterm, a final, and a 15-page final paper is not a small commitment, but it's well worth it if you're at all interested in learning more about kids and about yourself. Professor Keil is a very engaging lecturer and I went to most lectures even though it was at 9 am. Also try to get Alex Shaw to be your TA if you can, he's great!",
    "Excellent course giving a large overview of child development. Not too much work - if you go to class you don't have to read the book, and it's a writing credit!",
    "I would definitely recommend Psyc140 to another student. This class is amazing. I feel like I've learned so much and left every lecture feeling exhilarated, which is difficult to do for a 9 am class. Professor Keil is a great lecturer. I know there are a lot of concerns about how much work goes in to the paper and preparing for the tests, but if you plan your time well there's no reason that it should be any more unmanageable than any other class at Yale. The slight extra effort is DEFINITELY worth it for the amount of learning you get out of the course.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. It's a lot of work. (writing credit) but you get a lot out of it. If you are not interested in the topic at all, it may be a little too much work but the lectures are great and section is good too.",
    "Lectures were always very engaging despite being at 9am (not an easy feat). It was a great way to get exposed to a wide variety of both current and classic scientific research in many areas of psychology\/cogsci. Don't be intimidated by the debates, they're very informal and not as big of a deal as they seem at first. Lectures and the reading match up very well, so you don't actually have to do all the reading if you always go to lecture. The weekly assignments for section are kind of a nuisance, but 150-words goes a lot faster than you think. You get around 30 questions to study before the midterm of which 5 are on the test, and 30 more questions for the final (for a total of about 60), so studying before the midterm and final can be a lot of work.",
    "PSych 140 is a great introduction to Developmental Psychology. It is interesting and covers a very wide range of material. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in psychology, but would caution them that it requires a lot of hours of work to really know the stuff well.",
    "Take it. If you are a psychology or cognitive science major, I would say it is essential. If not, still probably worth taking. If you are going to take one psychology course at Yale (perhaps other than Intro), this would be a great choice. Far more material is covered, and in greater depth, than in other survey psychology courses. Frank Keil is a great researcher and lectures well. The work load is quite high (in terms of number of assignments) but everything is straightforward and fair. You will have to invest a decent amount of time into the course, but if you do so you'll emerge with a good grade and a good foundation for research in psychology, both developmental and otherwise.",
    "I thought Developmental Psych was a great course. The lectures are thorough and the subject matter is very interesting. There were weekly section debates, which dealt with specific topics in developmental psychology and were usually very interesting. The midterm and final are difficult because you have to prepare for a lot of essay questions, but you do get a list of prompts beforehand. The class is a lot of work, but if you're interested in the subject, I think it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "If you like psych, take it. Also, if you're a neuro track person looking for another List A course, this is great option.",
    "yes. lectures were very interesting, tests and workload were very manageable",
    "This was a great course! The material and the lectures are very interesting. The professor is great and the style of the section is fun. The debates are interesting and writing up an experiment was a good learning experience.",
    "Interesting class - you will learn about a lot of cool experiments that reveal various aspects of infant and child cognition. A variety of topics are covered, but there is a big focus on language acquisition, and a lot about Piaget.",
    "It's not mindblowingly amazing, but it's a very solid class and worth taking. Also, it's a writing credit.",
    "It can be a lot of work, especially for the midterm, final, and final paper, but if you're interested in the topic then you learn a lot.",
    "1. Do NOT take this class unless you a) have lots of free time in your schedule, b) are a junior or senior, or c) want a real challenge. I'm a straight-A psych major senior, and this class almost pushed me over the edge! I can't imagine how any freshman or sophomore (or anyone with a heavy course load) could get through this class without panicking. It's hard! Frankly, I'm surprised that this class is listed as a 100-level course. It's harder than most 300 and 400 classes I've taken.2. That being said, it's a PHENOMENAL course. I really, truly feel like I understand many different aspects of development, and I feel like a better-informed psychologist, adult, future parent, and voter because of it.3. TIPS:-Don't do the readings. You'll need to refer to them in order to prepare for the midterm and final, but there is no need to read all 1,000 pages during the semester.- Take notes on your computer. He doesn't put the slides up online, and it's hard to write everything down fast enough (especially if you're a visual learner like myself).- For the midterm, you'll need to prepare 30 essay outlines and you'll be asked to write 5 of them. For the final, those numbers are 60 and 7 respectively. Yes, you'll need to MEMORIZE theories, studies, and lots of examples for 60 different essays. Split up the work with a couple other trustworthy people in the class. There is no way to humanly write them all yourself, even though Dr. Keil will tell you to do so.- You can take 2 classes Cr\/D\/F for the psych major (as of 12\/09, anyway). Consider using one of them for this class. I wish I had done this just to ease the stress.- Otherwise, make sure the rest of your course load is relaxing or not too challenging. You WILL need a lot of time for this class, especially during the end of the year.",
    "I recommend it. The lectures are very interesting, and Professor Keil is an engaging (but fast) lecturer. The sections are mildly fun and definitely better than sections for some of the other classes I've taken at Yale. The midterm and final are a lot of work to study for and there is a lot of writing involved. Before you take the class, make sure you're willing to put in all the work required. It may not seem like much on the syllabus, but when the time comes and you have a million things to write and read in the same week, it can suck. So take the class, but consider the workload before you do.",
    "If you like Psych and Writing, take it. You will be writing a LOT for relatively little of your grade, though.",
    "You learn about developmental psychology, which is a fascinating topic in itself. Professor Keil makes the course extremely engaging, and fun though- with his passion for the material and his great sense of humor. Thesections allow you to express opinions about controversial developmental psychology topics, and learn how to do good scientific writing and research. It's a great course and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student regardless of major who has an interest in this material. The instructors are accessible, helpful, and highly knowledgable, and the material is engaging and interesting. The work load is very hefty, and it is a 9:00 class, but it is definitely worth every ounceof work put into it. Having a professor who works so closely in the field gives the class something extra, and lectures are interesting and relevant to societal policies. Take this class!",
    "I recommend this class. It is a lot of work. The midterm was really intense and we had little time to prepare. We had a final paper and a final exam due during the same week. But you learn so much and retain a good amount of it. I really enjoyed the material.",
    "This is a good course. You have to work hard but it is pretty fair overall. I would recommend the course because the information is interesting and the professor is good. The final paper takes a lot of work and you have to do a lot of preparation for the exams.",
    "This is an interesting, well-taught course. Even the textbook (Prof Keil's pre-publication textbook) is pretty interesting to read. The class requires a lot of time\/work but is not too unreasonable.",
    "Take this class if you have to- the material is really, really awesome but the tests S-U-C-K. Worst exams I've taken at Yale, and I'm a senior and I've taken a bunch of QRs. Great material tho- Awesome overview of developmental psych, presented in interesting ways that will keep you awake at 9am (usually, still bring coffee tho). Lots of cool studies discussed, which is always fun. Well-organized lectures.Midterm: 28 essay questions, often with multiple parts. 5 will be on the test, and you have to write all 5. So, you spend the entire weekend after you get the questions preparing outlines of the essays. It takes ~1hr per question, then you have to memorize them. So, at least 30 hours of studying for the midterm.Final: 2 questions from the midterm set, and 5 from a new set of 31. Everyone I know spent over 60 hours studying. By the end, I wanted to carve out my eyeballs.",
    "Fantastic overview of an interesting field in psychology. I would highly recommend this to all psychology majors. The professor is an outstanding lecturer. However, sections aren't great and assign lots of writing, reading volume is unreasonable and exams take an enormous chunk of preparation time, so reconsider taking this if that's a problem for you.",
    "The lectures are very good. The debate system for the sections struck me as unrelated and pointless. Still, I am glad I took this class; and you should take it if you are interested in development or psychology (as you'd probably guessed from the title).",
    "This course is really interesting, but a lot of work. I would recommend it, but not if you're also planning on taking other hard courses.",
    "Yes, but you have to be willing to do the work and deal with the ridiculous midterm\/final preparation. It's insane.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is fascinating, the workload isn't terrible, and it's a great way to get rid of a WR.",
    "Psych 140 is a great course that covers many different areas of development, mostly development in the early years and childhood. Topics ranging from the prenatal development to the development of a sense of morality are covered and looked at from various angles with a lot of experimental evidence. Professor Keil is an engaging professor and lectures are interesting. However, if you want to do all the readings, it is a LOT and the workload of the class is definitely on the heavier side. However, this class is worth taking if you are willing to sit down and work for this class.",
    "Take it only if you have spare time.",
    "tons of work...but if you are at all interesting in development...YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE IT IS AMAZING. just be prepared for a lot of reading and writing",
    "Although the course material is very interesting the course is waaaay more work than it's worth. There are weekly assignments, 2 debates, one assignment rewrite, a 4000 word paper and a midterm and final (before which Professor Keil gives you 30 short essay questions only a few days before the test which he expects you to look up and memorize answers to so that you can write 5 short essays in 75 minutes for the midterm-it was the most painful thing ever and means that class participation is essentially useless. Basically there are many other courses at Yale that go over similar material but are a lot less painful.",
    "YES. It's a lot of work, but of all the psych classes I've taken, this one has been the most worth it and the most rewarding. DON'T SKIP CLASS. Don't do the reading until the exam comes when you should just look up the specific questions in the text. Exam format: write 5 essays (no choice), ~25 questions given out several days before for you to prepare."
