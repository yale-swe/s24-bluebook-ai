   "comments": [
    "The class is very fair and the perfect amount of reading. there isnt a lot so you can acctually do it all.the short papers are enjoyable and the midterm was very straightforward.",
    "If you want a pretty basic American history class, take it.",
    "Take it. Seriously. It's great.",
    "Great course! I'm a science major\/pre-med who hasn't taken any history classes here, and I'm doing well in the class and am loving the material. Granted, I also love American history in this time period! It's like a much better, much more interesting and stimulating version of AP US History in high school. The readings were (for the most part) very interesting and Beverly Gage is an absolute expert on this time period. You'll learn a lot about the time period, how it relates to modern-day America and also a lot about history in general. A great course to start history at Yale!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone! It's for all students, whether or nor you're a history major, need a distributional credit, or just want to take an interesting class in American History. The lectures are fun and engaging, the reading load is very manageable, and the papers are short and interesting. This was my best\/favorite class of the year.",
    "Very broad overview of 1900-45, similar to what you'd get out of an AP US History class but with more focus on culture and social movements. Decent but didn't love or hate it.",
    "A fun introduction both to this period and to studying history in general. I didn't expect to learn so much about how to conduct research (particularly using resources at Yale), but I think that would be the most lasting (and unusual) benefit from taking this course. I highly recommend it, particularly as an introduction to studying American History.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in American history and politics. It's not too tough of a course, so it shouldn't be overlooked.",
    "I would recommend this course for those who are looking for a straightforward introduction to the major and to techniques for historical research. I was in a junior seminar simultaneously and learned a few tricks that helped me with my research project without adding too much strain to my work load. Lectures are enjoyable and Prof. Gage seems very approachable.",
    "I think that this is a good introductory class for anyone looking for a more in depth look into this time period.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a broad survey course in the history of USA from 1900-1945, take this class. Professor Gage is engaging, articulate and an organized person. The lecture are well organized, structured and the content is interesting and highly informative. Readings are great too. Lectures are never boring, and the course difficulty is reasonable. 5 short papers (which helps develop great historical research skills,) a mid term, and a final. Always walk out of the lecture feeling satisfied.",
    "This is a pretty good US class. If you've taken AP US History, it could be redundant, but if you haven't or want to brush up on basic history, then it's a good overview. You don't go into much detail about any one topic. The short papers can be deceptively time consuming, and a little bit pedantic for upperclassmen history majors, but if you want to practice research techniques they're useful. You don't have to write any long papers, which is nice. Overall, a solid class, but it might be too much of an overview if you know a lot about US history.",
    "Covers material from late 1800's up until the late 1940's. Hits all of the important events of the era including WWI and WWII.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "It is a really great class and Professor Gage is a passionate and engaging lecturer. I would definitely recommend it, both to those that love history and those who don't have much experience in the field.",
    "This is a great course to take because it gives you the tools that are necessary for begin a great history researcher and student. A definite recommend two thumbs up for any history major, because it opens your eyes to the many different types of research that can be done. The subject material is interesting, but not too difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class as a fairly easy fifth class.",
    "This class is great!! Not too much work, either.",
    "A very interesting time period to study, but this is definitely a survey course. It felt like I was back in high school. Doing the readings is the only way to actually learn something that isn't already common knowledge",
    "This class is fantastic. It serves as a targeted introduction to 20th century American history, and Professor Gage makes the subject both accessible and interesting. If you have even a small interest in history, you should shop this class - you likely won't regret it.",
    "History 131 is a survey course that covers U.S. political and social history from just before 1900 to just after World War II. I think if you want to get a general sense of what happened during this time period, and why the U.S. became such a global power, then this is an excellent course to take. However, if you are interested in a particular area within this time period, or you already understand the general trajectory of history during this time period, I would recommend a seminar over a lecture so you can go more in depth on a particular subject. But, as mentioned earlier, if you want an introduction to the time period in American history, this is an excellent course to take.",
    "Nice overview of 20th century American history.",
    "Great history course. Take it. Papers are short and not bad at all, midterm and final are manageable, awesome lecture, pretty chill sections. Lots of reading, but you can totally get away with skipping some of it if you need. Most readings are actually interesting though.",
    "Definitely take it! I had never taken a history class, and though Prof. Gage was super engaging and really made the material come alive. Also, not that hard... The five papers are easy and the midterm and final were not too overwhelming to prepare for.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about the time period. it's not extremely in depth, but more specific than a general survey course. manageable workload and fun material",
    "Great! Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend it as a great intro history course.",
    "An interesting class for those inside and outside of the history major. Professor Gage is a strong lecturer, and you can come to class expecting to learn something interesting about the period.",
    "This course covers political and social phenomena from 1900 to 1945. It focuses on elections, social mobility, and changing attitudes and roles of Americans. I would recommend taking this course for a better understanding of political factors that shaped our political landscape today, as well as for an interesting perspective on social issues from this time period.",
    "Do take it! I think a lot of students think that they know a lot about the period of 1900-1945, but I learned so much in it! And the readings are really well picked. The workload isn't too heavy; for a history course the reading is certainly manageable. Professor Gage is a straightforward but engaging lecturer, and the paper assignments were fun.",
    "Yeah, why not. Just be carefulwith GD history versus theory if you're an econ major.",
    "great class, great professor. take it, especially if you are considering being a history major.",
    "History 131 is a great class to take if you have any interest whatsoever in American history. The work load was not extremely demanding, and the essay assignments were both interesting and helpful in learning about Yale's various data bases. Professor Gage is a great lecturer, and there were very few dull moments during class.",
    "Take it especially is it's your 1st or 2nd history class at Yale. Even if it isn't it's still interesting and challenging.",
    "This class gives you a great overview of the period. If you're interested in learning about one of the most eventful periods in US (and World) History, this class is probably for you. It covers all of the significant political, social, and cultural trends of the era. Professor Gage's lectures are en\"gage\"ing (ha) and worth attending. She shows lots of interesting and relevant audio and video clips, and you'll come away from the class with a greater appreciation for history as a subject.",
    "Great course. Would take again. It is the sort of course where you are given the opportunity to take the direction that you want with your research. This period of American history (1900-1945) may already be familiar to you but the course gives you the opportunity to study something in depth or visit an archive.",
    "It's a very good history class. It doesn't have a lot of work load. The amount of reading is just right. But we do have a lot of writing assignments. Although each of the 5 writings was short, they all required us to do some historical research.",
    "This class provides a great look at American History from Reconstruction up until WWII. We can see how America transforms itself from a mess of a union after the Civil War into a global power of the 40s. Gage leads us here perfectly."
