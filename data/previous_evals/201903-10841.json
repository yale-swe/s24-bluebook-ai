I also learned how to input complex data sets into the computer language R and code so that I could draw causal analysis and make simplified models to explain the data.",
    "We learned about statistics and probability, linear regression, coding with R -- all meant to teach techniques to approach and analyze data in economics and explore\/explain causation between different variables. I felt what we learned was extremely relevant and applicable. Problem sets, in-class examples, and tests all featured examples and real data from studies actually published in the last 10-20 years. I felt confused most lectures and discouraged about how much I was learning\/understanding along the way, but after sitting down to consolidate my notes for both the midterm and the final, I felt a lot more confident with the material and pleased with what I was learning. Be patient with the class and try to review a little outside of lecture\/section before big tests -- the skills you gain are rewarding.",

This was the area of the course that I had the best understanding of, and what I think will be most useful for me in the future. I entered the course with no knowledge to code whatsoever and am pleased with my progress over the course of the semester. I learned this from the Psets, not necessarily lectures.",
    "Good class! Got an overview of probability and stats. I had taken intro probability, but dropped it because I wasn't getting much of anything. This class taught those things well - going to a section with a great TF was important; I had a hard time really learning in the big lecture setting. Also learn to use R. Not a ton of instruction on it, but not much is needed; you mostly Google for how to do things after you understand the basics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is well-organized. The quizzes and p-sets are helpful in making us review the material.",
    "Lecture was useless. There was no textbook. Problem sets took a long time. Teaching was horrible. The final exam was super difficult. Only take this class if you have to.",
    "The course was organised well, if a little bit slow. Good use of R in the course. Problem sets and practice material however were very lacking. Many of the problems were not written clearly at all, sometimes giving contradictory information or not even using complete sentences so it was impossible to know what they wanted from you. This even was the case on the exam",
    "The problem sets are grueling and they give no feedback on the grades aside from a number, never got the midterms back (had to go to office hours), the lectures are all over the place between R and statistics",
    "The course is organized well, but the teaching was very unclear.",
    "Strengths: JAIME, our TF, was AMAZING and explained everything super well. He was the only strength of this course. The one lecture he gave is the one I understood the best. Weaknesses: The problem sets are so long and basically only test R, and none of that is even tested on the exams. The quizzes are super hard (much harder than the exam questions, not even a good predictor of them). The exam questions half the time do not make any sense and they never provide specificity so you're just left wondering what you're even supposed to compute... Lecture is really dry and boring and never provided that many insights, to be honest. The course was also really disorganized; half the time, the slides would have typos in really basic formulas or the slides would completely mess up basic concepts like Type I and Type II error. Also, it was ridiculous that they couldn't have us pick up the midterms in section and made us go to office hours to look through the pile of hundreds of blue books. Super unnecessary.",
    "Discussion sections were very useful. Lectures were a bit unevenly paced, though, in terms of material. Sometimes I felt that we were moving slowly, and other times that we were moving very fast. Especially in the second half of the course, I often felt like each lecture contained a lot of information.",
    "Strengths: the head TA was very helpful in answering questions and clarifying lecture material. Applications and real-world data sets were interesting to look at. Weaknesses: lectures were hard to follow. Professor Ryan would ask a question right after introducing a concept, which was confusing and took up quite some time during lecture. Psets were difficult, but manageable with TA help.",
    "Strengths is that I learned R and stats well enough to be able to apply them to other courses. Weakness is that lectures are grossly insufficient - I felt that they were designed to frustrate our learning. Sections\/office hours are where it's at.",
    "The course is actually really well taught, it's just that there is a ton of information. In the first half of the course alone, you learn not only how to code in R but also all of the statistical concepts taught in AP statistics. I don't know that there's anything I would change.",
    "The strength of the course was that I learned a lot about how to analyze complex sets of data and how to draw conclusions from data using a sample sizes. Some of the skills I learned have practical applications in today's world especially when we use sample size data in order to draw conclusions about causal inference, omitted variables, sample means, sample variances, hypothesis testing, and more. The weaknesses of the course lie in the amount of different topics covered. This course simply tried to teach too much in not enough time and therefore the students were left with having to teach much of the material to themselves on their own. Because half the class was practical statistical analysis and half the class was computer language learning the students did not get enough teaching from the professor on either front. Therefore it made learning either topic extremely difficult.",
    "Strengths: relevant skills, familiarity with R, interesting concepts and examples in problem sets, very organized, easy-to-access lecture slides, actually a great crash course in probability and statistics for someone who has never had that training before, very helpful sections\/office hours with the right TF (Jaime\/Anisha both excellent). Weaknesses: long problem sets that only came every two weeks but were a struggle each time, fast pace that left little time for the material to consolidate, dry lectures",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot over the course of the semester. The course is also very well organized and you get good feedback.",
    "A little boring. Not clear links\/generalizations between concepts.",
    "The lecture slides were very thorough and put forward all of the necessary information in a clear way.",
    "Strengths: other than Jaime (head TA), I couldn't name any. Weaknesses: so disorganized (e.g., there were OFTEN typos in the slides, even in formulas! And even when they were discovered nobody would send out a notice about it letting everyone know what was wrong)",
    "Strengths: It teaches you a lot. Weaknesses: It sometimes moves too fast. This course goes over a bunch of the concepts but then expects you to apply these concepts in R.",
    "Strengths include the teaching assistants who met with me one-on-one to help me understand the content. The weaknesses include difficult and time intensive problem sets and large quantities of material to learn quickly.",
    "Weaknesses: Unfortunately, many of the weaknesses of large lectures apply. In addition, problem sets take a very long time to do, even if they are due every other week. The quizzes were unexpectedly and unreasonably difficult for some reason. Strengths: The lecture is engaging and I really like how the curriculum builds upon itself. Slides are always posted ahead of time, which was super helpful. Plus, exams are very fair.",
    "The course overall was pretty interesting but I feel that we overemphasized R during the lectures which was not that helpful since we just briefly went over the codes. I feel that I didn't really learn how to code using R. I just googled a bunch of things. The psets were also super super super super duper long and took forever because I felt that we didn't really learn some of the material during class but were expected to just know them. But, I really liked how we had so many examples in lecture so we could see exactly how the things we were learning applied to real life. That was super engaging and interesting.",
    "Lecture is boring and pointless; never worth going to, so I never went. Don't even know who my TA was tbh so clearly I don't many good things to say about section. Gotta say, though, that the slides were very well organized and made it so I could skip any in-person learning and just do the psets and quizzes \/ study for exams myself.",
    "Quizzes sucked. Frequent problems with grading, problem sets were graded in a weird way. TFs seemed more confused than the students. I did feel like I actually learned stuff though, but that was mostly in studying for midterm and final, and through the p sets.",
    "I really didn't like this course. I couldn't put my finger on it, but here are some key issues: the problem sets aren't graded for completion (like other intro Econ classes), the R is a lot easier than the data science theory questions (and they are the chunk of the course), the TAs aren't that great.",
    "The psets are really interesting since we have to use R and the lectures to reach certain conclusions from real-life research papers. It is great to apply knowledge gained from lecture in that way. Furthermore the material covered is large but the pace of the class is reasonable. The midterms of the course are challenging and they perhaps require a greater degree of review. It would be great if the review sessions could be problem-solving oriented.",
    "Strengths: in-depth concepts of statistics and their practical use in the real life.",
    "Online quizzes felt unfair because the difficulty is much greater than the lecture examples and test questions.",
    "The teaching fellows were engaged and helpful, but the professor didnt make himself available as much.",
    "The material wasnt really taught at a good pace and it didnt seem like what we learned in class applied very well to what was tested at times. The pacing was either way to fast or too slow and I didnt feel like there was enough support.",
    "1. good problem sets 2. too much statistics revision at the beginning",
    "The lecture slides were really helpful but making section attendance mandatory would help with motivation.",
    "I think the subject matter is really cool, and I liked learning it. However, the way it is taught in class is incredibly ineffective and boring. Most people had to self-teach.",
    "Good instructor",
    "Writing the formulas on the board and walking the class through them could be helpful. Just seeing them on the screen is makes them harder to process and decreases engagement",
    "I feel like the format of lecture could be improved \/ clarified a bit. Sometimes I felt like it was difficult to complete the HW assignments off the lecture material.",
    "The strengths were the staff. Section and the TAs were very helpful. Also, Prof. Ryan was clearly very knowledgable. However, I am very against the 30% weight of the problems sets when they are graded by a random sample of questions. You can put a lot of time into the problem sets but one slip-up could cost you a disproportionate amount of points.",
    "Its was good just a lot of work!",
    "I feel that so many subjects in this course were taught so that we could understand the technical definitions but not how to actually apply them to real-world problems. I wished that we could do more sample problems in class after getting some hint on how to apply the various formulas, etc. that we learned.",
    "i think the concepts were grossly over complicated in lectures. i think it shouldve been taught in a more straightforward way. i also think that the answers to the practice problems should have been put into the final versions of the slides",
    "Poorly taught. Avoid at all costs",
    "Weaknesses: Overly hard quizzes (class material was insufficient preparation), and lectures were overstuffed",
    "It was very poorly taught",
    "More interactive!",
    "Econometrics is really difficult if you haven't taken stats before! I think it would have been nice to have been advised to take a stats class prior, as many of the students had already, and we moved through material pretty quickly.",
    "I think the course was well organized to facilitate learning. The professor spoke well during lecturer and went over ideas fairly clearly and over multiple days. All lecture notes and materials were posted appropriately on Canvas for later review. Sections offered the opportunity to go over each weeks concepts in further detail and to ask any lingering questions about the material. The variety of problem sets and online quizzes was nice and balanced how much work we were doing each week while still assessing us on the content of the course. Overall we moved at a reasonable pace. Some improvements that can possibly be made are teaching us how to use R better. Learning are during lecture was helpful yet somewhat boring. Students don't really take notes for R code so students had to reteach themselves how to do R when working on their problem sets. It would be interesting to see whether the class could be better utilized to teach R to students who have never had experience with R before.",
    "I liked how the professor nearly always uploaded the slides promptly and the disciplined manner of the course overall.The sections were very helpful and the week-by-week reference list allowed me to self-study efficiently. However, I think there could be more TA sessions held the day before psets are due and the review sessions would be much better if they were more structured than based off student questions.",
    "I think the course was structured logically. Precious material was built upon in a way that made the connection between the course material clear. However, some weaknesses of the course involved the content of the problem sets. It was often not a great representation\/practice of what we had been learning and was often very narrow in scope.",
    "The lecture was impossible to follow. Professor Ryan rushed through key concepts, especially when it came to the R coding. Hed already have the code typed and just hit enter and watch it run, expecting us to immediately understand how it worked. He also spent extensive time on somewhat relevant examples that just diluted the material further. To be frank, I wasnt great at attending section so maybe that wouldve been helpful.",
    "It could be improved by spending more time with the practical part of the course in class and a little less with the theoretical part",
    "The TAs for the course, except Jaime, weren't particularly great when it came to review sessions. Lecture felt a bit hard to follow and dry. I think if the course was taught using a blackboard and not slides, it would be much better.",
    "I do enjoy that the course tries to solve practical problems and help students familiarize with R.",
    "Strength: this course offered a good mixture of theoretical and practical learning of econometrics Weakness: the theoretical basis of this course was very weak. Students were left confused many times in the course because of unclear notations and explanations. I only got a very very basic (and often flawed) understanding of econometrics after this course, much less than what I self-learned for my another course. For improvements, I would suggest keep the good mixture of R coding and theoretical learning, as well as the broad exposure to ECON literature in Psets. But I would prefer a much clearer and well-structured theoretical foundation for this course.",
    "exams were very difficult, homeworks were not well graded",
    "Strengths: -posting all of the slides -timely posting of practice midterms and finals -great TAs Weaknesses: -course moves very fast, especially in lecture -quizzes were based on material we learned the following week sometimes -the midterms and finals were very fast paced -I wish they returned back the midterm so you could see what part you did wrong",
    "Good content just very boring.",
    "I think the course could have been organized a little bit better, and the tests could have been made a little clearer in terms of directions, but other than that I really thought the course was incredibly well planned out.",
    "Strengths: Learning R (generally useful), inclusion of a good number of examples, well run (materials abundant and easily accessible) Weaknesses: Always either too fast or too slow: we would either belabor simple points with full lectures and drawn out examples or skim over points that came up a few times (degrees of freedom, etc.). Sloppy, at times: inconsistent grading by TFs, poorly written PSETs (some TFs would say other TFs were wrong, mainly because questions were vague), etc. It never could decide how important statistical details were: the class claims that it doesn't worry about a number of details important in statistics so it can focus on applications to economics, but it often assumed that we understood those concepts, leaving the audience confused at best. This is truly my biggest issue with the class. It needs to decide whether it ONLY wants students to know limited statistics and focus on applications (and thus be forgiving when students are hazy on the theory) or it needs to decide to be more rigorously technical and fully explain more theory.",
    "The psets can be kind of tedious and long, but they're only every other week which helps. If you go to office hours regularly, you'll likely get high grades on all the psets which is a big grade saver. It's your basic prereq class--not super interesting but you'll live.",
    "STRENGTHS - I made a lot of progress in R coding - I really like the assignment schedule, I think that 2 weeks is a great amount of time to work on the psets. I also like the variety of assignments (quizzes, psets) - I appreciated the fact that they introduced study groups into the program WEAKNESSES - For the majority of the semester I did not feel 100% confident coming to the course staff in section\/ office hours, which greatly impacted how easy it was to submit my psets. Sometimes the sessions were disorganised and the answers given by the instructors were not clear because they were trying to focus on many different students at once. Perhaps we could have more than one TA during office hours, particularly the more popular sessions. Furthermore, some of the TA's were actually not approachable, which added to my difficulty in getting my questions answered. - At the beginning of the class we were told that it was suitable for people who had never encountered R coding before, however, sometimes in lecture and psets I felt that a certain level of knowledge of R was assumed, even though not much R coding was taught in lecture. - The feedback I received on psets was oftentimes not clear, in my opinion - The quizzes were very difficult, and felt somewhat distant from the psets and exams in terms of relevance. That said, I did appreciate the variety of assignments (it wasn't just psets every week). - There were a number of typos in the lectures. This made things really unclear, especially in the lead-up to the exams when you go back and review previous concepts.",
    "Wish the same class were offered in small-class settings. Hard to learn in a big lecture. Like having real world examples of the concepts studied."

The final exam was quite difficult, but otherwise, problem-sets and the midterm were reasonable. I highly recommend learning from Jaime Arellano-Bover for section.",
    "Not unless taking for major",
    "For anyone really interested in statistics this would be a good course. Otherwise, it can be boring and quite challenging.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it for a major requirement. I learned more statistics and actually enjoyed it in the intro stats courses. This course really only goes a bit beyond those basics, and it is definitely not enjoyable. at all. It also doesn't even explain the rationale of what you're doing. I found myself just plugging in random formulas with no rhyme or reason behind what I was doing.",
    "I took it for Econ so didn't really have a choice. If you don't have to take the class, I wouldn't.",
    "Yes, I think regardless of your major, this course is useful. Statistics and R are broadly applicable in many fields.",
    "Yes, if you have to take it. The material itself is interesting and relevant, but the course structure is a bit disorganized and hard to follow. Prepare for a lot of self studying.",
    "Yes if you wish to learn a bit of R and stats.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's familiar with R or computer science in general or anyone who's familiar with statistics. Learning both the statistics and the coding at the same time was super difficult. Overall though, you walk away from the class with a lot of important knowledge as well as the ability to code in R which is an employable skill.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants an introduction to statistical analysis and an opportunity to learn the computer language only if the student knows before hand that a lot of the learning is going to happen on his or her own. Learning the computer language is like learning a completely new language and doing that simultaneously while trying to learn statistical topics is time consuming and demanding. Taking this class is essentially like taking two classes at the same time and then combining the topics learned in either class into one.",
    "Yes. I can now approach data and formulate important insights about real problems hiding behind it. I still see echoes of our course material in social science research from other classes and headlines in the news. I don't think I fully realized how much economics applies to before the semester -- public policy, education, healthcare, finance, and a lot more. Prepare to feel a little lost along the way, but looking back on the class, even though I'm not an Econ major, I feel like I gained very relevant skills this semester.",
    "This is a requirement for Econ people. That's why you're taking this course",
    "No.",
    "Only to Economics majors. I think that if you are a non-Econ major and are genuinely interested in the material, you could certainly find it in another course that is not as rigorous and time-consuming.",
    "for the requirement yes but other than that no",
    "ONLY if you have to take it for the major. Otherwise avoid. If you're just learning to learn stats, look at S&DS 230 or an intro stats course with better reviews.",
    "No, unless you are interested in this class or you have to take it.",
    "It is a requirement for the Economics major and I believe it is important to have an understanding of statistics.",
    "This class serves as a pretty interesting introduction to statistics, and also analyzes several very interesting economic questions while doing so. For example, to learn about linear regressions, we evaluated data on the difference in earnings for men and women.",
    "No, do not take it unless you have to.",
    "I would recommend the course for those interested in data science. It is a good introduction to the theory and the practical aspects of this field.",
    "I would but only if they have already taken another Stats class at Yale. I walked into the class without any knowledge in Stats while literally 3\/4 of the class understood a lot of the material and I was lost.",
    "Sure. If you want to take this class. It's not structured the best, the professor isn't the best, but the content covered is kinda interesting, at least. Could definitely all be explained better, and I'm not sure how much of it you will end up using later in life, but it's a requirement for the major. Don't let this evaluation change your mind if you're set on taking it (or if you have to take it) but good luck :)",
    "Definitely not",
    "Its required for the Econ major, but I wouldnt recommend to anyone with a passing interest.",
    "No. I hate that this is required for Econ majors. I would never take it otherwise.",
    "Learning R is useful and the material is covered efficiently. I would recommend the class to learn about many tools to tackle data.",
    "Yes, it is a great intro course to statistics and its use in economics.",
    "If you do not need it, do not take it.",
    "Depends on the situation; most people need to take it for major requirements. I wouldnt recommend it to someone who doesnt need it.",
    "I would recommend this class to people that want to learn more about regression analysis and tools for interpreting data.",
    "Recommend to those who have not taken other statistics courses. The first half of the course is revision of the most basic statistics.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in learning basic statistical analysis skills and econometrics.",
    "Yes, the skills you learn in this class are very applicable. I can honestly say this class taught me more real-life employable skills than any other class.",
    "Yes teaches you valuable stuff",
    "I would not recommend this course. This was by far the least interesting and least enjoyable course I've taken at Yale.",
    "I feel that although I did not enjoy this course, the information that we learned can be very useful. If somebody is not planning on majoring in economics, however, I would recommend avoiding this course.",
    "i would only recommend this if it is a requirement for a students major. otherwise this course is not worth it",
    "No. The class material covered too much for one semester since it combined both R coding as well as a plethora of statistical topics. The quizzes were also too difficult relative to the depth of material covered in class.",
    "If you have to",
    "Its a requirement but not really",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. This class is an interesting mix of economics and statistics and demonstrates how statistics applies to economics in the real world. It is well-organized for student learning whether you prefer to learn from listening in lecture or grinding through the lecture slides posted online. They provide plenty of opportunities to ask questions during lecture, at office hours, at section or by emailing and communicating outside of class. The course generally progresses in difficulty throughout the semester but the concepts never get too overwhelming as long as you take some time to read through and talk with others about the concepts.",
    "Yes, but they should be prepared to put in the work.",
    "Yes, I think it was a great introduction to all of the topics mentioned earlier.",
    "Dont take it unless you have to for your major. I wanted to drop this class so badly so many times throughout the semester but stuck with it for the sole reason that it was required for the Econ major. If youre interested in some of these concepts, take a stats class or compsci or Econ elective.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, since it is a very complete and effective introduction to the material",
    "You have to take this course if you are an econ major or 135\/136 so really no choice. Just do the problem sets, quizzes, go to section and you'll be fine.",
    "Requirement for econ majors obviously, but it is an interesting class in my opinion. You learn a lot and the material is very interesting. It doesn't hurt learning a bit of R programming as well. However, it is very difficult and problem sets do take a lot of time. Lectures were very informative, which was great for studying and reviewing purposes, but they covered too much material in one class.",
    "I would recommend the 135 136 sequence if you want to learn some real Econometrics. This course will very possibly left you confused.",
    "unsure, I would recommend econ 117 but maybe not with nick ryan. However, I am not sure how the other professors are.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student after they have taken another stats class at Yale. Also, only if they need this course for a distribution requirement.",
    "NO. This was by far the hardest, worst class I have taken at Yale. The material was so insanely difficult and the lectures were awful and boring. This class has all of Yales Math and Stats and Computer Science geniuses in it. No kidding, it often felt like every single person in this class had taken Math 687 and Computer Science 891 and had a Masters in Statistics. They would screw up the grading curves for the exams, so that it was almost impossible to get an A or even an A-. The problem sets were pages and pages of stuff (like for real 15 pages) that no one knew how to do, it often felt like the material covered in class had absolutely nothing to do with them. The quizzes were tough and a few hours long, and the exams were extremely poorly worded and complicated. The lectures were unhelpful and basically just consisted of the Professor reading the slides, and the TA sections were not useful except for Jaimes one. Look - I dont think Ive ever worked this much for a class in my life. I had friends with amazing GPAs and investment banking internships struggled so much and got way below average in the midterm, just because the questions were strange and people didnt fully understand what was going on. This class ruined my semester completely, it stressed me out so much for months on end and many of my friends felt the same. Now I am glad that my hard work paid off and that I am walking out with an A-, but the amount of blood, sweat and tears it took is just insane. The Econ department should really consider having two Econ 117 classes, one for kids with Math 112\/no coding\/no stats knowledge and one for kids with Math 115+\/prior coding\/stats knowledge. Because like this some kids barely came to class but still got As with no work, while kids who tried really hard but had never done any of the material before struggled and did poorly.",
    "Only if absolutely necessary. Not a great course to learn to code.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It teaches you what you need to get into economic research and statistical analysis.",
    "If you have to take it for the major, sure. If you want to understand statistics generally (even if you are particularly interested in economics), probably not. I'd take a pure S&DS class instead. This class will definitely teach you the basics, but it will be plenty frustrating (tedious and not particularly insightful PSETs) without giving you much theoretical ground to stand on. If you don't want to know theory, just applications, I'd still probably tell you to go to the S&DS department. In this class, you won't get enough applications to compensate for your lack of theoretical background.",
    "Absolutely not. This was the worst class I've taken at Yale, and I've lost all interest in Economics. As a computer science major, I was hopeful that this class would show me an interesting intersection of CS and econ, but it has managed to draw from the worst aspects of both disciplines. Many of my friends who don't have programming experience ended up dropping the course, and the others were forced to spend a lot of their time at office hours trying to get explanations. I'm really upset by how poorly taught the R portion of the course was taught, and I fear that many students won't want to try coding again. The conceptual statistics portion of the course was not much better. I stopped attending lecture halfway through the course, and understood the material much better by just reading the lecture slides and skipping the poor explanations. I only attended the first two discussion sections, which were somehow even worse than lecture. If you're set on being an econ major and need to take this class, good luck.",
    "I wouldn't go out of my way to take the class, but it's a requirement for the econ major. It's just kind of a course to get out of the way like most prereqs.",
    "Undecided - I think it is very important foundational knowledge for economics, but there are some aspects of the course that I would have liked to see different.",
    "Good course; I recommend as a way to learn basic probability, stats, and R. Well organized instruction."
