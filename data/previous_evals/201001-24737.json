   "comments": [
    "This course is fun. That is how I would describe it. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone.",
    "there actually is a lot of reading you have to do on your own because it is hard to understand the lecturer",
    "Yes - If you take it credit\/d it's bound to be kinda ridiculous in how easy it is. Without it's a 10 pg paper on anything you want pretty much, two easy hour tests and no final",
    "For art history majors: Black Atlantic Visual Tradition is entirely unlike any other art history course. It's far less scholarly, with lecture being more about remembering a few key attitudes for each culture or artistic form. The readings are genuinely interesting (though Master T tells you exactly what parts of them you need to know for the two tests). The workload is awfully nice, and I would recommend it as exposing you to an art history that receives limited attention.And if you've taken NY Mambo, Master T recycles 1\/4 or 1\/3 of the lectures. Which can be a bit boring.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "I would recommend it because it's unique",
    "take this class. DO IT",
    "I'm not sure whether or not to recommend this course: it was an interesting introduction to connections between different areas of the Atlantic world, but I didn't like how disorganized the lectures and assignments were. If you're a huge Master T fan, it's definitely worth it; otherwise, a good gut class but pretty frustrating at times.",
    "good classtake it",
    "yeah take it not much work and for the most part easy grading",
    "Take this class. Master T is the man.",
    "Yes, it's a unique experience.",
    "Obviously really fun. Not necessarily that structured.",
    "YES! great laid-back course but will help build an understanding of the tremendous African influence all over the Americas",
    "Yes. It's a crazy Yale experience. Go to class, enjoy it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a little kooky at first, but it is so so so awesome. As an art history major who focuses on European art, I was nervous that I wouldn't find the material interesting, but my worries were completely unfounded. This class is truly eye opening. Master T is awesome, and everyone should take a class with him before they graduate. In addition, this class isn't really work heavy, so it's great to add to an already tough schedule.",
    "Great, fun class in which you will get out of it what you put into it.",
    "2 Tests and a paper. Light workload, especially Credit\/D. I think the professor will be gone, and I'm not sure I'd recommend it if not for Master T.",
    "I would recommend it if you have an interest in art history through a very unique perspective. It's a good time, and if you need a class that you won't have to put in too much time, this is a good choice.",
    "Awesome class. It's a subject that most people haven't studied and Master T just wants you to come away from the class knowing just a little bit more about African art, dance, and music. Not much work except before the midterm and final. Go to class just to enjoy Master T.",
    "yes, because it is not a ton of work",
    "Definitely. Master T is the best.",
    "This is a course in Afro-Atlantic art history. It entails finding different West African peoples, finding visual trends across the region, and tracing them to American pop culture. For instance, foods like okra, dances like the mambo or tango, gestures like the high-five, and many others can be traced to West Africa. I would highly recommend this course for anyone with an open mind who is willing to embrace the uniqueness of Professor Thompson's arguments.",
    "Yes. It is different than any other class offered at Yale.",
    "Yes, interesting and not too much work.",
    "I DEFINITELY recommend this class if you like getting As on your transcript.",
    "Black Atlantic is quite easy and very fun. There are no real sections, just lectures, and yes I would recommend it.",
    "Fun class! Not hard. Master T is hilarious.",
    "This class gives you a broad understanding of many African cultures, and focuses on how their cultures have influenced areas all over, especially the United States. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, it is entertaining, and easy to learn in.",
    "good introductory course and i would recommend it to other students",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class! Professor Thompson is amazing. He has an endless amount of knowledge on the subject and his passion for his work is incredible. Lectures were always interesting and dynamic. The workload is very minimal and there are just two tests and a paper, which, if you attend lecture and put in some effort are not difficult. This class is a rare opportunity to learn for the pleasure of learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student but if you get a TA who is not available then you should try to switch because other students will have a huge advantage when it comes to test preparation and paper grades.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class with Master T as the teacher, but I'm not sure how it would be with any other instructor.",
    "Absolutely take this class no matter what you major. The topic is interesting. Master T is an incredible professor, though this may be his last year teaching. I had never had a class that is literally a performance each week, but this was like that. A great course.",
    "A totally unique and entertaining class. I definitely recommend going to class...Master T is hilarious and passionate guy. I don't think he is teaching again which is too bad!",
    "Interesting. Take it if you can get the books early because the class is not capped and, thus, there is a lot of competition for books. The teacher is a great guy and class is not strenuous but you must pay attention in class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Not a lot of homework and only has two exams with one final. The class is relatively interesting and it's one of those course you probably wouldn't have a chance to take if you weren't at yale.",
    "If you're interested in the Master T experience, take the class. It's relatively easy and you don't have to really be involved in taking detailed notes or even going very often to lecture. I'd be wary of any other professor teaching it, though - I think without Master T this class can become very boring very quickly.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are looking for a manageable credit. The course requires little work throughout each week except for two essay exams and a 10-page paper. The course load is VERY manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for a relatively easy, but VERY interesting class.",
    "It is a course that allows one to reach out of the normal course material and gain knowledge in topics that are rarely covered in conventional classes. I would definitely recommend the course because it is important to gain a broad wealth of knowledge in college.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in African Art or History, or in South American art and dance influenced by West Africa. Very cool class, with not much work, but a great output.",
    "One the whole, this is a fantastic class. It is a lecture with no section,which was extremely helpful in planning a lighter load. The professor, Master T, is amazing. Literally, one of the funniest, engaging, and most-knowledgeable professors at Yale. The content was varied every class, though some obvious themes made it easy to comprehensively understand. Unfortunately, due to the relatively relaxed standards (one paper and two tests), as well as a barrier of communication about deadlines (especially online), it got stressful a couple times, but nothing too unbearable.",
    "The course was not at all work intensive, though extremely interactive. Showing up for class was always a fun time, and the paper at the end was definitely interesting and \"outside of the box\". I'd recommend the class to anyone. Take it with friends!",
    "Definitely a class worth taking. Unfortunately I don't believe Master T is teaching the class anymore but if that changes, I'd definitely recommend taking the class.",
    "I'd recommend it if you want an easy class that you can go to lecture for and be amused. I wouldn't recommend it if you're sincerely attempting to learn about Black Atlantic Visual Traditions, because I'm at the end of the semester now and I don't even know where the \"Black Atlantic\" is located.",
    "Yes. It is a pretty simple class and really enjoyable at the same time.",
    "history of black culture and the influence of african culture in modern times",
    "An integral exploration into West African and Afro-American art.",
    "Take this course",
    "definitely...not much work and Master T is awesome",
    "This class was great. Robert Thompson is so dedicated and enthusastic and I love him. You must take this class. Avoid Michalina at all costs.",
    "It's not a lot of work. Watch out for the actual assignments though. The test and essay could potentially screw you over.",
    "yes",
    "yup.",
    "Interesting and not very hard.",
    "GREAT CLASS. Very entertaining, and you learn more than you think. I've seen applications in my day to day life where I always think back to this class.",
    "Black Atlantic Visual Tradition is the study of African culture and culture in the African Diaspora through art. You focus on West Africa, and compare traditional art works\/dance styles\/clothing\/architecture, etc. to their counterparts in places like Cuba, Dominican Republic, New Orleans, NYC, etc. The courses helps you see that nothing is original -- everything has its roots somewhere, and A LOT of things in American culture that we wouldn't think about has it's roots in Africa\/amongst decedents of Africans (i.e. cowboys, the saying 'that's cool\", etc.) I would definitely recommend this course to a student who wants to learn about something that is rarelytaught in American schools, specifically predominantly white ones. Not a lot of work, and fun lectures. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes I recommend this class. If you're willing to study the night before each exam then you should do really well",
    "Black Atlantic Visual Tradition is a great course. Lectures are made bearable by Robert Thompson\u0092s enthusiastic teachings techniques. You sit there for an hour as he takes you into his world, drumming off beats on the pedestal and dancing. The biggest negative about the class is that many of the readings have nothing to do with lecture. So if you want to pass the exams you don\u0092t even have to go to class, just do the readings.",
    "Yes top 3 class at Yale. It is just like mambo.",
    "This was a great course to take as an intro to African art and influence.",
    "very fun and master t makes the class. not necessary to go to class, tests based on readings. but fun if you go!",
    "A great introduction to the Black Atlantic Visual Tradition. I'd definitely recommend this class, its lots of listening to legends and stories behind great art and dance and even some in class dancing! Master T was a great lecturer and I always looked forward to learning something new in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to everyone.",
    "An awesome class taught by an awesome professor who knows his stuff. I would recommend this class, not much work, interesting lectures, and on some cool material.",
    "Learn about the African diaspora in art, music, and dancing. I would recommend if you have any interest in the subject!",
    "Master T is a legend. I apologize to those who may never get a chance to experience his presence.",
    "Yes wonderful class with a real interactive component to it.",
    "Take it. The information may be outdated but it is a lot of fun.",
    "I would highly recommend Black Atlantic Visual Tradition. Master T.'s teaching techniques involve more student participation than any other class I have taken at Yale. Studying Western African art history and cultural traditions was an excellent supplement to the slightly more mundane lectures I have been used to.",
    "Black Atlantic is a great course that I would definitely recommend taking.",
    "Just take it."
