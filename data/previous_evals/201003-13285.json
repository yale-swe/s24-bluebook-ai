    "This course is a great way to gain skills in critically reading the scientific literature and designing experiments. At the first session each week, a different researcher from MB&B or the med school gives a lecture about the molecular basis of a disease (flu, lupus, HIV, muscular dystrophy, etc.). There are 4-6 papers (1-2 reviews and 2-4 research articles) to read in between the sessions, and at the second session students work in rotating groups of three to answer questions about the papers. The workload was manageable, and the group discussion questions\/quizzes assessed critical thinking rather than memorization. Some of lecturers provided better background information than others (especially on experimental methods), but the helpfulness of the TAs made up for that.",
    "Absolutely, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Each week is a discreet unit, with a professor presenting a topic on Monday based on something they research. The students then read 4-8 primary research articles and then do a group discussion quiz on Wednesday. All of the students are very talented and so the discussions are great, as everyone has valuable input. I know that this course has helped me become a better scientist",
    "This class is fantastic. On Monday there is a lecture centered around a disease or a cellular process involved in a disease. Then on Wednesday, you work in a small group to answer questions based on readings about the lectures. It's really interesting because it has you think about research in a broader sense, how the research you do can impact peoples' lives. The professors are all great, especially Joan Steitz. The final project is well designed - it helps you to think about research you would want to do, and you learn a lot writing it.",
    "Take it if you want to see how biochemistry is directly applied to the betterment of medicine. Be prepared to read a lot of science papers. On average there is probably 30-40 pages of paper-reading which can be quite a pain sometimes.",
    "This course is a must for upperclassmenstudying science at Yale. It's really great to see how the basic science that you spend years learning is impacting the medical field. As an aspiring MD\/PhD, it was really cool to see how the basic science has such wide clinical impact.",
    "Med Impact is a great survey class for how basic research affects medical treatments or the basic biochemical\/genetic understanding of a disease. Definitely take this class right after MBB biochemistry - though I was fine taking a year after those courses. It also helps if you have taken MBB 251\/360 and\/or work in a lab so you have basic understanding of techniques. The lecturers are generally good - Profs. Schatz, Hochstrasser, and Steitz are great. The group quizzes were generally challenging but fun - but don't slack on reading the papers because then you will not get anything out of this class.",
    "Medical Impact is a fun course. We meet twice a week: on Monday a professor lectures about a particular topic (biochemistry research and a related disease or set of diseases), and on Wednesday we get into groups of 2-4 to answer three or four questions the professor wrote up. We get graded on our group work, two quizzes (same format as the group work, but done on your own), and a final paper (on some disease - background, current research, and your research proposal).It was not too stressful, and yet I learned a lot from it (about diseases, scientific research methods, and ongoing research at Yale and elsewhere). I would recommend it.",
    "This course is EXCELLENT, and hands-down one of my favorite classes that I\u0092ve taken at Yale. This was my first experience reading primary literature, and the course helped me become comfortable reading, evaluating, and critiquing. If you have any interest in basic research and in medicine, this class is the perfect bridge between these two interests.Prof. Steitz is a wonderful professor -- very approachable, genuinely interested in the students, and an engaging lecturer. Many of the other lecturers for the course were also phenomenal.The workload is very manageable, too. There is a group quiz each week (based on the reading), which is challenging without being stressful. It's really fun to collaborate with your classmates. The final paper is tough but do-able, and the TAs and professors are willing to help you if you have any questions. It wound up being a very cool chance to explore one subject in further depth.",
    "I would recommend this for MB&B majors only. No psets or exams is great. You read 2-4 research papers per week and then spend every Wednesday working in groups of 3-4 on some questions related to the readings. Final paper is tough.",
    "If you like research and it's medical applications, take it and it will be one of the best courses you'll take atYale.",
    "Great class, but lots of work. I learned a ton.",
    "Wonderful! Take it!",
    "yes i recommend it.",
    "Med Impact is a great course that is basically exactly as advertised. You'll spend every week reading somewhere between 3 - 6 basic science papers and reviews, have a background lecture on those papers, and a weekly quiz that tests understanding of those papers. You work in groups (except twice in the term), so it's not too difficult to come up with answers, as someone in the group generally picks up on something you might have missed. You'll get a lot of practice reading papers and understanding them fairly critically and become reasonably familiar with a lot of different cutting-edge topics in biology. Note that though every topic does tie into a disease and \"medicine\" somehow, it is a very basic science focused class: you're not going to be reading about a whole lot of translational research. If you do enjoy basic science, or think there's a chance you will, this is an excellent opportunityto find out. Highly recommended from my perspective.",
    "This is by far one of my favorite classes at Yale. The small class size and discussion groups stimulated interesting, thoughtful, and creative scientific discussions. This course provides important perspective on the critical and creative thinking that scientific research requires which too often is lacking in other classes.",
    "This is a must-take class for advanced biology students. It requires a good handle on scientific papers and techniques, so I would recommend taking another paper-based seminar first and getting some lab experience. That said, it is one of the best Biology classes Yale has to offer, delivering a huge amount of value (preparation and familiarity with research techniques and applications) for a relatively small time commitment.",
    "MB&B 449 is a good elective for juniors and seniors who qualify to take it. It basically covers the molecular mechanisms of various diseases and their corresponding treatments, so it might be particularly attractive to pre-medical students. The workload can be a bit unbalanced (ie, prepare to give up most of your Tuesday night learning the papers for the Wednesday group quiz), and you should have a strong background and biochemistry, but if you can deal with these aspects then I recommend the class.",
    "Take it if you have a good biochemistry background. It is worth the challenge"
