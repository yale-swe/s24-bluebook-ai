   "comments": [
    "1.) OLS works;2.) OLS cannot in itself allow us to make causal claims;3.) Good political science means doing hard work.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend the course.",
    "Any political science graduate student should take this course.",
    "It's an excellent course the every Poli Sci graduate student should take. P.Aronow created an environment that allowed success for all students but also guaranteed independent student growth.",
    "I would consider this to be a necessary course for almost any student in the Political Science PhD program.",
    "I would definitely recomend it if the person has some interest in learning theory as well as practice. If she is only interested in learning when and how to apply different methods, this class might not be the best fit",
    "Absolutely would recommend to every new first year student in the program, the course eventually makes much of the quant side of the field just click! Essentially the course provides solid building blocks that will make the rest of poli sic statistics make sense at a core rather than superficial level.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "This course is only half of what one needs to know to get the basic picture of how political research works. I would not recommend it to anyone who only had one semester to spare for quantitative methods. I would, however, gladly recommend it to someone who can take the full sequence."

   "comments": [
    "This course is absolutely essential to establish the background for independent quantitative research in political science and the instructor absolutely nailed it. A great course overall, one that necessarily delved into the abstract concepts of probability theory and regression but did so with a consistent eye towards applied research.",
    "This will be very helpful to my future research. This course was probably the most important learning experience of all of my first term courses.",
    "This course deepened my understanding of the philosophy and workings of statistics. it definitely enabled me to better grasp the methedological problems we face in my discipline and laid some foundations for learning how to deal with those problems.",
    "It helped me understand some of the debates in the field over what good political science isAdded clarity to reading papers in other classesProvided a base level where I can descriptively assess various data sets - which is exciting!",
    "Hard to answer this question at this point. I expect that it will be quite helpful in the long run."
