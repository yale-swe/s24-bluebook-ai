I learned how to analyze urban spaces and structures and see how they tie into the larger social, political, and economic fabric of a city.",
    "I learned how to document public space's history, use, and significance. I learned how to present an argument with texts, maps, and photos.",
    "This was a great survey of the history of urban design. I learned how to better research, observe, and analyze physical spaces to construct a strong argument about a place. I learned how to be critical of urban spaces and structures, and analyze their effectiveness."

   "comments": [
    "no improvements needed.",
    "Too much material covered in a once a week lecture",
    "The lectures can be hard to follow, though the topics are so interesting, because the professor can speak with sweeping claims and in roundabout ways. Taking notes can be hard as a result.",
    "This course was an interesting lecture, but section was very boring since almost no one did the reading. We also only received (very brief) feedback on the first assignment (out of three), so it was very difficult to know how we were doing in the course.",
    "The material for this class is often extremely interesting and I generally enjoyed doing the readings. However, I often found lecture less interesting. It felt like Professor Plattus moved quickly through a huge number of slides, while rarely delving deeply into a case study or example. The background provided in lecture and the readings provided a useful foundation for the papers, but sometimes the connection between lecture, the readings, and the assignments felt a bit tenuous. Overall though, I enjoyed the class, and especially appreciated Prof. Plattus' connection of the architectural theory and history we studied to examples or comparisons on Yale's campus or in the broader New Haven region.",
    "Include a walking tour of New Haven, especially to coincide with Prof. Plattus' uses of the past lecture.",
    "Readings are very long, but this is only really a problem when it's sixty pages of a very unusual, abstract writing style (i.e. Koolhaas), in addition to three other dense, forty page readings. We had to complete the reading before lecture, so it would be nice to have something to put the readings in context, or a list of themes or questions to guide our reading. Without any background knowledge, I felt like a lot of the readings went over my head."

   "comments": [
    "yes would definitely recommend.",
    "If they want to dip their toes into the field of urban design",
    "Very interesting topics, but the professor can be hard to follow in lecture. Not too much work. Enjoyable",
    "I probably would recommend this course only if the student was interested in the history of architecture.",
    "ARCH 345 is a course on urban design from the perspective of architecture. This is an important note, as I did not initially realize how much time I would spend reading and discussing architectural theory and how little time I would spend examining different contemporary cities in comparison. I enjoyed the class nonetheless, but also think that my teaching fellow played an important role in this, as all the assignments and discussions were run through section.",
    "Absolutely! Even if someone does not want to pursue a career in design or planning, it is a valuable course to inform anyone about modes and pathways that urbanization takes in physical form.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to understand more about the urban spaces we inhabit and how they came to be. I would also recommend it for anyone interested in architecture, urban studies, art history, globalization, or (for many reasons) colonialism."
