   "comments": [
    "Its great just crazy. Super confusingly organized. I mean who really knows what happened? Some of the work was brilliant. Some was just odd. But still a good time.",
    "This class was very different from any other production seminar I've taken, and it will push you to make work that doesn't comfortably sit between dance, theater, and performance art. Creative discussion, exposure, and exercises will give you a whole new toolkit for your own creative voice. Highly recommended.",
    "Take this class, if only to be in the same room with Emily Coates and Deb Margolin AT THE SAME TIME. They are quite the dynamic duo.",
    "Moving Texts was a great class! The class environment and discussions were very interesting and productive, and over the course it is possible to really expand your view of how movement and text work together. Take it if the material is interesting to you, definitely!",
    "Deb and Emily are hilarious together. Enjoyable class, even if you don't really know what you're doing a lot of the time."
