   "comments": [
    "I have already been singing the praises of this course to my friends and colleagues. An excellent sampling of US cultural historical methods and approaches. It's not comprehensive -- but nor is it meant to be. There's something for everyone on the syllabus.",
    "I would call it a great place to think about cultural history without coming to many conclusions (in a good way!). I would recommend it, particularly to people interested in culture and race, although I would be less inclined to recommend it to someone wanting to learn more about gender and sexuality.",
    "I would describe this course as offering useful foundational knowledge for those interested in understanding\/writing cultural history. The texts we read in the course were diverse in content and method. I felt that I got a broad sense of why and how scholars do cultural history, and I simultaneously got a useful historical arc to refer back to. I would recommend the course for the above reasons. I would only hesitate to recommend the course because of the limitations of the discussion format. For students coming to the class with a high sense of the political urgency\/stakes of cultural history (particularly students interested in marginalized historical subjects) the course can feel a bit detached. I often felt that the discussion of \"methods\" missed opportunities to discuss how historians wield power through their methods, and how that power relates to the story being told. I often wanted to think more about who is included\/left out of stories based on how they are told, and this was not a central concern of the course discussions.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course to anyone interested in studying cultural history. This course both helped me to understand how to write about cultural history and to learn about periods in American history that I was previously unacquainted with through the study of culture.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course. I wish I could take it again."

   "comments": [
    "This course forced me to think even more critically about cultural history as a discipline. I am now more confident than ever that this is what I want to do in my own research.",
    "I was grateful for the focus on culture and race, since that is an area I had not previously read widely in. The late nineteenth century books in particular were useful for reconceptualizing how cultural productions changed over time.",
    "This course gave me a useful set of texts to return to as I begin pulling a list of readings together for oral exams. I felt that it was a very useful foundational course for pursuing interdisciplinary work in my fields, and I felt that it did a good job getting me to think about the production of monographs. The course did not largely contribute to my potential dissertation research, though I am sure I will return to many of the texts we read as I get closer to developing a project."
