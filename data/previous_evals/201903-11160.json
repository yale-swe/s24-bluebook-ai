    "I learnt a lot of vocabulary and grammar structuring!",
    "Basic insights in Italian: vocabulary, grammar, culture. It requires a different method of studying and learning than math or econ. So I learned also a different way of thinking in a sense.",
    "I was able to learn Italian. By learning this language, I made new connections from Italian to other languages and cultures.",
    "I developed language comprehension skills and refined how to relate prior knowledge in related languages to Italian. Gained insight into the rules of a language.",
    "I think Ive reached the point where I can isolate and identify basic concepts like tense and word order in an Italian movie or tv show. If given the time, I can write mostly accurate, short essays and express more or less what I mean.",
    "Many Italian skills, as well as insight on culture and more.",
    "This class allowed me to learn the basics of Italian speech, grammar, and culture. I learned a lot in these three fields and did so to a very comprehensive extent. Although this course only lasted a semester so far, I feel like I've been learning Italian for much longer."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Farina is the most fun professor I have had and I loved coming in to class every day. While the class was not stressful at all because of hardly any homework, I believe that some homework at least every week could help facilitate learning better. There were every day quizzes though and that was of use in helping us keep up to material being taught in class, but none of the quizzes counted towards our grade.",
    "Meeting every day made it so the class became pretty close. Professor Farina always brought a good energy to class which made it very enjoyable.",
    "I liked how the course was taught with a small class, because it helped with the learning environment of being able to speak italian everyday.",
    "The weakness of the course was that is was entirely test oriented, written or conversational, and lacked instruction and feed back while having students basically teach themselves. Although, that could be conducive to some students learning styles it didn't really work for me.",
    "This course was incredibly engaging and fun, by far the most fun language course Ive taken in my life. I think I learned a lot very quickly. The work was well-paced and challenging, but not overly so. One suggested improvement would be to move away from the book some and have more informal class exercises, so that there is less of an impetus on memorization.",
    "None",
    "I think this course was structured very well in order to facilitate student learning. Most importantly we met every day of the school week and we covered new material every day. A few weeks in they changed the pace of the course to a little slower which I thought was actually immensely hopeful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you are looking for an easy, beautiful and fun language to take, I would highly recommend Italian.",
    "I would recommend Italian to another student as it is a good combination of a serious language that I really do want to learn while not being the most stressful atmosphere.",
    "I would recommend this course, because it was a great class to go to every day in order to learn new things while always having fun and enjoying.",
    "I couldn't recommend this course to another because of the lack of feedback and availability of the professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to people who want to learn Italian.",
    "Yes, the language is fun and Michael Farina is awesome, great teacher, has lived in Italy, and makes the class very fun.",
    "Italian is a very intriguing country with a lovely language and culture, I would certainly recommend any student to learn about it. It's a very lively language and it allows for us to express ourselves in a different manner, often more passionately, which is a wonderful opportunity."
