    "difficult class that you need to review for and follow closely; makes you work and truly learn the language",
    "Take this course with Oscar! He is the best. The class is interesting as well and the material is applicable.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone if, like me, they honestly want to improve their admittedly rudimentary Spanish skills. It was very formulaic, but definitely instilled in me a better understanding of the Spanish language. The homework was never too bad and the Professors are all pretty good.",
    "Take it, you are going to need the language credit anyways.",
    "Yes",
    "More fast-paced than L1, its not bad if you can stay with it.",
    "Harder than L1 so get ready",
    "Yes, you learn a lot of spanish",
    "Well, if you want Yale credit you need to do L2",
    "Small sections capped at 16. I was placed into L2 after 3 years of Spanish in high school and felt that my oral ability was equal to my classmates, but my knowledge of grammar, and perhaps some vocab, was more appropriate to a higher level."
