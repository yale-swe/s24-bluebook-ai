    "Yes, being able to write a senior essay independent from a class gives you an opportunity to study what you're really interested and allows you to work closely with a professor.",
    "Unless you have an advisor that you know and trust, do not write your senior essay through this method. It can really backfire.",
    "Do this instead of writing your senior essay in a seminar! Spending a whole semester researching and writing about something that YOU care about is an awesome opportunity. It was a great conclusion to my Poli Sci major.",
    "Yes. If you're the type to take on an independent project and do it well, this is an opportunity you should take.",
    "It's an independent senior essay; pretty straightforward. You get out of it what you put in. If you put in work\/ choose an advisor who'll actually have expectations of you, you'll be in a good spot when April comes around. If, however, you do not put in the effort\/ choose an advisor who doesn't care how often y'all meet, you will probably regret it. Choose wisely!",
    "It's a good idea to do an independent study if you have a great advisor who is really interested in your work. You also must be really self-motivated to set your own deadlines and progress with your research on your own."
