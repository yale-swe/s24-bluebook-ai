   "comments": [
    "Strengths: practical course assignments (designing and teaching a lesson plan; designing a syllabus, etc); mentorship opportunities through the observation program; a forum to discuss our thoughts and ideas about teaching (which I think makes English a leader among other departments and is a really positive model) Weaknesses: I felt that there was a bit too much emphasis on discussion of a set of theoretical readings that, although sometimes interesting or useful, were pretty voluminous and didn't necessarily always seem relevant to the set of circumstances at hand. There is so much for us to learn about the specifics of teaching and designing a course at Yale, especially from teachers as experienced as Jill and Margaret, and I would have liked to have spent more time working with them to revise and refine our course design ideas or write more lesson plans. A few more concrete suggestions, if useful: -Would it be logistically possible for students to have more input into their observation assignments? For instance, a student might want to arrange to work with a mentor in their field whose teaching they admire, including faculty but also even advanced graduated students. This could be a sort of \"opt in\" system in which no one feels pressured to be observed (especially graduate students), but can choose to work with someone with whom they already have a pedagogical or mentorship relationship. The class might also consider shortening the observation period to two weeks instead of three, just to make things logistically easier on everyone (this might also get more people involved, if they don't want to be observed for three weeks but could have someone in their classroom for a few sessions). --If the theoretical readings were cut down, could the syllabus assignment happen earlier in the semester, even at the midterm? I felt like there was a lot of intellectual energy around those syllabi that we didn't really get to follow through, since it was the last assignment. If we wrote the first drafts earlier on, the second half of the course could then be devoted to writing more lesson plans, refining the reading selections, and really getting that document into shape as an ENGL 114 proposal for the student's fourth year. Could Heather and the ENGL 114\/115 team be brought in to work with the class on this, maybe?",
    "I think the actual practice I got to do, inside and outside of the classroom, is really invaluable. I would like to see more updated texts on the syllabus. Also, having more choice in whose class I shadowed would have been helpful for me, because I struggled to lead a lesson in a class led my an instructor with a very different style from mine. Because class is so short, we couldnt always linger on things in discussion. I would have liked more time dedicated to discussing the readings and especially what applications in the classroom would look like."
