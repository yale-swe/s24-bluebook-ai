    "I really liked this course and thought it was well taught. The lectures and lecture slides were very helpful. My only complaint is that, in some of the lab assignments, the instructions were not detailed enough. It would be helpful if the questions were more specific about what should be given in the response.",
    "Great introduction to multiple advanced methods. Some methodologies and interpretations could have been made clearer in the slides.",
