    "If you want to listen to music and learn about Russian culture, this class is for you! The amount of reading and listening can feel a little overwhelming at times, but listening to music is also always a great break from other work. You'll also be exposed to music that you'll probably want to listen to throughout the rest of your life, and possibly even gain an appreciation of music you previously thought was unpleasant to listen to.",
    "I would recommend it. Interesting material, smart professor, reasonable grading.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It was a great learning experience.",
    "It was one of my favourite classes this semester! Take it if you love Russian history\/want an introduction to a music course!",
    "MUSI 004 is one of those Yale courses that can form a critical part of your general education. It will teach you to appreciate the arts more fully, a gift that if properly received, can keep on giving for the rest of your life. This course will be most enjoyable if you have prior musical experience or an interest in history. Be warned that you will only get as much out of this course that you put into it. You can certainly survive by going to class and listening to the music that you need to know for exams, but you will be cheating yourself of an excellent learning opportunity and a wealth of information from a very experienced professor. If properly taken and appreciated, MUSI 004 can be one of the most dynamic and rich courses that you take at Yale. I did not expect to learn so much about Russian music, history, and culture, and to be so interested in everything that I learned."
