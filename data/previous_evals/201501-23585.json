The point should be to really understand and not to be challenged",

    "This class did not seem particularly organized. There were not additional materials for non-engineering students to get caught up with the material. The instructors seemed to have a strong understanding of the technical aspects of the renewable energy technologies, but very little knowledge of the energy system as a whole.",
    "Given the book was at far too of a junior level for the course, one would hope that the lecture slides would have been more useful for learning, but they are difficult to get through. Variables for equations change on the same lecture and are often unlabeled. I am also not sure what the logic was behind having the midterm include material on a problem set we hadn't even turned in yet... How can students have the time to know whether they understand the concept if haven't even had a chance to work problems yet? It wasn't like there was a lack of material to put on that test.",
    "Prof. Smith did a good job teaching the course, but the material that was covered by Schwartz was not presented clearly. The slides were confusing and had a lot of extraneous information that really was not all that appropriate for the course, and it seemed like most variables in his equations were not well-defined so they were difficult for me to understand. Schwartz is clearly an expert in his field, but since this is a course on renewable energy and not physics, I think it would be better to have an instructor who specializes in the renewable energy technologies that we covered.",
    "I think the course was valuable to people with very little background knowledge in this subject. For me, I came in with an engineering background and some professional experience, and didn't really learn anything new. I don't really blame the course, I just wish there was a more advanced equivalent for those with some background knowledge and comfort with more advanced concepts, and taught by professors with more of a working knowledge of the latest technologies and trends.",
    "This course provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of renewable energy. Two things impressed me most: the clarity of explanations provided by the instructors and the content of the text book. I believe that students in the class were really passionate and interested, but some of the homework required a substantial background knowledge. I would suggest that TAs\/instructors hold drop in sessions in a classroom where students can ask questions on the assignments, get some feedback on the way they approach the assignment, etc... Students will benefit more, regardless of the grades.",
    "It should be made clear from the start that the course will be quantitatively focused and require basic physics skills.",
    "The content was incredible, but the teaching was marginal, as was the textbook and class discussion. It should be structured differently."

   "comments": [
    "There need to be additional resources for non-engineering students. PowerPoint slides need to define the variables every time an equation is given. Weekly problem sets ranged from being extremely easy to ridiculously difficult.",
    "The pedagogy really needs a bit more work. Larry's lectures went into far too much detail about certain aspects -- people who knew that material were bored and people who didn't know the material were completely lost--he needs to edit it down to the crucial concepts (not start everything from first principles). Did we ever need to use the Coulombic Force? Simple enough to say charges attract each other (why give the formula\/inverse square law)? Did we need to understand all those thermo engines? Better to concentrate on Carnot and really get it? Felt like we spent far too much time on that intro material and then rushed through interesting material. Would have loved to spend more time on geothermal, for example. Felt like a rushed grouping of definitions instead of a time to really master the thermo we spent so long on! Professors should hire a teaching assistant to go through the notes and add labels to variables\/make them consistent. They really should be in better shape, given recommended text is relatively useless... Of course it's not instructors fault that there isn't a better book out there!",
    "Problem set corrections\/grading could be improved (see above).",
    "Professor Larry Schwartz who co-taught the course was hard to follow during his lectures at times, and his slides were not very clear. He would not introduce an important equation or concept we were assumed to know as background, and he wasn't particularly helpful when you asked him a question about the background material or a problem set. In addition, it would be very useful to have access to answers to the problem sets after we received our grades so we could use them as a study tool. Otherwise it was very difficult to know what you did wrong on the problem sets if a few points were taken off but there was no explanation (and it wasn't clear which of the 3 TAs graded that particular problem set).",
    "The topics covered by Schwartz need to be presented and explained more clearly",
    "The homework assignments. The goal should be to understand, not to be challenged. I suggest drop in sessions, with QnA",
    "I would urge Larry to clean up his Powerpoint slide presentations. Too often there were multiple equations pasted up with little explanation of what the variables stood for, or how\/when the equation should be applied. I spent a lot of time googling equations for the hw assignments.",
    "Organization, class time, textbook choice.",
    "Many of the lectures given by Professor Schwartz were poorly organized and poorly explained. I understand that some of the material was complex, but the professor should have either reduced the amount of material taught or (better yet) simply gone over equations more carefully, with more explanation and greater clarity. One way of ensuring greater clarity might have been to use the white board rather than flashing inscrutable equations and diagrams on slides."
