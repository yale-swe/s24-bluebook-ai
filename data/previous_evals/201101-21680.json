   "comments": [
    "Do the take home exams. Easy to get credit in this class with minimal work.",
    "This course will make you paranoid--about the air you breathe, the water you drink, the plastic you encounter. Everything. Wargo is extremely knowledgeable but the lectures could get dry. Expect a fair overview of current environmental issues but not all that stimulating of a course. Great CR\/D.",
    "Good overview. nothing very specific. interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend it. A worthwhile experience.",
    "Strongly suggest taking this course",
    "solid class will minimal work and is decently interesting if you like the subject matter.",
    "All very interesting topics, but the class never really grabbed me.",
    "If you're interested in environmental sciences, EVST 255 is the perfect intro course.",
    "2 papers and section are the only grades. Good class, I thought it was pretty interesting",
    "Great class, manageable workload. Interesting topics. Definitely recommend it.",
    "take this class",
    "This class is great! It's not a lot of work (a fair amount of reading but you're not tested on this) just a midterm and a final exam, both 8-10 page take-home papers. Section is mandatory. Its an interesting, straight forward class. I would recommend it. Professor Wargo is stellar.",
    "Four parts to the course:Atmospheric nuclear testing and weapons testing and the effects on human healthFood labeling and processesConstructionConservation and land use.If you're interested in the environment, take this class.If you're interested in how everything you interact with in your daily life affects you, take this class.Take this class",
    "Take this class, it's interesting and informative in a very relaxed setting. And the professor is awesome.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in the environment and looking for an easy class. Take it credit\/D as a 5th or 6th class. The materials is interesting and it's not very demanding.",
    "It's an okay class, but it gives a very broad sweep of many environmental topics. It may be a good way to expose yourself to a variety of topics but if you're already interested in Environmental Studies, choose another class that focuses more on specific topics.",
    "John Wargo gets up and talks about how our government is failing to regulate certain aspects of industry and some of the dangers the products these industries make pose to our health.",
    "You know has Staple's has that \"Easy Button?\"",
    "I would recommend it to another student - it's not that work-intensive and the readings are really interesting.",
    "Take this course. John Wargo knows what he is talking about and the material is interesting.",
    "Take it- interesting",
    "Pretty gutty and also pretty interesting. But bear in mind that it's really about public health (not really environmental policy and law). And section will be painful. And you may not learn that much if you don't attend the class (which is pretty easy to skip...).",
    "Not too much work, good section, good lecture, mostly very interesting",
    "Very interesting class to take, really makes you think. The kind of class you should take at Yale. Very manageable workload - readings interesting, but not necessary. Take home final and midterm FTW!",
    "Yeah, you'll learn things and it's not hard. Although it should be noted that the class is disproportionately focused on public health.",
    "Broad survey intro course to environmental health essentially. Got a little boring at times, but very interesting, thought-provoking topics. Made me become an EVST major, even while being a pre-med. Def take this course.",
    "Great class. Professor Wargo is engaging and genuinely committed to teaching undergrads. With a great teacher and topics that are becoming increasingly relevant to our everyday lives, you should take this class.",
    "You get out of this course what you put into it. If you show up to all of the lectures and pay attention and do the readings, then you'll love it. If you're interested in nuclear energy, pesticides, plastics, food safety, etc. then I definitely recommend it--ultimately this is a really interesting and pertinent class, especially if you're an environmental studies major.",
    "Be cautious, this class is not a great deal of work however the first few lectures are MUCH more interesting than the rest and most of the course.",
    "Take this class if you are interested or need it for the major. If not, there are probably more engaging classes out there.",
    "eh. not interesting if you are a history major. lots of babes in the class though. \"oh, me too, i totally care about the environment\"",
    "A pretty easy course that is pertinent to everyone's life. Lectures can be a bit boring but Wargo is a great guy and the readings aren't bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class if you are interested in the issues. Often Professor Wargo presents his own ideas strongly, but there is room for you to explore your own opinions.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about the state of the environment and is ready to hear some worrisome information concerning the food we eat, air we breathe and products we use everyday. The course changes the way you think about your daily activities and the environment. It is a very interesting and exciting course that makes you want to help the environment in the future.",
    "This is a compelling class, and Prof. Wargo is phenomenal!",
    "Gives you an understanding of the issues with environmental legislation and you become aware of the great environmental quandry the world is in. I was hoping for more focus on environmental politics and law in regards to conservation, national parks etc. but because Wargo is an expert in human health and the environment that is mostly what the focus was. It's not an outstanding course by any means but it was interesting and informative.",
    "Not a lot of work at all. No tests!",
    "This class gives a very solid overview of American environmental law over the past decades, and Professor Wargo is clearly an expert in the field. The reading is relatively light--and you don't need to read it all in depth--and the take home midterm and final are very reasonable. The lectures can be a bit boring.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Professor Wargo is great. Definitely recommend this class. Not a lot of work, reasonable take-home midterm and final.",
    "Take it! Great course. Very structured and interesting discussions during section. Get Sara as your section TA if she is still running a section!",
    "Super fun topics that are varied. If you're sick and tired of \"typical highschool\" classes like Chem 118 or Math 120, take this class because you will learn a lot and become aware of the world around you.The assignments for this class are manageable, open, and encourage student research. You won't regret this great class. Only be wary of large lectures and falling behind in readings!",
    "Yes as it makes you think about may of the things we take for granted in our society, including national defense, the food we eat, plastic use, and the level of government intervention and secrecy.",
    "It is a fantastic class. It touches on several different crucial environmental problems. I would recommend it to another student. There is a lot of reading.",
    "Wargo is a quiet-spoken guy who uses \"ummm\" a lot. Basically this means that his lectures will put you to sleep immediately. The matieral is interesting, though, and important in the current age. Take it if you're really interested in this topic and can stay awake in lecture.",
    "Broad course covering an array of topics. Lecture attendance is certainly not needed (no in-class exams), although Wargo does a great job teaching.",
    "Environmental Studies 255 01 is a comprehensive introduction to the issues that have affected, and continue to affect, the environment. This topics introduced are of great importance with respect to contemporary issues involving the environment and policymaking. I would recommend this course to another student, as knowledge about the topics discussed is essential.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student. It's an interesting PLSC class and a great fifth class.",
    "I would recommend this class, it is interesting and is not very time consuming",
    "All the scary things you didnt know about the environment and what is and isnt being done about them.",
    "Take it if you are either polisci or EVST. If not, you should take at least one other policy class before this, because the assignments are few and far between but rely HEAVILY on policy knowledge and construction, which you can only really pick up through other courses.",
    "It's a very interesting survey course of environmental issues. The professor comes at it from a very liberal perspective, but there is room in the assignments for students to take an opinion of their choosing (either further left or right). Overall, I'm glad I took this course because it was interesting and provided a good survey of the key issues. However, be prepared to leave with more questions than answers as Professor Wargo generally points out problems but does not offer solutions.",
    "Pretty interesting and exams are great for people who get stressed, they are both take homes.",
    "My friend who also took the class described it as a collection of \"fun facts\" which I thought was pretty accurate. I learned some interesting information, but I felt like the class didn't really go into depth about anything. It was also very much based on Professor Wargo's perspective on the subject i.e. I feel like I could have just read his books, not taken the class and learned basically the same thing. The workload is pretty light - just a take home midterm and final, and a lot of the reading isn't necessary to do fine on them (although I would suggest reading the stuff Wargo wrote). Overall it was an alright class but part of me wishes I used that credit on a class where I would have learned more.",
    "Lectures are interesting.",
    "Good class. Pretty light workload\u0097midterm and final, both of which are take-home. Very interesting material with very real implications for your daily life, no matter who you are.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wants to be aware of the environmental issues in the world and all the thought processes that go into making decisions that attempt to protect human health and the environment.",
    "It is a very interesting class and John Wargo wrote the book on Environmental Politics and law...literally, but to get anything out of the class you have to be willing to push yourself to do the readings, because there is no incentive or evaluation that will require you complete them. If you are very interested in the topic - take it, if not -- it's probably a waste of your time.",
    "Pretty easy, readings are not bad, and there is always something you can say about policy.",
    "Yes, if your interested in the environment take this class.",
    "Yes, take this! Wargo is a decent lecturer, and the material, although sometimes dry, will change the way you regard the world around you. It's not very much work, but what you learn is really important.",
    "This is a really exciting and fun introduction to current issues in EVST. As someone who had never before taken an EVST class, I loved the course and could see how this might have pushedme to even consider majoring in EVST had I taken it before my senior year. John Wargo is a fantastic, engaging, and passionate professor, and I feel very lucky to have taken this course with him. The workload is very manageable and appropriate -- not too hard, but not too easy. I'd highly recommend this class to anyone interested in current environmental issues!",
    "Take this class, great overview of our the effect the environment has on human health, lots of good information, although weekly reading load is a lot.",
    "This is a MUST TAKE for all Yale students. If you want to graduate from Yale as a critical consumer of everything around you, from the air you breath, to the food you eat, to the type of power providing your electricity, this is the class for you. Easiest workload, amazing lectures and a life changing subject.",
    "I'd recommend it. Different than the other normal Poli Sci classes and focuses on a different area of politics and law.",
    "A very interesting introduction to Environmental Studies. This is a great class!",
    "Professor Wargo really knows his stuff, and the readings are great, but the class is as much about public health as it is about the environment. Also, lectures could be pretty dull as they are sometimes very superficial and sometimes very random case-studies. But overall, a great introduction to some important and interesting (and scary!) issues.",
    "Yes! Take it. Not too difficult and you learn a lot about issues that aren't traditionally taught in political science and are very relevant to our every day lives.",
    "Yes absolutely take it. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "I recommend this class if you are interested in learning more about environmental policy. It covers a wide variety of topics, with little mention of climate change. One midterm and one final.",
    "Good class, not very difficult if you don't miss too many lectures and take good notes. There are only two grades, so make sure you get started on them ahead of time to do well",
    "I would recommend it for sure, but know that it's not the same kind of class you would get at the law school. It leans heavily toward environmental health, which was a surprise to me and is outside my area of immediate interest but I thoroughly enjoyed the class. I think it was my favorite this semester.",
    "This is a pretty interesting class. Going in, I thought that all the environmental nuts were crazy, but actually the world is significantly less healthy than I thought. Lectures aren't always necessary to attend, but they are mostly interesting, and there isn't too much work in the class. Overall, a good So credit, and will help you decide if the environmental studies major is right for you. Also a clue about the nature of this class: there are a lot of athletes.",
    "i would recommend this class to someone interested in the subject, but don't expect anything very deep from it.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting subject",
    "Good class, not a huge workload and pretty interesting material. Lectures were rather good, and the grading was fair.",
    "The class is basically composed of several case studies that Wargo worked on. In all the lectures, key concepts are revisited. The readings aren't that bad and everything you read is covered in lecture. The exams are both take-home.",
    "A wonderful course and a very needed introduction to some the incredibly challenging health issues facing our generation. Just be aware that he focuses largely on dangers to human health--which most people actually, I think, don't know much about. That said, my only recommendation is to talk more about climate change as the greatest environmental issue (or indeed, general issue) currently facing humanity and at least gesture at the huge challenge it poses in terms of framing environmental law. It's a shame if students leave a class called \"Environmental Law and Politics\" largely unaware of the incredible need for legislation or regulation to mitigate climate change. However, that's a small problem in an otherwise truly enlightening class--it was one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale! (Granted, I'm interested in environmental issues, but I think it would be enlightening to anybody). The midterm offers a paper or take home test--the paper allows for some really wide-open research opportunities.",
    "Every Yale student ought to take this course. It will open your eyes to a whole host of dangers and problems, both environmental and health-related, that are either hidden from us or that we choose to ignore. Professor Wargo is an inspiration, and is not only a compelling lecturer, but is also a towering figure within the field of environmental health. Take this course--you won't regret it.",
    "The class was very interesting but required a lot of reading. I would recommend taking it, if you are prepared to put some time in.",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone if the person is willing to put some time and effort into it and do the readings. Only by attending lecture and section you won't get that much out of it. The course covers too many issues in not too much depth.",
    "Good class. A lot of interesting themes, and you learn a lot about important issues regarding health and the environment (plastics, pesticides and chemicals, nuclear, the EPA, etc). Keep teaching those themes, as they are directly applicable to our lives.Lecture can get a little repetitive, especially given that each class is done from PowerPoint slides which are then posted online. Professor Wargo is obviously knowledgeable, but the pace of the class and method of teaching is a little slow and sleepy.That said, the good parts of the class outweigh the bad. I would take it because it's an eye opening course.",
    "Interesting material; perhaps less work than I had anticipated. Definitely more on policy than on law--you won't see more than a handful of Supreme Court cases here and in essays, you'll be asked to think like a legislator, not like an attorney or a judge. Not a must-take, but consider shopping it; it would makea good fifth class.",
    "This class pertains to environmental issues and how they affect our world, our health, and our society. I would recommend this class to someone who wants to be more informed on these issues. The workload is very manageable. I found the class to be very interesting and informative.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in environmental politics and law. It's a great introduction if you are willing to do the reading.",
    "This is a good class. It isn't too much in terms of reading and learning facts, and the only real effort is in the midterm\/paper and final. Wargo is extremely knowledgeable, although some lectures may not be as interesting. However, it is really helpful that a lot of his lectures relate to his research, and his book is a really interesting read as well.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn not to take for granted the things we use in our everyday lives.",
    "Absolutely recommend it.",
    "Take it if you want to have a general idea of environmental politics. It provides a great background, but if you're interested in a specific field of it, then this isn't for you.",
    "If interested in environmental studies and willing to sit through long lectures.",
    "A drive by of environmental issues. Helpful, necessary and as interesting as you make it.",
    "Interesting class. I would recommend this if you are interested at all in the environment.",
    "If you know very little about environmental law and policy, take this class! Wargo is a great lecturer and the readings (if you do them) are very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, with the caveats that lectures can be a bit slow, and that there is a stronger focus on the health impact of environmental policies than on the ecological\/conservation effects.See answer from Question 1:The course was quite good, but not especially demanding. (It is one of those huge classes in the YUAG auditorium that, b\/c of its size\/distance\/sleepy lighting\/workload, becomes easy to miss or to arrive late to it.)There was a strong focus on the public health implications of environmental actions\/policies, and less on more ecological concerns. There was also very little emphasis on the laws themselves - other than in the reading, which wasn't necessary to complete fully in order to breeze through the course (because of the low number of assignments).",
    "I would call it a nice overview of environmental issues. A great starting point for someone considering an EVST major.",
    "Political Science 215 is an interesting look at the environment, the laws in place to protect it, and our success and failure in enforcing thoselaws. I would highly recommend the class to anyone with an interest in environmentalism, environmental law, and American institutions charged with protecting the environment, because it provides a fascinating look at the environment and how we try to protect it.",
    "Good intro course to environmental issues and policy in America. There is a take home midterm and final exam. Very good course.",
    "I would recommend this course. The information is all extremely interesting and very relevant to today's world. Wargo is an incredibly knowledgeable lecturer and his depth of experience and expertise is incredible. His lecture style can be a little dry, but the content is all really interesting. The work load is definitely not bad. Overall a pretty relaxed class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. DO IT.",
    "I didn't love the class but its not terrible. take it if u need political science classes"
