    "Chinese 120 is a very intense course. If you're not willing to do the work and put in the time to constantly practice you're speaking skills, pronunciation, and listening, don't take the course. If you're really interesting in learning the language beyond just taking it for a language requirement this is definitely a nice class to take to expand your fundamental language skills.",
    "I'd describe the course as fairly fast-paced, but also really enjoyable and worthwhile. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "The class is much more challenging than Chinese 110, even with the same amount of work, because students have to build upon the material they learned in Chinese 110."
