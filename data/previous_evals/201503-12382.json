    "If you would prefer proof-based mathematics at a more abstract level, take this class.",
    "Not nearly as hard or as much work it is reputed to be.",
    "Math 230 is the most advanced \"introductory\" math class offered at Yale. It is a proof-based class covering roughly multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, and a number of more advanced topics concerned with the study of manifolds. The \"Should I take 230\" Guide, 2015 Edition: If you come in with only single-variable experience, the class is perfectly doable, if very challenging, but you should expect your friends in Math 120 to know things that you do not for at least part of the year. You should also be prepared to learn from classmates with more background than you -- you will be more successful and learn more if you can do so. If you come in with computational multi-variable experience and no significant background in proofs, this class is designed for you. It will be one of your more challenging and work-intensive classes, but you should absolutely be capable of everything it asks. The comment above about classmates applies here too. In my year, the median student in the class sits at the top of this section. If you come in with computational experience in both multi-variable and linear algebra, but no background in proofs, this class will serve as a gentle introduction while examining the underlying principles of systems you already know how to work with. It will probably be a class of middling difficulty and moderate workload. If you come in with proof-based experience in multi-variable calculus and little\/no knowledge of linear algebra, this class will not be very difficult, but it might be a more interesting way to learn linear algebra than the alternatives offered. Try not to annoy the students without proof-based experience -- they will pick it up very quickly. If you come in with a rigorous proof-based background and experience in multi-variable AND linear algebra, the class will be too easy -- you should seek a higher-level class.",
    "If you really like math and are really good at it, this course will still be challenging, yet rewarding. Not for the faint of heart, Math 230 is a tough class for students prepared to challenge themselves. Even so, once completed you will have a profound understanding of linear algebra and a strong set of skills unmatched by any other course.",
    "The course is hard. Be expecting a very rigorous, very tough, high level REAL math course. Be expecting to spend lots of time on Psets. However, if you focus and dedicate time to the class, you will learn, and you will do well.",
    "To start off, don't be scared by the rumors you might have heard about 230--especially with Giulio, the material and problem sets are not that bad. There's definitely a subset of the students who would describe the class as \"easy\", so especially if you've taken a proof-based math course before, don't be reluctant to take 230 because it'll be too hard. If you already have experience with introductory analysis, the material will mostly be review--but I'd still recommend it, even if just for the bonding, memories, and the couple tough problems each week on the problem sets. On the other hand, there's many students who found 230 to be really tough, but also incredibly rewarding. I'd strongly suggest at least shopping the class if you're interested; one of my friends switched from an art history major to a math major because of 230! Grading is very generous. Almost everyone will probably end with with an A or B.",
    "Given a solid background in mathematics, this course is a good introduction to proof based math. The midterms and final are all approachable and the problem sets are not overly time consuming.",
    "Those without proof experience will certainly have a hard time adjusting at the beginning of the course, simply because learning the concept of a proof for the first time and how to write proofs is hard. However, the course is well taught and the Psets are very reasonable and help guide you through it. If you do not have proof experience but would like to pursue higher level math, this course is a great place to start. If you already have proof experience, this course will help you build on that further and help you see the connections between different branches of math.",
    "If you know that you are absolutely in love with math - especially studying and writing proofs - then this is the class for you. You'll thoroughly enjoy the experience of struggling through the problem sets with your fellow 230ers. On the other hand, if math is just a little crush of yours, or if you've been cheating on math lately in favor of other subjects, avoid this class at all costs. The amount of time you'll spend on the problem sets will seem like torture. The class begins with the fundamental question \"What are the real numbers\"? You'll then proceed to learn a great deal about the geometry of R^n, finishing off with the Spectral Theorem. The amount you'll learn in a single semester is frankly incredible. And the fact that you get to learn from Professor Tiozzo makes the class even better. He's a great teacher who's always willing to answer questions, and on the top of that he's a really friendly guy. (One word of caution though - he consistently ends class late, so don't schedule another class that's supposed to start 15 minutes after 230 is supposed to end!) Math 230 was a class like no other; I accomplished far more than I ever believed I was capable of. You'll find yourself thinking more deeply than you've ever thought before. It'll feel like you're exploring uncharted parts of your brain. If nothing else, surviving this class will be a major life achievement.",
    "If you like math and are prepared to put in effort, yeah. Don't take this course if you aren't very interested in math. Period.",
    "I would recommend Math 230 to another student! I would warn them about the time-consuming problem sets, but also reassure them that it is not as bad as they've probably heard, especially because there are many weekly resources to provide help with the psets (office hours and the problem sessions with the TF). I would tell them that rhe content was of varied difficulty, but the proofs were the real fun\/challenge!",
    "It is VERY tough, but if you go to Office Hours, you will survive. I definitely recommend reading the book! I wish I had before the first midterm. I only read it before the second midterm but I understood SO much more because of it.",
    "Math 230 is a highly abstract course covering multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and several other topics. I would recommend it to another student if they already had taken classes in abstract mathematics or if they wanted a rigorous introduction to proof-based abstract mathematics. It is definitely not a \"practical\" course, and as such it is not as useful to engineers or physicists as some other math courses might be.",
    "I would recommend Math 230 because it is an intellectually interesting and rewarding course.",
    "Hard but great if you love math",
    "MATH 230 was an amazing course! Take it if you're interested in proofs and the logic behind higher math. Some multivariate or linear algebra experience might be helpful, but it's not necessary. Find a pset group, and you'll make incredible friends!",
    "Extremely difficult course. The problem sets took around 15 hours a week, however the tests were easier. Be very careful signing up for this course, but the work is rewarding.",
    "If you are interested in learning math and understanding why math is the way it is this is a great course. You learn calculus and linear algebra from the theorems and proofs that underlie the concepts. It is a proof based course, so be prepared for that. The homework is long at times, but it is completely manageable. Overall, it's a great course if you love math.",
    "I highly recommend Math 230 to anyone looking to find out what math is really about. It's an awesome class and extremely rewarding in the end. However you also need to be prepared to put in a lot of extra work in the beginning if you don't have any formal experience with proof writing. If you can put in the time and stick it out you will really like this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has a strong interest in math.",
    "I would highly recommend MATH 230 to any student interested in mathematics. The course is very interesting, engaging, and rewarding.",
    "Math 230 is a challenging, rewarding introduction to college mathematics. You will have to work hard (or give up and go to sleep) every Thursday night. My dad took a lower level of calculus instead and later regretted not having challenged himself. As is often true, the challenge pays off, and when you're not struggling through problem sets, you'll feel very good at math.",
    "Tough but rewarding class",
    "Math 230 is a very fun, very challenging proof-based examination of multivariable calculus and linear algebra. While I was considering classes, I felt daunted by my classmates' math backgrounds: I'd taken IB higher level math, which I had enjoyed, but I'd never studied multivariable calculus or linear algebra. However, I'm very glad I took the class: truthfully, if you have a background in multi or linear, it will probably help you, but if you're willing to work hard, not having a background in those areas doesn't prohibit you from taking the class. I would highly recommend it to anyone who really likes math; it's a great deal of fun, and it teaches you to see math in a new light. That being said, it is a proof-based class, so don't expect any discussion of application. However, in sum, I highly recommend it.",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend MATH 230 01 to another student. The course is very challenging and time consuming, yet simultaneously rewarding. It requires that a student put in a lot of effort, but the amount of math I've learned this semester is incredible. I took this course to challenge myself, and that's exactly what happened. In summary for another student, I'd say that the class is most difficult at the beginning since you don't really learn how to write proofs until you've done them a lot. Office hours are key for succeeding, and all lectures should be attended. Basically, you get out of the course what you put in. If you want to really invest yourself, you'll grow a lot as a mathematician and a student. MATH 230 01 taught me quickly how to do college--it's like jumping into the deep end of a pool, but you'll definitely learn to swim.",
    "Take math 230 if you like math and haven't done proof based math or analysis before. Having done multi before is fine, there's very little overlap.",
    "Math 230 will probably be your hardest class and it is awesome. With an really excellent professor, a study group nearly every day, and an intense personal effort, I was able to meet the challenge of this class and learn an incredible amount; without any one of those three, it would have been very difficult if not impossible. It can absolutely be done straight out of Calc BC, though most of the class will have had a year or more beyond that in high school. If you didnt know how to write a proof beforeand you may be surprised to find that you did notyou will learn how in this class. The problem sets take 10-15 hours per week. Go to office hours, Giulio is a GREAT teacher. The exams are demanding but easier than the problem sets. You do not need to be a math major to take and enjoy this class, but if you do think you might want to be a math major you should not skip it. Take 230 if you want to fully understand the topics, learn how to write proofs, and get to meet and seriously bond with friends who share these interests. You should not take it if youre more interested in applications than proofs or if youre taking several other time-consuming classes.",
    "I would summarize it as a class intended for math majors, and thus rigorous and difficult, but thoroughly enjoyable, and eye-opening. I would recommend it, but only for students who love math.",
    "For many, Math 230 is the first true mathematics course I have taken, in that it presents mathematics as the creative, problem-solving field as it actually is, and not the test subject focusing on mere computation. I have never needed a calculator in this class, because the curriculum reminds us that no calculator can appreciate the supreme beauty of proof and logic that the human mind alone can derive and understand.",
    "A great class for a prospective math major."
