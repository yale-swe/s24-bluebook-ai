    "Yes. Russian combines the logical thought of an inflected language with lots of interesting constructions and ideas. For those interested in philology, or just words in general, Russian is a great language. Russian is especially appealing for classics students, since it's inflected. It's not a simple language like Spanish and yet it is highly logical.",
    "You should definitely continue to take this course! Russian culture is very interesting, and the adventures of Kevin and his Russian friends will make you laugh out loud while learning Russian!",
    "This class takes you through the remaining grammar for the Russian Language. It is fast-paced, but usually manageable. Just make sure you have an hour or two to devote just to Russian. Also, I would review L1 over break, or anytime before you start L2.",
    "If you are interested in a different language, do it. The classes are small and professors amazing.",
    "Russian is a challenging yet approachable and fun language to learn. Background in a language that uses declensions (such as Latin) is helpful but by no means essential. If you're looking to learn a language that is more exciting and different than one of the Romance languages but isn't as difficult as something like Chinese or Arabic, Russian is a great choice.",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes, it is an excellent introduction to the Russian language."
