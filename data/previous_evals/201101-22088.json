    "What an amazing amazing class. First and foremost, Lee Seonsaengnim (Prof. Lee-Smith) is one of the greatest teachers at Yale. Period. Her enthusiasm about the language and her genuine desire to make learning Korean an enjoyable and life-long experience is something that you don't find really anywhere in this world. Her constant efforts to make the classroom environment feel like a family, not just a typical language class, made classes so much more interactive and dynamic that you couldn't, even if you tried, get bored on a day-to-day basis.In terms of workload - you know what you are getting. Your vocabulary, your grammar, tests now and then, vocab quizzes frequently, and of course presentations. Nothing too crazy, but you still have to do the work and keep up because Korean, especially more than other languages, is about self-motivation and persistence. Lee Seonsaengnim will do everything in her power to make the experience enjoyable and fulfilling, but it is ultimately up to you whether you maximize the help of the class.In summary; TAKE THIS CLASS! You seriously will NOT regret it.",
    "Yes because it is a wonderful class. The class size is small and the classmates become close, almost like a family. Professor Lee is both kind and understanding. She is easy to talk to so if one has a problem or needs help, one can turn to turn for help. She really wants students to improve in Korean while enjoying themselves. The class is full of fun and experience.Take it!",
    "I don't think anyone would actually discourage you from taking this course, as it is enjoyable and educational and even practical.",
    "100% recommend if you're thinking about Korean language. Very fun and rewarding course.",
    "Yes. It is a great class to learn intermediate Korean. It helped me develop my speaking skills so much more.",
    "Emphasis on speaking Korean in this course. Compared to L3, L4 Korean begins to open up areas of speech that are necessary for daily activity in Korea. Many more \"real-world\" applications, if you will."
