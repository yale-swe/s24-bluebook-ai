    "I would recommend Perspectives to another student. It is only one problem set every other week, so does not require a lot of time. You will be exposed to some very interesting lectures. More than that though, you will meet people who also like Science and Engineering and these people will most likely have another with you as well.",
    "Perspectives is a low work, highly interesting class for anyone who is interested in learning about all of the sciences. Don't take the course just for the money, if you do then you ruin it for everyone else.",
    "Great lectures but your discussion sections depend on how good your discussion leaders are.",
    "Perspectives alternates between lectures on a wide range of science topics and small discussion sections every other week. I would say the deep discussions not necessarily about the material but the questions asked about science, research and life paths are the most valuable part of the course. All of your work culminates in a self-driven research paper written at the end of the year. It isn't that much work and if you have the time, it is absolutely worth it.",
    "it's an interesting class to take. I would only take this class if you're sure you want to be a science major and are actively interested in science. also if you're planning to do research your freshman summer (which is a good experience), then this class is helpful for the fellowship at the end. there is a substantial paper involved, though",
    "An overview of different science research topics. I would recommend the course for the research opportunities and a chance to learn about science that you might never take a course on.",
    "I took it for the grant money but you still have to apply for the fellowship, although it dramatically increases your chances of getting it. The final paper at the end of the course is very unpleasant though, and it's likely that you can still receive funding without taking this class.",
    "This course introduces you to a lot of different fields in science, so if you love science, definitely take it. You also come out knowing many science students who are willing to talk to you about quantum mechanics and\/or synthetic biology as if they were the weather. However, because of the dispersed lectures and discussions and unscaled grading system, it's easy to lose a sense of importance to the class and eventually you come to think of it as almost an outside, extra-curricular thing and begin to slack-off. So pay attention.",
    "If you are unsure of what you want to do, this gives extremely good exposure of actual scientific research that may be extremely valuable.",
    "Yes. Perspectives in Science and Engineering gives you a close-knit community of awesome STEM students and a better understanding of the STEM fields. The professors invited to lecture in this course design their talks to be fitting to the group, and after just an hour and a half you would have working knowledge of a topic you may have never thought about. It is not a lot of work andcomes with the Freshman Summer Research Fellowship. Take it if you get in!",
    "I would recommend it because it's not a very time consuming course, and you get a lot of information on the different fields of science here at Yale.",
    "Take it if you want exposure to different topics in science and engineering.",
    "This is the second part of a year long course that must be taken the entire year for credit. I said this in the fall but only take this class if you really have no idea what area of research you want to be involved in: physics, chem, bio, biomed, etc. The class is however useful in obtaining funding for the summer research.",
    "Definitely take it just to meet other students interested in the same things. I have made many friends and learned about some random cool science things as well.",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering is a course to take if you are interested in science research but do not know which sciences interest you. It is effective in surveying topics to offer a representation of howstudying a topic could be. Otherwise, it is somewhat interesting as a class but not worth the place it takes up in a schedule. As a student focused on computer science and interested in research--with prior university research experience--I found little of use from what this course had to offer. The aspects of the course that involve research are very brief; unless you are interested in research but have never taken part in any before and are too timid at first to email a professor or two, it is likely easier to arrange research without this class. As it occurred, I made my summer research arrangements during the fall term without facilitation from the class. Professors here are eager to take on undergrads who have the skill and interest necessary for research, either during the term or over the summer. As a last note, it is definitely possible to apply for the grant to which Perspectives students planning research are required to apply (and also possible not to receive the grant even after taking Perspectives and submitting the requirements and proposing an experiment that interests Dean Segraves). To anyone seriously considering this class, I would also advise a freshman course load heavy in science classes. Working to fulfill distributional requirements and taking this class at the same time would be a bad idea, as subjects present on the transcript for the grant application are a factor serious enough to determine the result of the application. In general, I would not recommend this course, since there are better ways to join a lab and to get funding and the lectures and discussions in the class are not as interesting as those in other Yale classes.Lastly, keep in mind that this course is part of a year-long commitment, work is concentrated at the end of the second semester, and the course grants credit but fulfills no major or distributional requirements. It's just another elective.",
    "When I chose to take this class, I very much took into consideration an automatic stipend to do research over the summer and the attainment of credits each semester. We were not told that, as a new policy, we all would have to apply to get non-guaranteed funding. Additionally, credits are awarded retroactively, meaning that your first .5 credit is not awarded until you finish the second .5 credit. I felt locked into the course because I had already invested an entire semester. This is not to say that the lectures weren't interesting and rewarding. It's to say that the purposes of this course were undermined by the changes in policy. That said, I would recommend the course if you want perspectives on science. If you mainly want funding, just know that you will have to apply, but it is more likely that you will get it. Still, this course was useful in revealing to me that I like research and the processes that it entails, but I don't really look to major in science. If you are on the border between science and another major, this course in addition to other science courses would be helpful.",
    "If you know what you want to do, don't take this. If you don't know, take this.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this class ot other students. You can find research other ways and dont need to take it just to find research. It was intersting but you can find this information out by reading papers.",
    "Definitely take this course! Lectures were very diverse and for the most part geared towards an audience without expertise in the field. Discussion sections were great-- you get to chat about cutting edge science with some brilliant freshmen and faculty members.",
    "Perspectives is an awesome class if you have a broad knowledge of the sciences. The lectures are interesting and relavent to modern research. The discussion sections are fun because you are surrounded by passionate students who are just as eager to talk about science and have interesting, well-thought-out points to make. The only disadvantage of this course is that modern research is so complex that only people with a good background in that field will fully understand what is going on (unless the lecturer is very good, which happened somewhat often). As a result, the lectures can be distant enough that one loses focus and not everyone is able to participate in discussion. The same complexity is present in reading journals for the final paper, which can make the paper difficult to research and write. This can be alleviated, however, if one starts early and has a faculty member to answer questions as they arrise.So, to fully enjoy this class, one must know a lot about science, and if he or she does, I absolutely recommend the course.",
    "Absolutely! The second half of PSE is as good, if not better, than the first!. The exploration paper, despite being ridiculously long, is very fun to write and will be a great project for most science-oriented students.",
    "If you love to learn about different fields of science research pursued at Yale, this is a good class to take.",
    "Fun\/easy seminar. Lectures were really interesting - especially David Schatz's lecture - and the discussions were often laid back. The Exploration Paper takes time though, so start early!",
    "SCIE 199 is a good overview of various fields of cutting-edge science. Take this course if you are interested in a wide range of scientific topics. The final paper is a difficult assignment, so be ready to spend time and effort to complete the final paper. Otherwise, the class is very low commitment and a easy half credit (again, be prepared as the final paper decides the actual grade of both semesters of PSE).",
    "It was a pretty good course because it gave you a taste of all the different type of sciences out there. It was really low key and only once a week which was nice. I enjoyed it but I saw it more of a extra class that just gave me a taste of science rather than a true classroom learning experience.",
    "Great course. Great way to learn a little about other fields in science. Great opportunity to meet other students as well.",
    "I really enjoyed perspectives but it is not for everyone. If you know exactly what area you want to go into and don't want to here about anything else the. You would not enjoy this class. However even if you have a vague idea of what you like, but enjoy hearing about other fields this class is very exciting and interesting.",
    "Awesome!",
    "This course was really interesting. I loved being exposed to the cutting-edge research happening in so many scientific fields. For some of the lectures, I had not even known that such a field existed or had any idea what was studied within it, and then my awareness was expanded of what problems remained to be solved and of what we were able to do. It helped strengthen me in my commitment to my own field of interest, as well as providing me with a more interdisciplinary perspective on science as a whole. My discussion section could have been slightly better-- but I heard that other sections may have had more stimulating conversations. In addition, although I may have been able to acquire the Freshman Summer Research Fellowship without having taken Perspectives, I feel that I was aware of more options when choosing my research and that I am far more prepared to make the most of this summer due to the preparation that I did in Perspectives.",
    "I would recommend PSE to students interested in all areas of science, or alternatively, students interested in one area of science who WANT to be interested in many areas (I am the latter). Don't start the paper the day before it's due! It takes longer than you think it will. Also, use your discussion sections as an opportunity to get to know some of Yale's awesome science faculty!",
    "Take it if you want to do research in the summer.",
    "This class is a compilation of lectures from various science and engineering faculty. Quality and your level of interest will vary. If you are interested in many different STEM topics and want an easy half credit class, take this one. Note that summer research is not part of this class, nor is this class necessary in order to get funded for the summer!",
    "Exposes you to a lot of fields in science and math",
    "I would recommend Perspectives to someone who is interested in exploring the different sciences, but more so to someone who is bent on doing research. I can't say how much I really learned from all of the different lectures, as most of the material is very high level and difficult to understand in entirety, but Perspectives gave me the opportunity to do research over the summer, and for that I am very grateful.",
    "Good overview of areas of research that I would not have normally known about. Take it.",
    "Good course. Your discussion section will determine how much you enjoy the course, but my discussion section and leaders were wonderful. Everyone was very enthusiastic about science. Also, you get to meet a lot of your fellow science minded folks at Yale. Workload is a pset every two weeks that vary from simple to very challenging. Get some friends to go over these psets with you.",
    "I loved this class--I got to know some phenomenal professors and hear about cool research. I enjoyed nearly all of the lectures, although I know other people were only interested in their own field of experience.",
    "It's an overview of the different types of research done at Yale - as a freshman science major, it's invaluable. I find myself considering different types of research more closely, and I'm far more aware of where the frontiers of other fields lie. The class teaches you to think of science as a growing, tangled web. Take the class.",
    "Absolutely fantastic course. If you're interested in science research or simply learning more about some of today's cutting edge scientific developments (that are happening right here at Yale), this course is for you. Every other week, an outstanding Yale faculty member is invited to give a talk about their notable scientific achievements, current research projects, and future direction. They also talk about general topics related to being a science researcher such as running a research lab, publishing in journals, and being a professional member of the scientific community.The speakers have ranged from great to phenomenal. Even for subjects that I was not especially interested in, I found thetalks fascinating and engaging. The speakers do a fabulous job to make their research accessible to everyone, but also not sacrifice rigor or skip any important details. It's a genuine pleasure to hear such brilliant scientists give talks, and even if I weren't getting credit for the course, I might still have gone to see many of these professors speak.A large range of scientific fields are represented throughout the course, including Biology, Medicine, Physics, Math, Geology, Astronomy, Chemistry, Engineering, and more. Such diversity definitely enriches the course.In the weeks that PSE doesn't have a guest speaker, the course meets in sections. Each section is lead by two faculty members and serves as a time to discuss the last week's lecture, clarify any questions or curiosities, and think about the research in a broader scientific context. Section is generally very enjoyable and a pleasure to attend.There is a small homework assignment for each lecture, usually consisting entirely of questions whose answer came up at some point in the talk. These assignments are usually straightforward, but can sometimes be difficult. Either way, they don't tend to be all that time consuming.The final paper for the course is a chance to explore any cutting-edge scientific topic you'd like in tremendous depth. I very much enjoyed writing mine, though it is a substantial amount of work. If you pace it out over several days or weeks, writing it will be both enjoyable and low-stress.I would wholeheartedly recommend the course if you're interested in science research or enjoy fascinating talks. It's a fantastic and very unique experience for your freshman year.",
    "Overall, this is a horrible class. This is not a good class. The lectures are extremely complex and there is absolutely no way to get any assistance with the material before the psets are due. Also, the lectures are so different from one another that there is no continuity in the class at all. I found this class incredibly difficult and not rewarding at all. Also the homeworks are not graded with letter grades so I had no idea how I was doing in the class all year. This class ruined my freshman year and is impossible to drop because if you try to drop the class second semester you will get a W on your transcript for the first semester. Think twice before taking this awful class. Additionally, the final paper is ridiculously difficult to write. I pretty much disliked every aspect of this class.",
    "A boring survey of many science labs at Yale. Only take it for the (practically guaranteed) grant money.",
    "I definitely recommend the course for the exposure to a lot of different material you might not have had the chance to see before. Also, the final exploration paper really shows how far you've progressed throughout the course reading research journal articles for the lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSE to a fellow student. It was not an enormous academic commitment, it gives you a credit, and it's a great way to feel like you're on top of the science gameat Yale (assuming that's what you're looking for). They do a pretty good job of getting scientists from a variety of fields to present, and there's a nice sense of solidarity among the 60 students in the course (which is also helpful for recognizing faces of the other science kids). If you're not sure if you're interested in science, it's a really good way to get a better sense of the sciences as disciplines and to see if it's something you want to pursue. No regrets about choosing PSE over freshman seminars.",
    "Same as last semester. If you're really interested in research, it's kind of fun, but by no means necessary. Paper makes the workload heavier, but it's still manageable, and it does help familiarize you with your field if you're doing summer research.",
    "Yes, it is interesting and not a lot of work. I've definitely learned quite a lot about different research fields that I never knew before.",
    "Do not do it if you have simply liked science in high school, but also have a deep passion for the humanities.",
    "Continuation of Perspectives from the fall semester. Pretty much the same format but you have to write an abstract (about 2 pages) near Spring Break and a final paper (about 17-20 pages, 4500-5000 words) at the end. Make sure to get ahead so you have time to finish it. Or if you're really ahead start the paper on Spring Break so you don't have to work at the end :)",
    "This class is amazing. There is a problem set every two weeks and one final paper, which isn't too bad, and the material is some of the most cutting edge research out there. If you have the opportunity to take this class, do it. Best class I've taken.",
    "SCIE 199 is an interesting class that exposes students to different scientific fields that they may or may not have learned about before. For example, I have spent most of my high school career studying biology and chemistry but was introduced to geology and geophysics, chemical engineering (block copolymers), etc. via PSE. If you have a genuine love and invested interest in science, this may be the class for you. Funding for summer research is not guaranteed, but this class will prepare you if you decide to write a proposal for the Freshman Fellowship offered."
