    "Find options for advisors and projects early (it's okay to start at the beginning of the semester, but start at the beginning of the semester). You'll probably want to do the bulk of the work before midterms get too heavy, because you'll probably also have to do a paper or presentation as finals come around.",
    "This your senior project, it is what you make of it.",
    "It is the senior project. I would imagine the experience is very different depending on who your adviser is.",
    "I worked with James Aspnes and thoroughly enjoyed working on my senior project. Our meetings were always productive and I think we were both very satisfied with the final result. If you're interested in doing a more theoretical project and liked his distributed systems course I would highly recommend him as an advisor.",
    "Great opportunity to study any topic of interest. Find your advisor and project topic the semester BEFORE you plan to take this course. IF you do so, you have about 4 extra weeks to actually start working on the project and accomplish all that you want to accomplish in the semester. The more work one does early the easier this course will be. This course is incredibly fun and if you have time, take it again, or spread your project over two semesters to do something more significant!"
