    "I think it would be helpful if we did the readings for each speaker the week before the speaker actually came to visit. I realize that travel is difficult to arrange in the winter, but having the readings and class discussion fresh in our minds would make the visits more valuable. I also thought it was strange that we talked so much about Thomas Berry but never actually read anything by him. I know it's hard to cap courses, but this one was too crowded for a good seminar discussion. The discussion also was not managed well - sometimes people would raise their hands and wait their turn to speak, but others would jump in without doing so. The result was that the most assertive class members often took the floor and left no space for their peers who did not wish to interrupt. As a woman, I felt on more than one occasion that I made a comment that was ignored, only to have the same idea repeated by a male classmate.",
    "It would have been great to have a final class (after our speaker series ended) for synthesis\/reflection."
