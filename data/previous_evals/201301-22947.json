   "comments": [
    "Take it if you need a Sc credit that is interesting. The shlep up Science Hill is not great, but worth it because there is no section. One test, one presentation, six home works and a paper.",
    "A (somewhat) hidden gem - this class is wonderful. This class is extremely accessible to science majors, but is still interesting for those who are interested in the details of resource sustainability. The teacher is a clear and engaging lecture, while the TAs have great personalities and are quite knowledgeable. The only downsides may be that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get into the class as more people learn about it, and the book is basically useless and absurdly overpriced. To put this class into perspective: this was my last afternoon class on Tuesday and Thursday on science hill, and I never considered skipping. There are 6 or 7 moderately easy problem sets, a midterm of essay questions (he gives out 15-20 questions beforehand, and he chooses 10), a group presentation (each person is graded individually), and a 10-20 page paper on that same subject. Definitely a must take if you need a science credit and\/or are interested in the topics.",
    "Great, covered a lot of material, came out with a comprehensive understanding of issues. Professor is accessible and passionate about material, and gives realistic explanations and evaluations of renewable energies.",
    "Please take this class if you are going to work in policy, finance, or any position that makes executive decisions regarding natural resources. This class will remove all emotion and politics for issues of sustainability and teach you how to make useful calculations. Do you know how much wind power is available on Earth? Do you know how to calculate if 100% of that energy could power human activity? If you are interested in sustainability, you should know.",
    "Great material. Caring professor. Fun field trips.",
    "Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh",
    "Great science credit but great class in general. Take it! Work load is not that heavy.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a relaxed but informative science class. I felt like I learned a ton but was not stressed out.",
    "A general overview of energy and resource issues (but mostly energy). Not very difficult but you stand to learn a lot if this topic is new to you. If you have taken other G&G courses and\/or are informed about energy it may be a lot of repeat and not worth taking.",
    "If you're just looking for a gut, don't take it- not worth it",
    "Warning: this is NOT a gut. I've taken both chem and math here (I took this class for my major, not for my distributional requirement) and the psets in this class take longer tea any of the other classes I have ever taken. They're tedious and long and the grading on them are entirely too anal.",
    "The class is the title. If you're interested in such a topic then take it; there is no reason not to.",
    "A very interesting class. The workload was nice. One midterm, 6-7 p-sets, a final presentation and then a final paper, the topic of which is a more in-depth look at your presentation topic. Also, it was an afternoon class, and I don't think that's going to change, so no need to wake up early. This all contributed to making it very agreeable.",
    "Two 75 min lectures\/week, a pset every other week, a midterm for which you get the questions in advance, and a final presentation and paper. The psets vary a lot in difficulty, and there's a lot of freedom with the presentation and paper but it's still hard. I would recommend it, although be warned that it isn't exactly a walk in the park!",
    "Take GG 205 if you are a non-science major. If you are interested in energy, GG 274 and GG 275 are much better alternatives.",
    "Do not take it, find another Sc credit",
    "Very good as a science credit. The psets some times take a long time but in general the class doesn't have too much work and you learn a useful, manageable amount of information about energy and strategic natural resources. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Great class to get a basic understanding of renewable energy. The psets focus on real life applications of alternative energy - very interesting stuff.",
    "I would recommend this to a student looking to learn something about the topic and not necessarily somebody who was passionate about the material and science. I found myself wanting more from the course and couldn't bring myself to give a full effort.",
    "This was an awesome class! Great survey of energy technologies and issues concerning our energy and natural resource future."
