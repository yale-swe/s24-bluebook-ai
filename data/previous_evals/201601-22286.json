    "Great class, you learn a lot from paper discussions, allows you to read papers critically and evaluate experiments in depth.",

    "Discussion course where every week we review a cell biology paper (often a very recent one) in detail and analyze it critically. It's not a lot of work and a very enjoyable class. The discussions are great. Would recommend.",
    "It's a great class to learn about different things that labs do and it's a great way to get yourself a good understanding on the kinds of experiments that all different labs do.",
    "Weekly papers (usually two at a time) that require close annotation and analysis. Every few weeks, you will be responsible for presenting the week's paper with a partner. Weekly summary writeups of the papers."

    "Since I joined a lab in the Cell Biology Department, this course was very helpful in diversifying my knowledge of cell biology.",
    "I feel a lot more perceptive when reviewing papers and have a better appreciation for well-designed and well-presented figures.",
    "It has helped me think of different possible experiments and helped to understand and approach the work of other papers.",
    "Understanding how to read primary literature, exposure to topics of cellular mechanisms that are used in a wide variety of research as basic background."
