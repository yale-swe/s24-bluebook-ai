    "I learned a great deal about Vico's early texts which I had never engaged with previously.",
    "By taking this course, I learned how to approach, read, and interpret a philosophical text. It helped me to analyze arguments in a philosophical context and it has been extremely important in order to enhance my research methodology."

   "comments": [
    "I believe that students could have been more encouraged to take some initiative in leading the class. As I have heard, some seminars require that students present sections of the required text, etc. One thing I believe this class lacked was the sense of a seminar with back and forth dialogues. Nevertheless, the professor's breadth of knowledge in the subject made the class immensely worthwhile and enjoyable.",
    "Occasionally there was some confusion about what texts we were covering that week.",
    "The main strength of this course has been the presence of Professor Mazzotta, who helped me to improve my critical thinking. He has guided us in the reading and studying of Vico's texts through an interdisciplinary approach. I found very helpful the reading and the analysis of the texts. I found the organization of the single classes very useful and well done. In particular, the reading and the analysis of the texts, both condudcted in class under Professor Mazzotta's supervision, have been very valuable; in this way, I had the opportunity to re-think and clarify to myself some specific concepts. This approach has been very useful also becasue Professor Mazzotta has guided us in the reading through a selection of passages from the texts that had a pivotal importance for the topic discussed in class. I found extremely useful our last class, in which students had the opportunity to present orally their ideas for the term papers. Each student has received a comment both from the colleagues and from the instructor. It has been a very important moment in which I had the opportunity to clarify the topic for my final paper."

    "This course was excellent and not only gave us a deep insight into Vico and his thought, but also the surrounding intellectual context, which is essential to any insightful study of Vico.",
    "Yes, provided that they are interested in anything Italian or anything that is relevant to modern day education and\/or the discourse between the arts and the sciences.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! because it is a very interesting and valuable course. This course should be taken not only to learn Vico's poetic philosophy, but also for the numerous literary, historical, and philosophical digressions provided by the instructor, that made the course itself a place to learn much more than what is written in Vico's texts."
