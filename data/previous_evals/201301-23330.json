   "comments": [
    "Take this course. You won't regret it.",
    "Take it! But only if you're prepared to read about 3000 pages this semester: the general pace is a (long) book every two weeks. There will be times where you bitterly resent the fact that James Joyce ever existed, but it's totally worth it in the end. I particularly recommend Stefanie Markovits' section, as she's a great teacher and a really cool human being. She also doesn't try to have you read Infinite Jest in two weeks, like some professors.",
    "English 130 is a very reading heavy course, which requires commitment and a good work ethic. I am very glad that I took it, and would recommend it to any student seeking to take an interesting English course. It is not a course that should be taken if you are seeking an easy writing credit; Epic is a course that a student must very much WANT to take, or the reading will quickly become quite burdensome.",
    "Only take if you are willing to either dedicate most of your time to this class's readings or accept that there will be times when you won't complete all of the reading before class. If you can do one of those two things, absolutely take the class - you will emerge with a rich understanding of Epics' influence on modern literature and will strengthen your writing skills immensely.",
    "If you love to read a lot and love writing take it for sure",
    "This is the epitome of a good Yale course. Professor Markovits was excellent\u00e2\u0080\u0094brilliant, and a wonderful discussion leader. I actually looked forward to discussing the works, and I learned more about the Odyssey in one day of discussion in this course than in all the time I read it in high school. As has often been said, these are all really good books that you should read before your graduate, to be culturally literate. As the course moves on, and the syllabus transitions to great novels, the reading for this class becomes a welcome respite rather than a chore: you can lie in bed, perhaps eating some chocolate or drinking some wine, while reading a really great book, and you needn't feel guilty\u00e2\u0080\u0094because you're doing your homework!",
    "This class is actually epic. You will do an outrageous amount of reading, but it is so, so worth it. Professor Markovits is one of the best teachers I've ever had, and all the books you read are books you should read before graduating; that being said, it's quite easy to fall behind on reading. As someone who is not an English major, I would still wholeheartedly recommend this course, but make sure you can keep up with the reading (it ends up being ~70-100 pages per class depending on the book). If you can, you'll get a phenomenal experience in perhaps the best intro English course at Yale.",
    "A lot of reading , worthwhile"
