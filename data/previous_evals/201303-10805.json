   "comments": [
    "Very well organized and structured. Covers a variety of topics in recent Chinese newspapers and media, with a focus near the end of the class on homosexuality and tolerance. Zhou laoshi is a very sweet man who emphasizes structure and phrases, and he is also very lenient on turning in assignments late. Great class to take if you are interested in learning how to read a Chinese newspaper or online article.",
    "Chinese Media and Society is one of a few advanced Mandarin courses at Yale, but it is also one of the best. The professor, Zhou laoshi, is invested in his students' success, and works hard to ensure that the content provided is both logical and well-organized. There is a greater emphasis than in lower level courses on speaking\/writing than merely memorizing characters. Highly recommended.",
    "Zhou Laoshi is amazing!",
    "Yes, take it if you want an easy language credit",
    "If you're interested in learning about issues in Chinese society, I'd definitely recommend taking this course. If you're only seeking to improve your language ability, I'd think about taking another Chinese course. While you do learn some useful vocabulary, this class focuses much more on applying your language skills to read about course material rather than actively working to improve your language skills.",
    "Great class, awesome teacher! Take it!",
    "Yes! Take this class. It's actually interesting.",
    "Great class! Take it. It will teach you all about China from the Chinese perspective, actually reading Chinese articles and watching news reports. It also teaches you to read and write more formal Chinese. It's a lot of work (750 word essays, 4-8 page articles with 40-50 vocab words per class, 2 presentations, exams, etc) but Zhou laoshi is very reasonable and the grading is fair. Basically, you just get to sit around and talk and learn about cool topics in China today, all while improving your Chinese.",
    "This class is a wonderful escapade in learning about Chinese media and contemporary society. It was the first time I took a Chinese class where I didn't feel like I was just memorizing words from a textbook; I was reading actual news articles! I really felt like I learned a lot of Chinese in this course: at the beginning of the semester, we watched a news broadcast that I literally did not understand a word of and when I watched it again, I understood all of it.The workload for the class is manageable. We had two in class oral presentations that I thought would be dreadful, but it because we got to pick our own topics, it was amazing seeing and learning about things that other students in the class were passionate about. Professor Zhou is verydiligent and passionate about teaching his students and wants to see you succeed.",
    "Zhou Laoshi is the best! I was initially worried about the workload in this class, but it turned out to be very manageable, while still challenging enough so that my Chinese skills actually improved. A wonderful class-- Zhou Laoshi is organized, kind, encouraging, prompt, and genuinely cares about his students.",
    "A truly worthwhile and interesting class to take. If you are interested in learning about a broad range of modern Chinese issues, developing your language skills, developing formal writing skills and getting a chance to learn about China and Chinese in an interesting manner I would highly recommend this course."
