    "Highly recommend it, it was a very good course covering important topics.",
    "Math 525 provides an introduction to the main structures and theorems of functional analysis. I would recommend it to another student because I found it very interesting.",
    "One improvement is recommending a more elementary textbook. Conway was good for Hilbert spaces, Compact operators, and the first part of Banach spaces. I didn't really like Zimmer so much.There is a phenomenal book by S. David Promislow called \"A First Course in Functional Analysis.\" It has great intuitive explanations, clear and well-written proofs and is similar to the treatment of the subject by Prof. Minsky.",
    "I would recommend Math 525 to any student interested in learning Functional Analysis -- whether a math grad student or not. It is definitely important to know measure theory decently well. Complex analysis just came in a little at the end and I think you could get by without prior exposure to that, as long as you could work competently with complex numbers and power series (which doesn't take too long to grasp). Anyway, all that said -- a really great course! I highly recommend taking it, especially if Prof. Minsky is teaching it again. There was lots of homework, but none of it was unreasonable. Actually it was just right."

   "comments": [
    "Really helped understand, Hilbert, Banach spaces, weak topology, convexity, and the spectral theorem!",
    "I'm not at the dissertation level yet, so I can't answer the latter part. However, I feel that it definitely deepened my knowledge of analysis and of mathematics. Since I'm interested in differential geometry -- and hence in PDE -- the material will be very relevant, and I think I got a good preparation in it here."
