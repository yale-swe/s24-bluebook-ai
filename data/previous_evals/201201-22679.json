   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Take this if you can get in (mainly seniors). Great material, doable workload.",
    "Give speeches, read speeches, learn proper rhetoric, learn the tools behind the speech",
    "Take it. Not too taxing. Practical experience. Nice seminar for senior year.",
    "Take this class-- don't have to do any reading and the speech giving opportunity is totally worth it. Not a lot of work for a great experience.",
    "You're not going to get into this class if you're not a senior, and you're certainly not guaranteed to get in even ifyou're a senior, but if you do get in you should definitely take this class! It's part lecture, part public-speaking workshop, and all great. The format of the class both allows us to benefit from Professor Hill's wisdom and allows us to bond as a class and benefit from the useful advice of our fellow classmates as we critique each other's speeches. You don't have to do most of the readings, since Professor Hill goes through what he wants you to take out of them in class\u0096\u0096but you should read them, because they are often examples of great oratory from which you can learn quite a lot. You have to give three speeches: a speech that someone in history has given, an introduction to a specific day's readings, and a final speech on a topic of your own choosing. You have to write the latter two speeches yourself, although unfortunately you don't get much guidance on how to actually go about writing a speech, except for seeing the examples from the readings and trying to pick up on the things that Hill mentions in class. There's also a midterm exam on things from the first half of the course (so take very good notes for the first half!), and some on-the-spot writing and speaking assignments every once in a while in class. This course is a great way for second-semester seniors to gain public speaking and writing skills that will be useful for any career, while also giving us a series of Life Lessons with Charles Hill.",
    "Yes, take it! If you can get it...",
    "Take definitely if you can get in. Really relaxed, perfect senior class",
    "Survey course on oratory.",
    "One of the few courses at Yale in which you learn skills that will immediately help you in the real world.",
    "\"Oratory in Statecraft\" is a course to take if you want to learn to think better on your feet, learn how to write and deliver much better speeches, and learn the considerations necessary when going into the political scene. It was a very interesting course and I would highly recommend it. However, make sure to do the readings and spend enough time on your speeches if you want to get the most out of this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Greta course as a second semester senior. Work load is very manageable and you take away so much from the class. You learn a lot from your peers and their experiences, and their critiques of your speaking. Charles Hill is a great professor who presents his knowledge in a simple and eloquent way.",
    "A weird and terrific class that resembles sometimes an acting seminar, as it concentrates primarily on students delivering and workshopping speeches. It also includes brilliant exegesis by Prof. Hill of historical examples of oratory and rhetoric, and discussion and analysis of contemporary politics and phenomena. It's a lot of fun to take as a senior wanting an interesting elective with very little homework. Be prepared to give speeches boldly and be critiqued recklessly by classmates and have random government-memo type assignments thrown at you by Hill.",
    "Read, write, and perform great speeches.It is excellent and interesting.Do the readings; it is easy to not do them but you will miss out if you don't.",
    "Must-take if you can get in. Don't be intimidated by the well-spoken, well-dressed people."
