   "comments": [
    "This is a great class. If you love children's stories, you will look forward to every class and assignment. Be creative and release your inner child!",
    "Great syllabus. Really fun reading that spurs really interesting discussions. Amazing project opportunities.",
    "If you are interested in children's literature, take this course! The reading list is great and discussions are wonderful. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "What other class lets you read Where the Wild Things are and Babar? I loved revisiting my childhood and doing the creative projects, so if you are an aspiring writer\/illustrator\/performer, or just a lover of children's literature, you should take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you can take it.",
    "It's difficult for non-majors to get in this class, but if you do, absolutely take it.",
    "If you're interested in children's literature, especially from a writer's perspective, this class is a great learning opportunity. It is not a gut, however. The reading adds up fast, and although it's all worthwhile it's not something you can easily skip.",
    "Great course--lots of wonderful books and the chance to do creative projects etc. This is not a gut by any means. Professor Stepto is wonderful but a very, very hard grader. IF you put thetime in on your projects, you will do well, but if you don't want to do that, don't bother with this course.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. The creative assignments are a ton of fun to write (even for non-writers like me), the books are easy and universally awesome, and the discussion is really interesting. Some of the secondary reading is really boring but you can get away with skimming it. This class brings me so much nostalgia for my childhood, but actually had a ton of valid academic material and opportunities for thought provoking discussion.",
    "Read the books of your childhood and learn to analyze them from both a child's and an adult's perspective! I would recommend this class if you're interested in children's lit. or children's psychology. I'm interested in both so despite any caveats, I'm still glad I took this class. Beware though: one of your favorite childhood books may be maligned, and that can be devastating! (The class on Little Women nearly broke my heart.) Also, the workload is very different from most other English classes. Be prepared to use your creativity a whole lot more than usual.",
    "Fun to read the kids books and usually a nice group of kids who are excited to be in class. Not a lot of profound insights to be gained, though, and definitely a bunch of work. Also, be prepared, a lot of the assignments are creative, not analytical, so if you aren't interested in putting serious work into a creative assignment, it may not be for you.",
    "This is a very interesting class, looking at books that are often categorized as children's literature. The reading list is great, with a good variety of books, some you've probably read before and some you haven't. Even though it is a children's literature class, there is a lot of reading, and it often takes longer than you expect.The discussion is interesting, focusing on the books and how they are written for children, whether they are appropriate for children, and themes that run through children's literature. The frustrating thing about the class is that Professor Stepto often has very strong opinions about the books, and runs class discussion as though there is a \"right answer\" to her questions, somthing that is very difficult to endure in an English class. However, it may have bothered me more than it bothered the rest of the class.The assignments are really flexible: one creative and one critical assignment during the semester, and a final project that is either creative or critical. The due dates for the semester assignments were based on which book you chose to write on. Assignments were due before we discussed that book in class, which again I found frustrating. There was also a fun group presentation on one of the books during the semester, which was pretty low key, though some people did make elaborate puppets.As with many English classes, how much you enjoy the class also depends on your classmates. Especially when so many of us have read some of the books before, the makeup of the class really affects the discussion. If you are interested in the class, it makes sense to shop it, but make sure it's you're style before you take it.",
    "THINK TWICE. LOTS OF WORK AND NOT AS MUCH FUN FUN FUN AS YOU THINK.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. I found it really interesting to take a second look at books that had meant a lot to me as a child and discuss them in an academic setting."
