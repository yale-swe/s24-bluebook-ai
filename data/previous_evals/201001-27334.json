   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about Iranian history, things I had no idea about beforehand. Some of the material is a little bit dry, and seminar wasn't always thrilling. But I really enjoyed some of the conversations I had, the books i read, the papers I wrote. If you're interested in the Middle East, go for it.",
    "History 349J is a good course. I came in with with minimal background, and I left with a fine overview of Iran and its greater region over the past two centuries. The only problem I had was that the reading was far too heavy, and I felt that no one could feasibly complete it on a week-to-week basis. That being said, Prof. Amanat is kind, understanding, and his depth of knowledge and passion are unmistakable. The term paper is very open-ended and allows you to pursue whatever interests you most. Shop it, carefully review the syllabus, and see if you think it suits you.",
    "The readings for this course were varied and interesting, and the era in Iranian history is fascinating. I enjoyed this class although class discussion was slow at times. I would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "This is a FANTASTIC class on modern Iran and its neighbors. I highly recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in what is going on in Iraq and Afghanistan today!The course focuses on Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan and the imperial powers that have struggled for control of them (Russia, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States) from the early 19th century to the present day. The class is a perfect blend of cultural history and grand strategy, never focusing too much or too little on the impact of politics, economics, or culture on the lives of the population of these countries. Professor Amanat is agreat teacher, and his tendency to lecture in the seminar is definitely beneficial.There isn't too much writing required (15-20 page final paper and a couple of book reviews) but the reading is VERY heavy, so be prepared to skim. If you put in enough time though, the class will certainly pay off.",
    "Good rest of the world seminar."
