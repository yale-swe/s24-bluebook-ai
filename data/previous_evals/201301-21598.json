    "Skip this class for sure. Section is 75 minutes long, the professors are poor lecturers, and the location is really inconvenient. Every week, there is either a quiz or a paper, and then there's an in-class midterm and final. There are much more interesting and well-taught science classes at Yale than this one - take one of those instead.",
    "This class was not fun. It's a lot of material. It's not well taught. It's dull. It's not worth your time.",
    "yes i liked it.",
    "I would recommend it because I learn a lot of important concepts. I also improved at reading scientific papers, which is awesome.",
    "There's a lot of material in this class, and it's covered quickly. I didn't take the intro bio sequence, nor did I take AP bio in high school, and I was completely fine in this class. (I had already taken orgo though.) The professors really encourage questions during lecture, and are willing to explain things as many times as necessary.",
    "If you plan on taking Cell Bio, skip this class. This was my worst class in a long time, it's just tedious and not particularly enriching. Everything you need to know about molecular biology you learn in cell, and so a lot of the information in class seems relatively unimportant. (minute details about the name of enzymes in comparison to big ideas). Farren is pretty awful and his exams are not particularly fair or understandable. He's an overall pretty nice guy, but I'd avoid this class just because his information is difficult to chew while not being fundamentally difficult and his exams are hard and worth half the grade. Pyle is better with much more straightforward exams, if it was only her teaching the class would be much easier. The lectures are too long, and I think it's illegal to have an hour and 15 min sections, but they do that. The research papers are difficult to grasp while the actual material just seems superfluous. While Genetics is also terrible, if you're choosing between those two, it seems like the lesser evil. MoBio is boring and it's near impossible to enjoy the material unless you're studying it by yourself. Also the kids in the class are the science versions of section assholes this year, not sure if that trend will continue. Do yourself a favor and skip this.",
    "MCDB 200 is a course on the details of DNA and RNA replication, regulation, transcription and translation. It involves a lot of reading and memorization, so you should be ready to commit a fair amount of time to it. every week there are questions on a research paper and on the other weeks there are quizzes which basically involve memorizing all of the slides. The midterm and final were fairly difficult and involve a lot of memorization.",
    "It's a good class. I took it because I placed out of the intro bio sequence and needed bio (I'll also be an mcdb major but that's mostly because I'll fulfill most of the requirements anyway). The lectures are good\/engaging but the reading is heavy and boring. I didn't really do much of it and then paid (particularly on Isaac's exam) for not memorizing stuff.",
    "Pretty straightforward class. As a sophomore, it was my first bio class since AP BIO (junior year of high school). Despite this, it was quite doable. Exam\/quiz material is drawn from the power points so you don't need to worry about studying the entire book. Isaacs and Pyle are both OK lecturers. You'll definitely learn a lot about molecular biology (DNA, RNA, proteins, and everything in between).",
    "Yes! One of my favorite classes at Yale. Perfect pace to learn the material with great professors.",
    "This is a decent bio class. You walk away with a good understanding of molecular biology, but the class tends to be reading heavy, and the papers read for assignments tended to be quite difficult. If you stay on top of the work, however, you'll do fine with the curve. If you have to take it, you'll be fine, it's just not an amazingly interesting class.",
    "Basically a review of DNA replication, transcription and translation. Better than genetics (I started taking that and decided to take this instead). There are only two exams and weekly quizzes\/study questions that aren't hard, but Pyle's quizzes\/study questions\/exams are poorly written. Farren's slides are great. Section is useless but you have to go.",
    "I thought I liked molecular biology, but I found the class uninspiring. It's gone through a lot of changes the past few years, but I think it will get better. Professor Isaacs and Pyle are good, but the curriculum they work with needs improvement. Lectures are long, each slide has a ton of detail, and it is hard to stay focused.Sections were 70 minutes this year, and we would go over literature that did not improve our understanding of class concepts. The tests are generally pretty broad (with some exceptions), which is in contrast with how detailed some slides are. Although I feel like I have a general understanding over the topics we discussed, the class experience did not leave me satisfied.",
    "Mostly covers the mechanics of genetics. Instead of talking much about the genetic code, the effect of mutations, etc., it explains the physical processes for things such as transcription, translation, mutations, editing, etc."
