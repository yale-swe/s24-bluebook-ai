   "comments": [
    "I finally learned to speak Korean in full sentences!! After many semesters of struggling, I think this course helped me finally consolidate all the different vocabulary and grammar that I could not put together before, and taught me a lot of new grammar and vocabulary. More than anything, I think I learned a lot about how to actually conversationally speak in Korean in front of others and understand what others are saying to me.",
    "I improved my speaking skills and learned more natural ways of conducting conversations as well as cultural elements.",
    "I learned to speak fluently about a wide range of topics and we often had stimulating class debates about contentious issues that helped to expand our vocabulary base and pushed us to use new sentence structures.",
    "Intermediate debating and discussing skills",
    "Improved my verbal communication skills and can now follow and argument\/ contribute to one.",
    "More development of korean skills, especially speaking, often in a casual and debate context.",
    "I gained a very wide grammar base and the ability to debate\/discuss intermediate\/advanced topics.",
    "My conversational\/spoken Korean became much better. I'd say this class was comparable to about 3\/4 of a semester of Light, which is really impressive given that it is not (and cannot be) anywhere near as intensive.",
    "Evaluating this course is tough because the skills and knowledge needed for this course very much depended on L3, and I did not agree with how L3 was taught. This is not 's fault, but I think this course would be more effective after changing the L3 curriculum."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course was how relevant it was to student's interests, the professor really went out of the way to accommodate K-Pop songs we liked, interests of ours, as well as political issues that we wanted to talk about. We really got a good opportunity to articulate our opinions, and learn Korean speaking and listening through the behaviors of others. In terms of weaknesses\/how it could be improved, it could have benefitted from a bit more structure towards the end. We also noticed, as we were practicing, that we were missing a lot of vocabulary, and she would write it on the board for us to write down, but I would rather her have gathered the necessary vocabulary we kept not knowing and tested us on that instead of the kind of random\/not as useful vocabulary in the textbook (the professor actually did do this a few times, with words like \"knowledge\" and \"conceptually\" and \"personally\" which were really helpful in discussion settings). More of that would be helpful!!",
    "The speaking practice is great. In previous levels there was a lack of a lot of speaking, but this class made up for it.",
    "The strengths are that you get to improve your language skills in a low-pressure environment since the material was very manageable and the professor was extremely kind and helpful in explaining new topics. Because it was primarily discussion based, there was no central textbook used so we would rely mostly on handouts and class notes, which is not necessarily a weak point but is something that was different from previous semesters of Korean.",
    "A lot of focus on speaking practice which was really great. It was easy to forget the grammar points if we didn't practice them a lot.",
    "Felt less structured than L2 and L3 - it would have been helpful if we had vocab lists for each debate to reinforce what we were doing in class. At times, it just felt like I was learning random words for the sake of one debate and would forget them later.",
    "Lee SSN is always wonderful I really enjoyed the weekly Cook n Talk language tables! However, and this may be a Korean program-specific experience or not, but the pace of Korean at Yale is incredibly disjunct from the pace of the Light Fellowship programs over the summer. It was really difficult to feel and stay engaged after having learned Korean over the summer, and much of what we learned in L3 and L4 was just review.",
    "Lee Ssn. continues to be really encouraging and fun, so even with our 9:25 class, I felt awake and engaged. Class atmosphere is pretty relaxed, and I looked forward to going every day. Coursework as well isn't as heavy as previous semesters.",
    "Strengths include the amazing professor, weaknesses are that the course is slow paced at times, but that is counterbalanced by the strength that the course material flows based on student input and student understanding.",
    "At least this semester, the class was almost entirely composed of previous Light Fellows, so most all of us were on a similar level which was great. proved once again to be one of the best professors at Yale and the best language professor in the world. Her lessons are tailor-made by the week, if not the day, to respond to student feedback and questions from previous classes; she has the incredible ability to turn one question into an entire day's curriculum. We focused on speaking and listening and I could definitely feel myself learning a lot and gaining confidence in my speaking ability; each week we had at least one class set aside for debate\/discussion, which was a consistently good learning experience. The only frustrating thing that jumps to mind is that we had to buy a textbook for class which we only used a few times; I wish either we had used it more or didn't have to buy it (preferably the former). The class has a low workload; I don't think it would be too much to ask for more homework each day from the book to expand vocab etc.",

    "Yes, Korean is an amazing and rewarding language.",
    "Yes, if you would like speaking practice.",
    "Yes, if you really want to continue korean! The most enjoyable semester of korean so far, imo, and if you have friends in that class as well it's a really fun way to speak and have fun while also developing language skills.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course!",
    "Yes! If you can continue taking Korean at Yale, definitely do so. The Korean program and have been by far a highlight of my experience here.",
