    "How to best analyze research articles",
    "I really did not know much about economic history prior to this course. I especially learned a lot about the Industrial Revolution and the changes that characterized it.",
    "For me it was a first experience with papers in the economic history literature - and I learned how researches in this field approach questions and try to answer them. I learned a lot about the industrial revolution and the context in which it took place. As a student interested in growth theory, the course gave me a lot of insights that I incorporated to my research ideas, enlightening my view on macroeconomics, its possibilities and limitations. I believe every class in this course provided very valuable learning opportunities for students, going from the specific historical facts and context being considered to deep questions posed by them for the economics science and for our understanding of the past. The classes were very motivating. One of the best courses I have done in the graduate program."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: professor really cares about the course, he always comes really prepared for the class and it engages the students in productivity discussions. Respect differences. Weakness: order of the papers are not super helpful. The course could also benefit from a first class placing the topics that will be discussed.",
    "This was a fascinating introduction to the field of economic history. It's a great part of the first year PhD program.",
    "Awesome class. Tim talks quite fast, which made many important points in lecture difficult to follow at times. (Maybe lecture notes\/outlines could be helpful for this?)",
    "Tim is an engaging lecturer and he interacts a lot with the class. I also enjoyed the readings every week. I sometimes wished there were more materials (detailed slides or notes) on the subject matter covered in lecture.",
    "The course was one of the best courses I have done in the graduate program. I believe the way each class was organized was so great: we were asked to read some key papers (very well selected) in advance, and then in the lecturer Professor Guinnane, explained the general context and important details of the topic, encouraged students to participate and raised important questions to guide the discussions. This combination was amazing. Moreover, I think all the lectures remarkably combined attention with specific details related to the topic with more general issues on that same topic, sometimes even shedding light on hypothesis and underlying assumptions of other areas of economics. The short-paper assignment was also great since it made us dive into some key papers and were followed by an excellent feedback from the professor. As a minor suggestion, I think the professor could make more explicit the linkages between the lectures: why the topic of lecture x came after the topic in lecture x-1 and before x+1, or how are the topics discussed in different lectures connected (or not) with each other."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I was seldom bored during lecture, which can't be said for any of my other classes.",
    "Definitely! It was really interesting and eye-opening, and I think Tim does a great job of making the material exciting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I think the topics covered are very relevant and every graduate student should have a good sense of them. Moreover, this course not only covers the details of each topic, but it also sheds light on bigger questions - many of which are connected to other areas of economics, i.e., the course has a remarkable spillover to other areas of research. It made me raise new questions and insights about my particular area of interest (macroeconomics\/development) - and, like me, I believe students from different areas can benefit a lot from this course."
