   "comments": [
    "Yawn. Most boring class ever. It's not actively bad, just annoyingly slow -- take it iff you want to go farther in the subject and this is your only option to do so, and be prepared for nonsensical midterms that never get graded and lectures that aren't worth coming to.",
    "The material is rather easy, if you think at all that maybe you should be in a higher-level course, then you probably should be. With that said, it's interesting stuff, and it's nice having a course that isn't very difficult on the schedule.",
    "I would have said this course was easy, but the final was legitimately very challenging. That said, presentation of the material and the homeworks and midterm gave no indication that we would be expected to do such a difficult final. The material was interesting but the pace is slow and the number of people in the class who are terrible at math and get hung up on little things rather than concepts was frustrating. Take it if you want a really easy class to count towards a math major.",
    "Only if you are Econ+Math or Math.",
    "Can be difficult. Don't take the class lightly.",
    "Stat 241 is a great course for anyone interested in probability, or who wants to get a more in-depth understanding of the mechanics of statistics. Although the concepts are not always easy to grasp, it is a very fulfilling class and really helps you learn a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "I recommend this course if you are a strong mathematics student with a serious interest in Probability. The course starts out very easy, but gets rigorous after the first midterm. Prof. Madiman is a good, approachable lecturer. But don't take this class expecting it to be an easy math credit-there is real math to be done in probability.",
    "This is a fun course that gets much harder as the semester progresses. Professor Madiman is a great teacher, too. If you go to TA sections, you can get any questions that you have on the homework cleared up or just listen to others' questions to make the homework a little bit less puzzling.",
    "Useful, but poorly explained. maths heavy",
    "Math 241 seems like a standard introduction to probability course. It does not move too fast, but you learn a lot over the course of the semester.Yes, I would recommend it. The material is very useful. The problem sets are hard, but doable, and they help you to learn the material.",
    "Well taught. Required either way for most.",
    "If you have to take this class as a requirement, take it with Madiman. He was as fun as the topics allowed him to be, engaging and very comfortable with the material. Explanations were lucid and his teaching style meant that you won't want to miss a single lecture as they're much more helpful than the textbook. Madiman also made himself very available and is open to taking any questions during lecture. Only, don't let the midterms and the problem sets fool you--the final is much harder than the rest of the course leads you to believe. Great class overall.",
    "I would recommend the class for someone looking to take higher level stats classes, but it's not something you should take if you're just dabbling.",
    "I would recommend this class to you if you have to take it. You definitely learn the intro material well, but there's not a lot of material. It's very easy at the beginning, for 80% of the course, but then it suddenly picks up and becomes difficult at the end. This catches everyone off guard. So be careful!",
    "Take it.",
    "It's a good introduction to probability, and it's a prerequisite for many other courses. Prof. Madiman is pretty good--he definitely seems concerned with making sure students understand the material and explains things until he thinks everyone understands it. (However, if you get the material quickly, you might find the lectures painfully boring.) The workload is pretty manageable, with problem sets usually under 6 hours, but be careful: they get much harder near the end. If you took AP Statistics and\/or IB Higher Level Math, much of the course will seem like a review, but don't let your guard down.",
    "It is not an easy ride!!!!! If you need to take it, then take it, but don't be fooled into thinking its an easy class, you'll have to work hard it.",
    "Decent introduction to probability, more focused on problem-solving than proofs. Prof. Madiman is very clear and a nice guy.",
    "The class material can be dry at times and after an entire term and the entire text book, for some reason I still feel like I haven't learnt much. The professor is great though, and he tries really hard to explain everything again and again until people understand, but it is hard teaching a 9am class three times a week so the class is quite unresponsive, which makes class boring and lethargic. It's still an interesting and useful class, and I'm glad I took it.",
    "Take it - the material is interesting and the class is well taught.",
    "This class starts with very, very basic material, but be warned that it gets a lot more difficult in the middle; the sixth pset easily took me five times as long as previous ones, and it was not expected. Professor Madiman is a great teacher and always willing to help you outside of class. I would recommend this class to someone interested in learning some basic statistical\/probability skills. The tests are not very hard, but some of the later psets are tough."
