   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you're looking for an English class that is not as writing heavy but still requires a lot of reading. In terms of the content itself, Professor Williams picks a lot of fascinating stories that you've probably never heard of, but because it's English 127, there's Moby Dick.In terms of the professor, Williams is a great guy. Enthusiastic, charismatic, and instrumental (he's part of Faded Paper Figures, look them up on Spotify). The thing you should watch out for is that he very much favors a lecture style of class, and occasionally hooks up a computer or iPad to the TV screen to give short lectures on the readings. While these help you understand the readings more, it leaves little time for class discussion about the readings. So if you like a professor who's easy to listen to and you're not big on talking in class, this is a great English class to take.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Absolutely take this course, even if it's the only english class you take as a freshman or even as Yale student, essential readings and reasonable workload",
    "English 127 is a fantastic course! It is not as writing intensive as English 120, but the subject matter is very interesting. You get to read classics like Moby Dick and poems by Whitman and Dickinson and even very recent novels like Ubik. It's a nice sample of American literature, and by the end of the course, you can see how all the texts are related--pretty mind blowing.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 127 to anyone looking for an introductory level English class. John Williams is a great professor - very accessible, very helpful, and very funny and laid-back. Apart from Moby-Dick, which requires a lot of legwork, the work load is very manageable, and VERY enjoyable once you get into Thomas Pynchon onward. This was one of my favorite classes that I took this semester, and a great introduction to the English Department.",
    "If you're looking for a not-too intense but still interesting and worthwhile course on American Literature - take it! Take it with Williams!"
