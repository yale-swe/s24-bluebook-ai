    "I improved my close reading of texts, and also improved my essay writing to make it clearer and more focused. I also gained a greater appreciation of literature.",
    "Helped a lot with my writing Analyzing literary texts and extracting meaning from them.",
    "Aside from some newly gained background and insight into the works we covered, I learned about the archival resources Yale provides through the Beinecke Library.",
    "From this course, I was introduced to a broad sample of important American literature and learned analysis techniques and writing skills.",
    "I became much better at reading carefully and identifying important parts of the text. I also improved my essay writing, especially organising my argument. I learned a lot about American literature which I had hardly read previously, especially about black literature and the South.",
    "My essay-writing skills improved immensely in this class. Also close-reading of the text was heavily emphasized throughout the course.",
    "This course was a big step for me in making my writing clearer and less verbose. I gained some interesting insights into the interactions between politics and aesthetics in American literature, which was helped along greatly by my professor outside of class."

   "comments": [
    "The course was so interesting and used a variety of different types of text and forms of literature. It wasn't difficult to stay engaged and involved. I think as an improvement on an already great course, there could be more of a focus on writing, and how to incorporate close readings into the essays.",
    "The course definitely challenges one to think thoroughly about the texts read and to conduct a complete analysis of those texts. Discussions in class were often interesting and helpful in developing topics for essays. I did not care for a majority of the books we read but that is pretty subjective.",
    "Seminar format and thorough feedback on writing made it great.",
    "The feedback for the essays was incredibly helpful. The depth of the feedback and advice always helped and advanced my writing style for the next essay.",
    "The syllabus was fantastic, and it varies by instructors - so I recommend Sunny Xiang's section. It was a pretty juicy cross section of American literature from diverse social perspectives. The class discussion was generally lackluster, largely because many students weren't terribly interested and because we couldn't get to all the reading in the slightly excessive reading load. It could be improved by covering slightly fewer works in greater depth and finding even more ways to get students to feel invested in the texts."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about American Literature, or anyone who likes to read or interpret text. It's a very interesting and insightful class in general.",
    "I would recommend this course because it definitely helped me improve my essay writing and also challenged me to think deeply about the texts read.",
    "Absolutely! It is a great introduction to American literature and a fantastic writing credit.",
    "I'm personally not a huge fan of American lit, so I didn't enjoy many of the readings as much as I would have liked. But if you're into American literature go for it. It's not too much writing, three relatively short papers and weekly reading responses, but the amount of reading was just way more than I was used to.",
    "Yes. I think it offers a really clear and interesting overview of important American texts and authors. I really enjoyed the reading, and felt that there was an interesting range of literature. The essay amounts were not overbearing yet they challenged me and made me want to do well.",
    "Yes, most definitely, if you want to read some really good books and improve your writing.",
    "Yes! The texts are very interesting and the approach is cool - the syllabus is lined up with visitations from authors, scholars and performers. The class model is generally cool and exciting."
