    "Perfect if you are interested in British Empire studies",
    "The course looked at the European and native art of Australia and New Zealand from the 18th century through World War I, with a brief look at contemporary art. It was especially strong in areas related to natural history and ethnography. I would definitely recommend the course to others, though I would recommend it in the context of the Australian material culture seminar, the British Empire lecture, and the research trip.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. I would tell students that the course is highly participatory. As a seminar class, students give assessments of the weekly readings and artworks; the class is rarely silent, lots of discussion. Also, students give 2 class presentations per semester which allows them to become knowledgeable about mini topics and to prepare presentations--that part was one of my favorite parts about the class. Also, the professor works with you if you have questions."

    "Great for expanding my knowledge of British Empire studies",
    "The course was extremely valuable in building up my knowledge of the British Empire, as well as thinking through ideas surrounding mobility and transit.",
    "Yes, this course has been helpful to my discipline. As an Americanist, I think it is very important to gain a global perspective. I feel that I will use the knowledge I gained in the course for other projects."
