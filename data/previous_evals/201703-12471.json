    "Professor Gonzlez Echevarras marvelous course instructed its students to decipher and analyze many essential Spanish Golden Age plays and to develop their own critical viewpoints towards them. Professor Gonzlez Echevarras presentation of his own insightful and illuminating interpretations and analyses of these plays especially exemplified the intellectually challenging research expected of the students taking this course. For instance, Professor Gonzlez Echevarras profound and detailed analyses of many works, such as El burlador de Sevilla and La vida es sueo, through the framework of the clashing yet coexistent interactions between the Ptolemaic universe and the Copernican universe expanded these works literary capacities. Additionally, such interpretation demonstrated to students how a particular key concept, in this case, the different conceptualizations of the universe, can incorporate itself into different works and thus formulate an intellectual trend within works of Golden Age theater. Also, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra showcased how profound analyses of literary works originate and found themselves upon careful interpretation of the details of the work, such as its diction, poetic form and verb forms utilized in its poetry. Professor Gonzlez Echevarras wonderful teachings expanded themselves even beyond the scope of the works discussed in class and developed his students knowledge and perception of literary criticism and the very conceptualization of literary history itself. For instance, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra dispelled the frequent interpretation of the Renaissance and Baroque literature as Europes comprehensive separation from Medieval literature and rather introduced students to a much more continuous and inclusive viewpoint, in which Renaissance and Baroque literatures manifest themselves as a grand continuation of Medieval literature. Therefore, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra effectively instructed students to question and challenge frequently accepted conceptualizations and perceptions, both towards particular works of literature and towards overall literary history. All in all, Professor Gonzlez Echevarras class consists of a wondrous and comprehensive development of his students reading and research abilities.",
    "I delved in the textual analysis of Golden Age Spanish Theatre, contextualized with reading from world renowned specialists and with the insightful scholarship of Prof. Gonzalez Echevarria, whose lectures were as eyeopening and enjoyable as the plays themselves.",
    "The course allowed me to learn more about Golden Age drama, through the reading of numerous authors I didnt know and others to whom my previous approach had been very superficial. I could also develop my close-reading skills, my capacities of associating the content of the works with other texts or artistic productions, and my knowledge of the period.",
    "The course gave me a greater understanding of the recurring themes of the Golden Age Theater of Spain, and sharpened my close reading skills."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Gonzlez Echevarras course always guided and challenged its students towards further intellectual development, both as a critical reader and as a researcher. During each class discussion, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra introduced students to various contexts and critical history of the works, from historical background to its critical reception by critics of different eras, such as Marcelino Menndez Pelayo and Alexander Parker. Thus, students were able to acquire a comprehensive knowledge of each of the works discussed in class. Furthermore, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra truly encouraged students to interact with each of these works in a profound and engaging manner, asking them to further develop any commentaries they present and thus intellectually challenge themselves. Also, such atmosphere of intellectual engagement, as created by Professor Gonzlez Echevarra, enabled each student to demonstrate and articulate diverse opinions. Thus, the class discussions themselves successfully exposed students to different viewpoints and commentaries amongst themselves. Therefore, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra fostered mutual intellectual growth among the students. Furthermore, the final twenty to twenty five page essay enabled students to prepare themselves towards writing formal research articles, via obliging them to formulate and articulate profound interpretations of the Golden Age works of their choosing. In this way, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra effectively trained his students towards professional and formal academic writing. Therefore, Professor Gonzlez Echevarras course exemplifies an engaging and wonderful seminar course.",
    "The strength of the course is the selection of comedies and the interpretative insights the professor help the students develop. The fact that it was a very small group of students made possible an in-depth approach to the texts.",
    "I loved that the course was more like a seminar, intimate with many opportunities for rich discussion. I also thought that having the students do short informes on certain works was illuminating and a wonderful way to learn from my colleagues."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues who have yet to take it, since Professor Gonzlez Echevarra would certainly train his students towards the world of professional academics, via enabling them to acquire the essential reading and writing skills required of them as novice researchers. For instance, Professor Gonzlez Echevarras extensive and elaborate presentation of his own wondrous and illustrative analyses and interpretations would expose students to various conceptualizations of a particular work. Also, the engaging and challenging class discussions that Professor Gonzlez Echevarra successfully formulates will further develop the students own intellectual abilities of crafting and articulating their own viewpoints, because of the diverse and complex opinions presented by students during each class discussion. Furthermore, the final essay of this class prepares students to write an article-length research project, in which they will be able to develop their opinions and reactions towards a particular work and craft them into coherent and formal academic writing. In summary, comprehensive and profound learning awaits students who take this course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course for those who wish to gain an understanding of Golden Age Theater and read some of its greatest texts."
