   "comments": [
    "I think gaining understanding about the subject matter has been limited. Not because of the professor, but because of the complexity of the topic. Exposure to such things have been wonderful, but I do not believe I came out with a true grasp on what was being taught.",
    "Stimulating course that made with think about the economic, social, and political implications of spatial organization.",
    "First architecture class, and it was great to learn with Keller Easterling. She really allows you to study concepts of architecture in the scope of your own interests and background.",
    "I feel that I developed my ability to critically analyze abstract theoretical articles and papers relating to infrastructure. Additionally, I gained a lot of insight into global networks and relationships, how they developed and why they are structured the way they are.",
    "I learned about space and globalization.",
    "The class was really an exercise in aesthetic argumentation, an underappreciated form of understanding that provides access to otherwise difficult to access narratives. This is a huge benefit of the course, and I appreciate that type of argumentation as someone usually used to more traditionally argumentative philosophy courses.",
    "It is difficult to explain how, but I learned to look at the world differently in this class. Professor Easterling explained the dynamics of the world that people do not usually pay attention to and it was fascinating.",
    "I learned to think about spatial productions as evidence and causes of globalized life. This class allowed me to consider some larger theories of globalization and apply them to solid examples."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that difficult part of this class the complexity of the subject matter. I feel like the graduate students definitely had a better grasp on the nuances of different topics than I did.",
    "Excellent class - change nothing",
    "Sometimes the reading were a bit challenging, and as a non-architecture major, some of the spatial\/design jargon was hard to get used to at first. But my TA Caroline was great at leading section and dissecting the reading!",
    "The course required readings versus the lectures were often very different and not reflective of what Keller said the content would be in the beginning of the semester. The discussion sections are not very structured.",
    "Every lecture was filled to the brim with interesting content, and the readings were very manageable and relevant. I feel that the course could benefit from a structural change, reorganizing the relative positions of discussion sections and lectures to create a more cohesive flow (I often forgot about the relevant lectures by the time my discussion section came around).",
    "This course is sometimes a bit hard to follow in the narrative it constructs, but taken as a complete work, it provides a powerful argument for Professor Easterling's reading of globalization. The last two weeks were a shift in her plans, and because of that they seemed at times a bit more disjointed than the rest of the course, but that is understandable given the shift. Overall this is an exceptional course.",
    "Interesting class as it covers a lot of topics but in doing so becomes much more confusing rather than clarifying. I think if the course was a little more focused it would provide more direction for students",
    "The course is well-structured and I appreciate that the TAs understood Professor Easterling and gave feedback i fell she could have given herself. I also appreciate the mixing of undergrads and grads. The course might be improved if certain questions were sent out so I knew what to focus on in the readings. I don't know if anyone else had this issue, but I often had trouble in section with knowing how to contribute.",
    "The lectures and section are excellent. Easterling is a stellar lecturer that has a keen understanding on theories of globalization. The readings are dense but oftentimes relevant to our education. Although there were readings that were sometimes too dense, I would say that the course syllabus was strong."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to anyone that comes in with some kind of knowledge about globalization trends and is familiar with terms regarding philosophical politics and space. Otherwise, it is a difficult lecture to understand.",
    "YES I WOULD! Excellent.",
    "Yes, would recommend if you're interested in infrastructure and spatial organization",
    "I would recommend if you are looking for a very low workload class. Weekly discussion sections, a final paper, and very short end of class presentation are the only things required for the class. While the content of the class sounds interesting, Keller jumps all over the place and the sections (at least mine) are also very disorganized. Didn't get much out of the class, but can't complain much.",
    "If you have a relatively solid foundation in global infrastructure, you would really love this course. It gives an incredibly expansive history and analysis of so many areas in globalization, and really pushes you to think. Coming from an extremely STEM-y background, I felt that I wasn't able to think on the same level as many other students, and didn't get as much from the course as I could have with a better background, but if you're able to understand the readings and connect it to things you know about, you'll really learn a lot.",
    "This is a fascinating course. The method of pedagogy in this class is different than any I've taken at Yale--you won't really get answers from any single lecture in itself, but instead the full course will provide a sort of aesthetic argument for the interpretation of globalization that Keller has.",
    "You won't learn much out of it but low work load",
    "I would definitely recommend globalization space to another student. What you put into the class is what you get out. The course does not demand very much from you, only a final essay and that you lead section once. Given the low expectations you could sleepwalk through the class and it would be your loss. Alternatively, if you keep up with the readings and stay attentive to Easterling's commentary you could come away with a great introduction to spatial globalization. Easterling is a wonderful professor trying to teach a very multidisciplinary course. While some aspects of the course may seem less relevant than others, there is a lot of room to make this class your own. If you want some free rein to write a paper, this is a great class to do it."
