    "I would recommend this class as a way to learn about the role of ethics in business practices and how they are implemented in real world cases.",
    "It is a very good course. If you are interested in ethics and businesses, you should take it.The professor is very good and he is very prepared. However, there is not a lot of discussion.",
    "Definite reccomendatiom. Take this course",
    "I would recommend PLSC 120 if the course material is of interest. I think it would be a valuable course for anyone interested in International Relations, Politics or Business. Professor Sethi is very knowledgeable about his field and offers a different perspective on globalization and the power of multinational corporations."
