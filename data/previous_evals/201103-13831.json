    "3. I bristle a little at one sentence being used to gauge our understanding of the course reading.",
    "The coordination of the instructor and the TA was such that all students could benefit from their work. The readings were really interesting and helped me understand the issue discussed in the weekly discussions. Having a smaller size class really helped the discussion environment for the complex topics.",
    "This course was an excellent intro to the social sciences for me. Some of the readings were very challenging but non the less Carol was always ready and willing to answer any and all questions to make sure we understood the material. I am very glad I took this course this semester!!Sometimes I felt that Luisa (TF) was a bit harsh with her comments and advice. Her comments did made me work harder to understand the material, but often i wished she was nicer and more inviting to ask questions and seek for help. Don't get me wrong, she was always willing to help students but her attitude sort of deterred me a bit."

    "Being able to systematically go through the literature and get a better sense of key authors and ideas; Carol's rich knowledge and keen analysis; support for developing your own ideas or projects and applying course materials to that idea.Overall, it was a very solid course, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about social science theories of development and conservation.",
    "The way it changed the way I think.",
    "The best thing about this course was the great quality of the readings connected with the lecture and discussions that followed.",
    "hard to choose one. Really the combination between the readings and Carol's lectures going over the readings were invaluable.",
    "This class deeply affected the way I think about not only development but other everyday issues in politics etc. Glad I took this class!"

   "comments": [
    "I spoke with both. Carol was very helpful in office hours, and offered many insights into my final project. The TA was also helpful and clearly very knowledgeable about the literature, although sometimes I felt that she could be more accessible. Our interactions with her were very structured (e.g., in meeting to discuss our final projects, we could only meet in groups of three, and only on Saturday or Sunday morning). I understand the need for structure, but also wish there were more flexibility for spontaneous interaction.",
    "Both Carol and Luisa were very available. Luisa was perhaps a little brusque which sometimes made me hesitate to contact her.",
    "The instructor had weekly office hours that really shaped the way my final paper was fitting into the class. I found her guidance really helpful in my learning experience.Regarding the TA, she prepared extra group discussion sessions and offered flexible hours for the discussion of specific topics regarding the readings done every week.",
    "The instructors office hours filled up very quickly, so consulting with her was sometimes difficult. The TA was available more often, but was easily frustrated, which discouraged conversation.",
    "Although I only got to see Carol one on one for a few minutes each week, that time was extremely productive!! In less than 30minutes Carol is able to answer any of your questions and guide your research efforts. She is also very accessible through e-mail.Luisa is also very accessible through e-mail and always willing to help students. She is also very knowledgeable and insightful about the topic covered in class. Could be a bit nicer though."

    "I'm most interested in environmental policies having come to F&ES straight from working for the government. In my previous experience policies were done with a stronger lean on the economic or the environmental side of the issue, but I felt I had a set of skills missing to complete the understanding of environmental policies. It was this class that opened the social factor to my mind and presented a framework of thought that knits the other two threads together. I believe that by realizing and including this new thought scheme in what I do, I can fit this course in my overall program perfectly.",
    "Ive never taken an anthropology like course through my student life and I am glad this was the introduction for me. Considering I would like to work on sustainable development initiatives in Latin America, this course is very much related to my goals."

    "I felt inclined into the topics discussed in the class rather that other similar classes because it had a direct application into the work I'd done in the past with governmental agencies.",

Carol's lectures were thorough and insightful, and I think it really helped to write a thesis sentence for each reading, because it forced you to really think about the essence of what an author was trying to get across.",

    "Read everything. Start onyour paper as early as humanly possible. Go to office hours. Do your best.",
    "For students taking this class I recommend they give enough time to read and re-read the readings so they have enough time to reflect on what the readings are about. I would also stress the importance of the previous meeting when you are leading the discussion session in class, the richness of the discussion is what brings the flavor to class.",
    "START YOUR FINAL PAPER, at the LATEST, in Early November. PLEASE do your self a favor and start your paper early; at least read up on it.",
    "Do the readings carefully and take good notes during class sessions as little of the information discussed in class can be found on the internet. Classes are extremely helpful to understanding the reading material."
