    "Some of the readings can be dense and niche, but others are genuinely interesting. If you have an interest in Russian history, you will like this course.",
    "Readings are long and very pedantic. Not extremely accessible to the layman.",
    "I would recommend but too bad professor is leaving.",
    "If you're at all interested in Russia, take this class, it is essential to understanding an underrated dimension of Russian politics and identity. If you don't really care about Russia, however, you will probably find the topics too obscure and not worth the dense readings.",
    "This is a historiography course that covers Russia's relationship with the East from the beginning of Russia's existence to present day. I would recommend it, especially since it is relevant when considering Russia's position today.",
    "I would recommend it!"
