   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The material was very interesting, and extremely applicable for anyone planning to continue work in the sciences via lab research, medicine, etc.",
    "Yes, wonderful class and a great way to see how bio concepts are applied to modern technology and modern problems in the world. These kinds ofclasses are the reason I'm a bio major!",
    "Covers a lot of interesting material in the realm of biotechnology. In general, chooses to cover more topics rather than flesh out a topic in more depth, so in that sense it's a survey course. I'd still recommend it.",
    "Don't take this. It's a horrible survey class.",
    "Really solid course. A great exposure to a lot of topics on the frontiers of biotechnology, the workload is pretty light, and I learned a lot. I don't remember what the listed prereqs are, but you're probably fine if you have even a basic understanding of genetics (I had no real bio background and felt able to kee up).",
    "Great class, interesting material. Not all too difficult.",
    "Having 4 different lecturers made the course a bit confusing, particularly since there wasn't a great deal of continuity between the lecturers. Aside from that though, the course was pretty interesting and served as a good survey course of what biotechnology's been up to lately. The non-cumulative exams are also a huge plus (this includes the final, which was just another hour exam that you've got three hours to take)."
