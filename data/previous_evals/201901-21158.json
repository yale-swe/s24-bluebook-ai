    "This course was very student interactive which I considered a strength when learning a new language. It was nice to practice talking in Italian with other people who were at my speaking level.",
    "Strengths- very immersive and understanding of mistakes Weaknesses- moves from concept to concept very quickly",
    "Strengths- fun, interesting, I learned a lot",
    "Excellent course",
    "The class is fun and keeps you engaged while also teaching you a lot.",
    "I would have preferred to deviate more from the textbook.",
    "The course used the textbook really well which helped with studying and returning to examples a lot easier outside of class. Additionally, practice reading out loud and holding short conversations in Italian was really helpful for solidifying concepts. There were also fun things that engaged interests outside of Italian class like the presentations we did at the Yale Undergraduate Art Gallery.",
    "Strengths were it is easy to get all the students involved. Weaknesses were I wish there was more speaking in the every day class.",
    "Strengths- organization of the class, clear schedule, it was understood what we needed to know Weaknesses- None!"

    "I would recommend this course to another student because Italian is a beautiful language and the department is extremely helpful in providing the resources you need to succeed. The class was well organized and as long as you follow along with the textbook, you can figure out a lot of the concepts and practice to make sure you understand everything. You get a lot of feedback so you are constantly improving.",
