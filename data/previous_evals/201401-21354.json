   "comments": [
    "Really interesting class and a great linguistics course for a non-linguistics major.",
    "Super interesting class for anyone experienced in linguistics or not! I would highly recommend it. Make sure to ask specific questions about the assignments, I think this would result in less frustrated students!",
    "Whether you should take this class depends on what you're looking for. If you just want a casual class that does what it says on the label (goes over the grammar of various American English dialects), then take it. It's a little boring at times because the material can get repetitive and some of it is hit-or-miss depending on your interests. It's very interesting at other times, though. And overall, it's doable and the professors are nice (unfortunately, Prof Horn won't be teaching in the future).",
    "A cool exploration of different American dialects, mostly from a syntactic perspective but also getting into pronunciation and things like that. I will admit that it was not as easy as I expected it to be, but I didn't really mind because it was so interesting. Larry Horn is leaving, but Raffaella is very nice and good with explaining ideas.",
    "Great for anyone regardless of major or prior experience in linguistics! It will change the way you think about language in general as well as your own variety of English.",
    "This is very much a sociolinguistics class. Though we do learn some technical grammatical things, full syntactic understanding of them is not necessary to enjoy or get the most out of the class. An open mind is necessary. If you're a prescriptivist who chastises people for \"improper\" grammar, this is definitely not the class for you, unless you are prepared to change your perspective.",
    "Yes, take it! It's a fun course and definitely worth it if you are already into linguistics. If you haven't taken many linguistics classes, it may take a while to get used to the lingo or how to talk about linguistic phenomena, but I think the effort is worth putting in.",
    "LING 211 was, often an absolutely brilliant class. It is the only class of it's type offered at Yale, and is the only class where you can talk about modern linguistic change and Internet and youth dialects. The journal assignment is really fun, and it open your minds to variations in language use. The class was especially good when the students contributed their insights. Unfortunately, the class was too often the professors explaining things to students, which could become boring, and was frustrating given the small professor-student ratio. Additionally, I felt that the professors expected too much foreknowledge of linguistic terminology, so you would do the problem sets blind and then find out the necessary terminology after you did badly, so I would only take this class if you have a grasp of syntax. If there could be more review and teaching before the problem sets, it would be very helpful, and it would be great to have more class discussion, and more time devoted to more recent changes that students have experience with.",
    "Small class with 2 professors which felt very open and comfortable. Not tons of work and the readings are generally pretty interesting, if you're interested in the quirks of English and dialects. We did spent most of the time on African American English and Appalachian English and also could research whatever aspect of English we wanted for final projects.",
    "Would recommend, but make sure you enjoy writing about language! lot of the work you'll do for the class will be introspective, as in you'll be writing about why you think certain language differences exist for English and why they differ. Also, there are no linguistics prerequisites to take this class, so a lot of this introspection and surmising is allowed to be from the \"layman\" perspective."
