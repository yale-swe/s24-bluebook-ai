   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it as an entry point for university level mathematics in the sciences. It's also a req for the physics major.",
    "I would recommend the class if you need it for some sort of physics major. You touch on a lot of important applications of math in the physics world, and I feel like it's a good thing I have some exposure to the topics now. However, the course does move very fast and I found it pretty challenging, so I would definitely recommend taking it when you have the time to devote to it (otherwise the math just goes in one ear and out the other).",
    "Because of how the course is set up, it feels like it's in a perpetual rush to cram each section in. Teaching is decent and the Nikhil makes a great effort. However, he could do better by being more conscious of what parts of his lectures are relevant. It's a frustrating when he goes on a long explanation of something that leaves most of the class clueless, and it turns out that it's not necessary or expected of us. Also in future classes, please try to not assign a pset due the day before finals start.",
    "Physics 301 was a good course for physics majors looking for a class to give them a better grasp on mathematical tools. I would suggest that they take some basic math courses first (calculus, linear algebra, differential equations) before deciding to enroll in this class.",
    "Either fantastic or horrific depending on why you're taking it. If you're looking for a solid review and consolidation of math that you've learned before, it's a good choice. If you're trying to learn a lot of the material for the first time, you've got a difficult semester.You need to have taken multivariable, and it's not inadvisable to have taken either Linear Algebra or Differential Equations already. A problem set each week, and the testing is very fair.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. I learned a huge amount of math form this course. Professor Padmanabhan is a great teacher.",
    "Physics 301 is a quick and dirty run from calculus methods through complex numbers and complex integration, linear algebra, and the essentials of differential equations. A given section will of course be easier if one has taken the relevant class before (i.e. you should take a differential equations course if that's what you really want to learn), though I had taken multivariable calculus and no other math and learned a TON. In addition to the specific topics I learned for the first time, my general mathematical competence skyrocketed. I am very glad that I took this course, and only wish I had taken it sooner.",
    "I took multivariable calc and linear algebra in high school but had not yet taken any math courses at Yale. This was a good way for me to review much of what I had already learned but also still learn some new topics. Worth taking if you feel like you need some extra practice on any of the topics in the syllabus. What you learn won't substitute for taking an entire course in one of those topics though. Prof. Padmanabhan is one of the most dedicated professors I've had at Yale.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to all physics majors. It's really helpful and not too intense.",
    "This class covered a lot of information very quickly and was at times difficult to follow, but the professor was very helpful on an individual basis. If you want to get a survey of a lot of math topics that will probably be useful in the future, this course is a good one, but be prepared to work hard.",
    "Rushed intro to diff eq and linear. Good review of calc. Good intro to complex numbers and functions. Definitely doable with only 120\/151.",
    "You cover calculus, complex numbers\/analysis, linear algebra, and diffeq in a semester, so it's just a lot. You're probably only taking this class if you have to... so would I recommend it? Not really. It's not taught very well, and it didn't really make me understand the math any better... but at least I have a vague idea of what I need to know for the rest of the physics major.",
    "I highly encourage any science major to take this course early in their time at Yale. It's extremely helpful for upper level science electives.",
    "This was a good course that gave a broad overview of many different types of math necessary for physics. It was great review for me, as I had taken the courses covered in high school, but forgotten how to do a fair amount of it. However, I feel like I will end up having to take several of the subjects covered again in their own respective class (especially differential equations and complex analysis) to actually learn the subject. While this course was good, we just did not have enough time to cover everything. Professor Padmanabhan was a great teacher and I especially recommend taking a course with him. He is very good at creating clever problem sets that really help teach the material.",
    "This course used to be a joke, but I found it to be pretty useful. Definitely a great substitute for the endlessly frustrating required courses in the math department.",
    "Overall a good overview of important mathematical concepts. The course felt a little bit rushed at the end and could have benefited from a few more examples and a few fewer proofs but, all in all, not too bad."
