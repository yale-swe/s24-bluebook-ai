    "This class covers a serious of models of social networks, and the main principles that account for the impact of digital technologies on the social\/bureaucratic\/professional worlds. I would definitely recommend this class! It is not very much work, and I learned so much. It is definitely structured as a lecture course, though, so for students looking for more of a discussion-based class, this would not be ideal.",
    "In this course, you will listen to Prof. Boorman teach a way of learning. It is different from most courses at yale which embrace a very liberal arts philosophy of wandering through knowledge hoping you pick something interesting up from it. Boorman thinks a lot about how to think about new areas and it was excellent.",
    "This class is probably not going to be what you expect it to be. I would say close to 50 people shopped the class, and only 5 ended up taking it. As someone who did stick with it, I really liked this class.As a fifth class, SOCY 133 was a very manageable workload. A lot of the more mathematical stuff went right over my head, but it wasn't that necessary for the exams.Even though the idea of having your grade be just your final is really scary, I really appreciated it because it is so finite. As long as you pay attention in lecture and skim the readings, the exam is quite manageable. It would have been fun to write a paper though, and ultimately I probably would have gotten more out of the class.Also, please note: THIS IS \/NOT\/ A SEMINAR!! As my major requires I take all huge lecture courses this semester, I thought this course would be a great way to mix it up. Even though there were five of us, Professor Boorman explained that the material lends itself much better to lecturing. This is not necessarily a bad thing - a lack of discussion means that you can get away not doing the reading. Which is a shame because the email installments that Professor Boorman sends out are very interesting."
