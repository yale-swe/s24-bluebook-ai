    "Amazing course - CPB is THE BEST",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It can be a fair amount of work on a weekly basis: a decent amount of reading with a weekly reading response, and a 14-16 pg final paper at the end of term. That said, it's an extremely interesting topic and Prof. Panter-Brick is great. Hopefully the format will be changed so it's a little less student-run (Prof. Panter-Brick has lots of great insights\/fieldwork experience to contribute), and it should hopefully be made a WR credit in the future, too.",
    "Yes, highly recommended! A wonderful introduction to medical anthropology, even for non-anthropology majors. Almost all of the readings were interesting (and for the ones that were not, Prof. Panter-Brick will agree with you) and the workload was fair.",
    "This was an introductory course with in depth discussions on Medical Anthropology and its applications. I would recommend this as a good course, namely because Professor Panter-Brick is so great!",
    "Prof. Panter-Brick is engaging and knowledgable. Interesting and relevant course material.",
    "Maybe, if you're interested in the topic--otherwise, you might check out during discussions."
