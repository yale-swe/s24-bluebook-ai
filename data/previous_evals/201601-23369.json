    "Unfortunately, it is my opinion that Roy Lee is simply too old to keep teaching effectively. He is not current on the material that he's teaching, and brings nothing new to the analysis of any reading that has been assigned. He is disorganized, and relies heavily on the TA to suggest readings and to keep him on track, both inside and outside of class. The readings were rarely assigned on time, and class discussion was almost non-existent because students learned, very early on, that they didn't have to do any work to get by during class. Roy is unable to encourage class discussion. The field trips of this class were it's only saving grace -- this course should, if it is offered in the future (which it shouldn't be), be entirely field-trip (or internship) oriented."
