    "I'd recommend this course to someone who's very interested in the art world. I'd recommend it less to someone who's more interested in the craft of making art. It's more about the \"Critical theory\" part than the \"in the studio\" part.",
    "Take it if you can! Great class. Weinberg is a bit lecture-y at times but it is always interesting and ends up being very worthwhile",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. You learn a lot about different movements in art throughout the course, and the readings are very interesting.",
    "Yes, just based on the readings and the organization of the course into major themes. If you think you'll like it based on the syllabus, you probably will. If you've ever wondered about 20th-century art history, or tried to come up with your own theory of art and its evaluation, this will be a great experience. Also, Prof. Weinberg is pretty great, and always has useful insights and propositions to challenge your assumptions about art and art-making. In addition, as a nonbinary queer person, I found this class to be a more-or-less safe space to express and engage with that part of myself, which has been really rare in other art classes I've taken here."
