    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you are really excited by the syllabus and want to read those texts. It was difficult to get anything out of the class because it wasn't really made clear what the goals were or what we were supposed to be learning- literary analysis? comparative lit? facts about colonial america? how to write history? There weren't many threads that tied the class together. Although Professor Brander Rasmussen is very nice, she didn't facilitate discussion in a meaningful way so it felt like people were just speaking over one another and not having a conversation. She also would talk for literally an hour in a seminar\/discussion-style class and go off on tangents that were interesting but just sounded like her own reflections rather than teachings.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class to another student unless the student is interested in the subject matter. If you like the ENTIRE reading list, take it. If not, don't.",
    "The reading list for this class is pretty interesting and encompasses pieces you probably wouldn't read elsewhere. There's a heavy focus on captivity narratives. At times the colonial works can be pretty dry though. The class is really laid-back and not too much work--short weekly reading responses and a big final project. Having no grades until the end of the class unnerved me a little. Your final project sort of makes or breaks your experience in the class; you have total freedom to choose the topic and format for it. Also, Birgit is the nicest teacher!",
    "This class is ok, but not as exciting as I thought it might be.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely."
