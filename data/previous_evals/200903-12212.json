   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting course and I would definitely recommend it. I would also recommend gaining some familiarity with Africa and its history before taking this course (such as through a survey lecture course), as you will probably find the seminar more enriching if you have a foundation of knowledge upon which you can build.",
    "This is a course about the treatment of women in Africa from precolonial to modern times. I would only recommend it if people are extremely interested in this topic and willing to put in a LOT of work-- debates can get heated and Professor Mahoney is extremely demanding. I learned a lot about the historiography of this subject, but it is such a vast and variegated topic that it would be difficult to say I definitively learned anything more than that.",
    "A terrific seminar course. The readings were well-chosen to show how Africa is not one big place that's all the same, and how women in Africa are not just victims, but agents for change.Prof. Mahoney works hard to make sure that everyone speaks and that the conversation is intelligent. He's an expert, and yet he is much more interested in listening than lecturing. Treating our final papers like the articles that we read for class was an excellent move--the sign of a great teacher.No weaknesses to this course. Take it.",
    "This class covers different women's issues in different parts of Africa. All of the material was fascinating and discussions were really interesting.",
    "Take this class if you need a 'rest of the world' component - it is a bunch of reading that can get dry at times and sometimes confusing if you don't know African history - but don't worry, you don't really NEED to know this history. 50% participation, 50% final paper that you do a draft of and peer-review first.",
    "i would definitely reccomend the class if you are at all intersted in the subject matter. even if not, its a good way to learn about soething new with such an established professor"
