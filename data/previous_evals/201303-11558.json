   "comments": [
    "This class teaches you everything you didn't want to know about insects and other arthropods and I would strongly recommend it. I enjoyed the lectures and the papers were a very nice supplement to the material.",
    "Great course! Straight-forward 3 midterms, final exam, and 12-page paper. Learned a lot and enjoyed going to class.",
    "YES. Insect and Spiders are totally fascinating. I loved going to the lectures because they were so interesting (and entertaining! lots of amazing video clips!). Not a gut by any mean, but the work is very reasonable and the paper ended up being fun to write.",
    "This is a good course overall. I took it as my second science credit and do not regret it. Marta is great and shows a lot of cool youtube videos about insects and spiders. I recommend going to the review sessions before each test.",
    "If you love bugs, take it. If you hate bugs, take it! Either way you'll end with a greater appreciation of the subject and have a great time, both without investing too much effort. There's three midterms and a final, all long but straightforward, plus an open-ended paper that's only as much work as you make it. No homework; just skim the book and study for tests. But TAKE THE LAB, TOO! And note that the lab will be enough work to more than make up for the class.",
    "Great course.The lectures can get a little long, but Marta does a great, great job of keeping people awake with her enthusiasm.I really enjoyed this class.",
    "I wasn't sure what to expect at the beginning of the semester--I took this class mostly because it was the only EEB course that fit my schedule--but this was a fantastic class. Take the lab if you can, it's really one of the best unexpected surprises I've had at Yale. That said, I can't really recommend it if you're a fall-season athlete. There are two field trips for the lab (one to Florida over fall break) which are optional, but it's not really possible to complete the main assignment of the lab without going on one. I couldn't go due to athletic obligations. Marta gives you opportunities to make up for it, which was appreciated, but there's not much you can do.",
    "Take it! Take it! Take it!",
    "I'm sorry to say that I learned very little in this class. There is nothing here that you couldn't gather from a cursory reading of Wikipedia articles. You are tested on how well you can memorize Powerpoints, and you learn no skills and gain no new perspectives. As a non-science major taking this class for fun (without the lab), I didn't feel that I gained anything from taking this class. The videos make the lectures worthwhile -- but I don't think that's a good thing.",
    "If you aren't scientifically inclined, it doesn't matter. This was by far one of the best--and most fun!--classes I took in my whole four years. Never left behind, and clear\/concise lectures were always interesting with Marta's stories and awesome movie clips. Take it! And if you don't have time to take the lab, you should definitely try to make the time!",
    "Really cool information but sometimes a bit obscure. Take it if you're really excited about bugs or want some semi-random but mindblowing information!"
