    "Yes, this is a required course for EVST seniors BUT it is very valuable to have this group setting to discuss senior essays. The guest-lecture sections are helpful in learning writing style, how to do good research, and even learn about potential opportunities post-graduation. Take the time to enjoy this class as the community is a great part of the experience of being an EVST major!",
    "Don't worry guys, this semester is much better than the first! You don't even meet much after spring break, which allows you to focus on editing\/finishing your paper--",
    "The EVST thesis has been a truly life-changing project for me (personally and professionally), and I am so deeply grateful for the experience. Professor Wargo is a stellar, deeply kind, brilliant adviser. Choose a topic that you love and care very deeply about and it will be a joy.",
    "EVST 496 is the capstone project course for the Environmental Studies major. A two term essay feels relatively manageable in this class, and the professors are there to help you with whatever you need along the way.",
    "You have to take it, and as much as you may resent the deadlines, they're pretty helpful, and all the professors are helpful. All in all, a really solid colloquium, though some of the class time might feel a bit slow at times."
