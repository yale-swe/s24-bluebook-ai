    "In this course I gained knowledge about german poetry. Additionally, I developed my german academic writing skills.",
    "Great course about German poetry - developed knowledge of different poets and cultural factors affecting their writing. Lots of close analysis with different poems",
    "You learn about the tradition of German lyric poetry. You read about 2-3 poems per class and focus on all the major writers. In addition, you work on expanding vocabulary and writing skills in German.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of Germanys beautiful literary heritage. Also, I developed an appreciation for textual and conceptual intricacies. Languagewise, this course was a great way to improve both my oral and written German, as the instructor encouraged me to speak up in class and provided very clear feedback and support for my written work.",
    "Got to thoroughly practice my German reading, speaking and writing skills. Learnt about the tradition of German lyric poetry, through a wide time range."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course was a really good insight into german poetry and was very engaging.",
    "The content was great - covered lots of well-known authors and poems as well as lesser-known poets and the class discussions were very open and interesting.",
    "This course is fantastic. It does not overwhelm but has enough work to always keep up your German abilities. In addition, you really do get a nice snapshot of the lyrical tradition and some of the philosophies of its major writers. Overall, I would say the course was ideal for someone who wants to keep up their German and is interested in poetry.",
    "The biggest strength of this class is that it solicited great student participation while allowing for factual learning. The only weakness was that, in the first part, the instructor would step back a little bit too much to allow students to speak up, so as to inadvertently lead the conversation astray, at times.",
    "Very well structured and enjoyable course. Classroom discussions were excellent, and very well facilitated by the professor. Really appreciated the level of close feedback and assistance the professor consistently provided on all assignments!"

    "Definitely, if you want to improve your german and learn about its poetic tradition, this is a fantastic course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, as it helped me overcome certain linguistic struggles.",
    "Definitely- fun and productive course."
