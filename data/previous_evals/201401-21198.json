    "only for arch majors. if you are a senior, you have to take it.",
    "This course was a bit scattered - I like Stephen and Marta as people, but I really feel like the course should be more structured towards designing buildings rather than endless research. I felt like most of what I was instructed to spend my time on before spring break was unproductive. The professors also had very different concerns, so we were constantly being pulled in two different directions. I also felt like they frequently wanted us to do something but then didn't actually tell us and then got mad when we didn't do it. This has been an extremely frustrating semester for me, and I think it shows. On the other hand though, the trip to Miami was AMAZING and one of my favorite events in my Yale career.",
    "Hopefully you'll get professors that care more.",
    "I never felt that Steven was particularly invested in our growth as students\/architects and sometimes it was hard to know where we were going with a project with conflicting views from Marta and Steven. The hydrological center project was difficult because we were asked to base our designs on water treatment methods or something environmentally beneficial to the Everglades but we never knew enough to actually design for that, so it was mostly made up treatments and vague pseudoscience. The TAs were amazing, the saving grace of the class and the reason we produced what we produced. I definitely learned a LOT about digital drawings and renderings through the TAs. The Everglades trip was super fun too!",
    "A lot more work than the fall semester and less rewarding. It was very hard to produce something that made sense with the guidance of our professors. The scale that we working at was unlike any other studio at Yale which also made it very difficult. Our projects felt somewhat incomplete at the end",
    "Well, you have to take it...."
