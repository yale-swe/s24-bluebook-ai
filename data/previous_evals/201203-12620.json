   "comments": [
    "comprehensive background in linear alg, diff equ, and complex variables kind of required; i took this having taken linear and diff equ three years ago and without taking phys 301 prior, which might give more adequate preparation, so i found that i had some catching up to do.a lot of theoretical examples included explaining things from a physics perspective, so the class may be more challenging if you haven't taken physics in a long time.class graded solely on midterm\/final, which means no regular problem sets but a lot riding on those two assessments.",
    "No mandatory problem sets, and only two take-home exams (you could consult any text you wanted, and collaborate with anyone you chose). It's a very quirky course. Coifman is a good lecturer, but I had a lot of trouble following along. I should have devoted more time to this course when there weren't take-homes looming.",
    "A mixed bag--fourier series and transforms, eigendecomposition, calculus of variations, and more. If you did well in multivariate and linear algebra, you'll keep up. But don't expect much structure from this class; only a few take-home exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in seeing where Fourier series or legendre polynomials come from. I'd recommend it to anybody who wants to use spectral theory or calculus of variations-- these two are the primary topics of the course.",
    "Fascinating class with challenging material and a relatively light workload. Note that, if you really want to understand the material, however, you will need to do significant work anyway. The class only has two take-home exams and optional homework, but trust me, there is plenty of work necessary to wrestle with the mathematics and gain any grip of it. Ideally you should have a strong understanding of linear algebra and some analysis before taking. However, if you are a physics or equivalent major who feels confident tackling quantitative problems, you will get a lot of this class. Also Coifman is brilliant, go to class just to listen to what he has to say for an hour twice a week."
