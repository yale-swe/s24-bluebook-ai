   "comments": [
    "Yes I would -- you'll definitely improve your language skills!",
    "it is a fantastic way to improve your French and get your language credits. It is a lot of work, so be prepared to spend significant amounts of time on this class. You will feel totally rewarded at the end though.",
    "It is an interesting class~",
    "My french definitely improved a lot over the course of the semester. This class involves a thorough review or overview of a lot of French grammar, and you read\/watch some very enjoyable books and films. Most people who take this class need to satisfy the language requirement, but it's really not bad. You will like the class if you give it a chance and don't treat it as something you're only taking because you have to.",
    "This is a solid introductory course, and it's just what it seems like. However, the reports of \"this course is too much work\" is just from people who don't feel like working- it was just enough work, and everything seemed worthwhile. It was at a good level and it was enjoyable. I would certainly recommend it, and not only because it might be a requirement to graduate. Professor Koundi was fantastic.",
    "Very good class which improves speaking, listening, and writing skills as well as expanding one's vocabulary. Also good in that you read famous texts and watch films which make the course more interesting. I would recommend it to someone looking to improve their french.",
    "You improve your French a lot if you are attentive, take good notes,and read the text carefully.I would neither recommend nor dissuade student from it.",
    "FREN 130 01 is definitely a rigorous course that provides the basics for reading, speaking, listening and writing in French. I felt that I learned more in one semester than I had previously in 4 years of French in high school. I would recommend it to another student who needs to fulfill a language requirement because it definitely entails a lot of work so a student should be very committed to it."
