   "comments": [
    "I hear it's less work than 180 and it's certainly been doable.",
    "If you took AP Physics in high school you should be fine.",
    "Physics 200 is a pretty intense course, but it's definitely manageable. The lectures can be a bit boring sometimes, but Tipton is pretty funny, so just pay attention for his jokes. Tipton does a lot of derivations in class and very few problems, but you have to do practice problems on your own. If I could redo this semester, I'm not entirely sure if I would have taken this course, but if you're ready for this challenge absolutely go for it.",
    "The mathematics required was low but the problem sets were tricky at times. If you had a strong grasp on Physics C and go to all the lectures, you should do very well in this course. Try to find a group or a friend to do the problem sets with early on, it will make the work more enjoyable.",
    "Take it with Tipton! He is very clear, concise, informative, and posts lecture notes from which to study. The problem sets might be a bit long (especially the relativity ones) but they prepare you VERY well for his very fair tests.",
    "This is a fascinating class that may have convinced me to be a physics major. It requires a lot of hard work, but I guarantee that you will feel great for having taken the class. Problem sets are a sort of bonding experience and the feeling when you answer a tricky question is unparalleled in the other classes I have taken. I would highly recommend taking this as your intro physics class no matter whether you are a physics major or just want to learn a little about the world.",
    "This course is very difficult but if you are well versed in physics and prepared to take on a challenging physics class then go for it.",
    "Covers basic high school physics, applying calculus. Would only recommend if needed for the major, or if you are particularly interested in physics. Not the most captivating lecture series.",
    "Put in the effort + see the peer tutors = you'll be fine. Good lecture, and Tipton's lecture notes (posted online) are THE BEST study guide for exams. Also have the Open Yale Course recorded version (oyc.yale.edu) and MIT's physics lectures if you have to miss lecture for whatever reason or don't understand a certain concept.Definitely take this over PHYS 180 if you want to actually learn the material.",
    "If you don't want to take Physics 260 because Prof. Baltay scares you, and you don't want to take Physics 180 because it looks too easy and half the class is asleep, take Physics 200. Half the class will still be asleep, but at leasts its not 180.",
    "If you like maths and physics, it is a great class and introduced me to some very interesting aspects of physics! Lots of work though.",
    "It is a good introduction to college physics for someone who was good at math and science in high school. There was a fair amount of review from AP Physics B but we covered most of the concepts more in depth and there was much more emphasis on problem solving.",
    "If it's the right level for you, yes. I had quite a good physics background, though I hadn't done any multi-variable calculus so I couldn't take Phys 260 (even though I would have liked to understand the proofs of all the equations). So it was a good fit.",
    "Physics 200 is good to have even if you have had AP Physics. The extra practice that you get by doing problems is great for cementing the concepts.",
    "I would recommend Physics 200 to someone with a strong background in physics and math. The material moved quite fast, and I would have felt lost if I had not sought out the help of TF's.",
    "Review of high school physics, plus a lot more stuff: waves, relativity, angular motion, gases, liquids. There is a smattering of calculus, but it's not an integral part of the class.",
    "I would recommend it. The material is interesting.",
    "Physics 200 was fine. I liked the material and it was well taught. I was choosing between 260 and 200. I had physics C in high school, but no multivariable. I think my choice was fine, but I sometimes wonder if physics 260 would have been better because physics 200 was some review.",
    "As a student who loves physics, I didn't love this class. Professor Tipton seems like a really nice guy, and he would probably be great if he were explaining it one-on-one or something, but his lectures could be confusing, and he seemed confused himself when he did example problems. There's a problem set each week, but its not too bad. The midterms and final are somewhat difficult but very fair. As a student in multivariable calc, it was at an easy level mathematically, and would probably be fine for someone in Math 115.",
    "Depending on what you want to do with a physics class, consider taking 180 or 260 as well.",
    "Strictly as the title says introduction to the fundamentals of physics. I would recommend this course to any student with a relatively decent high school background in math and science interested in getting a more in depth understanding of key principles in the field of physics.",
    "This is a challenging course with tough homework assignments and exams. Professor Tipton is a great professor - his lectures were well-organized and interesting. If you are interested in learning physics in a challenging program, take this class.",
    "It is a good class to get more practice in doing physics problem if you have already taken AP Physics. If you look to learn new things, you should try PHYS 260. However, by no mean is this class easy. The exam problems are complex and takes a real deep understanding in the way physics work and correct assumptions. I would recommend this class for those who look to improve their current knowledge of physics, but not to those who look to learn new material.",
    "Take it for a requirement.",
    "If you need physics for your major and have taken AP physics in high school, I would recommend 200. This class gives you a pretty solid overview of basic physical concepts and Tipton is a decent professor, which is better than you'll get in most other intro science classes. That being said if you haven't had much physics in high school and are placed into 200 for your math preparation (like I was), beware that much of the class has already seen a lot of the concepts covered in 200. Also, the first couple weeks of class are much easier than the rest of the semester, so things can get difficult pretty fast. Other than basic algebra and a few integrals, you won't be held accountable for that much math in this class, so don't let a strong background in math substitute for one in physics when deciding which level to take. If you don't need the class and are just taking it for fun, take something else. There are way more interesting classes out there that require way less work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in physics. If you took AP Physics B in high school and did well, Physics 200 is probably the class for you (unless you have a great math background, in which case maybe look at 260). A lot of the material is stuff you've seen before: you start with projectile motion, then do momentum, and eventually fluid mechanics. But the problems you'll have to tackle will be more challenging. That, combined with the new material (some modern physics, i.e. relativity is covered) means that it is still very much a worthwhile course. After a particularly hard problem set you really feel like you've exerted your mind.",
    "This class is perfect for someone who took AP Physics B in high school (i.e. has never taken calc-based physics before). If you've had calc-based physics before, take PHYS 260 because 200 will be too easy. Tipton is a so-so lecturer, but he's good to get to know one-on-one.",
    "Good class. Tough at times. (Take it if you're really interested in Physics).",
    "I would only recommend it to someone with a strong physics background and is interested in doing something physics- related for their undergraduate degree. Being in a high level physics class, all the students know the information fairly well so the exams have high expectations to them. It is not a class to take just to explore the subject.",
    "Overall it is a good intro to physics. Take it if you are serious about studying physics, not a very easy science credit.",
    "I took AP physics B in high school and the only new topic to me was relativity- the rest I had already seen and didn't really learn anything new. The course was a strange mixture of review of topics I already knew and challenging problem sets. If it wasn't for the problem sets, I would have considered Physics 260. The format of the class is large lecture. Prof. Tipton reads off of his slideshows, which can get a little dull, especially when he makes them available online.",
    "This class seems to be the best option for people who have to take physics but are not interested in the highly theoretical aspects. If you've taken AP Physics, a lot of the material will be familiar. Although derivation of principals and formulas is covered in class, you are not expected to explain why things work on exams, only apply the concepts. But because of this, a lot of material must be learned independently; the textbook is too basic and broad and the lectures are too specific, so relevant material is often first introduced in problem sets. Exams expand upon the problem set content, requiring not just knowledge, but often insight... and it's hard to study for that! My advice: attend the study halls. Some of my peers were great teachers this semester, and talking through the problems even with other confused students was very helpful. Also, watch the Open Yale Courses PHYS 200 lectures by Professor Shankar. Although he goes through much of the same irrelevant content, he is much more clear and straightforward (especially for relativity!).",
    "I enjoyed the course. The subject matter was interesting but Tipton's teaching style wasn't the best in my opinion. He focuses almost exclusively on proving formulae in class, leaving you to work out how to use them for the problem sets and exams.",
    "This is a recap of AP physics with additional lectures in miscellaneous topics like relativity and hydrodynamics. The problem sets were interesting, and the study hall was a life saver. Definitely go to it - I improved my grade and understanding of the material dramatically after I decided to go. Don't go to lecture every week. The online class notes and Yale open courses replace any need for lecture. The class is good if you want to take an solid, not too challenging, introductory physics class.",
    "If physics is your thing and sort of \"proof-like\" problems come easily to you... then this class may be pretty easy for you. Otherwise, the material gets pretty dense and the problem sets are really difficult to complete independently - definitely go to study hall and work with other students. I would suggest taking this class with Professor Shankar or watching his lectures online on OpenYale... I really didn't like Tipton's teaching style. He's a really nice guy, but he teaches completely from powerpoint presentations and all of his complex derivations just blend together with formulas and he doesn't generalize about problem solving techniques very much... I ended up not going to lecture, and learning the material on my own from the textbook. The curve in the class was incredible though, partial credit gets you a long, long way - you can do pretty badly and have really minimal understanding of the material and still come out with a B+ or A-, depending on how much work you put in (homework grade really boosts your final grade).",
    "This was a good course in introductory physics, but I had a lot of problems with the manner in which it was taught. I honestly would not recommend it to s student unless it was required for their major.",
    "The physics study hall is really helpful for problem sets that you are completely stuck on. It's pretty hard, but basically AP Physics + Relativity. If you've ever taken any Physics course before, it's a good class.",
    "You will truly learn physics and how to think intuitively and analytically.",
    "I don't recommend this class unless it is required for a major or if you have a strong background in physics (AP Physics+). If you do have an AP Physics background, this shouldn't be too difficult. If you never took AP Physics, you're in for a lot of work. Paul Tipton is a sub-par instructor. It's more productive to sit in class watching online lectures done by another professor of this same course or simply to not attend class. Rarely did I learn anything from Tipton's lectures. Tipton is at times incoherent, rambles on about stuff, and does not teach material in a logical manner. As a person, however, he seems like a good guy.",
    "To my understanding, Physics 200 will give you the most complete intro-level physics education out of the 4 levels offered. It goes more in depth than 170 and 180, and it explains the concepts more thoroughly than 260 because 260 assumes that you already understand the concepts. There aren't really many surprises with this course, as you kind of get what you expect in terms of lecture material. Tipton is a pretty safe bet for a professor for this class.",
    "Tipton isn't very good, but this class covers a wide range of topics in physics, so it's good if you want to learn both basic and modern physics. Not a lot of work.",
    "Goes over a lot of essential, introductory topics in physics. If you've taken AP Physics in high school (B or C) and did well, you'll have seen many of the topics covered in the class. Most likely, you'll still find the problem sets challenging. They encourage to develop better problem-solving skills.The class gets tougher once you get into relativity. Professor Tipton had some trouble teaching that part of the semester this year.",
    "It's a good class for anyone who's interested in physics and has sufficient math background. But it is not an easy class; you'll have to put in a lot of work. Weekly problem sets can be very long and tedious especially the ones that cover relativity. The midterms were also tough but graded on a curve. The final was easy though. Overall this is a good class for someone who wants to learn more physics than what PHYS180 offers and does not have sufficient math background for PHYS260.",
    "I would recommend this course for physics majors, but not for students looking to get a science credit or who just want to take this class for fun.",
    "Take it if you had a decent physics in high school. It can be very hard to catch up with material and then relativity starts and it's screwed. Also, because of the number of pre-meds and other people who are simply forced to take this class, it's a very impersonal experience.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "It's a really good class. Fair grading, the midterms are scary and the averages are around 65%, but they are generously adjusted up. For me, problem sets took a really long time, and they were the only way that I really learned anything in the class. There are study halls two or three days before the psets are due, so there's always help for people who ask. Take this class if you have a good background in mechanics. Tipton is a really nice guy.",
    "The class is just ok. If you are good at math, you should think about at least trying 260. I hear its really not as bad as people say it is. But if you're willing to teach yourself and looking for a good curve, this is the class to take.",
    "If you have taken AP Physics C, you should be fine in this class. If you haven't, be prepared to work really hard unless you have a knack for physics. I didn't, and I struggled a lot. However, if you want to put in the effort, you'll learn a lot about mechanics and special relativity. I'm still glad I took the class even though it was a struggle for me.",
    "I took this course as a biology major who had not taken AP physics, and it was challenging but I feel like a learned a lot of physics. I do not regret choosing this course, so I would recommend it, especially if your are trying to avoid the crazy premeds that you usually get stuck with. The challenge makes it more interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone because of the awesome professor and interesting material.",
    "As someone without AP Physics C or multi, I sometimes felt I was at a disadvantage, considering a significant majority of the class had. Even so, though the class demanded a fair bit of work (and I did poorly on the first exam), I did pretty well in the end. To students in my position, I would probably recommend it. It's more interesting than the 180 level, but it's quite doable.",
    "Take it. Tipton is a good professor, if a bit incoherent when you catch him off-guard. But his lectures are quite understandable, and the notes are always available online. His good sense of humor doesn't hurt either. For those of you choosing between this and 180: definitely takethis. Firstly, it much more interesting (you get to do relativity which is awesome, albeit a bit difficult). Secondly, and more importantly, the course is on Open Yale Courses. The online course is given by Shankar but it is a wonderful complement to Tipton's lectures and very helpful if you didn't get stuff the first time around. Oh, and don't be intimidated by relativity. It is only one week long, with one (relatively hard) pset, which only counts as 3% of your grade. Any relativity question on the final\/midterm is surprisingly simple. One piece of advice: GO TO STUDY HALL. I can't emphasize this more. It definitely reduces the time you have to spend on psets, and you get to bond with other students who share your plight. Plus, the TAs can help you understand the material if you don't already.",
    "Physics 200 is really boring and often frustrating. Professor Tipton is nice, but not very helpful. I would shop the other Physics sections first.",
    "I'd recommend it with a strong background in math and physics. It was very hard but im glad I took it.",
    "I would recommend this as its not too stressful, the curve is generous, and you can self learn everything as the material is not too difficult.",
    "Search you feelings. Take if you are truely one with the Force.",
    "Great class if you are coming off of AP Physics C. Not too difficult. Good review of AP C with some new and interesting material added.",
    "Cool course, definitely take it over 180 or 260 if you can, tipton is the best",
    "I don't feel like I \"understand\" Physics as well as I hoped I would. My intuitions haven't improved as much as I expected they would. Even though this class was magnitudes better than the one I had in high school, I'm not as comfortable with the material from Physics as I am with any other class I've taken at Yale :\/Maybe too much is being fit into this one-year course?I think I would \"understand\" better if we were asked to explore phenomena more systematically. We could take one go-to situation and systematically add one variable at a time throughout the course. By the end of the course we could do any physics in this situation second-nature, and that would be amazing.Of course, we'll absolutely do a lot of work on other systems as well, but if one in particular \"followed\" us through the course, that could be very effective.Ex:1) forces on a disc on a frictionless surface; 2)same, +friction; 3)same, +nonconservative impact of a projectile => momentum conservation; 4) same (disc + friction + momentum conservation) + torque 5) etc",
    "It was a good class and I would recommend it to anybody who has a strong high school background in physics. It assumes a prior knowledge of certain concepts and moves very quickly!",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow a student (I had not taken AP physics in High School) Especially in the beginning, the problem sets took a while to complete but they really did a good job at explaining the materialPaul Tipton was a good professor - although sometimes the lectures could a bit dry (especially when he was explaining mathematical concepts and applying them to physical phenomena)",
    "One warning I would give to a student contemplating taking this course is that it assumes quite a bit of previous knowledge and thus moves at a fast pace. Another warning is that the graded assessments can be quite challenging.",
    "It is a good introduction to physics, it uses some calc, and it is a good way to learn physics.",
    "I recommend this course to other students. While there is a fair amount of work every week, students learn a lot. This class will be good preparation for anyone who feels their high school class didn't fully prepare them, or for someone who wishes to master intro physics concepts.",
    "Physics 200 is a good course for those students seeking to review concepts learned in AP Physics. The class moves at a very fast pace and the material is presented in a manner meant to enhance prior knowledge of a concept, not to introduce brand-new concepts.",
    "Physics 200 is alright - it isn't too much work and there's a decent curve. Just make sure to study.",
    "Decent physics course... lectures involved rushing through pdf \"lecture note\" slides, so if you haven't read them beforehand, it's quite difficult to follow along and actually learn anything from them. That means the burden of learning the material largely falls onto time outside of class, which is a huge time suck compared to traditional math\/science courses where you learn things in class.Many of the pdf slides contain derivations of different formula and theorems... though they can be interesting, some of them are less than helpful to know. Tipton claims that learning them will enable you to master the material thoroughly, but I believe this should also be balanced with lessons on solving problems (which were lacking in the class overall).Midterms were fair and the final was straightforward. There is a lot of material to learn in a very short amount of time, so study as you go, instead of cramming before the tests.",
    "In my case, I took PHYS 200 because I came into Yale without the necessary math background for PHYS 260. However, 200 is no cakewalk either. If you're premed, and you're just looking to get the physics credit done and over with, then don't take this course. Be prepared to struggle through the problem sets at one point or another. I spent many of my Tuesday evenings at the group study sessions to work on the p sets. Thankfully, the exams are fairly easier than the p sets. Definitely know the lecture notes forwards and backwards, your grade will thank you in the end. And definitely take a look at the example problems from the textbook, you never know when one of those show up on the exam. All in all, PHYS 200 is a pretty good intro physics course.",
    "A standard intro Physics course. Take it if you have to.",
    "It is a good class. Most of the materials are covered by the textbook. For the part that is not covered by the textbook you have to refer to lecture notes, which are not as well organized. Exams are long answers.",
    "Yes if you are a science person.It's not a gut course at all.",
    "Pretty good for a required course. Take it if you feel like you have the sufficient preparation in physics, you probably do. However, for engineers you don't have to take this over 180 and special relativity will likely cause you some stress. It was during that period of the semester that I wished I had taken 180.",
    "Watch Shankar's lectures and read the textbook. You probably won't learn much from Tipton. Be prepared to put in a lot of work.",
    "Absolutely take Phy 200. And don't forget to look online for help!Also taking Chem 118 concurrently would be of great use, as Thermodynamics is covered in depth in the final 2 Phy lectures. For this, Chem 118 would be very useful, as some Thermodynamic question will undoubtedly come up in the final.",
    "If you need to take physics, beware that PHYS200 is a little on the pre-med curve. If you've taken AP Physics C, you're in a great place for first semester, but consider taking PHYS260 and shop both to see if 260 is better taught.",
    "Physics 200 is a lot of work. My year of basichigh school physics and relatively strong math background were not sufficient to prepare me. Paul Tipton is very nice and wants students to do well, but his lectures rarely helped me learn the material. Be prepared to spend hours over several days on the problem-sets. Go to the group problem sessions or, if you can't make them, find buddies who are always willing to work at odd times. On the bright side, I learned a lot of physics, and looking back, I feel proud of that progress.",
    "It's a large lecture intro physics class. It's interesting material and has a generous curve. If you are looking to do physics just to get it over with, this is not the class for you.",
    "Like AP physics C. Until you do relativity. Then it sucks. But everything else was easy.",
    "Its a good class and I would certainly recommend it. I wouldn't recommend professor tipton but perhaps it was just that my learning style didn't match with his teaching style.",
    "Solid intro physics course. Take it if 260 is too much but you want to push yourself. Go to the homework sessions. The practice exams are easier than the actual exams--don't be lulled into feeling secure.",
    "It's solid and interesting",
    "PHYS 200 is a very solid introduction to college physics. Everything from homework and exams to grading and curve is pretty fair and straightforward, which means that you will not easily fail, but you also need to put in enough efforts to do well. The two midterms weigh more than they seem and the final weighs less (because the final is in some way not really cumulative), so be careful with the midterms, as they are somehow more important than they seem. Professor Tipton is a very nice guy, but be prepared that he will conduct the class mainly just by reading off the slides. Curves are a little harsh, though, but if you study every slide carefully and resolve your problems in time with the professor or TAs, you will progress steadily in the class and should do fine."
