    "'A wonderful introduction to Spanish. The pace and format of teaching were simply ideal. Sra. Garcia was absolutely wonderful. She was always very helpful and reassuring, and I always got the feeling that she was really invested in making sure that we (her students) got the best possible experience from the class. She was also super nice about talking with me during office hours. 10\/10, would recommend.",
    "This is a wonderful intro class; I totally recommend it. I learned more in a semester than I ever did in years of high school Spanish. There's a good balance between the different skills involved in learning a language: reading, listening, speaking, and writing. There is homework every day, but it's nothing too time-consuming, and it's also nice how the homework forces you to actually look forward into next lessons. It's great, and Maripaz is such an accommodating professor!",
    "It's an L1 class, so it will be a shock to learn a new language.",
    "It is a good introduction to Spanish. Definitely take it with Maripaz. She is the best!",
    "Very tangible rewards to taking the class, i.e. a marked improvement in and increased understanding of Spanish language (reading\/writing\/speaking). Class is definitely geared towards beginners, so as long as you stay on top of the nightly homework assignments. You leave the class with basic conversational and writing skills; class challenges you to build confidence in ability and fluency when conversing.",
    "Amazing class. Maripaz is the best teacher ever and the curriculum is awesome and fun. Take it!"
