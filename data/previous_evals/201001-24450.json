   "comments": [
    "This is a broad overview of mericna literature of the nineteenth century (but often ties in works fromthe 16th, 17th, and especially 18th centuries to harp on broad literary themes or changes in american literature over time). I would recommend this course, especially if the student is an AMSTUD major and want to kill two bird with one stone- the pre-civil war and broad lit requirement. There is a TON of reading, though ,and the final exam's a doozy, so be prepared to work hard, read a lot, and take initiative. i nice lecture course with a FABOULOUS, SPECTACULAR, AMAZING teacher whom you'll want again to be taught by.",
    "A survey course with a fantastic teacher.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class. A wonderful overview.",
    "Great pre-1900, take it. Readings aren't too bad. Be careful with your TA, if they're a hard ass you won't do as well.",
    "Greta, great course. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - it's a unique way to fulfill the pre-1900 requirement, and involves a lot of good non-fiction (as well as fiction and poetry) and oratory, which I feel like we don't get much of an opportunity to study otherwise. The reading load is heavy, but only about half is really discussed in lecture. Professor Warner is amazingly intelligent and insightful. All in all, I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for an opportunity to read literature that is vitally important and incredibly interesting, even if it's not what we would generally think of as high culture.",
    "This is not a good class for fiction lovers, as it's mostly essay and poetry, but it's still a good survey course and an introduction to a variety of early American writers. My main complaint was that my section, at least, was dominated by a lot of obnoxious English majors (and I say this as one myself) who seemed to be more interested in hearing themselves talk and use big words (and criticize writers) than in the actual material.",
    "The class is a smattering of literature ranging from the seventeenth to nineteenth century and (I think) is meant to be a portrait of nineteenth century America. I wouldn't say that that's true, but I did enjoy a lot of the readings. The workload is inconsistent...the reading varies a lot from class to class, but I enjoyed most of them. The final was fair.",
    "Yes, unequivocally. Take this class, literature and english students of the world.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the covered works. It is relatively easy for a non-intro English class too.",
    "Your grade basically consists of two papers and a final. The grading is reasonable and you probably do not have to go to every lecture (most people don't). However, the texts were not interesting at all and I wouldn't recomment the class to anyone looking for a good time.",
    "A very broad American Lit History survey. Pretty easy, not too much work. It didn't end up very good in the end... so much of the early material is so boring. But Warner was AMAZING on Whitman, Dickinson and Emerson.... if he teaches a seminar on any of those, it would be very worthwhile.",
    "I recommend this class. Sometimes the reading can be a bit much, but you can skim and be selective and still get a lot out of the course. Waking up in time for lecture can be a bit difficult but definitely try to go. Michael Warner is a cool guy.",
    "It's a survey of 19th century American lit with earlier literature thrown in, too. I would recommend it to people who feel like they need a better understanding of how American literature evolved.",
    "Course outlining the development of American literature, beginning at the very earliest American writing (think John Smith and William Bradford) and ending around the time of the Civil War. I would recommend this course.",
    "Take it for the material, definitely. Great era of writing and very interesting most of the time.",
    "This is a solid survey, and the workload is very reasonable. The readings are from an anthology and are great selections. Take it from Professor Warner if you possibly can."
