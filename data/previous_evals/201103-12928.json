    "I would definitely recommend this. The workload isn't bad, the grading is relatively easy, and the professor is great!",
    "Absolutely take this class - Russian is awesome.",
    "The perfect continuation of Russian. The readings are great, and Prof. Muravnik is a remarkable teacher.",
    "This course is excellent. There is a good amount of work for the class, but still taking this course is worth all the work. The class will greatly expand your Russian skills and give you the cultural, historical, and linguistic context for the language.",
    "I would recommend it, if they wanted to study Russian Language past L4.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class for someone beginning advanced study of Russian. The class does a good job of reinforcing information previously learned with new vocabulary and grammar.",
    "A good review of the challenging grammatical concepts of the Russian language and an introduction to reading more challenging texts, with many opportunities to practice composition on topics of choice.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their reading and writing ability in Russian. It is a great course."
