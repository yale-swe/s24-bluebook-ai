   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're stuck choosing between classes for the major. The workload isn't that bad but the material, while ostensibly familiar from high school physics, can get pretty confusing.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need it for the major. It isn't a bad class at all, I really enjoyed it, but I don't think many non-MechE majors take the class. O'Hern and Thibault make the class fun, but make sure you stay on top of the material because it can be a little confusing with the lack of organization.",
    "Fun timez w\/ Corey and Thibault.",
    "You're probably taking it because you have to, but it's not a bad class by any means. The class doesn't really strictly follow a textbook so make sure you go to most of the classes or are able to get notes.",
    "Overall, I liked the course. It was structured in a way that promoted the learning of the lessons instead of students worrying about the grades. I like the addition of the hands-on lab, however the course could use more.",
    "If you have to take the course, then take it. Otherwise, you probably do not want to take this course.",
    "Problem sets were super hard, but TA sessions were super useful and basically solved all the problems, so it ended up not too stressful. You mostly investigate basic physics concepts a little further and learn about tensors and rotation matrices, so none ofthe material is particularly earth-shattering (although the frequency lab was pretty fun, if also stressful). Pretty good class overall, but I don't necessarily recommend it if you don't have to take it.",
    "Great class, even better if you are comfortable with linear algebra and classical mechanics. Professor O'Hern and Thibault are both super chill as instructors, and the problem sets and tests are always fair. If your experience is anything like mine, you'll have fun while you learn."
