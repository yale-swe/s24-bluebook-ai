    "WDesigning Weimar Classicism starts with and tests the notion the Classism is a matter of design and construction. It combines aesthetics and political theory to figure out what intellectual trends and ideas unfolded in Classisism. These inquiries occur on the the basis of close readings of theoretical texts, philosophy, novellas, and lyric poetry. I would highly recommend it since it provides a great introduction to material if it is new to one and offers new ways to think about it even if one already knows some of the texts."
