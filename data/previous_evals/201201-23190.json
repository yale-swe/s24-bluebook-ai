    "Great class if you like sports, but not much in the way of discussion as often as you might like.",
    "Very hard and work intensive but improves writing a lot.",
    "Definitely take it as an English Class. There's a good amount of work, but if you like sports, this is the class for you.",
    "If you want a good intro English class to work on your writing, and are interested in sports, it's definitely worth it. However, be prepared for a lot of work - many drafts of all the papers, and daily writing assignments on top of that. Quite a bit of time is spent going over the mechanics of writing an essay, so it is more useful to freshman than upperclassmen. That having been said, the papers are interesting, and Professor Gibbons is great. You'll get a lot out if it if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "At first, English is difficult and tedious but by the end of the semester you will realize that it is your favorite class. I would recommend it because it's a good intro class.",
    "English 114 is a great class to improve your writing, but with that said one must still keep in their mind that it is a lot of work. For this reason you should make sure that you choose a discussion that is interesting to you so that the work will not seem as bad.",
    "A lot of work but this section was definitely worth it."
