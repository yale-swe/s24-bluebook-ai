    "I would heartily recommend this course! It's intellectually challenging and occasionally emotionally demanding, but the material is fascinating and Joe Fischel masterfully leads the class discussion. The workload is very light; just two response papers and a final assortment of three short essays.",
    "100% one of the best, most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. This is a fascinating course that will change the way you think about sexual consent in a variety of contexts, including rape, sex work, bestiality, and sex between adults and minors. The readings are all pretty great, and I felt like I learned so much. The people in the class were incredibly engaged. There are not many assignments, but there are high expectations for the quality of thought in the assignments. I recommend starting the class Credit\/D.",
    "A fascinating and thought-provoking course. Don't think this is just a self-indulgent look at the way consent at college works (important as that is); TPSC goes above and beyond those matters, looking at how consent is enacted within different sexual subcultures, and even challenging the concept of consent itself. Like most seminars, the quality is largely determined by the other students in it, so be aware of who else is there the first day. Joe's a great guy, though he tends to move very fast through already dense readings. This is not a skim-the-readings course; the discussions go in depth, and Joe is very good at pushing you to solidify your point (a good thing).",
    "This is a really, really great class. Obviously, the subject matter is intense, and also, the academic experience of taking political and legal theory class is also intense. I highly, highly recommend taking this class with Joe because he makes that intense experience approachable. The class works in an online forum, academic and personal essays, and a few films and outside items for analysis. It's multimedia and thorough, and a really excellent class."
