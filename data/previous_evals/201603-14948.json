    "This course was great for developing my ability to understand current research and present it to others. Also, topics in representation theory introduced a lot of interesting material.",
    "The course lectures are essentially run by the students, with the major ideas highlighted by Professor Frenkel throughout the course. Aside from seriously improving my board-work and illustrating where I need to improve in my mathematical presentation skills, the self-study associated with the course was worth at least a semester's worth of directed reading. I learned a great deal of gauge theory and yang-mills theory, as well as a significant amount about the more general theory of instanton-like objects studied in mathematics through tools in algebraic geometry and topology. It has highlighted a huge variety of open research areas in modern mathematics."

    "The strength of topics was that it forced you to engage extensively with current research so that you might present it to others. At the same time this meant that certain topics were not as well covered as others as students did much of the lecturing."

    "I would recommend topics in representation theory to any student wanting to seriously engage in representation theory and improve his or her lecturing skills.",
    "This class is unlikely to be held again, at least in the near future, but I strongly recommend this to any student interested in mathematical physics or representation theory who possesses a good background in Lie theory, algebraic geometry, and some homological tools. There is alway a varying amount of information and understanding that can be gotten out of each lecture, but ultimately they are very much worthwhile experiences. Involves many topics that would be relevant for students\/faculty studying CFT\/high-energy physics, but keep in mind that as a math course, the material is presented in a specific way that isn't always familiar to physicists."
