    "recommend",
    "A class where you will learn a lot.",
    "Not to be missed!",
    "If you want an in-depth overview of applied macroeconomics, this is the ideal course for you. You learn interesting theory and practical models to apply that theory to some of the most relevant economic occurrences in the world today.",
    "Same as above",
    "It was a great course",
    "A fast-paced introduction to everything macro.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",

    "ECON 546 01 is an integral part of the IDE program. It allows you to, regardless of your initial level of proficiency, understand important macroeconomics concepts that would be useful wherever you go - be it in research, academia, or policy work. Highly, highly recommend this course and I'm glad this is a core requirement for the IDE program!"

   "comments": [
    "This course really deepened my understanding of economics in an applied sense. Ive taken a lot of econ classes that focus too much on theory and youre unable to see it applied in the real world. But Dukes managed to really draw it all together and it was thoroughly interesting",
    "learn a lot about the thinking method",
    "Taught me the practical skills I need to know to understand applied macroeconomics.",
    "This course gave me a practical understanding of macroeconomics, that will enable me to apply my knowledge to my future career and everyday life (e.g. when reading the news, discussing current events).",
    "Yes.",
    "Gave good overview of macro + exciting areas within the field",
    "Will help in a general sense to understand macro conditions in the world economy. Very useful for having an understanding of whats going on around you",
    "It helped me to understand a different branch of econ.",
    "Yes, very helpful for deepening my knowledge and developing my dissertation.",
    "The course definitely helped contribute to my research, it was actually vital to my research.",
    "It gave a really helpful overview of issues helpful to any aspiring international policymaker.",
    "It not only deepened by knowledge of macroeconomics, it made me more interested in macroeconomics and has allowed me to better appreciate what is happening in the world and also understand economic news better. Now I know what the Fed is trying to do when they delay raising the Fed rates and how the Bank of Japan is constricted (hitting the zero lower bound of nominal interest rates) when facing stagflation. Amazing course!"
