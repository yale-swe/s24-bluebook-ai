The relaxed environment of the course is a good contrast to those that stress on exams and final projects, without sacrificing the valuable information conveyed in the course.",
    "yes, i think the course deepened my understanding on biological membrane a lot.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it. You get to know a lot of stuffs and you don't get pressured by homework grades or exams."
