   "comments": [
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class- I don't know if Professor Leverett will be back, but I haven't met a person who's been disappointed by his teaching in the two classes I've taken with him thus far. Fabulous class.",
    "If Professor Leverett ever returns as a Jackson Fellow, TAKE a course with him. His a great lecture, he runs good discussions, and he keeps a good balance between theory and practice\/reality. He also has awesome stories from working in government.",
    "This is a class about changing dynamics in International Relations, and is highly engaging. If you're interested in policy and relationships, this is a great class. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "Very broad subject matter, but we get surprisingly deep into each weekly topic. Plenty of material to cover, definitely not a biased class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for anybody who wants a broader understanding of U.S.-China-Persian Gulf relationships in the 21st century. One of my favorite courses this semester.",
    "INRL 611 examines the current issues and historical trends relavent to the interactions among rising Asia (primarily China, but also India as well), the United States, and the Persian Gulf. The class looks at these issues through the lens of globalization and grand strategy, examining both connections among the three regions and specific issues that affect each of them.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone with an interest in US' relations to Asia and the Middle East as well as internal developments and relations within the regions. Especially the Middle Eastern part have I found extremely interesting and I would especially recommend the personal dimension of the course provided by the professor's professional experience with the actors in question. It is a broad course providing a broad, yet good introductory understanding of the field."

   "comments": [
    "As an undergraduate, I don't know that this question is so applicable. But as someone considering an IR MA, this course heightened my interest considerably. It was fascinating for me to look at Chinese Grand Strategy from a variety of differing perspectives and get a better read on what the CCP is trying to accomplish overall.",
    "Opened my eyes to a topic not previously studied. Glad I took it.",
    "Having already taken a number of classes on China, I was excited to find a class that looked at China's relationship with other countries through the lens of grand strategy. This class did exactly that, and so much more. It was an incredible journey through many of the present day issues that affect great power relationships and globalization in three key areas: rising Asia, the United States, and the Persian Gulf. My knowledge of the Persian Gulf was greatly expanded, and I now look at some of China's relationships much differently than I did before taking the course.",
    "I had little academic experience with the field on beforehand and since I am an exchange student it was somewhat different from the rest of my program but very inspiring and has helped me develop my own academic field of interest."
