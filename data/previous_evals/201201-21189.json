   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student (as long as they're open to criticism of the US military). The reading is pretty light, the assignments are straightforward, and the discussion is topical and interesting.",
    "Yes! It is a manageable amount of work (3 response papers, one final paper--review of Hurt Locker--and blog posts)",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The professor is amazing, the readings are interesting, and the work is manageable. DEFINITELY take this class. Whether you're a WGSS major, or whether you still can't figure out what WGSS stands for, take this class for sure. It will blow your mind.",
    "Take this class! Professor Montegary is amazing and really pushes for her students to think critically and ask important questions as you delve into what makes the military tick, how it pervades our everyday lives, and how it constructs and reinforces traditional masculinity. This is a very accessible WGSS class, and people who did and did not have a background in the course material all had their perspectives included. There's a class blog for talking about current events related to the military or masculinity, manageable and interesting reading, and only three reading response papers and a final paper (though this may change in the future). Overall, a great class I would recommend to everyone as it deals with really, really important issues.",
    "This was an AMAZING course, but I am not sure it will be offered again because Liz Montegary was a visiting professor and will not be here next semester. This was my favorite class this semester. The readings were all extremely interesting, and the workload was totally manageable that you had time to do all the readings well without being pressed for time. The people in my class also made this semester great. Discussions were always lively and never strayed from the course material and the readings. Not a lot of reading, 3 reading responses that were 3-4 pages long, 5 blog\/comment posts that had to be about 200 words long, and a final paper that was 5-7 pages long. It is a shame that Montegary wont be at Yale next year.",
    "Certainly an interesting class. Quality probably depends a lot on who else is in the class, but Professor Montegary is great, so definitely shop it.",
    "Definitely, even though Professor Montegary is unfortunately leaving. The material was often fascinating and Professor Montegary often pushed us to go deeper with intersectional analysis, which encouraged us to situate any discussion within the broader historical and social context. The discussion was often difficult since Professor Montegary asks complex questions, but this motivated me to think deeper and read closer. She constantly drove us to think critically and synthesize the class themes in complex ways, so that we emerged with a nuanced picture of the relationships between manliness, the military, race, sexuality, imperialism, disability, technology, and more.",
    "A class about how the military and its militarizing nature affects ideals of masculinity (as well as people in general) in US society and vice versa. I would totally recommend this to another student, probably someone interested in WGSS themes, because it's a great way to examine a specific way that gender& national ideals are formed in US society."
