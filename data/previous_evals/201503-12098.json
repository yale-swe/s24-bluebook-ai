   "comments": [
    "Please take German 110! German is an amazing language, and the class is loads of fun.",
    "German 110 is a great introduction to the German language. It is taught with a focus on verbal communication, and the class is very enjoyable and is taught at a great pace.",
    "I would recommend the subject as I found that the course encouraged you to actually learn German in an active manner that was fun and engaging. The final project was great as it spanned a long period of time where you were able to talk with fellow peer in German consistently and so you were able to improve your pronunciation,",
    "I would recommend GMAN 110 to another student interested in learning German. I think it is a good introduction to the language and to the culture in general. It is what you expect of any introduction to a language, focusing on vocabulary and verb conjugations. I think the way that the course is designed appeals to all kind of learners (visual, auditory, etc.).",
    "Yes would definitely recommend this class to any student",
    "I would recommend it, but I would say that it is very difficult. The immersion is very tough to get accustomed to, and I do not believe it is the best way to conduct a class. I would think that a 90% immersion would be ideal. Where all conversation is conducted in German, but when a word is not known, then the English translation could be swiftly given and conversation could resume.",
    "This is the class to take if you're looking to start learning German. It really is not a lot of work, although you will certainly benefit from it more if you dedicate some amount of time outside of class each day to study over the concepts, rather than waiting for assignments or tests to cram everything. The class was very relaxed and the final video project proved to be more fun than I was expecting.",
    "It's the introductory German class. Take it if you want to learn German. There's not too much more to say about it beyond that."
