    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a drawing class after basic drawing - I wouldn't recommend it to a student without prior drawing experience.",
    "Figure Drawing is a great class to take if you like drawing\u0097it's especially a great complement to a schedule full of non-art classes. This class is not about getting all the proportions correct or your shading just so; it is more about how you want to approach the rendering of the human figure and how you want to include it in your own personal art. Some previous drawing experience is good\u0097Professor Messer does not give a great deal of specific technical advice. However, you don't need to be an Ingres or da Vinci to get something out of this class. If you want to explore your own artistic voice and approach to the figure, take this class! If you want someone to tell you what projects to do and how to draw, you should probably take another class.",
    "YES. Very good intermediate art class",
    "Yes, absolutely. Fantastic class.",
    "Yes, it's an awesome class, and you can have fun listening to music and making art. It also really helps with understanding the structure of the human body and how to manipulate space so that it's not just some floating figure in the middle of empty space.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You get back exactly what you put in, with regard to both workload and improvement. Class consists, usually, of sketching a nude model in various poses and using a number of mediums.",
    "Figure Drawing is a studio class where you spend four hours a week drawing. It's not a lot of homework, but the effort is definitely there. For those who are taking this as a freebie, beware: it will be very hard to slack in this class when your peers are turning out great work.Take this class if you want to improve the way you see and draw. Can be great practice for those who want to improve technical skills, a chance to explore for those who want a creative outlet.",
    "Definitely if you are interested in the human form. We had life models most classes and ewre free to experiment with a range of techniques and materials."
