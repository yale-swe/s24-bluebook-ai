   "comments": [
    "Technical skills, and problem solving skills. Learning how various technologies work, and how to code etc.",
    "This class is advertised as an overview of various engineering areas to help a prospective engineer choose what they might want to focus on. In this regard, the class is not great. The various fields of engineering are focused on for the first half, but just barely in depth enough to give you an idea of what they're about. However, the second half of the course more than makes up for that. Groups of students are partnered with a client on campus to create a functioning product. The hands-on learning achieved through this project was immense, and the process was super fun.",
    "This class was absolutely incredible and I learned so much. Though the class doesn't go in-depth into all parts of engineering, the broad overview it provided was worthwhile. I learned a bit about programming, circuitry, mechanical engineering, solidworks, 3D cads, laser cutting, 3D printing, etc.",
    "How to deal with sociopaths in groups, some self-taught knowledge of coding.",
    "I learned so much about design thinking from ENAS 118 and how to use much of the equipment in the CEID. From this course I gained some basic knowledge about 3D modeling, 3D printing, soldering, wiring, silicone casting, and woodworking. This course really helped think about my engineering interests and made me more interested in using all of the CEID's incredible resources.",
    "I now have a better understanding of what various disciplines within engineering entail as to their day-to-day workings, practical skills used, etc. I greatly improved my Arduino coding abilities, as well as brushed up my powertool\/handtool know-how.",
    "I learned SO MUCH in this class, and in really fun ways! I learned some (very) basic coding, wood shop skills, great team-work skills, some basic heat info, very basic strength and deformation background, green engineering methods and ideology, and more!",
    "Engineering",
    "During this course I gained a broad understanding of what it means to be an engineer, including what the different disciplines are and how to evaluate and solve engineering problems in a logical and effective way. Additionally, I gained a basic knowledge of many of the tools around the CEID, as well as got to practice with many tools which I have already used before.",
    "I learned a vast expanse of knowledge across the engineering fields. I also learned hands-on skills such as computer programming, arduino programming, different construction techniques, woodworking, laser cutting, and 3d printing. I also gained an insight and affirmation on my interest in pursuing engineering.",
    "I got to survey the different fields of engineering and learned things like circuitry, and how to build structures.",
    "introduction to basic skills in different types of engineering (arduino, coding, physics)",
    "Before I took this class, I vaguely knew what the idea of \"engineering\" was, but this course really gave me a hands-on approach to project-based learning, applying skills I learned from the course.",
    "I learned how to use various tools in the shop, work with a team, design a product for a client, and meet mandatory deadlines.",
    "Since the class is a survey course for half the semester, I learned a little bit about coding, shop work, and a lot of electronics with arduino. You get to know your way around the ceid pretty well too!",
    "In taking this course I learned about various engineering disciplines and what roles these disciplines play in our society. This provided me with insight into what type of engineering I would like to pursue as a major. Additionally, this course provided me with real world experience and by assigning a group of three other students and me to develop a solution for a client. This part of the course taught me about the design process and provided me with valuable practical experience.",
    "I learned the basics of engineering fields such as computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. I got a real feel for these engineering fields, especially electrical engineering and computer science. I also got a feel for working with others in a group on an engineering project.",
    "many many many skills -- processing, power tools, 3D printer, arduino, etc etc -- relating to all types of engineering",
    "I have learned a sporadic range of skills relating to different engineering fields. It was a broad overview of every engineering but the final project was true learning experience. I learned how to work in a team towards a deadline and a lot about computer science.",
    "I was able to develop practical knowledge of Arduino and other technical skills (soldering, power tools, etc.) that the CEID provided. ENAS 118 also allowed me to develop my abilities to work in a team and towards a collective goal.",
    "-a comfort with learning technical skills in a short period of time -basic coding -teamwork and work distribution -the basics of the major types of engineering taught at Yale"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall I thought this was an incredibly well taught and engaging course. The only thing is that occasionally the material taught in class was not enough to do the homework, which meant that I had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out the basics before I could do the homework. So it would have been helpful to have the class lectures focused more on what is expected for the homework, especially for the coding homeworks.",
    "The class gives a great introduction into engineering and can thus provide a good amount of direction in terms of what type of engineering one might like to pursue. That said, the class seems to show the fun and interesting parts of engineering without exposing the more difficult computational (science\/math) parts that go along with it.",
    "Strength: can be \"fun\" Weakness: too many to list. Inadequate immersion in areas of engineering, never learned anything useful from teachers. Students also don't have the right to choose the final project, so may be stuck with one that doesn't spark interest or inspired ideas.",
    "The strengths are its ability to have students engaging often with one another and its thought provoking nature. However, at times during the final we felt that the material learnt earlier was insufficient to help us in designing the product and actually creating it.",
    "This class really quickly gives you a brief overview of many different disciplines of engineering in a fun way. The last third of the semester is very work intensive because of the design project.",
    "I liked the general organization of spending about a week on each field. The lab sections were especially helpful in practicing skills, and I enjoyed the buildup of our labs to finally temper chocolate. The content of the lectures were a bit general\/much of it I kind of already knew, so that could be improved, made more in-depth, add fun, quirky facts. Maybe have more guest lecturers who come in and talk about exactly what it is they do on the daily basis. Because lecture content was so-so and not tested on, some people would just skip them. That's not to say the course should instead do tests, but more worthwhile lecture content might solve that issue and make students attend lectures because they find it a valuable use of their time.",
    "There are too many strengths to name for ENAS118. I LOVED working in the CEID and collaborating with my team and our client for our finally project. The only negative was that it was a HUGE time commitment, and as an athlete and a prospective engineering major, time is not something I have an abundance of (does anyone at Yale, really?). The time I spent on my project was all SO fun, as I loved my team and our project, but it was definitely a LOT of work. Another negative was that they did teach us VERY basic coding (which was cool!), but the level of coding skills they expected of us for labs and homework was much higher than what was taught, and I came in with absolutely no coding background. ***I also wish we had learned more about engineering in general, such as what kind of job market is open to engineers\/what you can do with an engineering degree.",
    "Less lectures and more higher level labs",
    "Incredible course. Some labs didn't fully explain a field but in general very engaging and informative",
    "The course was great in that it allowed for a significant amount of hands-on interaction between the Thursday lab sections as well as the final projects, which I believe to be one of the major strengths of the class, especially as a prospective engineering major who has had little insight into the physical aspects of what it means to practice engineering, up until now. The overall structure of the class was very informative and interesting. The only weakness that I would point out, is that I wish there was more feedback during some of the assignments in the first half of the class before the final project.",
    "The strengths of this course involve the variety of topics discussed, and the final project task that brought together elements from the course. The professors and TA's were fantastic. There are no weaknesses that I can think of.",
    "I liked the direction of the course, but would like more focus on mechanical and electrical engineering.",
    "Really interesting and hands-on but a lot of work at the end of the semester",
    "The strength of this course is definitely the final project, where all of the skills you learn in the class lead up to a culminating effort with classmates to solve some kind of problem presented by your client. Though I spent many long nights in the CEID for this class, I feel like I'm that much more prepared for any other classes that require hands-on effort in the future.",
    "Strengths are that it gives a good base for prospective freshmen engineers, and it is useful for real-life skills. Weaknesses are that not much time is given for each engineering field, and some of the labs are repetitive.",
    "I really liked the structure where you dabbled in skills before applying them to the final project halfway through the semester. The weeks when we had multiple homework assignments in the first half were kind of tough though. You have to learn to budget time really well. The professors really care and will spend extra time with you if you ask for the help!",
    "This course was very strong in providing an introduction to many different fields of engineering and in exposing students to the practical aspects of being an engineer. This course, however, did not provide much depth into the different engineering disciplines due to time constraints.",
    "This course covers many engineering fields, yet there are only two or three fields for which you actually gain a hands-on feeling and understanding and in which you actually learn how to do the engineering for them. For me, these fields were mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. I didn't really get a feel for or learn enough about the other engineering fields since they were more overlooked. Also, I felt that many of the group projects could have been on more diverse topics because most of them came down to programming into a circuit as the solution to the problem.",
    "strengths: great survey course",
    "Strength: It gives you an overview of all different engineerings and a small insight into what each one does as well as a taste in labs of some hands on experience. Weakness: The overview is broad and so you don't go as in depth as you might like.",
    "Strengths: -very engaging homework assignments -lots of hands-on learning -ability to learn about each type of engineering offered at Yale Weaknesses: -some of the lectures were hard to focus on so early in the morning, especially since some, especially the mechanical engineering lectures, were very technical and included many equations -no syllabus with deadlines at the beginning of the semester: it would have been helpful if it said on the syllabus that most assignments would be due Wednesday night -would be helpful to know in the first lecture and on the syllabus that there would be a lab section that was not for additional credit in addition to lectures"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was incredibly helpful to cover all the engineering fields so that I could have a better understanding of which field best suits my interests. In addition, the final project in which we designed a product for a client provided a real-world application for what we had learned in class. This class is not an easy, though, so be prepared for a large workload, especially in the first few weeks and during the final project.",
    "If you are a person that likes making things, this class is awesome.",
    "DEFINITELY!! DO IT if you think you might be interested in engineering!!",
    "Not at all. Gives you a sense of what engineering is, but doesn't even teach you the very basics. Rather self-teach or take specific intro courses.",
    "Definitely take this course if your interested in any aspect of Engineering. Be prepared, however, to take time out of your day to dedicate solely to this class. Its a lot of fun and a stimulating class, but also a very high workload especially during the last few weeks of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are at all interested in engineering or design.",
    "I know I, going into this course, wanted to use it to see if I wanted to pursue engineering. If others are also seeking to use it for this purpose, I would say I don't recommend it, simply because it didn't really help me decide. Otherwise, it's a fun course that exposes you to a non-pen-and-paper learning style that adds diversity to your learning experience. Switches up your gears a little. For that, it's valuable.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE IT! It was SO cool, especially as a prospective engineering major. It's a huge time commitment, but SO worth it in my opinion!n",
    "Yes. Incredible. Larry and Dean Vince are super into it and ready to help you out. Lots of work at end of semester but well worth it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as it was by far my most enjoyable course this fall. This especially goes for anyone thinking of majoring in some form of engineering since, at least in my case, ENAS 118 did a great job of introducing the different fields of engineering to me and better informing me as I move forward and think more about what I want to major in and what I want to concentrate my time in during these next 3 and a half years at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. This is a course that is highly beneficial to anyone who wants to explore different aspects of engineering before pursuing a single track, or who just wants to gain some simple engineering and programming skills that they can use in the future.",
    "Yes! It was such a fun course.",
    "Would recommend!",
    "I would definitely take this class again. One, you learn tons of extremely useful skills that are relevant at Yale, and are still relevant well outside of the classroom. I'd never used power tools before this class, yet afterwards I'd drilled and screwed in more screws than I will probably ever want to see again (in a good way). Not only that, I got extensive time with the laser cutter, while is probably one of the more exclusive pieces of hardware here at Yale.",
    "Yes, but only to those who want to do engineering or computer science.",
    "I would definitely recommend this! It's really cool to spend weeks working on something with a team you get to know really well and being proud of that product. Your ability to apply the skills with electronics, coding, and woodwork\/metalwork improves incredibly by the end of it. It is a big time commitment though towards the end of the semester. Worth it!",
    "Due to the practical experience and increased understanding of various engineering disciplines, I gained by taking this course, I would highly recommend this course to other students. I would especially recommend this course to any student unsure about which type of engineering to pursue in college.",
    "If you are a freshmen who is really interested in engineering or comp sci, I highly recommend this course. It had a few flaws but it was definitely worth taking. It teaches you everything about the CEID, and it really gives you a feel for many of the engineering fields. Even though you won't learn everything about engineering, the final project at the end of the semester is a great challenge that you will definitely enjoy and learn from.",
    "yes!! especially if you're not planning on majoring in an engineering or stem field. it's a fun time!",
    "If you're unsure about what kind of engineering you want to do or even just curious about engineering, this course is amazing. The class helps dip your toe into the water of what you could do and labs challenge you intellectually to think creatively and outside the box.",
    "I would highly recommend ENAS 118 to all students. The technical skills and knowledge one acquires from the course is incredibly valuable. The course is offered in the CEID and allows students to engage with everything the CEID provides. Dr. Wilen and Dean Wilczynski, along with the course's TFs, were great to learn from and offered an incredible amount of support. The second half of the course involved a 6-7 week project that required a lot of work and offered a lot of fun.",
    "This course is very helpful if you're deciding if you want to be an engineer or what type of engineering you would like to do. Be warned though, the workload does vary a lot between weeks. Also, you are also required to partake in a 2-hour lab section where you apply the knowledge from lecture. Sometimes there is additional work for this lab on top of the assignment given in lecture. However, completing the work in this class is so fulfilling and the professors are so incredibly helpful and personable. Professor Wilen is always ready to help and when it was crunch time for the projects, it would be common to see Professor Wilen helping students until midnight or even past. He and Professor Wilczynski were so obviously and wonderfully committed to our growth, learning and success. I loved their passion."
