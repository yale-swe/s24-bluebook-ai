   "comments": [
    "recommend taking this course, the instructor was very engaging and made the sometimes dull material much more interesting than it should have been.",
    "Tough class but very intellectually satisfying. The final was brutal, still waiting to see what the curve might be like.",
    "Great class, great teacher, definitely my favorite class the semester I took it. Shankar is a great lecturer, explains everything clearly, is always willing to take questions, and has a great sense of humor. Problem sets are never overly challenging, generally took about how long one would expect a pset to take. Exams were definitely also manageable. Definitely feltlike a course where you walked out of the room every day having learned something and where you didn't have to kill yourself studying in order to learn it. Highly, highly recommended although if you're thinking about taking this course, this review probably isn't going to change much.",
    "Honestly I don't understand why everyone thinks Shankar's lectures are so amazing. I was immediately confused as soon as he started talking, and problem sets were rarely related to what he goes over in lecture. I don't think you actually learn that much in this class. Take 410. This class is kind of useless.",
    "If Shankar is teaching, then take this class! This is easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Shankar is the best lecturer I've ever heard. The problem sets are very interesting and aren't that hard. The exams are fun too.",
    "Definitely take it if you're not 100% sure in your abilities in physics. And if for nothing else, definitely take it for Shankar!",
    "Yes it is a cool class, a manageable amount of work and Professor Shankar makes it fun and understandable.",
    "Phsyics 401 was very well taught, well paced, and provided a great way to learn more fully classical mechanics at a deeper level. The exams were great: challenging but doable if the concepts of class were fully understood. Class periods were a little long, but worth it for the free Fridays.Shankar is an all-star. He knows his stuff, and knows how to teach it. The class dynamic was stimulating and engaging. He's truly the best physics professor I've had at Yale.",
    "Tough but not impossible, a great way to learn some advanced physics in a manageable way. If you've taken 260, this class might seem a little repetitive but it'll cement the things that you learned in 260 and add onto it as well. It especially gave me a much better understanding of relativity and four-vectors.",
    "Physics 401 is an interesting middle ground, as it appeals to physics majors who avoid taking 410. It is a little slow coming from 260, but there is some new material covered. The course is significantly less work than 410, and it is worth taking if you want to avoid devoting the majority of your time each semester to a physics course. The class is a bit disorganized and it is hard at times to follow the main ideas of each lecture. The problem sets can be kind of annoying, since they often do not correspond to a textbook or examples done in class. The TA (Carl) is quite helpful and is good at helping students work through problem sets.",
    "I went from 260 to 401 and I feel like I should have taken 401 in the very beginning. The lectures are very well-structured and the problem sets are very challenging. Professor Shankar is such a good lecturer, and he really knows his stuff.",
    "The class provides a useful background in classical mechanics, kepler's laws, special relativity and thermodynamics. The material did not seem particularly advanced compared to entry-level physics courses, except perhaps the lagrange and hamiltonian methods. The problem sets were very reasonable and corresponded well with Shankar's lectures. Shankar is a great teacher, and I would definitely suggest taking this class with him.",
    "Title pretty much says it all. Shankhar is a great teacher, and it's really fun to be in his class (if you like physics, I guess). Covers the same material as the intensive track in two semesters instead of three, which much better instruction. If you're thinking about being an intensive major, just be wary of hidden math pre-reqs. I started in 410 after coming out of 200\/201 and felt I was in over my head.",
    "It was a very good class and explained PHYS 200a really well... It also reminded me why I love physics.",
    "Not an easy course, but an awesome one. Particularly with Prof. Shankar.",
    "Fantastic course! Professor Shankar picks great examples, which enables him to point out the important applications of the theory without a ton of number crunching. Not too difficult or too much work but the exams are tricky because they don\u0092t match the problem sets or class material that well.",
    "Good class to decide whether or not be major in Physics."
