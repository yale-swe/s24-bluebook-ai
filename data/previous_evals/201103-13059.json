   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to learn more about the future of sustainability and systems thinking",
    "Good class, but really redundant. Take it if you have a basic understanding of environmental and enconomic sustainability and want to learn more about change management.",
    "This class covers both institutional problems of sustainability and the change management strategies used to solve them, with examples from case studies on U.S. corporations and Professor Newman's time in the Office of Sustainability at Yale. Professor Newman is very passionate about the material, and she takes great interest in the students' passions. This class is great for stoking interest in campus projects and programs that can be done by students, and you learn a lot about Yale's systemsand plans on the administrative level",
    "I would recommend EVST 170 to another student. It wasn't my favorite seminar but if you are interested in change management, then this class is for you.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are very interested in sustainability and excited about designing ways to improve sustainability.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class if you are interested in exploring the many aspects entailed when discussing what it means to be sustainable.",
    "Overall, I'd recommend it- you learn about working towards sustainability through Yale facilities. This class started out frustratingly vague, but I ended up learning about general topics that helped me gain a broader perspective on sustainability and its challenges. The last half of the semester we learned about Yale facilities and got to go on class walks to places like the roof of Becton, so that was really cool. Not a lot of work either- readings were pretty interesting after the first two assignments. The final project is a lot of fun if you choose something you are really interested in working on."
