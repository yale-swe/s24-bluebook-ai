    "I definitely improved my ability to close-read complex passages of texts. A large portion of this course was focused on close-reading these selected passages and then extrapolating those insights to the work at-large, which I found extremely useful, especially when writing papers (as I knew exactly which textual evidence to reference). Of course, my writing skills improved since we wrote 3 papers in this class, as did my analytical skills in general.",
    "I learned how to read critically and quickly, since there was a lot of reading material per class. I also learned how to write more effectively and write papers in a longer form.",
    "I expanded how I thought about American literature, American themes, and American culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The breadth of the works we covered -- this isn't the stereotypical \"American\" literature course that focuses on the writings of primarily white men, etc. We did spend a substantial amount of time on Whitman and Moby Dick, but they are integral to the shaping of American literature. We also spent a LOT of time reading essays by Octavia Butler, poetry by Audre Lorde, Patti Smith, etc. There was a HUGE emphasis on what it means to be progressive in this course, and Brandon was wonderful in shaping that emphasis. Brandon is such a positive person, and it's evident that cares so much about his students and their thoughts. He has this magical way of taking something unpolished a student says in class and extending it to analysis that is borderline profound and revelatory. The reading assignments are also very fair and completely doable for each class (Moby Dick does get a bit dry though). Brandon is also extremely flexible with deadlines. He also meets with every student for every paper, which is very valuable. TLDR - the main strength of this course is very clearly Brandon. He's a gem. Take anything you can with him. Weaknesses: Sometimes I thought we spent a little *too* much time close-reading a couple passages here and there, and therefore lost the overall focus of the work. This happened especially when we read Moby Dick; we'd read some ~50-60 pages for class and discuss ~3-5. However, I do recognize that is understandable when considering how dense Moby Dick is -- there could definitely be an entire class devoted to it. Other than that, this class was positively lovely.",
    "The array of genres and authors was great. The discussion\/round-table class structure was a great way to participate and learn. For me, the course readings focused too heavily on poetry. I would have liked more short stories.",
    "The course had a lot of reading material for a given class, which was hard because there was no way to discuss all of the poems we had to read for one day. On the other hand, the reading material was very interesting and always related to many elements of American society so that we could discuss what people's views of our country were.",
    "The course presented a wide range of material and writers. I appreciated how we touched on poetry, literature, film, visual art, and music. It provided a more holistic view and allowed us to see how every art media influences another. I also enjoyed how we looked at individuals from very different backgrounds in order to see what \"American\" meant to them and how it has changed and varied, but also stayed the same, from generations and across social and cultural boundaries. I think it would be interesting to also include a dance component seeing as how other arts were included. This could be a piece inspired by one of the works of art, or looking at similar themes of Americanization. Martha Graham explored this idea and was fighting against fascism in the 30s and 40s with her piece \"Appalachian Springs.\" Overall though I was impressed with the design of the course and the discussions facilitated by Brandon, who was an encouraging leader.",
    "The class is very engaging and challenges what is traditionally thought to be American Literature. I do think that it isn't fully representative of the American identity because the pieces chosen leaned towards certain identities.",
    "I think this course would benefit from more out of classroom learning. While we talked about trips to art galleries and museums, we did very little. Given my personal excitement about these aspects of the course I was disappointed that less of this was done than was advertised.",
    "Great class in class, graded papers needed to be handed back faster"

    "YES YES YES!!! I could not recommend it more. The course is so chill, but you learn a lot and read a great variety of works (see what I wrote about the breadth of the works we read earlier). Brandon is wonderful, fair, low-key an English genius, and very understanding that students take other classes, too. There are 3 papers (the last of which had a creative exploration option -- very fun!): 2 4-5 page ones, and the final project, which has some flexibility. Like I said, extremely manageable, and a pretty much painless WR credit. Reading is very manageable, class discussions are fun (75 minutes feels a tad long at 4pm on a Monday, though, gotta say), and if your class clicks, you'll have an even better experience. If you are looking for a very doable WR credit with a great instructor and a diverse set of works to read, TAKE THIS CLASS. You will not regret it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to another student. It's a really good introductory literature course, since it covers a great deal of literature from throughout American history. With poems and novels written by American writers, it's easy for students to discuss things about American politics and society, especially in the modern era.",
    "I would recommend this course. I am not a huge fan of writing, but I wanted to take an English class for my WR credit because I knew I only had a few more semesters left to take a 'real' English class. I was impressed with the spread of work that we explored and it was all quite interesting.",
    "Yes if the student likes to read a lot.",
    "If you don't mind doing a lot of reading, this is a good course."
