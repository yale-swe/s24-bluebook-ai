    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great continuation of the French 150 course, although I like the readings and movies from 150 better. You can learn a lot from this.",
    "My absolute favorite class this semester. Mme Skorupa is a wonderful teacher, she's got a great wit and warmth that makes students feel comfortable speaking in class and engaging themselves. The material was wonderful -- movies and texts with a focus on the arts. Also, the workload is just SO much more reasonable than L4. The readings are shorter and better with more focus on each. I loved how Mme Skorupa always brought snacks to class too! If you have a choice, absolutely try to get Mme Skorupa's section -- you will develop a greater appreciation for French!",
    "Take this with Mme Skorupa. She's wonderful and really cares about each of the students. She goes ten extra miles to make class fun-- things like baking us food, bringing in candy during tests-- which makes taking an otherwise work-intensive class worth it. Don't take this as a fifth class-- it's a lot of constant work and is pretty time-consuming.",
    "French 151, like French 150, provides a good, in-depth grammar review, coupled with interesting readings and films and lots of class discussion. The workload is substantial but reasonable, and you will truly get better at French. Take it! Also, Mme. Skorupa is a delight, so consider taking the class with her.",
    "I would; it's a great way to get in some language practice.",
    "I would only take a French course with Mme. Skorupa. French 151 is actually a fun way to keep practicing your French, so I would definitely take it.",
    "I liked it, and I certainly learned a lot. It is a very useful stepping stone to the higher level french courses."
