    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Dr. Zheng was such a clear instructor. The way that he presented the information was far clearer than the way that the other epi teachers have presented it in the past. He was able to teach the information in a useful and easily understood and practical way.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Dr Zheng is very difficult to understand. The material can be somewhat challenging and the language barrier makes it all the more difficult to understand. His knowledge is remarkable, however, and he is an overall excellent instructor."
