    "If you took 132 or placed in to 142 and are at all serious about improving your Spanish, then taking this course as the next one in the sequence is a no-brainer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a student with a general understanding and background in Spanish who wants to improve their cultural and grammatical understanding. It was an engaging, helpful class to a student who grew up with Spanish in her household but never had the opportunity to really delve into the language.",
    "This has been my favorite course at Yale by far. It is a must-take if you have previous exposure to Spanish. You will have individualized attention, plenty of one-on-one and group discussions, and a fantastic experience. Profesora Alexandrov is the best. Seriously.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this to another heritage speaker.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another heritage student! In fact I already have. To several students, in fact."
