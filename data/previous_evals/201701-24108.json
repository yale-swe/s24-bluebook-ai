    "One big weakness of this course is the lack of ability to choose the project on the part of the students. I realize that past projects were poorly defined and unsuccessful, so perhaps the administration felt some pressure to ensure the success of this year's, however I think the execution was a bit ham-handed. It would be great to allow groups to plan their own projects. Depending on ABET requirements, it would be good to get this planning started in the Fall, and have students get together early to discuss. If students can define their own roles and goals, I think they will take on more interesting projects, take on more responsibilities, and have better results.",
    "The biggest weakness is that I couldn't pick my own project. I'm more on the theoretical side and my assigned section of the project was mostly hands-on and played to none of my strengths or research areas. I made the most of what was given to me but I wish I could have chosen my own project"

   "comments": [
    "While this course has its own flaws, I will take this opportunity to express some criticism of the major as a whole, since this is the climactic senior project. I think the EE dept needs a bit of a shakedown and needs to improve before I can wholeheartedly recommend the ABET EE track (and thus this course) to anyone. For faculty: take a look at other prominent organizations' pedagogy. MIT, for instance, has awesome, practical labs and instruction. There is much that can be done to make courses in the EE major better. More coding projects and practical, hands-on use of real industry tools could be incorporated throughout. EE majors need to know good coding practice (beyond ENAS130) too! Hindsight is 20-20 and probably gives me a more critical perspective, but I feel that there are a good number of holes in the Yale EENG curriculum that could be filled, especially given the weight that the name of Yale is supposed to convey. This does not mean I haven't had my share of sleepless nights, and that more work should be piled on. It's simple: the EE dept courses need to be looked at and systematically restructured and optimized to better prepare students for the industry.",
    "If you aren't ABET, find a professor and a project that best suit your interests. You'll have a much more rewarding experience."
