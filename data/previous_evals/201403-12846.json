    "I would recommend French 140 to another student. I have definitely learned a lot this semester.",
    "It's a small class and you become very close with everyone else in it. The readings have to do with solitude and immigration, which can be a tad depressing but the class itself is very fun and not too hard. You have to just dedicate about 1-2 hours to it a day.",
    "I took it because I needed a language requirement. I would recommend it if you dont mind the extra work.",
    "I would highly recommend Caroline's session."
