   "comments": [
    "Recommend to anyone interested in history or South Africa",
    "Good synopsis of South Africa - region not just country. Between this and History of Africa since 1800 (Mahoney's other class)... definitely pick the latter!",
    "really good class. the apartheid lectures were fascinating.",
    "Yes, if you like the history of southern africa. a lot of facts to know but good overall",
    "Better than average survey course. Covers a lot of material, but the papers are fun to write and the exams focus on the big ideas. Really interesting other world class because of all the similarities with America.",
    "It's a really great and informative lecture that's workload isn't too bad with some smart decisions on selecting what to read and what not to. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "The material is fascinating, but Prof. Mahoney is not a good lecturer. I learned a lot about how to study history, and I'm really glad I put in the effort to get past the lectures and learn the material. This class is a good \"rest of world\" credit for the history major.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "It's a very good class, with a moderate reading load. If you are looking for a good survey introduction to the history of South Africa and the influence of the West in this part of the world, it's a very good class.",
    "Take this class, stop being ignorant about Africa, this history is more interesting than anything you will find in the West.",
    "If you want a solid general knowledge of the area, take it.",
    "Don't take this class unless you really have time to commit. The lecture is bad, the tests are impossible, and you won't come out of it feeling like you learned something valuable.",
    "This class is a good survey of a lot of material - you really learn a lot - about half the classes were about South Africa, but you also learn about Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana. I would recommend the class.",
    "Only take this class if you are a) already interested in South Africa, b) are good at learning from lecture only, c) you can memorize terms for finals easily. Otherwise it is just too much to fully comprehend and remember. I am glad I took the course as I did not have any background in South African history, but the course could be much better organized and planned out.",
    "The material is fascinating but it is really poorly taught. Professor Mahoney is a nice guy and going to office hours is great. BUT. The lectures are totally disorganized. You WILL be cramming for the midterm and final. Nothing about what you're supposed to do for the papers is clear. Also. Do not be in Professor Mahoney's section. He grades WAY harder than the TA ever does.",
    "reat class, especially if you are looking for thet ROW credit. Oh and by the way, Apartheid South Africa is pretty important stuff. All history majors shoud be required to take the course.",
    "If you want to learn about Southern Africa, take this class. It's an awesome place.",
    "maybe",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.Mahoney is one of the BEST history professors at Yale. I totally came across this class by chance - my TA from Total War recommended it to me. I have no background in Africa, but Mahoney makes the information accessible and gets you interested in it. (If you're a history major with no experience with the geographical region this is a really good opportunity to fulfill requirements too).Also, he is really selective in choosing readings and a lot of documentaries\/films which is great because the load is manageable - aka you can actually do the reading and watch the movies instead of skimming 400 pages a week.And the lectures really are so good - they are planned out and directed but Mahoney delivers them with energy and keeps it interesting. If you take it, try to take the section that Mahoney leads. If you do the work for this class (which you definitely can), section is actually really productive and useful (and not that terribly painful section that you dread) with him leading it.",
    "Take this class. It's a great way to fulfill a rest of the world requirement. Prof. Mahoney is an engaging lecturer and it's not too much work. Don't expect it to be all Apartheid all the time though, plenty of other subjects are covered.",
    "Great course! Take it!"
