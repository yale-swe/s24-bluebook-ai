    "This is a wonderful class! If you are deciding between L5 Hebrew classes, this one is definitely the way to go. It is fun and relevant and definitely becomes a little community since it is such a small group. There is a pretty consistent, but not unmanageable, flow of homework, and the material is actually quite useful, especially if you are looking to eventually spend some time in Israel.",
    "Great class!! Must take if you want to continue learning Hebrew.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you are interested in speaking hebrew outside of a classroom setting."
