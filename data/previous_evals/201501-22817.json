    "It is a series of poems and short stories from Latin America from the mid 1800s until the 1990s or so. The works are great and the lectures are interesting. There isn't really much discussion, and the reading can be tough for non native speakers. If you are interested in the material though, you will absolutely enjoy the class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interesting in Latin American history but don't want to take a full blown history course. It is a fun and cool way to learn about this huge, varied region, and the readings can be really cool and fresh. Don't expect to read full novels or essays or do too much analysis.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in literature from Latin American I would recommend it. We covered lots of authors from the Boom as well as from other movements like romanticism and surrealism. It will def. expand you familiarity in the area!",
    "Take it",
    "All in all, this was a really great course. It focuses more on the authors than you'd expect in a standard literature class, but that fits in really nicely because the course also focuses on how Latin American literature affects the entire concept of Latin America, its development, and its identity. Professor Gonzlez is a truly exceptional professor-- he's funny, extraordinarily well read, and a world expert in the field who has actually met a good number of the more recent authors we discussed. If you're not a native speaker, some of the readings may be pretty challenging or long. This depends on how well you know Spanish but you should try and maybe see some of the readings beforehand. The midterm and final are both fairly easy if you've kept up with the reading and go to class. Overall, a really solid, low-key course that teaches you a lot about the narrative of both Latin America and its literature with a fantastic professor.",
    "Solid introduction to literary canon, dont expect to get too deep into any one work but you will learn a lot about a variety of authors",
    "Loved it! Latina American literature is intertwined with history, so you'll learn about this general narrative of literature and history intersecting, influencing each other, and responding to each other. I definitely learned a lot and always enjoyed readings and class. In terms of the class itself, it's really chill, not discussion-based (he'll occasionally ask for people to chime in but it's definitely not necessary) and the readings vary-I'm not a native speaker so they always took a while for me, but I also got faster over the semester at reading, which was cool. If you're trying to improve conversational skills, look elsewhere-you really don't talk much at all.",
    "If you are interested in Latin American literature, this class in a really interesting class. It provides a really comprehensive overview, and Prof. Gonzalez is really passionate about the subject. His personal insights and experiences really add to the course. On the other hand, this is not the class if you are looking to improve and work on your Spanish. The exams are focused more on your knowledge of Latin American literature than your grasp of the Spanish language.",
    "I would recommend LAST 267 for anyone looking to meet a language requirement in a challenging environment. Also to anyone who is interested in Latin American culture.",
    "Only take this class if you're interested in literature and have a pretty high level of Spanish. The readings are super engaging but can be pretty challenging, so it's good to have some sort of internal motivation for taking the class.",
    "The course was interesting and had fun reads although some were a bit longer than others. Everything was manageable. Echevarria tells interesting anecdotes about the author. I would recommend the course to other students."
