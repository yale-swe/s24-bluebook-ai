    "Jeffrey is excellent. Knows the material and is willing\/able to help on a personal level. Interesting lectures. Some of the material is pretty convoluted and involved, but Jeffrey redeems it. Chances are if you are taking this, it is required of you for the major; luckily this is a class you will feel fortunate to have taken regardless. Was beneficial in coming to understand my own work within a theoretical framework.",
    "As an art major, you have to take it. But don't look on it as a requirement. This class is unlike any other you will take in the art major and if you give it the time it deserves you will get an immense out of it. Not only will you learn a lot but your art practicewill develop a lot as a result of the class. This is a course art majors should be excited by and dedicated to."
