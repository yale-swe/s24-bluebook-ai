    "I would recommend it if you're a French major or interested in women's writing.",
    "I'd recommend this class. I'd say that though readings can get a little long, the class as a whole is entirely reasonable in terms of workload. I enjoyed having this as a very laid-back seminar. Professor Sanjabi is very approachable and has a relaxed character. She is probably one of the chillest, most accommodating professors in the entire French department, and you'll love her for it. Although I was worried that this classwas just going to be feminism stamped into my head over and over, it's not really that at all, just an entire syllabus written by women, some of them more vocal about women's rights than others, but on the whole, I think we actually read a great diversity of material. There is a particular emphasis on postcolonial literature, some WWII lit, and \"auto-fiction.\"",
    "This course is a great exploration of Francophone women's writing. It is an excellent introduction to feminist thought as you get to read texts from authors that come from a variety of backgrounds. From Simone de Beauvoir to Duras to Lucie Aubrac this class offers something for everyone interested in the subject. I would definitely recommend this course to any student wishing to learn more aboutfeminist thought and writing, and autobiographical works. Also, the way this class is structured as a seminar makes for great in-class discussions.",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Women's Narratives is a very typical French lit course - you read a book a week and discuss with two essays and some sort of final assessment. The works are interesting, although if you're not into feminism or post-colonialism probably not the best course for you. Includes things that are not strictly literature like film and video clips. A solid course.;",
    "It is a lot of reading but they are interesting. The writing was manageable and allowed for a more profound investigation of the readings. Most of the class discussion relied heavily on the readings so it was necessary to have done them well.",
    "If you can, take this course. You will gain a foundation of some of the best literature of its respective time periods, and Professor Sanjabi cares tremendously about her students."
