   "comments": [
    "A very good survey course. I would recommend it as providing a good overview of the topic without being superficial.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for students interested in music and literature or in the late Middle Ages. The course covers French and English lyric, mostly in manuscripts, though also recent audio recordings of the lyrics and engravings of lyrics on things such as rings. It's a very useful course for students interested in learning about the emergence of vernacular lyric in Europe before Dante, Petrarch, and Chaucer and the influence of the troubadours and trouv\u00c3\u00a8res on those canonical authors, though we focus only on Chaucer and not at all on Petrarch or Dante.",
    "General course on Medieval literature, covering France and England, as well as a variety of medium and approaches. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, with the caveat that there was a fair amount of busy work (mostly in tracking down the sources). This course went beyond an introduction to medieval lyric because we discussed questions and issues at the heart of the field of medieval studies--and explores all of the complications involved. While I feel that I have gained much knowledge across these topics, it was more difficult for me to acquire a cumulative and comprehensive senseof them.",
    "Interesting for the texts we read, but not a very inspiring class to be in. I would not recommend the class to another student because I don't feel like I got much out of it."
