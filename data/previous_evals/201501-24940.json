    "I don't know if they will teach this together again, but there's nothing like this class offered if you're very interested in empire. It's definitely one of the best and most advanced political theory classes offered for undergrads. Just know that this is more of a mini lecture with some discussion--a lot of which is the two professors discussing ideas with each other--than a pure seminar. With professors this eloquent and brilliant (they really are two of the sharpest minds on this campus) this element isn't that much of a problem. Weaknesses: they struggled to work together in the early part of the semester but the dynamic got a lot better as the semester progressed. The mix of undergrads and grad students didn't work to well either this semester. One more point: don't expect much guidance on the paper unless you're willing to go after the professors for it. Overall, excellent class and really the best if you're interested in empire.",
    "I would cautiously recommend the class. A terrific syllabus, but in many respects a disappointing class. This is a general problem with political theory courses, but I found that the speed and breadth of this class was ultimately a bit counter-productive. I think this class could have benefited from spending 2 weeks or so on some of the more influential\/complex texts. A single 3-hour session on Leviathan and Grotius gives us too little time to begin to enter the complex systems these thinkers are working within, let alone to think through their implications for empire and imperialist ideology. I think spending some time going slower and more methodically would have been nice. I also think classroom discussion was disappointing. This was in part due to the virtual non-participation of many of the graduate students. I think that the structure of the course also wasn't ideal for discussion. class opened typically with a 30 minute talk from Professor Bromwich and a 15 minute talk from Professor Mantena (sometimes Bromwich would go on for much, much longer than half an hour). These talks were really good at times, but I think they may have inhibited conversation. A way of restructuring the course that might help would be to formally split it up into a lecture and discussion portion. In the first hour or so, Professors Bromwich and Mantena could give formal, structured lectures, rather than talking and at times rambling. Following this half we could take our break and return for another 90 minutes of discussion. Finally, discussion suffered from a lack of normative argument. I think careful exegesis of texts is incredibly rewarding, but with a topic as morally divisive as empire, some time spent critically evaluating the texts could really be helpful. Instead, we often discussed texts by saying \"herein lies JS Mill's imperialist presumption,\" without actually evaluating why or even if he was wrong. It wasn't until the last class that we actually opened up into this kind of normative discussion. Finally, some more structure on the paper would have been nice I think. The prospectus was due very late in the semester and we got very limited comments. An earlier focus on the research paper with more professorial involvement could have been productive. All that said, I was very happy in this class. The readings were great, the syllabus expertly curated, and the professors wise and insightful."
