    "RLST904 sought to define and understand the concept of secularization using classic political philosophers who have written on the subject. The professors noted that many contemporary accounts of secularization are ideologicalwhether this means that they are celebratory arguments about religions demise, or that they are postcolonial critiques of secularization as a historicist fantasyand our purpose was to avoid ideology and excavate the best parts of secularization narratives for constructive use. In practice this meant that we saw secularization as an empty container that captured a historical process. Our job was to fill the container with content. The question wasnt, How have scholars defined secularization and what is at stake in those definitions? but How did secularization occur?; not What is the rhetorical architecture of secularization theories? but, What does secularization, the historical process, mean existentially? The class didnt sustain rigorous, close engagement with its key textsHabermas, MacIntyre, Blumenberg, Lefebvre, Taylorbecause of diversions from the reading and chaotic term us. For example, the professors often invoked Mahmood, Said, and Asad (and postcolonial theory generally) as examples of what NOT to do when discussing the secular. But we never read them, nor did we discuss them outside of caricature. In class we made first-person normative statements about we moderns in the west without defining modern or westwhich led to imprecise discussion and ignored decades of historical\/anthropological scholarship that teaches us to know better. It is very possible structure a class with classic thinkers AND to have rich conversation about their contributions, strengths, limitations, presuppositions, rhetorics, unexplored crevices, basic terms, etc. This is why I took the class! Yet this potential was undercut by vague, defensive triangulation through texts we hadnt read and resistance to close reading. Co-taught courses are notoriously tricky. Each professor may expect the other to pick up his\/her slack, whether in expertise or in preparation for a given week. If both have prepared carefully, they may spar together, without inviting student input. Both scenarios occurred in this class. Requirements were incoherent. When students asked about policies the professors consulted on the spot. By semester-end the syllabus still said DRAFT, the readings had repeatedly shifted at short notice, and students had heard multiple, mutually contradicting, final paper due dates. Two days before finals period ended, we received directions for an annotated bibliography mentioned on the draft syllabus but never in class. I hesitate to use language of hostile environment to describe 904, but I did experience the course dynamics as out of sync with the idea of respectful dialogue about course themes. This goes beyond pedagogy. Often the class negatively sanctioned careful preparation. Such sanctioning was particularly evident when a student's interpretation contradicted a professors interpretation. This course rewarded participants who covered poor preparation by routing the class into inquiries about universal \"truths. This dynamic was gendered. When the two women students analyzed reading, it was common for them to be interrupted and dismissed, by either a professor or another student, before we could complete even 1-2 sentences. Two male students who often made off-topic comments and read book summaries on Wikipedia during class, dominated. Women students became quieter over the semester, as it became clear that our contributions were rarely taken seriously, if we had a chance to enter the conversation at all. With these considerations, I would recommend 904, as it stands, to men who are interested in this tradition of political philosophy (but not in doing close readings of the texts) and who enjoy finding their place in the sort of classroom dynamics I have described.",
    "This is a discussion-based course which introduces students to a range of less commonly read studies of secularization. I would recommend it to students in religious studies, philosophy or political theory who want to work on secularization and who are interested in having a forum for discussing the texts on the syllabus."

    "In this class, I read texts that are important to my field and found ways to think through them constructively, even if this did not always happen in the space of the class itself. I learned the ways that scholars are currently thinking about secularization as a concept and a narrative. I also learned professional skills, particularly around framing ideas in ways that would minimize conflict. This mostly meant becoming satisfied with mostly listening, getting into the habit of opening any statements with a qualifier that flagged that I was just trying to experiment with an idea, and finding ways to discuss the readings outside of the class when the seminar became unsatisfying or intractable. I am not sure how any of this will contribute to my dissertation, but surely there will be some connection.",
    "This course exposed me to some important existing work on secularization, which is the topic I hope to research, and helped me think through methodological questions I have about my own work. I really appreciated the chance to discuss questions about my own work with both instructors. I also appreciated the opportunity to discuss my work with Professor Gorski, who was a guest speaker during one session."
