    "This class helped me to develop functional Russian vocabulary and more advanced structural skills for speaking.",
    "I learned the vocabulary necessary to discuss climate change, national security, foreign policy, and other high-level conversation topics. I also learned about the history of post-soviet Eastern Europe and current Russian politics.",
    "We gained practical experience discussing and debating complex issues in Russian."

   "comments": [
    "The course is a little bit haphazard by nature, but that is just because the students dictate the topics that we discussed for the most part. The class was very well formatted though. We would read and then discuss the reading.",
    "The course provides an excellent platform to practice speaking Russian and learning the vocabulary and constructions needed to talk about abstract concepts. However, the course lacks a consistent structure. There is a lack of regular vocabulary assessment, and the homework assignments are often assigned very late. This makes it difficult to find the time necessary to do the assignments well. Furthermore, the lack of vocabulary assessment made it hard to keep track of the vocabulary we had learned. All of the students in this course are advanced speakers, so keeping new content separate from old knowledge is actually somewhat difficult, and this can lead to students failing to practice with the new vocabulary during class discussions. I think that regular vocabulary assessment would help maintain this distinction, and students would more engage with the new words learned rather than relying on past knowledge.",
    "The course uses interesting, complex online materials to organize the conversations in class. Students choose the themes as a group, and the course progresses per their interests."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would. For someone hoping to gain an advanced level of Russian language, this class is phenomenal.",
    "Yes. If you are even considering this course, you are already an advanced Russian speaker. Each class meeting is almost entirely students speaking to one another, and so this class is a great way to elevate your speaking abilities. The work is very manageable, and the readings are often from Russian news sources, so the content is interesting and relevant to contemporary world politics.",
    "I would recommend this course for people looking to challenge their Russian speaking and writing ability."
