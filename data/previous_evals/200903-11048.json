   "comments": [
    "I advise my fellow students to take the course, in order to get some policy writing and presentation esperience.",
    "Stronly recommend! Through the teamwork, we can learn more!",
    "This class is an excellent window into the policy world and the skills necessary for policy writing. The class allows you to work in a team on a specific subject for the course of the semester, and equips you to write a comprehensive white paper to be presented to policy-makers. I would highly recommend the course for anyone interested in the policy world or looking to work on a topic of choice in a concentrated manner.",
    "Absolutely would recommend the course to a fellow student, particularly those who are interested in entering work for a think tank or, on a more limited basis, the consulting world, where such policy papers might be produced.",
    "I'd recommend the course to any student interested in pursuing a policy-based career.",
    "\"Policy Workshop\" creates a real-world environment in which students collaborate on projects centered around relevant issue in international relations. This semester's themes included the policy implications of pirates, mercenaries and the melting Arctic. This creative course mirrorswhat students would experience working, for example, as policymakers with the Department of State or the UN. Dr. Gottlieb challenges students to treat their projects as if they were to be submitted to such a professional bodies. The course appropriately culminates with a white paper and a presentation, the product of a semester of research, writing, group work and the wise council of a professor who really knows his stuff.I would highly recommend International Relations 760 01 to other students, especially those interested in a career in the policy world. This course is good preparation for second year students about to begin their careers in international relations.",
    "For anyone who will work in policy making in any capacity, this course is a unique opportunity to prepare. Policy writing is so different than any other type of writing and is crucial in a career in policy or related fields. It's also useful for anyone to understand how policy gets drafted in the process of policymaking. I'd certainly recommend this course to anyone, in particular to those in international relations or related fields.",
    "IR 760 is a workshop class where teams of students write a 15-page policy white paper on a global policy issue of their choice, then present it to their peers and other members of the academic community in the final week of the term. It has much independent teamwork outside of class and close work in meetings with the professor. A few times in the term, all of the teams gather to give progress updates and receive feedback. I highly recommend it for students at all interested in public policy.",
    "I would recommend Policy Workshop to fellow students as a course that allows students to explore their interests in the context of practical policy-making environments."

   "comments": [
    "I explore a vital issue to national and global security in great depth.",
    "This course was my first time focusing on policy writing and was a wonderfully challenging experience. I felt like I learned how to think in a policy-focused manner and how to write in a more concise and straightforward manner. I also loved being able to work for the course of one whole semester on a single topic, garnering an exciting level of expertise over my topic.",
    "It broadened my understanding of current policy debates and how to pursue research relevant to such debates.",
    "\"Policy Workshop\" helped me tremendously in preparing me for a career in the policy world. It deepened my knowledged on how to a policy white paper, and allowed me to strengthen my skills in analysis, writing and public presentation. I am glad to write that this course has contributed greatly to my development as a hopeful future foreign policymaker.",
    "This course was uniquely helpful for my profession, as I intend to work in policy. I've had professional experience in policy making and policy memo writing, and this course was still quite valuable in improving my skills and supplementing my understanding of policy and how to make a brief as effective and clear as possible.",
    "I have a better grasp of my assigned global issue, teamwork, policy writing style and the genre of policy memo. My interest in going in that direction in my career is piqued!"
