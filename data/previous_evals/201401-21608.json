    "A very theoretical course in sociology. I would recommend it only to those VERY interested in social theory and cultural studies.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class if you are interested in cultural sociology. It is an entirely different way of looking at the world and if you are attentive, it will apply to other parts of your education and life.",
    "I definitely recommend the class. Cultural Sociology is not only an important voice in social studies but Yale has a particularly strong program in Cultural sociology and is home of the field's leaders. Not only for a great reading list but for the opportunity to think about them in this particular context is very rewarding, and exciting too."
