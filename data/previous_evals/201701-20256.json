   "comments": [
    "I learned how to better conduct archival research using primary sources, understand historical arguments, and defend historical interpretations of the past.",
    "I learned how to do proper, archival research.",
    "I learned how to write a proper history paper. This was my first history course at Yale and has been such an interesting class that I am actually considering majoring in history now. This class cultivates your reading, writing, and presentation skills. Also, the coolest part of the class is that you get to look at physical, original manuscripts from the 1700-1800-1900s -- whatever is relevant to the reading from that week. Such a treat!",
    "You will learn how to research and about writing research papers. Even though the course was focused on slavery, there weren't as many discussions about race as expected or talks about how the legacy of slavery relates to our current climate.",
    "How to do archival research, skim books, focus my thesis, write with more precision.",
    "This course helped me to develop my reasoning and interpretation skills, as well as my skill in narrating my ideas efficiently.",
    "I definitely got a much greater appreciation for what the lives of slaves were like, as well as learning some about modern slavery (though that was only one class worth of discussion). It was good writing practice and definitely a great chance to do archival research, which I personally did not really enjoy but I know was very rewarding for other members of the class.",
    "I gained a broader perspective on the experience of North American slaves by reading and analyzing slave narratives as well as secondary sources about slavery in Jamaica, internal slave trade in the antebellum south and the legacy of slavery in contemporary racial injustices such as mass incarceration. We also delved into modern slavery and human trafficking and its connection or lack thereof with chattel slavery in the U.S. I learned more about conducting historical research using primary sources."

   "comments": [
    "Strength -- IN THE BIENECKE!!! Chill professor, interesting material, small seminar discussion Weakness -- lots of reading, lots of writing BUT VERY MUCH SO WORTH IT!",
    "The teacher is flexible and understanding if you are willing to go to him and its a good class to take with a good group of students in the class as well. Some of the books were long or difficult to get through given that we had to read a book a week. It was also difficult to properly plan time to research. Overall, a good class, but best to take if you are interested in the economics of slavery.",
    "Strengths: interesting content, good literature, archival research, writing workshops, cool mixture of Beineke materials for class (so cool). Weakness: Not enough guidance on papers, too many books that detracted from time to do research, not enough discussion time for the books we had.",
    "This course was discussion based which was excellent!I would have liked to see, however, a larger period of time spent in the class dedicated to the modern implications of slavery.",
    "Rugemer is a great professor and definitely is invested in his students. The topics are relatively interesting and the readings are not at all dry. However there is a ton of reading--to the point were it was easy to just not do any of it. Sometimes discussions were pretty weak as a result as only a few students would have actually done the reading. When I did manage to do the reading the discussions were much more rewarding m.the few times we had shorter readings I think we had the best discussions.I also thought I was going to learn a little bit more about reconstruction and the social and political impacts the legacy of slavery has had in the US,but it was definitely more focused on the experiences of slaves, which was fine but different from what I expected.",
    "I thought it invaluable to have access to primary documents in the Beinecke, especially when they related to the texts we were reading. I thought the class sometimes focused too heavily on literary analysis and less on historical trends and patterns, especially when looking at slave narratives. I thought we could have brought the close analysis of primary texts into the historical narrative more intentionally. Also, a general review of dates\/timeline of American slavery in the U.S. would have been helpful towards the beginning of the course. Otherwise I greatly enjoyed the structure of discussions. When discussing impacts\/legacy of slavery, I thought the dialogue between peers was so important to understanding these issues."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. There was a lot of reading, but if you actually read the books, you learn so much. Take the time to put effort in the class you will gain so much more.",
    "Lots of work, but not unbearable. Such a great course, could not recommend it more.",
    "I would recommend, but it wasn't exactly what I expected with the title of Significance of American Slavery. There isn't much talk about its significance today or how slavery shaped racial relations in the US. However, the discussions were good and the workload is doable although you might have to skim some of the readings.",
    "Yes, because the content is interesting, the archival research paper is really cool, and it acquaints us with Chicago writing style. I would suggest that you have us read less books and in stead give us more rough drafts to do so that we can work on refining our thesis earlier, learn all the specifics of Chicago style (which I at least was not familiar with), and be able to more in-depthly discuss the books we read.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, with a warning about the heavy reading load. However, the class discussions are insightful and engaging and the material covered is important and interesting! A great freshman seminar, and a good introduction for anyone interested in taking AFAM courses.",
    "Yes! Just be aware there is a lot of reading. Also it is definitely very focused on the experiences of slaves more than anything else just to be clear.",
    "Yes especially if they are interested in history."
