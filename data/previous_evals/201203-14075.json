   "comments": [
    "This is a brilliant course taught by an enthusiastic, knowledgeable professor on some of the best literature ever written. The only way to improve this course would be to hold it at a more decent hour of the day. 9:25 for a primarily upperclassman seminar? Please. Still, totally worth it. This course is a gem.That said, one of the reasons it is so strong is because Professor Fink is so enthusiastic. She really made the course for me. Discussion was excellent and she provides lots of wonderful background and interpretation.",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Fink's enthusiasm for Russian literature translates to the class, and the readings themselves are all interesting on their own. It works particularly well as a once a week two hour class. Highly recommended!",
    "The readings are all really wonderful and manageable, as is the type of work. Professor Fink is so passionate about the texts that she makes them come alive. Her commentary no everything is AMAZING and the highlight of the class, but one of the results of her sharing her insights is that class conversation was sometimes more ping-pongy than fluid. I was totally fine with that since I wanted to hear what she had to say, but just a thought. I would recommend the class!",
    "If you know nothing about the Russian literature of the 19th century, this course will set you straight. If you already do know something, this class will offer new perspectives and introduce you to Lermontov, which I'm 90% sure you haven't read. Either way, it's great and you need to take it.",
    "This class was a fantastic survey course in 19th century Russian literature. Unfortunately, no book was studied in depth, but it created a great narrative for almost a century of the Russian literary tradition.",
    "This is a great course. Take it if you're at all interested in Russian lit and want to get to know the genre more. The readings are phenomenal, and Professor Fink is wonderful and clearly passionate about the subject. The discussions are fun and pretty low key. Overall really worthwhile.",
    "Great overview of Russian literature in which you will consider many important questions about how to live one's life.",
    "Yes, take it if you want to read really great literature. This course was very manageable and accessible even if you have no experiences with Russian lit.",
    "This is a fantastic course. Professor Fink is wonderful. You read and discuss really great literature. The reading was always enjoyable, and was a very manageable amount.",
    "TAKE IT! You read really wonderful Russian novels that, let's face it, you probably would never take the time to read: Anna Karenina (Tolstoy), Fathers and Sons(Turgenev), Notes from Underground (Dostoevsky), A Hero of Our Time (Lermontov), etc. I looked forward to seminar every week. Not too much work, very reasonable. LOVED IT!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to someone who is interested in learning about Russian literature. This was a great survey of 19th century Russian literature. We got to sample lots of authors from different strains of Russian literary tradition, from the beginnings of Russian novels to the end of the 19th century.",
    "YES.",
    "TAKE IT! A pleasure start to finish, for majors and nonmajors with a strong literature background. You're reading some of the most wonderful, thought-provoking, enjoyable books imaginable...as a class. Rigorous but totally manageable amount of work. Discussions were well-moderated and interesting, without becoming grossly competitive and pretentious. Fink is so kind and unassumingly brilliant, and really lovely to know and learn from; she kept people engaged in a too-early (and maybe slightly too-long) seminar.Especially awesome for seniors, or really anyone who's having a little big of an existential crisis.",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in Russian Literature!!",
    "Professor Fink always has interesting and insightful things to say about the reading and the work's historical context. The weekly reading responses are a great way to spend a little time processing the work before you get to class, and Professor Fink was very helpful in helping pick paper topics and work through ideas for the midterm and final papers. However, sometimes the discussion lagged, especially when people constantly responded directly back to Professor Fink instead of responding to each other, and I thought the papers were a bit too long (12-15 pages). But most of the reading is fantastic and Professor Fink is smart and nice, I would definitely recommend the class if you'd like to read the books on the syllabus!"
