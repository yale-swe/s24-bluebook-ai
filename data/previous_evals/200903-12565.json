    "We read 8 ethnographies relating to issues of reproduction and the different technologies that have developed concerning reproduction in different parts of the world. We would then discuss the books, guided by an overview and discussion questions written by one student each class. I would definitely recommend Reproductive Technologies to a certain kind of student. It is a very left-leaning class but with students from many different backgrounds, so it is important that students enter with an open mind about these issues and be willing to put personal politics in the background to discuss the issues intelligently. Also, as a very student-led seminar, people have tobe willing to do the reading and participate extensively in class discussions in order to make the class enjoyable. Lastly, it is not much of a learn information kind of class as a learn how to learn kind of class, so students have to be up for that sort of thing. But I absolutely loved it.",
    "This class is basically reading all about reproductive technologies and their effect on women then discussing them with a group of friends. The only tasks you have throughout the course is leading the discussion, writing two book reviews, and in the end writing a comparative book review. Yes I would recommend this class because of for everything you learn and the new thoughts you formulate throughout the course - the class is not very rigorous.",
    "It is a reading and discussion-based class on different topics pertaining to human reproduction. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It was the best class I took this semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you are at all interested in women's health issues and global health, it is really fascinating. It is almost completely discussion based, so all you have to do is read the books (all interesting, some more dense than others) and do a few book reviews. Marcia Inhorn is really nice and a very easy grader. Overall, a really interesting and fulfilling class, and not a lot of work.",
    "I highly recommend Anth 011 to any student who is curious and looking to have a good time and to learn a new perspective on controversial issues. This was a fun and intellectually rewarding class."
