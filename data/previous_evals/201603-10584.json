   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I got to learn a lot more about Chinese history and Chinese texts. I also have never taken a philosophy course, so this was a great course to learn about history, literature, and philosophy all in one. A skill I learned was to read analytically and closely at specific passages.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the Chinese literary tradition and gained valuable feedback on my writing.",
    "This class gave me exposure to a whole world of texts that I have not previously been aware of. I think it also helped me develop my writing.",
    "I learned how to piece together a wide variety of philosophies and texts into a tradition. I learned to what extent continuity, and canons themselves, are constructed. I also learned a lot about the Chinese tradition itself--I walked into this class with almost no background knowledge, and am leaving with an exposure to many of China's most influential thinkers. I also appreciated that the class emphasized how politics, philosophy, and literature all affect each other.",
    "I learned a great deal about the essentials of ancient and early modern Chinese history, literature, and philosophy. But I'm a total newcomer to the field, so that was to be expected nonetheless, the course is admirably comprehensive and I walked away knowing a great deal more than when I came in.",
    "I gained great insight into the major canonical works of the Chinese Tradition.",
    "This course gave me a very strong foundation in Chinese literature, culture, and society. I learned to engage rigorously with texts and art in a culture that differed from my own which is a gift in and of itself. This course does not give many answers to the dilemmas that have faced Chinese society since its inception -- nor should it attempt to. Instead, it narrows the scope of questioning and builds a framework within which to navigate the great puzzle that is Chinese society.",
    "I developed a great deal in learning how to close read and analyze both primary and secondary texts. Weaving together related themes throughout history is something I will take along with me from this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think it could be made clearer that it will be reading intensive from the beginning. There was too much material packed into one semester",
    "I thought it gave a really great overview of a large span of time and also pick out really interesting texts.",
    "I loved the course. I thought the material was structured in a very organized way and that Professors Lu and Bender did a great job drawing connections between the texts, which made comprehending them a lot easier. Only one thing I can think to improve on: sometimes, we covered texts in class that had not been assigned for homework or texts were assigned for homework that were not assigned in class",
    "This class is very ambitious with the amount of material it tries to cover which is both a strength and weakness. Going through three thousand years' worth of texts is exciting and it gave us exposure to the different facets of the tradition. On the other hand, by trying to cover a lot, we were not able to dig deep into each text and managed to only scratch the surface. I think this class would benefit from decreasing the number of texts and really spend time going into each one. One way I see this happening is to maybe have only one lecture a week where we discuss the historical context and then have two discussion sections where we can explore the texts.",
    "The professors were AMAZING. They always led thought-provoking lectures, and had high expectations, but they were also always approachable and kind. I thought the reading load was generally okay, but I wish we had read fewer texts. It was a little frustrating to dedicate hours to a text that would be discussed for only a slide or two in lecture. But other than that, I thought this class was one of the strongest classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Strengths: enthusiastic teaching staff; great variety of material Weaknesses: sometimes goes too quickly; could sacrifice some breadth for a bit more depth",
    "I'm glad that this course exists. It's wonderful to engage with the eastern tradition much like DS engages with the West. However, I think the class should actually adopt the DS style of teaching. One dense, historical\/background lecture at the beginning of a new reading, with two seminar style reading discussions to cement the details. The class was smaller than several seminars I've taken, yet was still taught in a lecture style. With two professors and two TA's team teaching, there are great opportunities for more personal engagements with the text.",
    "Lectures were usually great, some a bit disorganized. The readings were not always discussed, so if they were particularly boring or long they might not get the attention they should. Overall, fabulous professors and fascinating subject. Hard to cover all that material but the subject demands it. There should be some mechanism for students who know Chinese to read original texts! Not for a grade because it's not a language class, but I would have loved to see a few more original Chinese poems or Zhuangzi, that kind of thing.",
    "Given the fact that this was a survey course, its clear strength is that it covers A LOT of material and its clear weakness is that, because of this, it does not allow for extreme depth. This ought to be expected and I'm sure the professors are aware of this balance -- actually, they have struck it reasonably well. To improve a bit, I think that section could be more productive in delving deeper into certain texts. Occasionally new texts will be assigned specifically for section which hampers the ability to discuss lecture topics in a seminar style which is incredibly helpful. Particularly sections on philosophy like the Warring States masters, Daoism,and Buddhism should be covered more deeply and with more specific goals in mind for section. On an unrelated note, the exam could be made easier to study for. I mean this in the sense that frequently there are individuals\/texts mentioned in lecture slides that we were never assigned or individuals\/texts that we were assigned that were never in lecture and this made it confusing what exactly we should pay attention to. Probably a lesser problem was just the layout of readings and slides online which made it difficult to get organized to study -- clearer naming might help to fix this. Obviously these are mostly critiques, but on the whole I actually thought this course was highly effective and brilliantly taught -- I only include the weaknesses because I loved the class so much!",
    "I think the course was strong because it was in chronological order, and it made connecting themes a lot easier."

   "comments": [
    "No. I just didn't enjoy it",
    "I would really encourage students to take this course if they are interested in philosophy, Chinese history, or just reading interesting texts.",
    "This is phenomenal class for anyone, but especially for someone interested in China. Understanding China's literary tradition is crucial to understanding it's modern history. I went in to this class expecting to be put off by the material, but Professors Lu and Bender do a great job drawing connections between the texts. Full disclosure: I had some exposure to the early texts in the course, which are important because much of the rest of the course is built on them. Still, I'd highly recommend the class to anyone.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! Both Professors Lu and Bender are amazing lecturers who keep the class engaged in a casual manner. The content is very exciting since they are quite different from what we may be used to in the Western world. One bit of warning is the class covers A LOT (around three thousand years of texts) so we were not able to dig deeply into each one. The workload is also pretty heavy with three papers, a midterm, and a final.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course!!! It is an amazing survey of a rich tradition of thought. This is probably the best way to be introduced to the Chinese canon. Professors Tina Lu and Lucas Bender are incredibly smart, passionate, and approachable, and they led a great leminar-style class. I was surprised that the reading load was so heavy, and I was also surprised that the class focused so much on philosophy, rather than on fictional writing--but I think both of those surprises ended up adding to what I got out of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend, particularly to those with limited knowledge of China and\/or in a discipline such as philosophy where your exposure to non-Western sources is minimal.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if improvements are made to the structure.",
    "Definitely take it if Tina and Lucas are teaching it! Basically a survey of Chinese history and philosophy from the Shang Dynasty to 1919. 3 papers, 3-4 pages non-writing, 7-9 pages for writing credit, midterm and final for everyone. The first half was better, very organized and methodical treatment of the ancient philosophers, who are all must-reads at some point in your life (I read Zhuangzi for fun since this class). After the Tang, reading gets boring and long, but improves right at the end with Lu Xun. Focus on how themes in the Chinese tradition change with the times. Highly recommend if you're interested in China.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In fact I already have to several throughout the semester. Bender and Lu make the best pair of professors -- they are funny, highly knowledgable, unbelievably passionate, and truly want to see their students succeed. You get the feeling that they genuinely care about your development and see this class as a journey with their students every time they teach.",
    "A very good course if you're interested in the Chinese humanities. It combines historical background along with analysis of primary and secondary sources that help you develop skill of connecting key ideas."
