    "combinatronics, probability, graph theory",
    "I learned a fair amount of the mathematics of graph theory, including some topics in trees, algorithm design, probability, and combinatorics.",
    "244 covered a bunch of topics in combinatorics, graph theory, basic probability.",
    "Counting, combinatorics, graph theory, probability",
    "Probability theory and graph theory",
    "Knowledge in discrete mathematics, specifically in combinatorics, graph theory, probability, and generating functions",
    "Learned a lot about graph theory, probability, generating functions, etc.",
    "Foundations of mathematical thinking, proofing methods like induction, graph theory, combinatorics, discrete probability, and generating functions",
    "Learned basic discreet math (counting, probability, generating functions, graphs, etc). That's all the course was sold as, and that's what it was.",
    "I learned a lot about proof writing, probability, combinatorics, and graph theory. I am not particularly interested in math but some of the topics were very interesting.",
    "While some discrete math courses in other universities include basic number theory and graph theory, 244 has very little number theory but instead covers a lot of combinatorics and approximation techniques.",
    "I learned about some new areas of math, including beginning graph theory. I didn't improve much on writing proofs or basic number theory, though I had already taken a proofs-based math course.",
    "As a non math major I learned a ton. That being said as a non math major it was quite a challenging course.",
    "I learned a lot of graph theory, counting in mathematics, and probabilistic methods. In graph theory we explored different properties of graphs and how to analyze them. In counting we learned different ways of approaching counting, such as inclusion exclusion vs normal combinatorics, etc.. I also learned how to solve problems by utilizing probable outcomes\/probability.",
    "I learnt that I enjoy discrete maths.",
    "I was introduced to fields such as counting and graph theory. I continued to build my problem solving skills and I was encouraged to branch out and work with my peers.",
    "I learned a lot about basic proofs in math and the fundamentals of discrete mathematics.",
    "I learned a lot about counting and graph theory but I feel like a lot of the material in the class after the first midterm is not very interesting.",
    "Nice introduction to discrete math covering combinatorial counting, asymptotic growth, introductory graph theory, basic probability and a brief intro to generating functions which are cool.",
    "This is a math class that is extremely accessible in terms of content, but the exams that constitute most of your grade are very difficult and force you to be clever under pressure. I learned a lot of really cool stuff from this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: pretty good textbook, problem sets are a reasonable difficulty if not a bit hard weaknesses: teaching could be improved particularly towards the end of the class eg making a mistake midway through lecture and going back to correct it at the end is distracting and makes it more difficult to understand concepts, exams are difficult and worth a really high percentage of the grade",
    "Most importantly, the course should be taught by a more engaged professor. Also, the course did not require any background in writing mathematical proofs, yet these were approximately half of the work, despite never being taught in any formal sense. This caused a great deal of distress, and made many of the tests quite difficult. There was a fairly big discrepancy between the difficulty level of the lectures\/PSETs and the tests as well.",
    "Strengths: Ross' teaching, Diana's office hours Weaknesses: more review sessions before the exams would have helped. The exams in 244 were very challenging, so holding a few review sessions would help immensely without having to make them easier.",
    "Homework is probably the biggest flaw (it is almost never returned on time). The material itself is useful and interesting",
    "A pretty easy and fun math class in general. Introduction to probability theory and graph theory. Covers many topics.",
    "Strengths: content was very interesting and different from a typical math course Weaknesses: homework was graded very slowly",
    "Class was taught pretty well and the problem sets complemented the material well. Sometimes the in class derivations were a little long though, and perhaps the small details could have been skipped at times.",
    "Lectures were excellent. I think there could be more office hours and TAs\/TFs. Homework took a very long time to come back, so feedback was very rare",
    "Really good course. Not too hard, but you did have to know the material. The only issue, but it was fairly substantial, was how dry the lectures were. It isn't a deal breaker cause you can catch up since the lectures are very close to the book. That in and of itself isn't bad, as Ross really did clarify things relative to the book, but it became so dry that just maintaining attention was the largest issue. Also, we spent a long time on derivations which we didn't really have to end up knowing, so that decreased motivation to attend to the details of lectures sometimes.",
    "This is a hard math class because if you don't understand the concept really well, it is difficult to succeed, but that's not the course's fault. This is a difficult subject to learn and the way the course is organized was, in my opinion, the best way to approach the material.",
    "Strengths: Lots of cool new concepts Weaknesses: While the lectures were very engaging in that they covered some of the most enlightening proofs of theorems in the material, I feel like some of those proofs could have been set as assigned reading and in class we could have spent a little more time doing exam style questions.",
    "It felt a bit disorganized: a lot of interesting topics thrown together to make a course, without going too in depth into any of them. It was interesting, though, and I was intrigued enough to look stuff up further outside of class.",
    "The lectures were boring, fast paced, and definitely hard to listen to. The book is not readable hence there are not many ways to get ready for a lecture that covers a lot of material on the spot. The instructor should consider providing hand outs or readings for students about the material that is to be covered in the following lecture so that the students can better ready themselves to digest intellectually challenging material during the lecture.",
    "The course material was extremely interesting and I greatly enjoyed it. The problem sets were fair, a great length, and challenging enough so that they were doable but also reinforced the material. Lecture was interesting and Ross is good. The TA hours help hours were good too. No real complaints except problem sets being returned verrrry late\/never.",
    "The homework problems were well chosen and the material was interesting.",
    "This course does a good job of covering the material in a good amount of depth. It also explores several very interesting topic areas, and it is challenging in a fun way. More prompt feedback would improve the course.",
    "The lectures were always very engaging and fast paced, which is great. I felt like there maybe could have been more student support in terms of review sessions and more peer tutors.",
    "There should be quicker feedback on problem sets for sure.",
    "Course is well organized and structured with plenty of practice problems and relatively straightforward exams.",
    "The course could be improved by connecting many of the themes we learned in class to one another. It is unclear to me how generating functions relate to graphs, and why they are useful in the same class. It sometimes felt like the different topics we learned were themselves discrete."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It's good for a math class at Yale, so if you need to take a math class then this is a fair option. Teaching relatively good and easy to understand and sticks to textbook so easy to self-teach concepts not understood. Grading weighed heavily towards exams",
    "Absolutely not. The topics covered in the course could be self-taught far more easily and with less existential pain involved.",
    "Definitely",
    "If you enjoy math at all, yes",
    "If you're looking for a math elective, this is a great choice. There's a low workload (~2.5 hours a week), the professor is super nice, enthusiastic and high-quality, and the material is interesting with cool applications. The material is the sweet spot in that it's interesting, new and nontrivial, but not hard if you go to class and do the problem sets. The assessments are extremely reasonable. The problem sets are short and there aren't that many.",
    "Yes. You develop a different, but very useful set of critical thinking and problem solving skills here than in other math or QR courses.",
    "Take the class if you are reasonably comfortable in math and want to pursue math\/cs as a major. If you aren't too comfortable with problem solving\/proofs, shop the class but if you find it too hard maybe it would be good to take CS202 instead.",
    "Yes, Professor Berkowitz is an excellent lecturer.",
    "If you're interested in math then yeah. If you aren't interested in math then this won't make you enjoy math, you'll probably just want to get through the course, which I wouldn't recommend. You do learn some cool math and see good\/interesting proofs of a fair amount of things, so a good easier math course for the stronger math students.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in math and have some experience with math. I took this as my first math class in college and I struggled at first, which I think wouldn't have happened if I had any experience with proofs and proof writing. It is a very challenging course but the material is fairly interesting and Ross is an amazing professor who is always open to answering any questions.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. If you are deciding between 202 or 244, 244 is almost always the choice.",
    "If you are really interested in math in general and are looking for an easier class, this course is worth it. But I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who doesn't already know they enjoy math.",
    "It is a good course and teaches you great many applicable skills. But you need to put a lot of effort in to compensate for the shortcomings of the textbook.",
    "Yes, would recommend. This course is intellectually challenging which makes it exciting, and from what I could gauge it is not much more work than CS 202 at all, just more in-depth and interesting content. Ross is solid too, and the problem sets are very manageable. Tests are not easy but enjoyable challenging and fair. Problem sets were very slow to be returned though.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in graphs or probability.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was an interesting introduction to several topic areas that I had not previously had much experience with, and it effectively conveyed new concepts.",
    "Absolutely! Provided you're interested of course.",
    "Yes. I really enjoyed the subject material. I think it is a great QR course and very relevant to both Math and Computer Science. I learned how to solve a lot of fun problems that I've wondered about for a while (i.e. 7 bridges of Konigsburg).",
    "If you need it for your major, definitely.",
    "Good course if you're looking for some math or doing CS (although not much focus on CS concepts specifically; the book does go into some algorithms)",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys mathematical problem-solving. I actually had fun working out many of the problems in the course."
