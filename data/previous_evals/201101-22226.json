    "It's great. Totally worth taking. And don't bother doing it Cred D. Just memorize the basic info and go to class and you never have to do any reading. It's also just worth being in class.",
    "Definitely take this course. Every student should come out of Yale with some basic Art history knowledge, and this is the perfect general survey.",
    "Amazing, as expected. Just a suggestion though: when taking notes, you don't have to write down his flowery prose word-for-word, just get the main ideas although it is nice to listen to. Also, be prepared for a stressful exam but if you know the slides and go to lecture, you should be okay.",
    "take it as a credit\/d not cause you will not enjoy it",
    "take it credit d.",
    "Great class! Definite take!",
    "YES! This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. I would definitely recommend it. If you want a comprehensive, cohesive overview of the history of art from renaissance to the present, take this class!",
    "This is a basic introduction to western art history; you've probably heard it talked up, but I would caution you against buying into the hype wholeheartedly. It's a good course, but shop it first and see if you enjoy Professor Nemerov's particular brand of art history.",
    "If you want to take a History of Art Class for fun, this class is perfect but I recommend taking it Credit\/D\/F.",
    "Yes. Everyone should take this whether for credit or not. And GO TO LECTURE! You don't want to miss a word Nemerov says. And section is in the art gallery--it's a fun field trip once a week. Don't miss out on this course. It's a must take before you graduate.",
    "This class is about the appreciation of art. It doesn't place art in a historical context so much as it teaches you how to analyze individual art pieces.",
    "It is the history of art from the Renaissance to the present, taught by one of the best lecturers at Yale, so if you have room in your schedule, go for it!",
    "If you can put up with Nemerov's occasionally ridiculous-sounding lectures, yes. It's a very good, very thorough survey, definitely with more emphasis on the \"art\" and not the \"history.\" I came out of it with basic knowledge I didn't have before, and also an interest in learning more. Beware, though, that the TAs aren't easy graders. Many people take it Credit\/D, I didn't and was fine, but could definitely see the reason why so many do. Overall, thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "My favorite class this semester. I have never taken any art history but loved the way Nemerov taught and the class operated. Ours wasa 500 person lecture and I think Nemerov understands that most people simply want to gain an appreciation for art. He therefore doesn't stress learning the date of every major painting and period but rather centers the course around, as he said in the first lecture, \"being able to stand in front of a work for 60 minutes\" and appreciating it and the artist. I think he therefore would choose certain artists and works that could have been indicative of a time, but made his choices such that all his lectures together wove a tale of the artist, his ambitions, and our relationship to his work. While some who had already taken art history seemed to dislike his approach, I, as someone who simply wanted an introduction to art, loved it. Judge your taste off shopping period I guess.",
    "Take this class. The subject matter is interesting, and Prof. Nemerov is an incredible lecturer--perhaps the best at Yale.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course- I firmly believe it's one you should take before graduating, especially with someone as renowned as Prof. Nemerov.I chose to take it Credit-D, and I am VERY glad I did because there is a lot of material and a decent amount of work (one short essay, one midtem, one 10 page paper, one exam, and a whole lot of reading.)",
    "You should definitely take it before you graduate to learn something about art history. It gives you much more of an appreciation for artwork and prepare you for a greater understanding.",
    "A must take before graduation.",
    "Take it, it will change your life. It's a lot of work and a lot of memorization, so take it Cr\/D.",
    "Take the class. It is a must take for a Yale student.",
    "Nemerov makes this class. You absolutely MUST take it before graduating Yale or you will have missed out on a huge part of your cultural education (not even kidding, and I'm not even an Art History major): Nemerov makes each lecture (whether you agree with what he is saying or not) a treat.",
    "Take it, but take it credit\/D. This is the kind of class that mechanism was built for: something everyone should know, but is probably outside your area of expertise. You learn to think in a totally different way, and acquire genuinely new knowledge you'll retain for a long time. The exams are hefty and don't necessarily test what you're really taking away from the course; it's just good to give yourself some leeway.",
    "This is a good class, but I think overrated. Nemerov is very smart and interesting to listen to, but your grade is essentially based on rote memorization of artists and dates at the end of the semester, which is very stressful. Also, make sure your TA is an art history student!!",
    "HSAR 115 is a nice course. Really really interesting, but not too much work. I suggest that everyone takes it. Plus, since so many people do take it, it's really likely you'll have a lot of friends in the course.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "Every student should take this class by Nemerov at some point during yale. Such an interesting course and it overlaps with a wide variety of other classes (such as my italian language class and other friends' european studies courses.)",
    "I would recommend it, although I probably learned the most when i studied the material on my own. Lecture tends to be a theatrical arena",
    "Yes. Large amount of work but very fun and rewarding",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It's absolutely amazing. Nemerov is incredible! You won't look at art the same way. Plus, it's really not a lot of work- you just have to be able to memorize dates and titles for the midterm and final, but really chill during most weeks. You can't leave Yale without taking this class!",
    "First, the strengths of this course: an extremely compelling lecturer, really beautiful and amazing art, and a generally light workload. I think that any liberal arts education would really benefit from learning art history, and from learning how this strand of culture can speak to us about ourselves, and our histories.However, while I generally enjoyed this class, and the view it gave me of the subject and of academia in general, it was problematic in several ways. First of all, Professor Nemerov has a tendency to pontificate about art in a personal and sometimes arbitrary way -- sometimes he would have visual or academic evidence, and other times he would not. From what I've heard anecdotally he does enjoy being challenged, but unfortunately in a lecture this big, where the learning is being mediated by TAs, classwork and discourse often amounted to sycophantically parroting back his buzzwords. Moreover our version of western art history had huge gaps in it -- we somehow skipped over Goya, a great deal of Cezanne, and the Abstract Expressionists, among others. Picasso was boiled down to a single painting. Renaissance art was often discussed entirely out of its very Catholic context. These are all problems which are arguable, but unfortunately with few forums to argue them in, since this is such a huge and popular lecture. Since Nemerov's personal specialty is with photography and with kitsch, his lectures were much more valuable and rewarding once we got to the 20th century. Before then, the quality of his lectures was variable.Still, the founding philosophy of this class is fundamentally sound. Nemerov sincerely wants students to be able to analyze visually, think critically, and connect pieces to one another, all of which are valuable skills. He would be an extremely interesting and valuable seminar leader. Moreover the conversations and debates that I had with my friends after the class were really great, for what it's worth.A word to the wise: The Cult of Nemerov (the gaggle of students who furiously type his every word) is particularly terrifying. Gather your snarkier friends around you, really challenge what art history is, and this class will then become a genuinely intellectual experience.",
    "I would recommend it if you attend on doing the work. I got a lot out of the class but it required cramming for midterm and final. Take it credit D and attend lecture and it will be a rewarding class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Not a lot of work, NO READING, and really fun. All you have to do is study for the exams and take a couple days to write the papers. Really not that hard.",
    "Yes, take it. It's a Yale must.",
    "This is a solid lecture to take if you are interested in art history at all. It's not a ton of work, but I am happy I decided not to take it for a grade as I am not an art history major and I could see the exams being pretty stressful if being taken for a grade.",
    "Take it or you'll regret it.",
    "This is a great course, and if you have any interest in art you should take it. Many people take it Cr\/D\/F, but I found it to be manageable for a grade as long as you put enough effort into your papers and pay attention in the lectures. In the course evaluations I found that people in previous years of the course felt their TAs graded too harshly, but I didn't feel my TA's evaluations were unfair. Also, Nemerov's lectures are not to be missed; he is incredibly eloquent speaking on any topic related to art. Although you must do some work to prepare for midterm and final, the class is worth it and not overly burdensome overall. Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS> You will look at art and the world in a whole new way. It's a great class that will enrich how you see the world, understand history and politics, and help you understand yourself. I took this class as a senior and only wish that I had taken it as a freshman, as I might have been pushed to study art history because of it.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's a must before leaving Yale. The art we cover is fascinating, and the lectures are masterfully delivered. Attending section in the Art Gallery was such a treat, and undoubtedly a integral component of the opportunity to learn and embrace art as an individual. Be prepared to supplement lectures with a little independent review of the historical context--this helps for the midterm and final, and really isn't covered in class.",
    "Obviously take it.",
    "This is a great class. If you've never taken Art History before, you should definitely try it. It's interesting, informative, and not too much work.",
    "I would recommend this class. Lecture is great and the reading is interesting (albeit rather unnecessary). It is not too much work. Nemerov is a bit kooky and you will likely not agree with everything he says (nor should you) but this makes going to class even more enjoyable. It is more of an \"art appreciation\" than \"art history\" class, though. Take it if you want to sound impressive at a gallery or cocktail party, but maybe not if you are really bent on connecting everything back to the history.",
    "This is a great course. The work load is pretty low and it is really interesting.",
    "Yes, but the grading is very difficult and subjective.",
    "Absolutely. A great class for anybody.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in art. It is a wonderful experience to listen in lecture and study famous art pieces in the Yale Art galleries in section. Take this course!",
    "If you don't know anything about art history, walk into a museum without any knowledge of how to look at art, take this. Great syllabus that covers all the major art movements from the Renaissance to the present. Nemerov organizes the notes very well and i like that he puts them on the server. He is clearly very passionate about the field and has a very good vocabulary to talk about it. A MUST TAKE before you leave Yale.",
    "Great class -- I took it credit D, never went or did the reading and I'm sure I'll pass. Wish I had gone though! Honestly, take it for credit so you actually learn something.",
    "Yes. Why would you not take a course on the history of art if you are at all interested in the subject?",
    "Amazing. Unless you want to do a lot of studying and memorizing though, take it credit D! I recommend every Yale student takes this class before graduating. One of those Yale gems everyone talks about...",
    "This class is an absolute must take at yale, and every one knows that so I don't know why you're reading this. P Nemerov talks like a poet, and he will undeniably make you think--about art as well as life. All your friends will be in this class and it will be quite a traditional experience, DO IT.",
    "It's an okay class - it leaves out a lot of really important artists and pieces. Nemerov teaches the way he wants to teach, and its not until the end of the course do you really figure out what his angle is. That said, he traces art history through themes, rather than focusing on a specific timeline and hitting every major artist. If you want an interesting take on art history, or just a fun humanities credit, take it.",
    "Incredible lectures - a wonderful introduction to art history. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Section is pretty awesome too - you get to wander around an art gallery every week! Not too much work either - really only 2 tests and a paper. Lots of people take it credit D, but I got much more out of the class taking it for an actual letter grade.",
    "Great class! not much work until the midterm, final, and paper. you'll learn a lot too!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, like me, who wants to explore art history on a whim--actual art history majors might find it insubstantial and without the \"history\" part of art history.",
    "Fantastic course. Sections in the gallery which is great. Minimal reading. Take it.",
    "TAKE IT. Everything you've read about in the other evaluations is true: Nemerov is as brilliant as everyone says he is, as implausible as it may sound. This class will really change your view of art, and this is the most valuable thing I have learned all year. This class also introduced me to the Yale Art Gallery and the Center for British Art, which are now two of my favorite places on campus. Shopping this class really might not give you the right impression - I was definitely still skeptical up until like the fifth lecture and was uncertain if I should still take it -- I am SO glad I did. This has definitely been the most influential class I have taken in my entire life.",
    "Take this class!! Very interesting.",
    "Absolutely. Everyone who is interested in learning more about art and learning new ways in which to think about art would get a lot out of this class. The tests are fair, and you will do well if you put in the time to memorize all the paintings and at least a couple of points about each one. I feel as though, after taking this course, I will get a lot more out of visiting art museums in the future.",
    "I LOVED this class, it was my favorite class this entire year. At first I thought this class would be relatively boring, maybe speeding through a bunch of paintings across 6 centuries and memorizing a bunch of artists and dates. This was completely not what this class was - Prof Nemerov made each and every lecture so interesting and so poetic. The paintings came alive and I can never look at a painting the same way. When I walk into a museum now, the experience is so much fun and so mentally stimulating. The last lecture was by far my favorite this entire year.",
    "I took it Cr\/D\/Fail, but it's definitely doable for a grade. I kind of regret that.",
    "Take it (but do it Cr\/D\/fail).",
    "Pretty much as advertised. Entertaining lectures, interesting material, not a ton of work, and exams that require a lot of memorization.",
    "Interesting, inspiring and enthralling course that makes you wake up with a smile on your face in anticipation of the class.I would definitely recommend this class, but maybe as a credit\/d\/fail since the grading is harsh",
    "Yes, awesome and interesting class to take. great overview of western art",
    "Great class if you have never taken art history. I recommend it, especially if you are a senior and are looking for something to add to your Yale experience.",
    "Art History with Professor Nemerov is one of those classics at Yale that you must take before graduation. It completely changed the way I look at art and enriched my experience at museums. Professor Nemerov is poetic and insightful, and his lectures can be absolutely spine-tingling. My TA was amazing and section (held at the YUAG) is always interesting and engaging - by far my favorite discussion section I've ever had. The workload is completely manageable, and the 2 papers we write are quite enjoyable.",
    "Highly recommend the course. Nemerov is phenomenal and the content is super interesting. This is a great way to speed through the basics of art history.",
    "Yes. Definitely. it is a good survey of the time period and allows you to have a good general knowledge about art works.",
    "Yes, especially if you're looking for a humanities credit. Interesting and not much work.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing. First, a knowledge of western art from the Renaissance onwards is invaluable. Second, Prof Nemerov is a mind-blowingly fantastic lecturer. Seriously, his lectures sometimes feel as if they could inspire something akin to a religious epiphany. The sections vary greatly in how helpful\/worthwhile they are, but they are also great for getting you into the YUAG and looking at and thinking about art. Take this!!!",
    "This was one of my favorite classes. You basically get to listen to Nemerov tell stories about history and people and places for an hour twice a week, while being exposed to great art. This course gives you the tools to examine and enjoy art in a new way. Aside from 2 papers, this course is not very work-heavy from class to class, but you do have to memorize over 100 paintings and identify them with their artists and dates for the final. Don't let that scare you away though! Just make flash cards and start early. Section is held in the art gallery. Great class!",
    "Yes! It was a great course as a senior looking to have a fun (but with lots of memorizing for the exams) course. Section was unconventional and great. From what I heard of the other TAs, they're all pretty great.",
    "It's interesting, and frankly, a pretty easy A. Very little work, and readings can be done super quickly. Mid-term and final are a breeze to revise for as long as you have a good head for dates.",
    "see answer to question 4. I absolutely recommend it--even if it isn't perfect, you leave basically every lecture feeling like your perspective is enhanced in some way",
    "The best lecture course I've taken. Professor Nemerov is a treasure and will provide you with an inspiring semester.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR CREDIT. This course is very rewarding as long as you are willing to engage with the material in a serious way. The workload is very light. The exams are easy as long as you go to lecture. Simply memorize the IDs and look over your notes at least once. This is one of the best classes that I've ever taken at Yale. Even if you haven't taken an art history course before (like me), there isn't a single reason to take this course for credit.",
    "Amazing class. Lecture is absolutely necessary and section is actually fun! The papers aren't too terrible, although the deadline on the last one springs up on you fast - work on it over spring break.",
    "Great intro - lots of memorization but useful knowledge and fun to learn about different artists\/paintings",
    "I would recommend it. The workload is definitely manageable and it is overall an enjoyable course.",
    "It's rewarding if you want to learn about art. I feel much more educated now. I'd recommend taking it credit\/d so you don't have to worry about memorizing about 200 pictures from the final. This is a really good overview but a lot of work (midterm, final, 2-page paper, 10-page paper, and section). Section is in the art gallery, which is fun.",
    "Please take this course before you graduate. Often times, we are forced to think so linearly, whether it is using an equation or defining a theory. However, this course forces you to think exponentially. It is truly a thought provoking course.",
    "A great CR\/D. Little reading, lots to learn.",
    "Take it.",
    "YES!!! Take this class, it was absolutely awesome. Nemerov's lectures are great, the work load is light and it is really interesting. You get to go to to the Yale Art Gallery for section which is so cool. Overall, this class is interesting, not a lot of work or time and hands down my favorite class of freshman year.",
    "HSAR 115 is offers knowledge about art to anyone, even people who knew nothing about art beforehand. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Take the class, so worth it! I took it Cr\/D\/Fail and really enjoyed just sitting back and learning. This is definitely a class where I didn't want to worry about the grade but just wanted to learn. All my other classes at 25 or less people and this is a HUGE lecture, so it was nice to be anonymous in a class.",
    "Take this course. Like fine wines, a good taste for this class must be acquired. The first couple lectures seemed like complete BS, but as I adjusted to Nemerov's lecturing style, I liked each lecture more and more. I now feel as though I can intelligently analyze a painting in its historical context. Note: this course was far less \"history\" than I expected. Nemerov doesn't really comment on the historical context of his paintings but, rather, details the response and meaning of a painting. A little research outside of lecture is necessary to keep the lectures grounded in history.",
    "Definitely take this class. The material is important for anyone to know, and the class changed the way that I think about and analyze art. It's also not a ton of work, just a lot of memorization for the midterm and the final.",
    "This course is wonderful. Professor Nemerov's are so carefully prepared; every minute seems to have been planned. Art History should be part of anyone's liberal arts education; it opens your eyes to details and experiences we normally for granted. You should definitely it.",
    "This class would be better named \"Introduction to the Appreciation of Western Art.\" While lectures were awesome and Professor Nemerov had some great insights into some incredible art, it was more focused on art appreciation than the history itself. I went into the class hoping to get a better idea of art movements specifically (because I am already a big art appreciator) and was unsatisfied in that respect. So I guess a great class if you want a chance to look at and appreciate art.",
    "First of all, this class is more appropriately titled Art Appreciation \/ Art Interpretation by Nemerov. You don't learn any technical terms or how to analyze art.It's a gut. Also, being a science major, I was astonished by how easy it was to study for the tests (memorize some dates and what Nemerov thinks about each painting). If you like rigorous proofs and autonomous thinking, you'll despise this. This is hearing the most eloquent man since Martin Luther King spew his emotions about art and HIS interpretations which you sometimes think are absurd. But he's very passionate. Nemerov could die beside the art.Like I said, definitely a gut. I wrote most of my papers hung over -- and it's all theoretical, all your own interpretation that you cannot be proved wrong about. And my TA ate it up.That being said, I emerged from it with a real appreciation for most (not all) pieces of art.",
    "Take it! (But take it credit\/D -- I would really have been overwhelmed had I not)",
    "Shop it. Either like it or you don't.",
    "HSAR 115 is an amazing lecture. Professor Nemerov will make you think about looking at art, cultural criticism and visual analysis in a totally different way. Definitely one of the classes you have to take before graduating.",
    "Despite all of the glowing reviews you will probably read for this class, I'm not sure that it will be a constructive use of your time. I was unconvinced by many of Nemerov's artistic claims, and his analyses struck me as both slightly elitist and hyperemotional. He once told us that on a trip to the Louvre with his family he was \"scandalized\" by the \"hordes of people\" who weren't paying enough attention to each piece art. When he told this to his wife, she chided him for being a \"delicate flower\". But really, he is.I was also underwhelmed by his lectures. He frequently used awkward, imprecise words that were a chaotic collection of suffixes, like \"ongoingness\", \"bisexualizing\", \"psychobiographical\", and \"phallicness\". It was sometimes hard to take anything objective from what he had to say because his speech was full of inflated and nebulous artistic buzzwords.Finally, he doesn't respect your time; every lecture will last at least 5 minutes longer than the class period, probably more like 10 minutes. That's pretty much all I have to say.",
    "Art History is a staple. I took it CR\/D\/F to begin, but then switched the course to a grade after the midterm. The final is about 150 works.",
    "It's a fun class. I buy the hype. I would recommend it. It's good stuff to know and it's presented in a fun and interesting way.",
    "Yes! If you want to be able to talk about art better, take this course. but I would recommend to begin with credit\/d\/f if you are not an art history major.",
    "I liked this class, but not as much as I thought I would. I guess Professor Nemerov's lecturing style didn't really resonate with me, but I know a lot of other people love him. Section was actually my favorite part of the class (if Olivia is a TA again try and get into her section, she's awesome!). The class itself seemed organized by theme rather than historical\/social context which disoriented me a bit, but I'm nothing close to an art history major so I don't really have anything to compare it to. I took the class Credit\/D\/Fail so I didn't overstudy for the final, but when I was going over the paintings in preparation I realized that I did actually learn a lot about art and how to view and interpret art in a new way. Despite my ambivalence about Nemerov I would recommend at least shopping this class at some point in your Yale career.",
    "I disliked this course to the point of disgust in the beginning. Professor Nemerov threw around terms like \"emotional vector\" and \"space differential\" that caught me off guard as a mathematically-oriented student. However, the strength of this course is that it gets exponentially better as the semester goes on, and at the end of the semester, I found this course to be the most valuable, inspiring, rewarding, and thought-provoking course out of all my other classes. Nemerov's lecture on modern art was when I finally understood the mission and vision of 1960s artists such as Warhol and Lichtenstein, and the return to the Old Masters after an entire semester gave renewed insight to the depth of their art.Another strength would be the assigned essays, because through writing the essays, students are forced to personally interact with an artwork. I was surprised at the level of interpretation and meaning that can be gleaned through introspection on a piece of art, and this course opened the door of artistic interpretation for me. For empirically-minded students, this class is well worth sticking out! You will not regret it.",
    "take it",
    "Definitely recommend. Its the stuff about art you always wished you knew. A lot of it is Nemerov's personal opinion, which I found interesting, but that bothered other people.",
    "This class really teaches you how to think about art. It's so much more than just memorizing a lot of painting and their dates (although you'll have to do a lot of that), because what you get out of it is more the skill of analyzing and talking about art. Even if you're the kind of skeptic who regards art history as a lot of ungrounded and subjective fluff, I bet you'll be convinced otherwise if you take this class.",
    "I would recommend it. It's just a good way to gain cultural knowledge. Don't expect to get a lot of history, expect fluffy, more philosophical insights. I do have a greater sensitivity towards art now.You focus on specific artists and works, to the detriment of the survey. It's not a survey course, it's art appreciation, and one that I think is valuable if you have an open mind.",
    "I loved this class. The lectures were interesting, and I came away from the class feeling like I had learned a lot. It has sparked my interest enough to pursue this path academically in the future. Nemerov was a great instructor, and the TA's were knowledgable, accessible and helpful. The textbook wasn't always the most relevant, but it was easy to read and I felt encouraged to read chapters that weren't even assigned reading. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has ever been curious about the history of art. Also, the curriculum is challenging around the time of assessments, but I would also recommend taking it for a grade, not CR\/D. It is not difficult to do well, as long as you stay on top of the coursework.",
    "Amazing class, take it before you leave Yale -- it will change your life.",
    "It is a great class. You will enjoy going to lecture everyday. And, Professor Nemerov is not someone who believes that every piece of art is great just because we call it art. He does explain what everything means etc etc, but he refreshingly wants us to judge painting. He helps you understand the trajectory of the history of art throughout Western Civilization.",
    "I don't know if this class is worth taking for a letter grade if you have no interest in At History. However, I strongly recommend at least taking this class Credit\/D. It's an amazing class.",
    "Necessary for every Yale student, just try to not go to lecture sleepy because Nemerov's voice is somewhat melodic... he's a great lecturer though. Take it Credit\/D if you can.",
    "Great class...take it before you graduate",
    "Take this regardless of your background to be conversant in art history.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS CLASS. Go to lecture and listen to Nemerov. He will change the way you look at art forever. WORTH TAKING. Not an overwhelming amount of work, aside for some memorization for the midterm and final.",
    "Take this class! It's very little work, but really expands your knowledge of art. Make sure you get a good TA -- they can really supplement lecture. Some argue that the class is too abstract and doesn't contain enough history. This is partially true, but shouldn't be enough to deter you from taking it.",
    "Less a class about art history, more a class that embodies art-viewing\/criticism. Somehow Nemerov manages to establish a sense of trust between himself and his 600-odd students -- you'll come to trust that his lectures will absorb and emit all sorts of perspectives, that his treatment of art will both acknowledge and discredit the perception of art-viewing as irrelevant\/douchey. There'll always be some students, I think, who believe that their taking the class is some kind of ironic move, part of some crusade to tear down artistic elitism -- but see the class and its professor for what they are, and you probably won't be disappointed.",
    "Nemerov is verbose to the point of excess. Class is overall good and I enjoyed section every week in the art gallery.",
    "Take this class. Art history from the Renaissance to the present in the West is a huge body of work--and the class is huge--so Prof Nemerov chooses a handful of paintings (basically no sculpture or architecture) to focus on and gives thoughtful readings which attempt to account for the great fascination we have with these paintings of the past. He pulls out a bit of a narrative in the history of art, often focusing on the ways in which artists use painting as a place to comment on the act of painting, which they love and struggle with. This starts to become difficult in the modern period, and here and in contemporary art I thought Prof Nemerov had less surprising things to say. I don't think the structure of the class should change--those who think Nemerov is too \"woo-woo\" or abstract are missing the point that he is making, which is that art history, if it is to be meaningful and respect the meaningfulness of the art works as art, cannot be restricted to dates and history, but must include a theoretical accounting-for of the power of art. As an artist, I came out of every lecture with at least one new idea or new insight to turn around in my head, some new little thought about painting or a particular artist or work that inspired me.",
    "Amazing course- Nemerov is brilliant, the work is minimal, especially if you know something about art history.",
    "Intro to History of Art is an extremely well-done large lecture in the humanities. Although it is important to question Nemerov's lectures and form one's own opinions about the artwork, this class does an excellent job of teaching you how to talk about and appreciate art and its role in society from 1300 to the present. My favorite part of this class was the section, because it's an incredible experience to stand in front of paintings in the gallery and discussion them with the TFs, who are, in my experience, terrific. I heartily recommend this class; it made me fall back in love with art.",
    "It's a good class, but definitely overrated. The lectures are enjoyable, but I'm not sure how much art history I actually learned. Take it if the material interests you, but I disagree with those people who say this is a \"must take\" class at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it. It is an incredible class.",
    "Lives up to the hype. Nemerov is a god.",
    "MUST TAKE IT IF YOU HAVE NEVER TAKEN AN ART HISTORY CLASS BEFORE! It is such a joy to be in this class!",
    "It's really more of an art appreciation course than an art history course, but it's all good stuff to know and works that you ought to be familiar with, and it won't kill you so you should take it.",
    "yes!",
    "Awesome class that will teach you one way to go about understanding art. Maybe the coolest thing is that it's not definitive, but by the end you will trust your own instincts so much more.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this course, especially if you take it Credit\/D. If you don't the exams are hard because you have to do a lot of painting ids (including dates). However, despite wishing I'd taken it Credit\/D instead I do not regret for an instant taking the class because Nemerov is amazing!!",
    "Yes, great survey course and Nemerov's lectures are awesome!",
    "Absolutely. A course you MUST take (with or without previous art history experience)! You will want to attend every class.",
    "Really wonderful course. Perfect CR\/D\/Fail option. Professor Nemerov is an amazing lecturer who knows an incredible amount about his field of study. I really don't think anyone should leave Yale without taking this course. The workload is completely manageable, even if you skip a lecture here or there. Truly delightful 5th class that's enjoyable and gives a perfect introduction to a part of the world that I'm not sure Yale students often pay much attention to.",
    "It's a good summary of history of Western art. I recommend it if you would like to have aOne possible setback of this course is that your grades will be hugely affected depending on which TA you will get. If the TA is really strict, your grades can be damaged considerably, while other TAs grade really leniently.",
    "I would recommend this course if you already have an interest in art history, especially if you yourself are an artist to some capacity. The course focuses more on bring different works into dialogue, so its more up to you to develop your own opinions and analyses of individual paintings. This class is a hate it or love it kind of thing, and while I loved it, I know several people that thought it was a crock of bs because they didn't really have an appreciation for art to begin with. Really small workload though.",
    "general survey course",
    "Take this class. Just do it. I didn't even buy the textbook, but I looked forward to lecture EVERY day and really enjoyed both section and the papers I wrote, and I did fine. Nemerov's lectures don't do it for some people, but I found them INCREDIBLE and eloquent and just... well, awesome. I see the world differently now that I've taken this class. I can go anywhere and understand the art. Section in the YUAG was one of the best parts of my week - make sure you get a good TA, because they'll be grading your stuff and communicating with you far more than Nemerov (although don't be afraid to approach him, he's actually quite cool). This is one of those courses that you don't need to put much into to get a ton out of. Take it as a 5th or 6th course. You'll love it.",
    "This class is terrific and very much worth it. As someone who had never really been affected by art before, I felt that this course allowed me to appreciate art and art history. Nemerov is a very entertaining lecturer, although some take more time to warm up to him than others. A very broad range of material is covered, although the class itself is not much work on a week to week basis. Sections are held in the Yale art gallery, and it was nice to become familiar with the gallery.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course. Obviously, it is wonderful to gain a basic knowledge of this subject. But I mostly found myself frustrated and bored in this class. Unless you want to be an art history major, I would suggest you do not take this class.",
    "I would. You learn a lot of well-known pieces of art. It's good for cocktail knowledge if that's all you want out of it, but it's also a good starting point for other academic pursuits.",
    "Absolutely fabulous. This was my favorite course at Yale so far, and I'm a science major!! I can't wait to take another class with Professor Nemerov. He offered fresh takes on paintings and sculptures that I would have never thought of. But he also left room for us to make our own conclusions. The midterm and final were extremely fair, and the papers were actually FUN to write! Can't think of any improvements I would suggest.",
    "I would not recommend this course to an individual who likes learning in a concrete manner. Professor Nemerov incorporates a poetic element into his lectures. Especially at the beginning of the semester these poetic elements are hard to grasp and sometimes are a little far fetched. When it comes to studying for the midterm or final memorizing artists, dates, titles, and specific information about each painting becomes daunting. Unless you are determined to become more cultured in the art realm, don't take the class if you don't need to.",
    "This is an excellent survey course in Western art. From the standpoint of practicality, thecourse has taught me about the canon of masterpieces and artists, how to view and readworks of art, and situate an artwork in history. More importantly, I was affected by ProfessorNemerov's emphasis on his belief that art history should not just be about acquiring culturalcapital. Professor Nemerov has taught me to see works of art in such a way that they aren'tfrozen artifacts from the past, but rather, as sappy as it might sound, are living in thepresent. Nemerov challenges students to sympathize with the artists in the process creatingart and the original viewers. Furthermore, Nemerov challenges students to let art affect thememotionally. I highly recommend taking the class; it is one of Yale's gems.",
    "Definitely take this class before you graduate.",
    "Brilliant.",
    "Ultimate \"liberal arts education\" class.",
    "This is an interesting class, though do not expected a normal art history class. While you will get some of that, this class is more about listening to Professor Nemerov speak. I recommend it, but if you are the type of person that will get annoyed by a professor going off on his own little tangents and not covering the basic art history material, shop it and see what you think. This semester we wrote a 2 page paper, a rough draft and a final 10 page paper, and had a midterm and final. If you are taking it credit\/d though, beware - you'll still have to study for the midterm and final because you still have to put at least a little time into memorizing the paintings.",
    "There is a review from a previous year that really sticks out in my mind. It stated simply: \"Four words: Alexander Nemerov runs wild\". I think that that review was veryaccurate in describing the course. This is NOT a survey! This is Professor Nemerov's personal musings on a set of arbitrarily chosen works. If you are interested in hearing a brilliant, eloquent, and sometimes ridiculous professor lecture poetically for fifty minutes twice a week, definitely take this course! It really is an enjoyable course. But do not be fooled into thinking that this is a true survey course in the history of art. If that is what you are looking for, be sure to read the textbook, because that is the only place you'll get what you're looking for.",
    "Must take before you graduate!",
    "Really great and very helpful for visiting European cities, so do it if you're an underclassmen, before you travel abroad. It's a really fun course but at least start it cr\/d. Some of the TAs grade more harshly than others.",
    "Yes. One of the best classes I've taken.",
    "Absolutely. You should not graduate Yale without taking this class; it was a privilege to hear Prof. Nemerov's lectures! The sections were also very enjoyable (looking at art pieces relevant to that week's lecture at the YUAG).",
    "Take this class. nemerov is amazing and the TAs are good. i loved art history after taking this. one of the most enjoyable classes I've ever taken.",
    "Yes. You will learn a lot.",
    "Discusses specifically chosen pieces of artwork from 1300 to 1980s. Each lecture covers anywhere from 1 to 10 pieces, and also examines related works of art (sometimes from different places\/time periods). There's a midterm, a 10 page paper, and a cumulative final. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has even a slight interest in art, especially if you like to make art (I took it during the same term as a drawing course and was very happy with the parallels that came up between the two classes).",
    "Interesting, worth taking to get a good overview of the art after the renaissance. However, be prepared to put up with some lectures that are just wayyy over the top\/fluffy\/BS-y. Generally interesting and keeps your attention though.",
    "as great an intro art history course as i could have ever hoped for. take it",
    "If you have any appreciation for art, you have to take this class before graduating. You will leave lecture feeling inspired and better understand how art connects and builds upon itself. A great course, with a great professor.",
    "Yes, I absolutely recommend it! I would take it Credit D Fail if you're a senior as memorizing all the paintings is easy to cram but studying things beyond that can get very difficult and tedious.",
    "Yes, everyone should take it. Art history is important to learn as an undergrad, but this course will also equip you with the visual skills and descriptive abilities to succeed in future courses.",
    "Well-taught and well-designed art history survey course. It takes a decent amount of good-faith work, but you'll get a lot out of it (and this is coming from a senior econ and poli sci major who just wanted to broaden my horizons).",
    "Awesome. Take it. Especially if you don't think you like art that much. I just went to the National Gallery in London and had a fucking blast, which I have never done at an art museum before.",
    "YES- the first time i came out of that class, i said \" this is why i chose yale.\"",
    "incredible narratives provided by nemerov. wonderful images. great introduction to history of art.",
    "Nemerov is awesome! You'll learn a lot and maybe be a better person at the end.",
    "Take it. Know about art and behold the glory that is Nemerov interacting with art.",
    "Take it Cr\/D\/Fail unless you're sure you want to be an art history major. Everyone should know how to talk\/think about art, and this is a good way of getting to know how to do that.",
    "Only if you are interested in Art History.",
    "i would definitely recommend this course to someone looking to appreciate art and learn a lot about it from someone whose passion is palpable.",
    "The class is overrated. Granted, it is interesting and Nemerov is, in fact, a brilliant speaker with a huge, huge vocabulary. But I think Nemerov warns the room during shopping period-- this class isn't very scholarly. If you want an art appreciation class that will expose you to some great paintings, take the class. If you want a picture of an art historical trajectory, some historical context, information on sculpture and architecture (two important parts of art history that Nemerov just doesn't ever talk about), look elsewhere. It was interesting, but not THAT interesting and isn't really what should be called introductory art history. But it's super easy and kind of interesting, depending on what you're looking for.",
    "Take it, but be aware that Nemerov's lectures are sometimes hyperbolic and marred by his own personal emotions and beliefs, so it often strays away from giving you a general background in art history.",
    "I probably would not recommend this course. While there were three or four amazing lectures, I felt the majority of lectures were disjointed and even at times pretentious.",
    "Take it! I can't believe you can get through an entire education, from elementary school to college, without taking a history of art class. It will totally change the way you go to museums (for the better) and the way you visually analyze anything.",
    "Take it! Absolutely phenomenal.",
    "Really interesting introductory class. Provides a good foundation to the field.",
    "One of those things you must take before you graduate. It's so worth it. Don't bother with credit\/d. if you have a good visual memory you will be fine on the tests.",
    "This was a really good class! Definitely a must-take before you graduate -- you really learn how to analyze art, which is a skill that doesn't come naturally to everyone. Memorizing the slides is pretty time-consuming, but it's definitely worthwhile in the end; it's surprisingly rewarding.",
    "It was worth every minute",
    "History of Art 115 01 is an art history survey from the 1300's to the 90's. Plucking influential pieces from amongst an overwhelming sea of artand craft through this time, Professor Nemerov creates a curriculum that gives you a fascinating and engaging overview of how these works functioned in both their time and in modern day. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone; I believe that every Yale student should take it at some point. This course will lead you to look at art in a whole new way, and you will come to appreciate craft and the beauty in this world.",
    "Every Yale student should take this class before graduating. There's nothing else to say.",
    "I will definitely recommend this class to another student. It is one of the best classes I had in Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I really did not enjoy this course at all. I'm an art history major and only took this class because it was a requirement, but it was extremely difficult to get through. Nemerov is way too wordy and basis all of his classes on his interpretations. Sometimes he's just too much to deal with. I feel like I just had to memorize what he felt the paintings were about instead of really learning art history.",
    "Yes, a great Credit\/D",
    "Everyone at Yale should take this class. Before taking it I was very against the idea, but my roommate convinced me to shop the course. I loved every single lecture and the class was one of my better academic experiences at Yale. Papers were fun to write and exams weren't too difficult.",
    "This course really emphasizes the formal and symbolic aspects of art from the Renaissance to the present. I would strongly recommend this course to another student; however, I would warn them that they should probably take some of what Prof. Nemerov says with a grain of salt. While essentially everything that he says makes sense, it seems like a fair amount of it may be a bit of a stretch.",
    "Take it before you graduate.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "It's a good class, but a lot of memorization. I took it for a grade because I thought I could memorize everything, but it took more than just that and I wish that I had credit\/d the class.",
    "Yeah, you should take it, either for the Art or Art History major as a requirement or just to expand the kind of thinking you're required to do as another major. It's a nice respite from really hardcore analytical stuff.",
    "This class is a \"Yale\" class. It is one that a person should try extremely hard to take during his or her years at Yale. If you don't have any art history background, the class will teach you how to view art and is a fantastic first art history course to take. If you do have art history background (AP Art Hist), this class will still stun and amaze you. The lectures focus on primarily visual analysis (composition, colors, light and dark etc.) and they lack historical context. It is up to the student to read the textbook before the lecture to understand the history behind the painting. That being said, the textbook is not a necessary supplement to the course and a student can enjoy the course without it. Also, please shop the class. It is not for everyone. Some find it unbearable; most are mesmerized. The first few classes give you a good look at what the course will be like for the entire semester.",
    "ALL MAJORS TAKE IT DEFINITELY.",
    "I definitely recommend it.",
    "Nemerov's art history lecture is a great course. Take it! It's not hard and it's interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I feel very cultured after having taken this class, and now I can go to museums and know what's going on. The lecture format worked, and I liked listening to Nemerov's rhapsodies on art. I've heard debates about the merits of his lecturing style, but I don't care if he goes on emotional tangents all the time. I admire his ability to articulate his thoughts and emotions so well... I often tried to copy down his poetic gushes word for word so I can reread it later. Also, there is hardly any work involved other than the paper and the two exams.",
    "Nemerov is a great lecturer. He uses no notes and speaks almost in poetry. He's really passionate. Really glad I took the course.",
    "Absolutely, this is a must-take for all Yalies.",
    "Definitely take this class- Professor Nemerov is a great lecturer, and art history is something that everybody should know something about because it comes up so often. I really learned a lot from this class. It's very manageable, not a big workload.",
    "Great intro course to art. Take it",
    "Absolutely. You will learn so much about art, Nemerov is a god, and the workload is pretty minimal. For the amount of great conversations that this class has generated, I wholeheartedly suggest this class.",
    "It is an amazing survey coursethat everyone should take not just because you learn to recognize pieces or you get more familiar with western cultural patrimony, but because you learn about looking at art. You learn how to look at something, a painting, an engraving, a chair, a photograph, etc and you learn to approach it. It is a skill that is not well-developed in many other disciplines and I think it's quite an important one. Also, if Athens is a TA, definitely take her section. She is absolutely brilliant and the nicest person.If you want, you can take it credit\/d but it's not too hard to take it for a grade. I guess it depends on your other workload.",
    "Each lecture focuses on a few paintings, often several by the same artist, from different time periods. Nemerov would talk about political reasons for the development of certain art movements as well as reasons personal to the artists. In section, we would go to either the Center for British Art or the Yale Art Gallery and analyze authentic works of art. I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys museums and\/or is interested in the stories behind paintings. The tests were hard though so don't think you won't need to study.",
    "Great intro to the subject matter.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if only to learn about art. Taking it Credit\/D allowed a lot of students to learn the material without the pressure of a grade.",
    "If there's one course you should have on your transcript before graduation, it's this one. Prof. Nemerov is epic. The content of the lectures will enable you to talk knowledgeably about any piece of art by the time you're done. And you'll understand what was so great about Pollock and Picasso's work (I didn't before).",
    "Loved it. Makes you feel cultured and better able to appreciate\/analyze art.",
    "HSAR 115 is not as little work as people claim: in the end, it's a short paper, a midterm, a long paper, and a final. But the work is really interesting, and even I (someone who wouldn't consider himself artistic at all) really enjoyed the class and developed a new appreciation for works of art. Professor Nemerov is great, and it's a lot of fun to have sections in the Art Gallery (resources that I never really explored before).",
    "I loved this class! It did exactly what I wanted it to do, which was to initiate in me a basic familiarity and appreciation for art. Walking into any museum, I have a much better idea how to think about what I am looking at.",
    "What a fantastic way to end Yale. This class is minimal work\u0097and the work you do have to do is really fun. It was fantastic to take this class with a big group of friends as Nemerov's lecture-style really provokes discussion that continues past the classroom. I walked out everyday feeling like I was seeing the world through a slightly different lens. One of Yale's must-takes.",
    "I highly recommend the course, if you want to have a decent understanding of western art. But keep in mind that it is a survey course and therefore not very specific.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely take this class. It is a survey course in the sense that it works its way through the history of Western art, covering a large chronological span and a diversity of regional movements and styles, but it is far from a cut-and-dried, fact-based checklist of painters and periods. Each lecture focuses on a handful of specific paintings by one or more artists from a particular region and moment in time, and these form a framework on which Professor Nemerov develops a particular theme or argument. Professor Nemerov is utterly captivating as a lecturer, clearly brilliant and deeply, personally invested in the material. You will come away from the course with a deeper understanding and appreciation, not just of the artworks studied, but of art, beauty, and the human creative spirit. It's powerful stuff."
