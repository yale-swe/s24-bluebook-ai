   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course for those who are specifically interested in the healthcare system.",
    "This class is rewarding. It provides an overview of healthcare policy throughout history in both an American and global context. Three things may be of note to students: The discussion may be a bit repetitive, the class does NOT focus much on the recent Obama reforms so do not take it if that is your only focus, and the reading workload is heavy but the writing workload is not.",
    "I recommend this seminar. The workload is manageable: five 2-page papers in response to the readings.",
    "Slightly more reading the the usual class, but the writing load is much lighter (5 2-page papers). Professor Swenson does not grade the papers easy, but gives you the chance to revise two of them. The class itself is heavily discussion-oriented, but the discussion could use some more direction in general. Good readings, so so discussion, pretty light class.",
    "If you're interested in health policy, this is a good class. Health care probably isn't Prof. Swenson's primary area of expertise, but he's done a lot of research in the field and is knowledgeable about many aspects of the American health care system. The class definitely has a liberal bias, although the curriculum does make a good-faith effort to include some conservative sources. Because health care is such an important policy problem, it's good to know something about it, and this is one of the few clases at Yale that addresses it. Be prepared for discussion to lag sometimes, but also expect some great meetings. The workload is manageable, and the reading is generally pretty useful."
