    "This class is great overall, my only suggestion is to shorten the time for each class session and maybe meet twice a week.",
    "A very good class, but the homework assignments are very lengthy. This also should be turned into a full semester class, because it felt like everything was crunched into the last few weeks of school and caused us even to have class during reading week, which shouldn't be the case.",
    "This is an excellent course that is well worthy taking.Maria is very clear about what she is teaching and explain the content very clearly and in a very organized way.",
    "The course is very helpful in providing basic quantitative knowledge.",
    "Amazing slides and the homework is very helpful to understanding the material",
    "Strengths: the instructor is very nice and her slides are very goodWeaknesses: It took many, many hours to complete the homework (too detailed, too many calculations...)",
    "really good.. Very comprehensive. A must take course for any public health student.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I wish it was a full semester though and covered more topics in depth",
    "Slides were comprehensive and detailed (however they were less clear\/comprehensive as the slides for BIS 632)BIS 630 and BIS 632 were the best taught biostatistics courses I have taken.",
    "This is an excellent course. It would have been better to have a full semester course and go into more depth. The final exam was too time limited given the questions. It felt like there was more emphasis on being tested on speed of answering the questions versus content.",
    "detailed, not enough time",
    "This is a very good course. Its main strengths are that it covers the major concepts and applications of applied survival analysis and that the lecture notes are regularly very good; while a weakness is that some type of questions in the assignments are different from the exams, and sometimes from those in the slides too. Therefore, it can improved by doing the assignments and lecture notes even more homogeneous with the exams.",
    "super practical, very nice job",
    "If only the instructor could stop reading the lecture notes",
    "it's vey helpful and well-organized, I hope we could have more in-class time to learn something in detail.",
    "Really good course materials and lectures.",
    "very good!",
    "Homework included too many problems that were solved by hand. Didn't really seem to realistically represent how these problems would be solved in the work setting where SAS would probably be used.",
    "strengths: This course is an essential component of the biostatistics curricula at YSPH and to my knowledge, the most accessible and in depth look at the cox proportional hazards modelweaknesses: This should be a full-semester course"
