    "This course was very helpful for understanding how the procedures for making diagnostic decisions are carried out in clinical settings, which is pertinent to my research. It was especially helpful when Dr. O'Brien reviewed how the new DSM has changed from the previous version throughout the course. It provided a fresh perspective of where the field of clinical psychology is moving towards and how the field recognizes its weaknesses and implement changes to strengthen them.",
    "Becoming familiar with diagnostic requirements for disorders will likely be very relevant to my research, as this has helped to frame the issues I wish to study."
