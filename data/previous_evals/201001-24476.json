    "Excellent. Useful in making me a better poet.",
    "English 451 is a good introduction to the writing of verse in that it forces you to produce a poem every week. The structure was frustrating, though, in that we had to critique poems we only had the opportunity to read through once. Unless the structure changes, I might not recommend the course to another student.",
    "See first question. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "It is a pretty standard poetry writing course, with an emphasis on form for the first half on the semester, and then broader prompts for the second half. Only take this course if your love of writing poetry will withstand the barrage of cynicism and apathy that McClatchy will heap on it every week. But if you do possess such an abiding passion, I strongly recommend that you take it. You will question things you thought about your own writing, and your reason for doing it in the first place. Every week helps!",
    "The only poetry class at Yale where you'll be forced to rhyme and write in form, which is sometimes a pain, but is good for you if you really want to improve and challenge yourself."
