   "comments": [
    "I think that Marney is the most empathetic professor. She is very understanding and really tries to get to know her students. No other professors I have had at YSPH have tried to get to know me as a person the way Marney has. My TF Victoria Webb was also an amazing instructor. The course itself is very broad. The lecture on mental health in particular was not challenging enough for the students taking the class. A more advanced lecture on such a topic would have been appreciated. Technical issues made this lecture a nightmare. Rarely did we complete thoroughly all the slides in a given lecture. This was also frustrating as this is material we are expected to know, but were not given adequate time to learn. The most alarming part of the class is the lack of transparency in grading. While Marney provided a rubric for all major assignments, it was made very clear that grading on papers was curved. Why provide a rubric for a paper and then curve it? I felt that being judged on my paper writing skills compared to my peers would have only been valuable if we were all writing the same paper, but we all had very different health improvement projects. I found this unfair and think it lead to a lot of confusion regarding the final paper\/exam. It was also made very clear that if we chose to take the exam over writing the final paper that we would be graded more harshly. Why give an option and then treat the two options so differently that students feel grade injustice before even getting a grade on the assignment? In the end I think it would have been better to have a paper midterm and a final exam like many of our other 1st semester classes. I know Marney was trying to accommodate everyone by offering an exam option for the final as well as the paper, but the way she did it made the situation worse.",
    "Lecture is not well structured and too many irrelevant comments and jokes on the class.",
    "This was a TERRIBLE course. Every single lecture felt like the biggest waste of time and money. It felt remedial, and worse than a middle school course. I'm actually pretty sure I would have learned more in a middle school version of this course. There was absolutely no respect for our intelligence -- all the lectures seemed haphazard and disorganized. There was really no rigor involved in this course which is such a shame because it's a graduate school course. The class was not thematized and didactic (or even Socratic) -- facts were just spewed out at us. The ONLY thing I got out of this course was doing research for the in-class debates. Also, the class was overbooked so the instructor created an overflow room. This was an AWFUL idea. We are all paying far too much money to have to go to an OVERFLOW room to receive an education. It's such a shame the YSPH would allow such an awful class into the curriculum, much less to be required.",
    "Too many students took this class this semester that we had overflow problem so we needed to use a carryover room, but the audiovisual equipment was very unstable in the carryover room that we had a hard time following what was happening in the main room. I don't think this could happen again next year.",
    "Strength: provide basic knowledge on social behavior. Weakness: We have to do 3 papers, 2 debates, which are really heavy load. Although it is a core required course, not all of us are interested in it. Some of us are really struggling with the 3 sweaty paper. Even though we have a choice to either write the final paper or take the final exam, however the final exam requires us to prepare for 80 definitions and 93 essay questions, which seems to force us to write the paper.",
    "I had high hopes for this course, and must admit that I was a little disappointed. I think part of the problem was the extremely large class. This is a topic that I think would be more effectively taught in a group discussion\/seminar style rather than traditional lecture. However, with such a large class size, the opportunities for discussion were limited to our small-group sections. I would have also appreciated a little more grounding in theory and depth as opposed to breadth. For instance, it would be interesting to think about a particular theory for social and behavioral influencers of health and see how that particular theory can be seen in a variety of different situations or for different groups of people.",
    "Strengths: Relevant topics incorporated into the lectures. Weakness: Organization needs to be improved. Perhaps some timeline when going from topic to topic.",
    "Great overview of multiple facets of social\/behavioral issues in public health. Good balance of theoretical and applied topics in lecture. Some topics would have been great to have deeper analysis on (e.g. health disparities due to ses\/race\/sex). Discussion section was very helpful and interactive. Professor was always engaging and happy to interact with students. Guest lectures were informative.",
    "I didn't learn a lot from this course. Each class is like a seminar. And there were too many students in the class which, I think, influenced the overall quality. But I do like the media analysis part and writing instruction class.",
    "Strength: lectures were kept very interesting and were engaging. Weakness: Too big of a class",
    "I do not think this course was a helpful foundation to my knowledge at Yale. It is far too broad and it seemed like the classes did not flow in any way - rather, we were given a sweeping overview of lots of different somewhat-related topics, with absolutely no week-to-week connection. Furthermore, for students who have a strong psychology background, this course was a waste of money and resources. Although many of the lectures were interesting, a number of of us had covered this material many times over in undergraduate classes. Also, the grading was all over the place (at least, anecdotally), with some TAs seemingly giving out 90s and above, and some TAs who rarely did. I was disappointed with this course and the money that I had to spend on it. I think that this course could be improved by having it be SMALLER and perhaps have a case-study small-group discussion feel where we discuss topics in the news or of relevance to public health. As it stands, this course felt like a PSYC 101 intro course due to the size and broadness of the material.",
    "This course had a lot of potential, but really was a big disappointment. There is a huge logistical flaw with allowing both 1st and 2nd year students take it at the same time, and that was probably the root of over enrollment. It should be a required class for first year students to avoid having 85% of the 1st years take it along with 30% of the 2nd years. Even without considering that issue, the class did not feel like it taught me anything. Concepts were only addressed in the lectures and not always tied back to discussion sections. There is a lot of content that can be explored, but nothing more than on a surface level. The debates were a bright spot, but are too structured and did not have enough time scheduled in to have organic and useful debate. More time should be allotted for counter arguments and questions so it takes the entire section time and not just a half hour or so. The testing format is inadequate for mastering the material and the papers do not really incorporate much material from class. I chose to write the final paper, but only after considering the test, which preparing for taught me more than anything in class all semester. It also seems pretty unfair that those who opted to take the test were given no help or review but TAs were readily available for final paper feedback etc. It is as if those not writing the paper were punished and it was a sort of a false option. If that is how it is treated, it shouldn't have even been offered. There is a lot that needs to be fixed here because the class really was a waste of time. It was more useful as a forced hour and a half study hall than anything else.",
    "I did not like the presentation of the material. Each class could stood of its own and didn't connect well to other classes. The health improvement project was interesting but I felt we should have spend more time on behavior change in class.",
    "strengths: instructor's knowledge and enthusiasm weaknesses: overcrowding (not enough seats) --> diminished ability to and quality of lectures and interaction",
    "This course felt very scattered. The initial lecture was fantastic in communicating the need for examining the social and behavioral foundations of health. Unfortunately, the subsequent lectures disappointed immensely. The lectures felt just like information being thrown at the students, with very little unifying arch. Moreover, the rubrics released for each written assignment were very demeaning. I understand the desire to appear fair and equitable, and hence the issuance of a very rigid rubric, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was back in public school, being taught to a test, and writing to a rubric. I felt that the very prescribed rubric stifled creativity, and resulted in very cookie-cutter assignments. I know it is difficult to preserve room for creativity as well as equity in a class of this size, but those tensions have been wonderfully combined in other classes at Yale. I expect more of this institution than this class offered.",
    "I don't think an SBS discussion is necessary. Additionally, the class was incredibly research based and had an unreasonable amount of reading.",
    "This course lacked direction. Although I'm not sure how, the assignments and material could definitely be restructured to provide more flow and continuity. Assignments were disjointed from what was being learned in class, and from lecture to lecture it was hard to put each topic in the context of a greater picture. Incorporating reminders of that into each class would be very beneficial.",
    "The lectures left a lot to be desired. I thought much of the information was common sense and I found it not very interesting. The discussion questions were basically like pulling teeth as nobody read the articles and the teaching assistant did not know how to properly lead a discussion. I did like the personal health improvement project and the paper writing lecture.",
    "Strengths: interesting course Weaknesses: hard to see the link between each lecture",
    "Strengths - I liked the debates and the media analysis. I thought they were relevant to the course material and they made me think. Weaknesses - 1) Over enrolling the class and having to deal with the over flow room and technology challenges was a pain. It took away from lecture, disrupted the flow of class. The professor should have limited enrollment or offered 2 different sections of lecture. 2) The 2 large paper assignments (PHIP and the final paper) were not the best way to examine knowledge of the course material. Specifically, the final paper was not at all related to the course material and was honestly a waste of time. If the course were about evaluating research, then conducting a systematic review would be interesting but the class is about social behavior interactions and the paper should have had us highlight our understanding of these. 3) Sections without debates were not worthwhile. Often they were very uncomfortable - like when our TF singled out all of the people who had ever had issues with there gender or sexual orientation. Section meetings should be limited to debate weeks only. 4) I just feel that there is a huge disconnect between the objectives of the course and the material taught. It doesn't make any sense.",
    "This course does a great job covering the social\/behavioral factors that influence public health. Some of the topics weren't as interesting as others, but Marney kept the class enthusiasm up.",
    "Interesting and useful course. Provides a valuable framework to assess common challenges in public health.",
    "Strengths: -Interesting subject matter -Marney is an engaging lecturer and is funny Weaknesses: -Slides were not consistently put up before lecture -Lectures slides were not consistently finished -Class was over-enrolled and this lead to a unacceptable amount of technical difficulties and implementation of an \"overflow room\", not Marney's fault at all, YSPH should have seen this coming as it is a required class! This was really frustrating and resulted in a lot of wasted time -Many things listed in syllabus were not true or not followed Ways to Improve: -require some type of exam (midterm or final), studying for the final allowed me learn much more than I had throughout the semester -either offer in both fall and spring or figure out a better way to accommodate more students taking it -follow the syllabus -made lecture slides available before lecture -discussion section should be reworked, it was often disjointed from lecture and often felt forced rather than an actual discussion of the material -HIP was explained\/set up terribly and differed a lot from how the rubric outlined the project, which forced so many adjustments after the rubric was put out -INCREASE CONSISTENCY, some students were allowed to completely abandon any relationship of their final paper from their midterm HIP and others were not",
    "It was very difficult to understand what was the underlying theme of the class. In addition, there was restructuring of the logistics of class far into the semester which inhibited the class to really focus on the content rather than the confusion of where class would be located and such.",
    "This course is extremely helpful to scratch the surface of the underlying, pervasive issues shaping public health and its determinants. Marney is a fantastic lecturer and makes it an enjoyable lecture to attend. Additionally, her pedagological goals and means to achieve them are appreciated.",
    "This course is terrible and there should be an alternative requirement. I learned interesting statistics, but it is poorly designed and the lectures have nothing to do with the sections which then have nothing to do with the assignments. It was a mess.",
    "I wanted to like this class, but I just didn't. It is so disorganized and attempted to briefly touch upon subjects instead of actually teach us something. The TAs were variably- some were easy and some graded harshly. Not consistent. Additionally, the midterm option- either an unrelated 'Health Improvement Project' or an \"impossible\" test did not leave much choice. The debates in sections were OK, except you did not get an individual grade, but a grade as a group. If your group had one inexperienced or unprepared member, TOUGH because you will get graded down. The final- a paper or exam- was so obviously favored toward paper writing. Students were given questions to the final beforehand but could not ask questions? What the heck? Any teacher who discourages questions is a big question mark in my book. That does not facilitate learning.",
    "This was a great class! A lot of effort has gone into the lectures and structure of the class and it shows. While I appreciate the effort that goes into securing guest speakers, I almost preferred Marney's lectures because they were just so good. The biggest criticism is the health improvement project and paper. I felt like I should have gotten the most out of those assignments given their weight and emphasis, but I definitely got more out of the media analysis and debates.",
    "Strengths: The lecture on violence was excellent. Weaknesses: I left this course not sure I had learned anything and, more troublingly, not sure what I was supposed to have learned. I think this stemmed, largely, from a lack of structure. The lectures were interesting but more could have been done to establish unifying themes or broader points. This made it difficult to understand how the papers and debates fit in to the course overall. Improvements: I recommend that YSPH re-examine how this course is intended to fit in to the broader public health curriculum and come to its own conclusions about whether or not the class, as taught now, is accomplishing those goals. If indeed, the course is meant to give an ad hoc overview of various socially-mediated public health issues, then I recommend it be done as a weekly lecture series, much like the seminars that other departments already have, and not as a full class in and of itself.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. One major strength is that there are a wide range of topics discussed in the class. One thing that I would suggest is that more time is spent on the topics. Maybe instead of just one day of a brief overview of the topic maybe we can split it into to two days so that we can go a little more in depth. For example I was really interested in the mental health talk but was a little disappointed when we moved on to the next subject so quickly.",
    "It can be a bit disjointed sometimes. However the professor is very enthusiastic and provides great feedback.",
    "This class was extraordinarily disorganized, and Marney took us to Powerpoint hell every week she lectured (which was less than half). The many guest speakers were interesting, but made it so there was no flow with the class.",
    "I appreciated the sections over the lectures. Sections were more engaging and thought provoking. Loved the debates! The lectures just had too many students and the two room problem was a bit distracting.",
    "Lecture topics were very interesting and well articulated. Biggest weakness was an administrative issue--required courses should not need an \"overflow\" room.",
    "Amazing course, great materials! Really got me thinking about things differently. Really cannot think of weaknesses right now, as all facets of the course were very interesting.",
    "I found the content to be incredibly interesting. However, the assignments were for the most part a waste of time. I chose to take the final rather than write the paper as I actually wanted to get something out of the class. I felt as if I hadn't learned anything in the class by the end of it as there were no examinations to test our knowledge. I felt like by studying for the final, I would actually review the course material and really get a good handle on it rather than write a pointless paper about a possible intervention I was never going to do. However, I am very confused as to why the option was even given. We were very strongly discouraged from taking the final stating that it would be incredibly difficult. We were sent out this study guide with 80 terms and 93 potential essay questions compiled by the TF's, which is another issue in and of itself. There were terms on there that we had never even talked about in class-- or they were one small paragraph in one of the many readings were were assigned. I felt that the sole reason why the study guide was so long was to discourage us from taking the final. If you didn't want us to take the final, why give us the option? In addition, many of the terms were repetitive and many of the essay questions were the same thing written in several different way (i.e. 11, 43, 51, and 63 were very similar questions). When somebody in class asked about whether or not everything on the study guide were things that we had learned, you had to look at the TFs and ask. It seemed very much as if you didn't even look at the quality of the study guide before you sent it out to us. In addition, it was not fair to allow the TFs to help people with their papers but not let us ask questions regarding the exam. I have never in my life been in a class where I am unable to ask the Professor or TFs questions on course content before an exam. People were allowed to send 15 page drafts to their TFs as well as go to special office hours reserved for paper writing. However, I was not allowed to ask a few questions on course content. This was simply unfair.",
    "Lectures were all over the place, and not very formal. The professor frequently went off-track, which I felt was a waste of both students' and the professors' time. The material and expectations for the class were finally made clear after the study guide for the final was created. It would be great if each lecture had more organized take-away points.",
    "The course material was interesting but the written assignments that we had sometimes felt irrelevant to learning the material. The written assignments were more effort and drawn out than they actually needed to be. When I began assignments, I also felt that I initially did not have much direction in doing so. I like the subject matter and I learned a lot from the test. It was frustrating that we were dissuaded from doing a test because it actually allowed me to learn. If there is a test and a paper, that might be better for learning the material and applying it.",
    "The assignments did not contribute to understanding of the subject matter. The class was also overcrowded (which was, of course, not the fault of the instructor), but the reaction to the overcrowding was not adequate. Overall, the class didn't really go into topics with any interesting information, and I'm really disappointed that I was required to take it.",
    "Interesting information presented in the class. Often felt like an introductory undergraduate course though. I was disappointed that we weren't required to apply lecture material to our written assignments. There was little incentive to pay attention in class because of this. While content was important and interesting, there was no real reason to attend since our midterm and final projects were practically unrelated. Sure, there as some overlap, but not to the extent that I would have expected from a graduate level course.",
    "The class was interesting, but the paper assignments were overwhelming.",
    "I think paper were not very useful for me to learn the topic",
    "Strengths: interesting course and materials presented were extremely applicable to daily life. I love Marney she is wonderful and she is extremely clear on the issues she presents to class. Weaknesses: the number of little things we have to do is nerve-wracking. Specifically, I do not think blog quizzes are helpful and neither were the classroom debates. The lectures are interesting enough to attract students to attend. For debates, students mainly just read off their laptop and in my sessions I did not observe much of an interaction. This could vary with TA though.",
    "strengths: good overall blanket of the subject matter weakness: Some of the topics I would have preferred for them to be expanded upon, for example: racial health disparities only focused on blacks and whites. Also, I would have liked to see potential methods of remedying the problems that exist.",
    "I think that it was a bit disorganized. Every week was a new topic and seemed a bit disjointed. Also, the assignments were good but felt that there was little direction on how to do them, although i was familiar with them from undergraduate course work.",
    "I appreciated the overview of the many different social and behavioral influences on health. I liked the health improvement project too.",
    "There was never an incentive to study or pay attention in class. However, I enjoyed the debates - just wished that the articles were more relevant and fair for both teams.",
    "I would not have taken away much from the class if I had not taken the final exam instead of doing the paper. I believe that more needs to be done to review the concepts that are taught in class. However, I enjoyed the professor, my TA, and Friday discussions.",
    "good",
    "This course was great even though as a Sociology person it was mostly review, I loved Marney's approach and all of her timely data and news.",
    "I thought that the course content was interesting. I felt that section was not very productive. The debates were sometimes interesting, but the remaining time felt like kind of a waste. Discussions never went very well.",
    "The learning objectives of the course were not well communicated and the mechanisms were not well built for students to learn. Most of us coming out of the class not feeling that we have learned much. The debates are a great component of the class\/discussion sections and that is a great way to learn.",
    "I also think a majority of the students have some kind of psychology or sociology background already, and that the content explored in this course is superfluous. Further, I did not see a connection between the content presented in the lectures and the midterm exam or the final exam. Neither the midterm - the health improvement project - nor the final paper were particularly rewarding for me due to the requirements of the assignments as well as the very strict rubric, which I felt constricted the flow of my writing. Additionally, this course should be structured differently. A more streamlined approach would have improved the course.",
    "Alright, sometimes a bit disorganized so that it became unclear what the actual take-away from the course is.",
    "Shouldn't be a required course.",
    "The content of the lectures and section were often not related.",
    "lots of material to cover in a semester, very quick paced.",
    "Strength: Marney is very approachable and caring Weakness: the lecture content could be more focused",
    "I wish the course were constructed a bit differently. It would be nice to incorporate some SBS ties to global health concepts (although maybe I'm biased, because this is an interest of mine). It seemed that many of the lectures focused around theories or concepts that are important, but didn't necessarily address solutions to the issues brought up. I don't know if that's something that can be addressed in the course itself, or if this is just the nature of SBS. I like the Facebook component of the class. It allows us to share interesting articles and other sentiments with each other that apply concepts learned in class to the real world. I think the issues with the overflow room were addressed as well as they could have been. Obviously the situation wasn't ideal but the instructors did the best they could to deal with the issue and I think it was handled fairly smoothly.",
    "The strengths are that it's a broad class, discussing broad SBS issues. However, this is also supposed to be a graduate level course, but it failed to match up to most of my undergrad level SBS courses.",
    "I was really disappointed in this course. During the course of the semester, I continually found it hard to pay attention in class even though Marney is a great lecturer. I found the topics to be scattered and the lectures were unengaging, even though they had a lot of potential. What disappointed me the most is that I actually learned the most while studying for the final exam. I strongly wish that more of the theory and background structure had been more emphasized during the lectures, and less with the examples and side notes. Of course some students will call that boring - it's a trade-off. But after sitting through the whole class and feeling like I learned nothing (at least nothing I could apply to classes or situations in the future) at the end, it's worth it. Fundamental Cause Theory is actually pretty cool - why didn't I get that or remember that from the lectures? More emphasis on basic knowledge, less blurring everything up with too many examples. Speaking of the final exam. Was it really necessary to deter people so strongly away from the exam? Many students like myself actually get a lot out of studying for exams. Throughout the semester I was continually told the exam was going to be very difficult and persuaded not to take it. I was going to take it anyway, but the test bank made my decision concrete. Even then, was it really necessary to make the list of questions and terms so excessive? Was it really necessary to alphabetize everything, effectively randomizing it and increasing the time and effort needed to complete it without any benefit whatsoever? I found all of that to be incredibly unnecessary. SUMMARY: more theory in the lectures, less disincentive against final exam option.",
    "Strengths: huge number of topics covered, limited pressure on students Weaknesses: I feel like I didn't learn a huge amount. There were no incentives to actually learn and retain the information since there were no tests.",
    "I feel like this course gave a very surface level overview of the topics related to Social and Behavioral Health. I think if we had had a few smaller assignments over the course of the semester it may have facilitated more engagement of the material.",
    "Strengths - lectures were very informative, current, and interesting. Despite being somewhat unbalanced\/biased, they exposed me to a frame of thinking which I had not been exposed to before, which was very worthwhile. -Assignments were well constructed and accomplished their learning goals. Weaknesses: Despite informative lectures and worthwhile assignments, there was a major disconnect between course materials and assignments. Neither the lectures nor the readings provided me with the \"tools\" or knowledge i needed to do complete papers\/assignments. The syllabus was not set until several weeks into the course. It was too ambitious. Elements of the syllabus were not applied consistently and followed-through with. Examples are blog quizzes - which occurred mostly in the beginning of the semester. The syllabus made mention of having a personal tablet and clicker app for interactive course components which never occurred.",
    "I thought there was some quality, interesting information in this course. I believe the essays were not very important to y learning in the class and believe I could have learned as much or more without spending so many hours on them.",
    "The class covers a lot of interesting material, but there was something lacking in the lectures, although I'm not sure what. It could be improved by maybe more explicitly linking things we learn in class to other topics covered in other public health classes.",
    "The class was more like an interesting lecture series or seminar than anything else. I feel like the main accomplishment of the course was introducing me to the different research of a number of professors. I wish that the lectures were paired with theoretical frameworks and principles of social and behavioral science. Some of the debates seemed a bit out of place. Although the debates themselves sparked good discussion, the articles provided were not always particularly useful. I feel that our section was most effective when it was just discussion based and not constrained by the debate format. Overall, the class was illustrative of the difficulty of behavioral change, but I don't feel that I was introduced to many new principles.",
    "It was okay, but shouldn't be required. I liked learning about the impact of marketing on health",
    "Sometimes difficult to see the connection between lectures and our papers. I felt like our papers\/assignments had nothing to do with the lectures. Also, I understand the TFs take turns creating the discussion section lesson plans but some of them seemed really irrelevant\/pointless.",
    "I was really excited to learn about theories of behavior in class, but I don't really felt like I did that. We went over so many topics and as a result we only were able to get a superficial understanding of many things. There was no real motivation to do the readings because we were never tested on it and they didn't come up in class. At the end of the semester I don't really feel like I learned as much as I should have considering the time I was in class and out of class working on assignments.",
    "strengths: provides rubric of expectations for assignments,course includes training on how to write research\/review papers, Marney is clearly interested in her students, wide range of topics; weaknesses: the course tries to be very comprehensive, but in doing so, the class seems to lack developed, overarching themes; rubrics can be vague (but TA and Mareny will be helpful in clarifying if you ask them)",
    "This class is an insult to the intelligence of the students and Dr. Marney White herself. I cannot believe that this course is what the SBS Department shows it has to offer the student body. In the course, the obvious was stated class after class; structural issues are related to obesity, tobacco advertisements were evil but then banned, etc. A ton of data were presented however, with just numbers given what is the use? A way to improve the course would be to present the topics through the form of case studies. While keeping the same material, show us how the data have been used (unsuccessfully or unsuccessfully) in public health interventions both domestically and abroad. Introduce us to ways to measure behaviors and their barriers and facilitators. It doesn't have to be done in great detail but just enough to get the juices flowing so that if we find it interesting, we can personally look into it further.",
    "I enjoyed having different types of assignments including the media analysis and the debates. The health improvement project was useful and I thought it was a learning experience to go through an intervention for yourself. I liked having the choice of an exam or paper for the midterm and final. Given the over-enrollment of the class, I think that the instructor tried her best to accommodate everyone but it was definitely a distraction in class using the carry-over room when there were technical difficulties.",
    "Strengths - it was interesting debating current topics that are controversial Weakness - There was not enough emphasis on learning the theoretical backgrounds. The health improvement papers did not really teach me anything about how to apply these theories. The class was not structured enough.",
    "This course was engaging - the lectures were interesting providing a foundational understanding of the social and behavioral aspect surrounding public health. The readings were interesting and pop-quizes keep people coming to class.",
    "Too many students in class",
    "Marney was fantastic and engaging and all of the course info was super interesting. I have no weaknesses.",
    "I liked the topics covered in the course, however, I would have preferred if the course covered fewer topics and went more in-depth on each topic.",
    "Strengths: Covers a wide range of topics and introduces the social aspects of health. Weaknesses: Huge overemphasis on behavioral theory. Glosses over ethical issues outside the social ecology paradigm. Assumes the social ecology model, ignoring the political economy model which, in my opinion, explains structural issues better. One note: For LGBT health section, we were given a survey over stigma and the TA asked us how we would feel if we were stigmatized to that extent. It's better to use existing narratives (from cultural groups, blogs, or LGBT right organizations) because people outside a struggle often cannot know just by trying to imagine.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed this course! I thought that a great variety of topics were lectured on and I really enjoyed the guest speakers for the course. Weaknesses: I think the paper writing lecture was unnecessary. I would have rather have had a regular lecture in place of it and had the PowerPoint on paper writing uploaded as a resource. I also think it would be helpful if the readings for the debates were a little more balanced - it often felt like the readings were heavily biased towards one side of the debate.",
    "Strength: - Covered a good mix of topics - Developed communication skills through debates - Options available, whether to write paper or take exam. HIGHLIGHT of this class. Weakness: - Difficult to complete all the readings.",
    "The course covered a lot of the topics in SBS, and the guest lectures fit into the course well. Some of the TAs did not seem knowledgeable about SBS topics, so it might be good choosing someone in the SBS track next time. Some of the questions during discussion about income and race were not presented well. It made me really uncomfortable, and the atmosphere in the discussion was awkward.",
    "Strength: Tell interesting stories. Weakness: They are interning stories, true, but people forget after this.",
    "workload is too much",
    "Strengths - very little workload; the Health Improvement Project was fun and a good way for students to tangibly understand interventions targeting behavior change. Weaknesses - very little workload (to a point where this course was always my last priority); repetition in lectures.",
    "This class was extremely frustrating. Between the endless technological malfunctions, inconsistent grading, scattered lectures, and lack of guidelines, I had little to look forward to in class each week. The lectures were disconnected and we rarely actually got through any of the content scheduled. This was primarily due to Marney's lecture habits, which I will answer more in that question. The content of the lectures was often interesting, but not shared or expressed in any sort of coherent way. The discussion sections were great, outside of the debates. Stricter guidelines and better topics need to be established for the debates. In each of our debates, the individuals simply read off prepared statements for openings and closings, then floundered during the rebuttals. The topics chosen were often fairly one-sided, especially when you consider the papers chosen for us to read and present on. The amount of reading for the class was fairly absurd. It's typically ok to assign a significant amount of reading if any of it is applicable or even mentioned in class, but week after week many research papers were assigned to read without context or conversation in class. The grading of the assignments was extremely frustrating. After the first paper, it seems like a grading policy shifted, and only a certain number of individuals were allowed into the honors grading bracket. This type of grading is ridiculous, especially at a professional school. Grading just to fit a curve is a dated, faulty policy.",
    "Although the course material was interesting, the class could have benefited from being better organized. Also, the over-enrollment of students made lectures extremely packed.",
    "Debates very helpful and informative. Covers a lot of material, option to write papers or take exams is nice, but both options require lots of time invested. Good guest lectures. Overall good class",
    "The course is structured with a number of interesting lectures and really great, relevant discussion sessions. I really enjoyed both of these aspects. However, the final paper was a bit useless. I feel that given more freedom to choose a topic, I would have explored a portion of Social and Behavioral Health that interested me, such as the combined effects of race and low-income on the self-reported health of individuals, as a sort of systematic review - looking at the effect of social programs or interventions on these factors, or any number of important and interesting topics. Instead, I wrote a whole review on physical activity interventions in schools and workplaces, which has been done a hundred times over. The rest of the class was fantastic, but I felt the final paper was an exercise in futility, it was a waste of time for us, and for the TAs to read.",
    "The class was interesting with its pop quizzes and the discussion section have debates among other class components.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the material covered in the course but i felt like there was a LOT of material that was presented in lecture but not assessed or covered in discussion--which resulted in a somewhat overwhelming and unclear takeaway message. I think the course could narrow down what is addressed in the lectures and readings and make the assessments\/assignments align more with the lecture material.",
    "The choice between taking the final exam and the final paper was nice. However, I also believe that I did not get as much out of the course as I could have if I had to take a test and review the material. I think a small quiz\/test in the discussion group (maybe similar to a midterm but worth less) would have made me really study the lectures. The course was organized well and I liked the discussion groups.",
    "In general it was good. It definitely felt like a survey class and as such, it often felt very surface level, which was sometimes frustrating.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I thought the subject matter was interesting the the over arch of the course made sense. Guest speakers fit in seamlessly and Marney's lectures were always engaging and interesting. My only suggestion would be to include a supplemental outline for each lecture ahead of time. I found that my notes were usually all over the place and i feel that i missed key terms and statistics, some that flashed on the slides. When i would go back to go through my notes and match them with the slides it would no longer make sense. I appreciate that this could be my notes - but i feel that I would have been able to take away more information from the class into the future if I had a better overview of the lectures and semester ahead of time. Especially background on the theories of behavior and stuff-the readying was ok for this.",
    "Class was great. The lectures were well prepared and helpful. However, the final paper was overwhelming and can be done independent of the lectures. Basically, weather you attended the class or did not, you will be able to do the final (which was overwhelming) without looking at the lecture.",
    "Although I think very highly of Marney as a professor, I did have some grievances with the course. Strengths included a variety of topics not necessarily covered in my other classes (so that was interesting), creative assignments that I think were useful for a public health student to have, and an interesting approach to the discussion sections (ex. the debates, designing a marketing campaign, etc.). The weaknesses I found were things like: the material was not presented very clearly or in a very organized fashion (as in, I could go through a lecture and not necessarily know what the specific theories were, and looking back at the slides did not always help); there were concepts that were expected in the rubric for the paper assignments that we did not necessarily cover in class (ex. intervention scope, challenges to scaling-up, etc.); and in general, I just felt like the class could be a bit more structured regarding the lecture slides and notes for the class. In terms of improvement, I would suggest that instead of focusing on content topics and trying to weave the concepts and theories of behavior change into the topics (which got confusing), focus on the concepts\/theories of behavior change and bring in various topics as examples for emphasis (ex. instead of focusing on obesity and working in topics of stigma, socioecological approaches to behavior change, and other concepts into that lecture, create a lecture about the socioecological approach and use obesity and perhaps another topic like smoking as examples of how that approach might be applied, etc. Please make sure it is clearly stated somewhere that the socioecological approach is a theory of behavior change, etc.). Also, when preparing lecture slides, please keep in mind that some students are coming in with very little background, so I would suggest keeping the slides simplified and organized. Please use text to explain your figures just a little bit, otherwise it makes it hard to go back and review what that picture for the slides. I would suggest even maybe using the first 2-3 lectures to just layout and establish what the theories and concepts of social and behavioral change are without going into too much detail regarding other topics (maybe briefly mention a related public health issue, but focus mostly on the concept itself). Then once the foundation is clearly laid out, use the remaining lectures to speak on content areas like obesity, social marketing, violence, etc. Otherwise, the material just seems to scattered. Additionally, for the health improvement project, I liked that Marney gave us a structured way of choosing a topic through the online quizzes, but I would not recommend restricting our choices to the top three. I would say let people choose one of any of the recommendations because that gives the student more of an interest in doing the project and carrying it over into the final paper.",
    "The strength of the course is its broad introductory lectures about major themes of SBS in relation to public health. I enjoyed most of the guest lecturers (particularly the lecture on violence). Sometimes I wish that the themes of the course were woven a bit more closely together. All the topics were connected, but I wish that they were built off of each other more to feel more cohesive, rather than how I feel like they were mostly all tied back to the main theme of behavior change in health. I particularly liked the health improvement project as an exercise in attempting our own behavior change. I think that the intervention period should be lengthened though to present more of a challenge of implementing the behaviors. Also, while the lecture on paper writing may have been useful, I feel like that could be gone over by the TFs in section, and that a full lecture period could be devoted to a topic more related to the course. One last suggestion would be to slightly revamp the readings for the course. For the debates, the articles assigned were often numerous and not super on point for what the debates ended up focusing on. This was sometimes a hinderance as an audience member in following what the debaters focused on. Additionally, some articles for class seemed to vary in relevance and some were repetitive to each other.",
    "This course essentially provided an review of my psychology B.A. I do not feel that it adequately addresses the social and behavioral foundations of public health. It felt like a psychology course rather than a public health course. The two primary assignments for the course were based on the idea of behavior change based on personal changes. I do not feel that they helped me learn about behavioral changes in health. I think that it would be helpful to utilize case studies within public health (HIV transmission, obesity, teen pregnancy, diabetes, etc.) and identify strategies for behavioral change.",
    "This class had the potential to really show students various social and behavioral factors that influence health. However, I felt as though Marney was so focused on ensuring this wasn't a \"fluff\" class that she missed the target. Her lectures were disorganized and rushed. She frequently used examples\/studies that I felt were not compelling or relevant. For example, our mental health lecture had the potential to really delve into mental health stigma. But instead she chose to speak about humor and studies on nuns' journals. I appreciated the purpose of the media analysis paper and health improvement project. However, I felt as though continuing the HIP would not really increase my understanding of SBS, so I chose to take the exam. In my eyes, I would learn more by taking the exam. Marney seemed to really resent people for choosing to take the exam. It came across as if she was punishing us for choosing the exam over her precious HIP - she refused to answer any questions about the material and clearly chose the worst questions from the study guide. The study guide also didn't seem to reflect the material from lectures. I think that Marney needs to edit her lectures to really focus on her main points, as they were not clear during class.",
    "This class lacked direction and focus. It was poorly organized",
    "Strengths: Lectures were well structured and moved at a decent pace. Instructor and TAs were knowledgeable. Assignments were manageable and debates were interesting. Weaknesses: Reading load was excessive, and often not discussed in lecture. Guest lectures were of widely-varying quality, and the lecture on socioeconomic disparities and health was among the worst I have ever attended. (Speaker was incoherent, rambling, and presented nothing resembling new material). The \"overflow room\" situation was also, frankly, unacceptable. Every week there were new technological difficulties, and I was -- and remain -- unwilling to leave 30 minutes early to secure a seat in a class I am required to take. There were strong points to this class, but they fell short of compensating for the aforementioned flaws.",
    "The subject matter for this course is usually very interesting, and I like that there are some overlapping content with my Psychology course from college. However, I am not a fan of Marney's teaching. She likes to go off topic and bring up personal anecdotes that I don't care to know about. I like the guest lecturers that she brings. Furthermore, this class DOES NOT require discussion sections, which are a complete waste of time.",
    "Strengths: I loved the topics and the abundance of guest speakers made things interesting. Weaknesses: I didn't like that we spent the same number of hours in lecture as we did in discussion sections. I was frustrated that it seemed as though throughout the course we were encouraged not to take the final\/midterm exams and then at the end of the semester that inexplicably switched and we were encouraged to take the exam instead. I didn't like that the discussion sections were unrelated to the readings. The debates were unfair: the number of readings were different for each debate and the grading seemed subjective. The grading didn't seem uniform between TF's. I think its unacceptable to not have enough seats for the number of students enrolled, but I'm not sure who is at fault for that. I also think that mid-course evaluations would have been a helpful tool.",
    "There is a severe disconnect between the lecture and the discussion sections. There is a lack of cohesiveness and a lot of times, I felt like I was attending two different classes.",
    "This course was required, however I felt as though it was a waste of time. Discussion sections were boring and not helpful. Lecture was interesting some of the time, but very broad with little depth.",
    "Overall, I didn't gain much from this class. The course could have been taught in a better format- for instance as a seminar, smaller class size. Hopefully, another core requirement for SBS can be added... it is unfair to have to take a course where you do not learn much from.",
    "Marnie is a great teacher but I don't think her style works well in large lectures. She is very enthusiastic and entertaining, and certainly very knowledgeable, but the course was not structured well. The anecdotal information I learned about health disparities could easily have been learned by reading the newspaper. Too many guest speakers. More emphasis should be placed on theories during the first half of the semester and then applying the theories later on. The lack of information being taught leads students to choose to do the personal improvement project and final paper - when neither assignment taught me anything relevant to my studies. Beyond the instructor, the fact that administration allowed a required class to be overbooked at an institution of this reputation is criminal. Crowding into a lecture hall or being forced to watch class being streamed in a different room makes no sense and is an insult to every student.",
    "As an SBS student, I was quite disappointed with this course to say the least. This class was merely composed of fun facts and it became very hard for me to take this course seriously. For a class that was only held once a week, the discussion section took a way time that could have been used to discuss social and behavioral factors that affect public health programs. The health improvement and final paper project were not necessary to complete because as a whole I do not feel that I have a solid foundation of social and behavioral determinants of health especially in regards to the models. It would have been more helpful to discuss models or factors that influence public health programs and during discussion section formulate ways in which we ourselves would try to solve this or what programs we would plan. While the readings were fascinating, it was evident that we did not need to read these to contribute to the class. A better use of discussion section should be implemented in the future so that we may learn to think critically of why public health efforts have failed and what we would do to solve that.",
    "It was strong in providing interesting and relevant material on social health behavior, using the media and current events. However I feel like the assignments could have been made more interesting, like the discussion section marketing campaign exercise.",
    "Very good overview of the topic. Great speakers. The discussion sections were fun.",
    "I was frustrated that I was required to take this course. Attendance in class was not required aside from blog quizzes. The assignments, which were only two papers and attendance in section, did not relate to what we learned in class at all. The course could have been improved if we had weekly responses to the reading or lecture that should be graded on a 3-point basis; at least then we could have engaged with the material a bit more. I didn't feel that my TA was really able to add to my experience in the class, either.",
    "I think that the course has a lot to teach but that it should be made more clear what the agenda for the course is.",
    "Good - some of the projects were a bit redundant.",
    "The biggest problem with this course, in my mind, was that the expectations were not in line with the course material taught. The lectures were extremely basic, as were the topics in discussion section. Yet my assignments were continually panned for being insufficiently \"critical.\" I'm more than okay with being pushed to do more sophisticated work, but I want to be taught sophisticated material in return.",
    "I have to say that the teacher and TAs have done a wonderful job anyway. However, I still don't see the point of this course.",
    "Marney was extremely engaging, and the topics that were covered in this course were interesting and relevant to all MPH students.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, but didn't always correspond with the graded material. The discussion sections could be shortened in length.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. At first it seemed very scattered because of the difficulties with the course size and the classroom, but as the semester went on I enjoyed the course more and more. I had taken psychology classes in undergrad even though I was a biology major and I really enjoyed learning about some of the psychological and social foundations that have such an important underlying role in public health. While I enjoyed the lectures and the material, I often didn't do all of the readings because they were so long. As for the design of the course, I liked that some lectures were guest speakers because it brought a new perspective. I felt that section was good for discussion with some topics but sometimes I didn't feel that I got that much out of it. I thought that the debates were difficult because they were in many cases very one-sided and the research evidence favored one side more than the other. Some of them, such as the reproductive health one, would have been better suited as a discussion in my opinion.",
    "I think a lot of the information we cover is incredibly important, but it's very difficult to make it cohesive when we are speeding through a broad topic a week. Sometimes the topics were well-aligned with the debate or section discussion that week but sometimes they were not. There was also not a lot of incentive to pay attention during the lecture because of this lack of continuity and because we were never really evaluated for our knowledge of the lecture topics."

Every instructor had his\/her own teaching style that some of them kept us interested in the contents but some of them just kept reading the slides. Overall, I think people would only remember those contents that we were awake during the class session.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White is really a humorous professor. She is awesome!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was great, although I could often sense some stress, likely related to the fact that there seemed to be almost constant problems with the AV system and the overflow room. Again, I think that smaller class sizes are crucial for this course.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is a great lecturer - she is good at keeping students engaged and presenting the material in a way that is concise and clear. She used interactive exercises over the course of the semester, which were very effective. She is clearly very knowledgeable and excited about teaching, which made for a productive and comfortable class environment.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great professor! No weaknesses in my opinion.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a good lecturer - she does a good job of captivating a large audience. However, towards the end of the course, many students became frustrated with Marney and the way she approached the question of whether students were going to write a final paper or take a final exam. For students who chose THE OPTION of taking the final exam, Marney made it extremely difficult to ask questions and would not allow a discussion (while the students who wrote papers had a whole class dedicated to receiving help and were allowed to email TAs for input). Furthermore, it seemed like Marney's attitude toward students choosing to take the exam was \"you're screwed\". It was unprofessional, and I know many students were in the same boat of thinking \"why would you give this as AN OPTION if you do not want us to take it?\" Although I had enjoyed Marney's lectures throughout the course, this attitude was very offputting, and honestly, made finals week even more stressful.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The hardest part of this class in dealing with all the frustrations it brought about, is that Marney is so likable and a really bright and engaging speaker. Her quirky humor kept things interesting and entertaining, so that was a definite plus. However, I am one to believe that professors should teach their classes. The guest speakers were interesting and this is a course that has a lot of different perspectives, but not all of them were needed. I think her triple appointment at the university is a bit much for one person to handle, and it became pretty clear that the TAs were really running the show (with her guidance) in terms of what what we were learning and the assignments. I do not want to place all the blame on Marney because the class was so large and she had a very difficult scenario in front of her, but this just did not work for me. Maybe there is too much content being covered or there are better ways to focus down on the key pieces of each one. The lectures were so broad that a lot of things were barely touched upon.",

I feel as though she genuinely cares about her students, their success, and their health and well-being. Coming from a larger institution last year, it was so refreshing to have been able to have a class with her that--despite its size--felt small and personal. Marney's enthusiasm makes each lecture interesting, but sometimes I think in her excitement she forgets to provide context for the issues she's discussing. Overall I am so thankful to have been able to take a class with her!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She was fun and I like her on a personal level, but the topic of the course was not interesting to me. She wasted a lot of time in lecture and I found the discussion sections was where I learned more. Preparing for them at least.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Qualified and amusing. Makes the course interesting.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I had no qualms with Marney until she gave students the option of taking the final or writing the paper. Having several papers due in other classes, I elected to take the final. Yet, Marney was borderline hostile to students who declined to write the paper. She would not offer help (nor would the TAs) and was very glib in class about her expectations of the final. If you are going to be mean about it, don't make taking the final an option! We should not get different treatment from the teacher for electing an option that she provided. Also, she was far less severe to student's writing the paper and was much more lenient on previously strict criteria that she'd laid out for the paper (ie: topic must be related to your PHIP). If I'd known I could write the final paper about whatever I wanted, I may have chosen otherwise. In summary, stick to your guns about what it is you are assigning. And don't punish students for utilizing both of the options provided.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strengths: -engaging lecturer -funny -knowledgeable Weaknesses: -didn't consistently make lecture slides available ahead of class -gave a noticeable negative \"vibe\" to students choosing to take midterm\/final; if exams continue to be an option, they should be a viable option and students should not be made to feel bad\/inferior\/outcast for choosing the option",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great public speaker and very very smart. She is extremely approachable. However, the construction of content for the class was very scatter brained. It was difficult as a student to know what I was supposed to learn from the readings and the lectures. I never felt that I could adequately prepare for class due to this factor.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is fun to listen to and captivating, but you can tell this isn't her first priority.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Like her, not the course.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I was skeptical at first but Marney won me over. Knowledgeable, funny, and enjoyable professor! She's absolutely the best choice for teaching this course.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is great. She keeps the class engaged and paying attention. Marney also knows a lot about the subjects that she teaches and I like that she adds in her own personal experiences to make the class more interesting. It helped me to remember the lecture material better.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is amazing. I like her as a professor and I hope to have her in more courses.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is disorganized, and while like her as a person and she is really nice, I will do everything I can to never take another class with her again. She is fun and being her class means we know intimate details about her life and her family so I feel bad saying that she needs to improve. However, her class is not cohesive, and she could not seem to effectively fit her entire lectures into one class time. She had so much information on every slide that unless you brought your laptop to class you couldn't read them.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Knowledgeable, friendly, approachable, and accessible. She really cares about her students!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0A passionate and engaging lecturer with a great sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a great instructor: attentive, entertaining, and very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I liked how you allowed different experts to speak on certain topics (with the exception of Dayna Keene- she was bad!) I think you should take time to really go over the theories because they are incredibly interesting. You pretty much blew through them. There also were not very many readings specifically about the theories (i.e. SCT, SEM, etc.). I think it was a poor choice to allow the TF's to pick out the articles for the debates. They were often very one sided articles, and in the case of the HPV debate, they were just bad. They were not good for the pro team or the con team. The paper about mercury was irrelevant as mercury isn't in the HPV vaccine. There was a paper that was published after the Wakefield article was retracted citing the Wakefield article. I understand what the TF who chose the papers was trying to do, but giving us shitty papers not grounded in science\/fact only inhibits are learning & perpetuates the ideas put forth by the media. There are many papers about the cons associated with mandating the HPV vaccine for all school aged boys and girls that would have been better, which include Linda Niccolai's published in 2013 and Kahn et al 2012 (Pediatrics 130: e249-e258). There were also many papers discussing the cost effectiveness of the vaccine that could have been used. It was not ok to force us to use these terrible papers in our debates & I say forced because one of the criteria on the grading rubric was to use the articles provided by the TF's in the debate. It would be more effective to let us find our own papers and grade us on that because we did a much better job of finding quality papers than the TF. I think the question for the HPV debate was best designed meaning there was a body of quality literature that could support either side (although we were not provided with this quality literature). The other questions were very one sided and most quality literature only supported one side. A debate may not be the best format and perhaps a discussion would be better.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great at responding to student concerns. Could improve lectures by focusing on the material more.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0As a person, Marney is great. She's pretty engaging and entertaining. However, sometimes she rambles and goes off on tangents. At first its fun, but occasionally I get lost in understanding whether or not she's being serious.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Had passion for some of the topics, but had a distracting focus sometimes on personal matters. Did not make efficient use of lecture time",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was friendly, likable. Although I never felt that she was a professor I could reach because of how busy she always presented herself. I would reach out to my TF a lot and felt that I stressed her out because of it. Marney's method of \"facetime\" chats was a turn off.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Interesting.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a wonderful professor. She is humorous, confident, thoughtful, and knowledgeable. Her teaching skills are very good and I was able to learn a lot from her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is great.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is an awesome and lively person. Just felt that sometimes she was frazzled and all over the place in class.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0This professor was a great presenter, funny, and provided good information. She was available to students for any questions outside of class and was helpful when she could be.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a great professor who is passionate about her work and her students!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0very good",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Knows her stuff Answers all questions Personable Honest Humorous Brilliant!!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I thought that Marney was a good lecturer. I don't agree with having the TA's grading on a rubric like we are in middle school.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Although she is very caring of her students, she needs to be more critical and demanding. Yale students like to be challenged, but this is not how they feel in taking this class.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very diligent in responding to student concerns and questions Interesting lecture combinations.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is great!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney White is EXCELLENT! She knows a lot, explains lecture material very well, is funny and responsive to student questions\/concerns, and makes time for us despite her busy schedule. I have no complaints about Dr. White; she's fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is an exuberant lecturer and very knowledgeable about her speciality. Her mental health lecture was informative and interesting. However, her other lectures failed to rouse interest or teach anything beyond what I had already known.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I really liked Marney's personality, and the informal lecture style was funny and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is extremely engaging, witty, and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed her.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a great instructor and I enjoyed most of our lectures. However, I don't feel like I got very much out of the class.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is very knowledgeable and engaging in the class. She gave us very informative lectures.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a great lecturer, and attending lecture was always enjoyable. She does seem disorganized, as evidenced by the constant changes in the syllabus until several weeks into the semester. Also, her approach to the two major assignments in the class was not always fair. Do not offer a midterm or final exam if those who write the papers are going to be treated preferentially.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The instructor was delightful to listen to, enriched the material greatly.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is an intelligent, informative woman, although sometimes I felt that she was a little too playful to convey much more serious topics.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The instructor was a very engaging, dynamic lecturer. Although I appreciated the guest lectures, I think the class could be more effective if the instructor gave more of the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She was funny and taught an interesting class but went on a lot of tangents and made the class overly demanding",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great! Very engaging and fun. Easy to pay attention to.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is very engaging and I felt like she had so much more to offer to the class in terms of knowledge than what we were able to get. Also, we had a lot of guest instructors so I feel like I didn't actually see her that much.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney really looks after her students and takes the teaching part of her life quite seriously! Lectures are easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0informative, humorous thoughtful for students",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I'm convinced that Marney is a borderline genius. In person she is engaging, insightful, and kind and this course with its blanket coverage of what could be truly interesting material is a disservice to her and her teaching abilities. She is capable of so much more and it is disappointing to see her confined to such a course. I was disappointed that I was unable to get a spot in the lunch sessions she had which is a testament to her approachability. I hope that I have her in another course during my time at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney kept classes interesting and because her background is diverse, she had a unique perspective on different topics. I feel that her lectures could be a bit more concise and she should focus on a few major points for each class because at times it seemed a bit disorganized and I wasn't always sure what the take home message was.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Prof. White is engaging and personable. She's funny and thoughtful. She is what makes coming to class worth it.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Handled the mass of students great!",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very accessible and easy to talk to.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White was fantastic! I really enjoyed the energy that she brought to the class. I thought she handled the many challenges this semester (over enrollment in the class, spill over room, and technology issues related to needing to broadcast to the spillover room) very well.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strength: - Very responsive. - Shares information in class and announcements. - Flexible.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The instructor accommodated the overflow well, and took students' opinions into consideration. I enjoyed the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Intersting Teacher but it would be a better course if we learn some practical cases.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is a great instructor. She is funny, but never loses the important concepts and social\/behavioral health issues that students need to take away from the course. I mentioned \"repetition in lectures\" as a weakness for this course, but at the same time I realize that there is only so much one can teach about the importance of framing health issues in social and behavioral context. Furthermore, because many public health issues have the same social\/behavioral factors (i.e., SES, culture), it is hard to make the lectures new every week.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The lectures were excellent. I really appreciated her sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was a perfectly nice person to have a conversation with, provided she considered you a person worth taking up her precious time. In the lecture setting, Marney was extremely ineffective, often diverging from the planned lecture to wax about her child or personal history. Given, I do appreciate small mental breaks to relax during a lecture, but the frequency with which these occurred was distracting and frustrating, especially when we rarely would make it through a given lecture's content to begin with. Needless to say, I felt that a significant amount of my time in this class was wasted.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is a passionate professor, and cares about her students. I appreciate certain aspects of the course such as the blog quizzes, and option for lunches with Dr. White. Unfortunately, our lectures often felt extremely disorganized.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very engaging lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a fantastic instructor. She makes all of her classes highly accessible and is really engaging. I would take another class with her if I could.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is such a great lecturer! She's quirky but the material she covers is interesting and she answers lecture questions well. She's quite engaging too.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney has a lot over energy and passion for the material she covers in lecture. She is also very accessible to students and supportive of student ideas! It might be beneficial for her to think about streamlining her lectures and materials for next year---in order to cover a little less material but cover it more thoroughly (so that students come away with a better grasp of basic theory--but not just psychology behavioral change concepts...).",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White was interesting and engaging. She really responded to feedback and paid attention to our opinions and thoughts. She was a little hard to follow sometimes in class, as it can be difficult to tease out what the main point is.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Fun, engaging lecturer",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a wonderful professor, the best I have had at the institution and one of the best compared to my undergrad experience. I felt that she was very considerate of our perspective in the class and always very engaging. The surveys to link the class topic to things we were doing or our lives was very cool and helpful. I felt the same way about the assignments. I did not feel like i was doing them to just get done, they really added to my experience in the class and helped me to better understand the topics. The debates in particular were helpful for going through the readings and understanding the sides.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great instructor, I would love to take another class with her only if she change the way she gives the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a thoughtful and fun instructor. Strengths include being approachable, making time for students outside of class through organized lunches, etc., and inviting interesting speakers for some of the lectures (the violence lecture especially). Weaknesses include sometimes being disorganized in terms of presenting the information (not always very straightforward in terms of what she wanted us to get from the lecture, etc.), and I would say that she did not always streamline the material, whether it was providing too many papers to read for a given subject or being a bit too broad in all the information she tried to cover in a given lecture. I recommend trying to teach the theories and concepts we're expected to know more upfront and then going into the content areas more in detail.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was an engaging and understanding lecturer. Given all the technological\/class size issues we had this semester, I think she did a great job being patient and asking for student feedback about what worked best.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is very likable and personable. She was certainly one of my favorite professors this semester. The course was poorly structured, but she made class enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney clearly means well and wants SBS to be taken seriously. However, piling more onto our workload does not improve the quality of a class if the work is not directly relevant to what we're learning. The HIP meant well by trying to introduce us to the difficulties associated with making healthy changes to our lifestyles. However, that point was made very clear without having to extend the project into a 15 page paper. The paper did not adequately assess our knowledge of SBS, while the exam (in theory) should have. Marney seemed to resent us for choosing to take the exam, which was supposed to be a comprehensive assessment of what we've learned. Forbidding exam-takers to ask questions of Marney or TFs was cruel and came across as a form of hazing.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Fine. Approachable and pleasant, knowledgeable about the subject. The persistent technical difficulties were a major failing to this course, however, and we often felt that class time was not being used effectively.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0As mentioned in my response to the previous question, I do not like Marney's style of teaching. I know more about her personal life than I care to know, and I think her continued insertion of personal anecdotes in lectures is unprofessional. Marney is, however, very approachable and understanding of student concerns.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I loved how responsive Marney was to her students. She constantly surveyed the group, which made me feel heard. I was grateful for her lunches with students. She is great and determining when the class needed a break. The lectures were interesting and she is a great speaker, but the lectures themselves were not particularly cohesive nor did they follow a clear flow.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney tries her best with the course but there are many challenges to run a large course like this one.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great professor. Marney is extremely engaging during lectures, and always made the topic very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is very personable, but her sarcasm was at times grating.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very energetic and enthusiastic - almost to a fault. Needs to have a coherent and cohesive theme in class to be more effective. Shows up to class unprepared - without slides or leans too heavily on guest speakers. Changing themes every week doesn't work. Having ten readings for section is not effective either and further enforces students ignoring all readings all together when they have no relevance to the class being taught.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0While Marney is a great professor and is always eager to hear how she can improve the course, she is not the right professor for this course. She has too many appointments and do not believe she has adequate time to teach this course effectively. This is a disservice to her skills. I enjoyed talking to her during our lunches but feel this course will be better served by being taught by a different professor.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the course material. However I feel like the presentation of the course material on the slides could be made a little more clear. And less tangents could have kept attention of the class more.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White was a great instructor. My only criticism is that the lectures were sometimes a little difficult to follow along with.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She tends to be self-deprecating in class; this might be acceptable in a one-to-one personal setting, but it makes her appear ditzy in front of a lecture of 100+ people. I would have taken the professor and the course more seriously if she conducted it in a more professional manner. Otherwise, though, I much enjoyed the course material and the way she chose to structure the material. I did not like the fact that there was an overflow classroom; it led to so many technological errors that greatly detracted from the learning experience. I really disliked the class when the professor told us how to write a paper; this should have been an optional seminar outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very enthusiastic and accommodating!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very good - obviously tried her best",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is adorable.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I loved her personality.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The lectures were very interesting, but didn't always correspond with the graded material. The discussion sections could be shortened in length.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I really enjoyed Marney's teaching. Sometimes the lectures were a little scattered but I felt that I was very engaged in class and absorbing a lot of information because Marney keeps your attention. I liked her sense of humor and her ability to relate what we were learning about to current issues or relevant things from the past that people were familiar with (such as applying principles or theories to things that we see such as advertising).",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a very fun, dynamic, and caring instructor. The lectures were sometimes sidetracked by too many anecdotes, but a lot of other people seemed to like these. Although expectations were mostly clear, we never really had any idea what the ultimate grades would be and some of the cutoffs seemed arbitrary. For example, it didn't really make sense that someone putting a lot of effort into a debate could get the same HP as someone putting only 50% effort (the HP range was something like 4\/10-8\/10).",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0no changes needed. great teaching and knowledge of course materials.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very interesting course and Marney is good at getting students' attention. But wish the content could be more focused.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Funny, energetic, articulate."

    "The subjects are all over the place, it gives a good broad outline of social and behavioral health issues. I enjoyed the debates, they were a great exercise in public speaking and encouraged us to look at all sides of arguments related to public health. This goes for the media analysis as well. Wish there was more transparency in grading and less \"you have a choice, but the final exam is going to be very hard.\"",
    "I will not recommend it to another students and I don't think this class should be a requirement for students that are not in social and behavioral health track.",
    "If you can exempt out of this course -- DO IT! It's absolutely awful. Worst class I've ever taken.",
    "SBS is a core requirement course for the MPH degree, which we don't have a choice not to take it even if we are not interested in SBS. A broad background understanding of SBS especially for the first years to explore their specific interests in public health is helpful, that they can have further in depth study in certain topics by taking other courses during their MPH degree.",
    "It's a requirement, wouldn't take it otherwise.",
    "I didn't recommend this class but it is a required. I didn't learn a lot from this course. Each class is like a seminar.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend this course for anyone who has taken a PSYC class before, as it is just a review of material. I would recommend this course for someone who knows nothing about social\/behavioral interaction.",
    "Since the course is required, I would recommend taking it in your first semester so it lessens the overall class load in total. If you can just sit through the classes and write the papers, just get it over with. Hopefully this semester was just an anomaly, but without some serious revision to the course I don't see much changing. It was a frustrating experience overall.",
    "required course you just have to get through; won't ruin your semester but isn't particularly enjoyable either",
    "I definitely would not take this class. It is largely a waste of time; the main takeaways are presented in the initial class, and the rest is just excess. You will walk away wondering what you really got out of each lecture. A big disappointment.",
    "This is a required class, so I would recommend it, however I think that I would recommend it to students whose main interests are discussed in the course.",
    "I think I would recommend this course to others if they want broad knowledge of public health issues and want to enhance their debate skills. But I found the workload was more than I wanted for what I actually got out of it.",
    "It's required but if you can get out of it - I would try to. Didn't learn much and there are a lot of required assignments.",
    "awesome class. A requirement for many, but worth taking even if not required",
    "Interesting and valuable course.",
    "Pretty underwhelming, honestly. Class topics were all over the place with no cohesive summary of content. I would have gotten nothing out of the course if I didn't take the final. So while my grade might suffer some as a result, I'm walking away with a better understanding of SBS than I would have if I wrote the paper.",
    "Not applicable - I qualified out of the course",
    "Interesting course at first. They should change the format. Be more organized. Teach Section 1: behavioral theory, then examples. Section 2: Womens health Section 3: LGBT health, Section 4: Mental Health. This would make way more sense.",
    "This is a required class with a lot of reading you probably won't get to, but you'll still enjoy the class, learn a lot, and walk away with a greater appreciation for SBS.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because it lacks depth and cohesion.",
    "In summary I would say that this course is a over view of many large Public Health topics from a social behavioral view point. I thought the course was great. It was my favorite class this semester. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend it. I would only say to start the final paper in advance so that it will not overwhelm you.",
    "The topics are very thought provoking and the assignments are good reads. The final paper was a bit of a challenge - but some of the class opted to take a final exam. It's nice to have a choice.",
    "Great course, especially discussions. I would recommend it, as SBS really is foundational and the material and instructor are both amazing.",
    "I thought this was a very poorly run course which was sad because the content was interesting.",
    "Course brings up a lot of interesting concepts; do not expect it to be well-organized.",
    "Overall, it is an interesting class. Material is pretty intuitive so Marney tries to make the class harder than it needs to be, which is my biggest complaint.",
    "You have to take it, it's not a bad course. But don't blow it off because it is important information",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if he\/she is interested in social behavior science.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "It was alright. not sure i would recommend it though. best part was having the option to take the final instead of write the paper bc i think i realized what i learned from the class then. even though the study guide was a bit excessive.",
    "No, I wish there was a more effective way to teach this class. Personally, I gained the most out of TA sections.",
    "I would recommend it to a student if they had not taken a similar course. However, if they have, I would place out of it and take something else.",
    "very good",
    "If you've taken Soc. courses and health psychology or behavioral psych you can probably skip it but it can be a lot of fun! If you're between it and a specific elective that you only have one shot at, probably opt for the elective if you can, though.",
    "Great course to take.",
    "The subject of topic is definitely of importance to the field of public health. However, with the way the course is designed, it is not a recommendable course.",
    "It is currently a required course.",
    "It would be nice to give students another option to fulfill the SBS requirement.",
    "I would recommend the class--we learned a lot of useful skills like writing a research paper (intervention) and the health improvement project was extremely helpful as well.",
    "Overall, I did enjoy the topics covered in this course and would recommend it to other students (it's also a required core class so most likely, students will have to take it).",
    "As a person with a background in the social sciences, I found the lectures uninformative. The only reason I attended them were because of the pop quizzes she gave during lectures and the lecturer's jokes. Beyond that, the discussion sections were used to delve deeper into themes from lectures, but this resulted in numerous readings and assignments being due for them. This contrasted starkly to what was presented in class because it felt like the instructor did not invest much time into her lectures and materials (she skipped through most of her slides), and just assigned work for students to complete on their own. The debate topics were also asymmetrical, most times clearly being unfair for the con or pro side. Grading was also a point of contention as students found them to differ between TFs, criteria to be vague, and subtlety in writing was punished as being \"unclear\". Overall, her lectures outlined a lax class structure, but her grading was not, which in an effort to strictly define a vague course, her grading system only awarded points for the explicit or obvious, and any other complexity by which she (or her TFs) could not categorize, she marked down.",
    "As the course is now, I would not recommend taking it if it weren't required. If the course were restructured to incorporate more theory and overarching ideas between lectures, I would rate it more highly.",
    "I enjoyed the class, although I didn't learn very much. I felt like health statistics were thrown at us, and the theories that we needed to know for our papers (Health Belief, Transtheoretical, et.) were not discussed in detail.",
    "I believe the material was good, class discussion and debates were interesting and educational, the essays detracted from time that could have been better spent engaging with the material of the course,",
    "I would recommend this class if it were taught differently; I think it is important for every public health student to learn the importance of the structural context in influencing public health and consumer decisions.",
    "The course is like a lecture series or seminars describing the research areas of different professors who are involved in the social and behavioral sciences. It is an incredibly low workload.",
    "It was an insightful course teaching is about how behavior and societal factors Impact health. I would recommend this course if someone did not have this background but to force students with undergrad public health majors to take this class (all the material was completely repetitive for me) is completely and a waste of tuition",
    "Required course. Marney makes it as fun as it could be. The writing assignments are pretty intensive and tough though.",
    "It was ok. I wish that it had more substance because I think social and behavioral sciences are a very important element of public health.",
    "If could can opt out of this course, absolutely do it and take a course that will give you tangible skills.",
    "I would not recommend this course. At the end of the day I don't think I learned any skills that would help me in my future career.",
    "It's an easy and enjoyable requirement - take it. Work is concentrated to the two in-section debates, midterm intervention, and final research paper.",
    "It's required. Health disparities by race lecture should be a lot stronger and more sentimental. Race theory? Really? Police brutality\/violence should have also been included in a lecture. Nothing like current events!!",
    "You go to a whole bunch of cool lectures on other reasons why people are sick= not just because they choose to. Marney is super fun and you have a few quizzes in class. Its a pretty chill class that you will learn a lot in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - the professor is great and you cover a broad range of material.",
    "I would student to audit this. It is not necessary to spend 1 credit on this.",
    "it is a required course",
    "I would not recommend this course at all to another student. Unfortunately, it is a required course, so there aren't many options. Frankly, if a class like this is going to be required, there need to be multiple sections or a proper setting. It is absurd that some individuals weren't allowed to be in the same classroom, due to size constraints. Also, the technological malfunctions that were ceaseless week in and week out were extremely frustrating to witness. The content was typically interesting when it was presented, which made the entire class that much more frustrating, knowing how much I could be engaging with the information if it was presented in a coherent manner.",
    "The course covers some interesting material that all YSPH students would benefit from learning, but the class is a bit disorganized.",
    "I would recommend it for debate skills and breadth of topics.",
    "The course will teach you the introduction to Social and Behavioral sciences as a foundation for health. I learned a lot through the course, and had many interesting discussions. The discussion section itself also opens your eyes to many different issues, and allows you to explore public health issues from a view contrary to your own through debate. I would highly recommend taking it for these reasons and because it is required to graduate.",
    "It's a good class to have. Hope that you get a good TF who doesn't nitpick you for every little thing.",
    "The course is interesting and really shows you how interdisciplinary public health truly is. You will learn to see different perspectives and the challenges associated with recommending lifestyle changes. The course load is average, so I would recommend this course.",
    "A good, if surface level introduction to the subject.",
    "Great course, good prof and Ta good assignments. More time could be spent on the background of behavioral theory that guides the rest of the course as each marginalized group is examined.",
    "Overall, this course was fine. Given that it is required, I would encourage other students to simply engage with the material content and try to make the most out of their experience. There were topics covered in this class that were not covered in my other classes, and it was a challenging and thought-provoking experience to engage with some of those issues, such as assisted suicide or birth-control coverage. I would encourage incoming students to also get to know Marney, as she is an excellent resource and professor to talk to throughout the semester!",
    "I would recommend it for those interested in a course that presents the overview of major topics relating to health behavior change.",
    "This course is a great foundational psychology course. It is great for students interested in psychology and public health, but I do not feel that it adequately addressed behavioral foundations of health behaviors.",
    "I would not recommend this course, but it's unfortunately required so students do not have a choice. It is disorganized and the instructor uses weak material to supplement her very vague key points. It has the potential to be a really interesting course, but unfortunately it fell short.",
    "Useful perspectives on familiar topics, but not the best use of time and occasionally maddeningly inefficient. Worth taking but also worth a comprehensive overhaul.",
    "If this course was not required, I would not have taken it. I already learned most of the material of the Intro Psychology course I took in college. The teaching is subpar, and the discussion sections are a waste of time. Waive out of this course if you can.",
    "This course isn't a good representation of all of the things Social & Behavioral Sciences encompasses. It is a mandatory course, but my advice is to find something in the breadth of topics that you find interesting, and try to focus your writing pieces to that topic. Otherwise you learn a tiny bit about a million different things, without a real mastery of any of them.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The registrar should have kept the class smaller, giving second year students the priority to take the course. The class seemed chaotic at times and was disruptive to learning. There needs to be more connection between the lecture and discussion sections.",
    "This class is unfortunately required. Make the best of it.",
    "Not worth taking if it is still being taught in this same format. But then, it's a core requirement.",
    "This course initially suffered from administrative ineptitude and and aggravated by poorly chosen primary instructor. I did not learn anything remotely helpful to my studies or at all worth the cost of this course.",
    "I disliked this course immensely!! I would not recommend this course as it did not teach me anything new at all. The Health improvement project only affirmed what we as students already know and felt that it was a waste of time. I believe another teacher would be better suited for this course.",
    "I think it is a core class for public health, though could maybe discuss issues on a more complex level, as for many students the material overlapped alot with general knowledge from undergraduate courses.",
    "Good overview of the topic.",
    "Great material is taught in the course but its important to keep track of what you're learning because otherwise all the material will sound repetitive.",
    "I wonder whether we can remove this course from the core courses as I don't think I have leaned anything from it.",
    "Low workload, kind of like a seminar but the content is interesting.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, but didn't always correspond with the graded material. The discussion sections could be shortened in length.",
    "This is a required course but I think it is important because the social and behavioral factors have such an huge role in all of public health and I think this is an enjoyable course with a good instructor.",
    "It's required and there weren't any other options for fulfilling this competency this year, so I can't not recommend it. The class is probably useful if you are interested in social determinants of health or any kind of chronic disease interventions, but much of it is also common sense. You will really only get out of this what you want--if you don't put in any kind of effort, you probably won't learn anything.",
    "interesting overview of behavioral health, but not very in depth in any particular area.",
    "It's an interesting course in general, with a broad perspective of view over various health topics."
