   "comments": [
    "Intro to Tibet is a good course for any religious studies major (definitely take it!) or for anyone interested in Buddhism in general. The course really widens your perspective as to what \"Buddhism\" encompasses and gives you good knowledge both academically and day-to-day, especially considering how popular Tibetan Buddhism has become in recent years. Thereadings aren't difficult, the assignments are straightforward, and Professor Quintman is not only incredibly knowledgeable but also a really nice guy.",
    "This is a great course that is a good introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, covering the beliefs and history of the religion starting from its founding. The reading is a bit boring, and we are not necessarily held accountable for it, but one learns a lot regardless.",
    "This class is extremely comprehensive and extremely reading-intensive, so be ready. Don't take this on a whim; take it having already tested your interest in Buddhism and in Tibet in other ways. That said, Professor Quintman is articulate and knowledgeable and the readings are interesting for the most part. I took this as a wild card fourth class, and the resulting acquaintance with something so far out of my field was well worth it. Having learned a lot about Tibetan Buddhism, it nows seems to pop up all over the place. The assignments were very manageable; we even wrote encyclopedia entries for one of the three writing assignments, which is a nice change. Overall, highly recommended.",
    "This course was good. Coming from a background of knowing nothing about Buddhism, I often felt like I struggled to understand what was going on, but by the end of the course I think I've gained a pretty good understanding of the subject. You definitely need to do the readings, though.The professor is nice, and helpful if you ask. Requirements aren't bad - 2 5-7 pagers and 1 10 pager - but be warned: he makes you post in weekly discussions on classesv2, which was really obnoxious.",
    "Tibetan Buddhism is a class that will challenge you to think about Tibet in a way contrary to the popular portrayal. It teaches you about the origins, customs, ideologies, culture, as well as the religion of Tibet. The class requires extensive amounts of reading but the topics are very interesting. I recommend this class to others because it was a small class that allowed students to discuss in class and through an online blog. Questions were asked and answered and students were encouraged to analyze the readings and draw conclusions."
