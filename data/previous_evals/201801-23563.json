    "I learned what I thought I was going to learn- different tools and a way to think critically about project design. The best tool I learned was the conceptual model. I have also talked about this class in many job applications\/interviews so this class has helped me substantially (I hope to go into project management)!",
    "Similarly",
    "Very well.",
    "Aligned, learned a lot",
    "It was helpful to understand the importance of project evaluation and it will assist me conduct my summer research",
    "I think I expected us to dive deeper into the various sections we covered in class. We scratched the surface of many topic areas, but didn't really develop and master the skills associated with them. I also would have liked to have spent longer on developing a budget.",
    "Very well.",
    "The class aligned with my expectations",
    "Very well."

   "comments": [
    "The content of this class was great, but I felt like it was stretched into a full 3 credit class when it would be better as a 2 credit class. Some of the lectures felt a little drawn out to fill the time. I would shorten the class to 2 credits and take out the final paper. The final paper was not very meaningful to me because there was so many hypothetical aspects of the project. I would recommend having the class earlier in the day- 3 hours at night is hard.",
    "If nonprofit conservation is your career path, this class offers a deep dive in theory and real-world examples. I often thought the class was too focused on unimportant details that we all will learn on the job (i.e. budgeting). The biggest critique is having class for three hours on a Wednesday night. This is just not conducive to any human's learning ability. Split the class into two weekly classes and have it in the morning. Everyone will get much more out of it.",
    "I thought it was a well designed and organized class. I would have loved some more ideas on how to apply some of these tools, or how they have been applied historically.",
    "Less in class discussion of individual projects with whole class , more time to work in small student groups and get help from professors or TA. Do monitoring and evaluation earlier in semester, would have loved to learn this earlier and a week longer",
    "It is practical and engaging through group discussion but, for someone who has not done monitoring and evaluation before more practical examples will create more understanding. Maybe group projects will facilitate more understanding than individual work for 1st time learners.",
    "This strong is a great introduction to project design and management and very relevant to anyone who will work with a nonprofit internationally or domestically. The course is pretty basic in many ways, and not very intellectually or practically challenging. The course could be improved by diving deeper into subject material and spending less time talking broadly.",
    "Great level of experience. Perhaps too many tools presented. It would be great to have it be client based final projects!",
    "Amy and Bill have great practical experience that they bring to the table, and bring their personal experience into the course -- I enjoyed this! Much of the course is based around a single final project (essentially to design a conservation project of your own). While this was a helpful endeavor, I think more time should have gone into research upfront instead of diving right into planning. We were encouraged to fudge real details and move ahead with whatever information we felt like for the sake of the project, but I think it would have been helpful to ground these projects more in reality. This would have also meant more research and work went into the problem ID phase.",
    "I thought the focus of the course on one specific project was good and bad. Since the project was so made up it made it hard to come up with realistic answers at times but it was nice how you could focus on your interests. It would have been nice to hear more real-world examples of other projects and their successes and failures."

   "comments": [
    "This class is great and teaches how to think critically about projects. However, it gets slow, especially in the middle and the late time frame of the class makes it difficult to be at your best for learning.",
    "Only take if conservation is your only focus. And take it in your second year--it's a good lead in to a career job, but might not be the best for a first year.",
    "Take it, especially if you want to be involved in field conservation in the future. Also, have a strong, applied project from the beginning.",
    "Seek out bill and Amy in office hours. They are invaluable advocates and stores of knowledge",
    "It is a very important\/helpful course to understand project if a project is achieving its objectives and improvements to be made to ensure it meets its objectives",
    "If you are planning to work in project management for a conservation-based nonprofit, this class is a perfect fit. It gives you many technical, interesting skills relating to project management. However, it's pretty surface level.",
    "Choose a final project that's centered on an individual client.",
    "If you've done other types of planning exercises in the past much of the course content will likely be repeat. I also found that this course doesn't do much questioning of \"why\" these tools make sense, it's more about how to use them -- just something to keep in mind. I'd recommend taking a class taught by Susan Clark before this one, because it will help you to individually question the \"why\" throughout.",
    "The tools focus on large mammal conservation so if you are not interested in that then it may not be the course for you."
