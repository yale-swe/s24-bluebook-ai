   "comments": [
    "introduction to statistics for psychology. definitely take this if you want to actually understand the work being done in psychology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student seeking an introduction to statistics.",
    "You should keep of with the small work assignments after each class, because if you don't, you will have much more difficulty learning the material.",
    "I would only recommend this to a student if they must take it for the Psychology major. It is definitely not an easy class.",
    "only take it if you have to. to be honest, it was pretty brutal waking up at 9:20 for. class time is really not engaging--it's just copying what professor treat writes on the projector. the material is really boring and although professor treat tries to make it relevant and interesting, it simply isn't. the quizzes were really long and hard and annoying. the tests were really easy if you studied, but this class is by no means a gut. i wouldn't recommend it unless you need it for the psych major.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 200. The workload is manageable and the tests are very fair. Professor Treat gives you a ton of extra practice for the exams so if you spend the time to do the practice problems you will do fine on the exams.",
    "Take it if you are interested in statistics or psychology or need a QR.",
    "Worthwhile",
    "Solid QR",
    "This class is by far the most well-run and organized class I have taken in my life. Pf. Treat is excellent, and the in-class notes are very helpful. The material is very relevant, not just to psychology, but to many different areas.",
    "I would recommend it to any psych major or aspiring psych major because, well you have to take it and Teresa Treat is awesome so you should definitely try to take it with her. The workload is manageable and helps you prep for tests. If you're not a psych major though, you could probably find an easier QR elsewhere.",
    "it was harder than i expected. granted, prof. treat told us the first day that she had made the class more difficult this time around than it has ever been before. i had no prior stats experience and math is not my strong suit, so i definitely struggled a bit. i took it solely for the QR credit, and probably won't get that hot of a grade, but i'm not sure what other math class i would've rather taken for the QR credit.",
    "Tricky math if it doesn't come naturally to you, especially as the pace of the class is extremely fast. You really have to go to every class and stay on top of the quizzes and learn for the tests ahead of time to consolidate ideas. Would definitely recommend using the help of the TA's.",
    "It's a really useful class and probably one of the only ones at Yale where you will be able to use the practical knowledge later on in life.",
    "Good introduction to statistics. The work is not too overwhelming (a quiz every week or so), but go to lecture because there is no textbook, and what you go over during lecture is basically what's on the exams. There's a lot of support from the professor and the TAs, so if you keep up with lectures and study ahead of time it's a really easy course.",
    "If you are planning on being a psych major, definitely take this course. I am now able to read psych studies and understand what the statistics are telling me!",
    "It starts off easy but don't blow it off. It gets a lot harder and many people find themselves realizing they are completely lost half way thru the course. It is manageable if you stay on top of the subject matter. Prof. Treat is also really great. Take it",
    "This is an ok class. Good for a QR credit, if you need it, but not particularly interesting. If you took AP Statistics, the first half of the course will be somewhat of a review, however this class as a whole tends to play a lot of focus on the conceptual aspect of Statistics, rather than just the mathematical aspect. Professor Treat is a pretty good teacher, though, lecture was boring at times.",
    "Good way to really learn stats, but don't be fooled and think this is a gut! It is DEFINITELY not. It's a pretty good amount of work and you have to show up and commit to get a good grade. Once I slacked off, I reallyyy started to feel the consequences.",
    "Take it if your a Psych Major, but don't bother otherwise.",
    "NOT AN EASY QR. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",
    "If Prof. Treat is teaching it, take this class!",
    "A pretty easy (if your willing to actually go to class) QR credit. If your a psych major you have to take it, if not, I'd pass.",
    "Take it if you want a basic overview of Psych, or take it for the major.",
    "Yes. I'm not a big fan of QRs, but this one was relatively un-stressful. The lectures could be fast-paced, but the workload was quite reasonable and Professor Treat and all her TFs bent over backwards to be helpful. It's really on you if you don't do well in the class -- important to keep up with practice problems and ask a question the moment it occurs to you (don't put it off for later-- stats is one of those subjects you can fall behind on very quickly). The psychology examples made the statistics material seem relevant and interesting (I'm not even a psychology major -- the examples would be interesting to most people, I think). Probably you shouldn't take it if you've taken another stats class before-- it's approached from a different angle that might either confuse you or make you feel like you're in a remedial class (depending on your prior experience!).",
    "Take it if you need it for psych major or a qr, stats are pretty useful stuff and prof treat is really good",
    "Very helpful in understanding social sciences and survey results. Very practical.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need the QR credit or must use it toward your major. Like most other math courses geared toward non-math majors, you may need more help than you initially think. Teresa and the TF's are very helpful and approachable; utilize them EARLY, especially if you haven't taken math in a long time or are not especially adept at it. Teresa's teaching style is very clear; she takes things step by step and allows for questions.",
    "This is a great class. The information is important for interacting with numbers in daily life, and it is presented in a clear and concise format. Prof. Treat and all the TAs are more than willing to explain any of the concepts to help students grasp the material. The workload is steady and not too heavy. If you go to class and do the quizzes (one about every two weeks) you should not have to work much harder to do well on the exams.",
    "Take for an easy A if you are a fairly math and science oriented person. If you're not, prepare to work in this class!",
    "Energetic, nice, and dedicated professor, but teaching style may not be for everybody. Shop it and see for yourself.Warning: having to come to class at 9:20am to fill in the blanks in the notes can get to be a pain.",
    "It's a good class to take. It isn't terribly difficult to do well in and you'll learn a good deal.",
    "total of 20 hours worth of studying for the whole semester. Easy. Great QR for non math people!!!",
    "Harder than you would expect. Very useful. Great professor.",
    "Only take it if you need it for psych or plan on doing empirical social research.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to cog sci majors, even though it is not a requirement like it is for the psyc major. Now that I understand what all the statistics mean, I get so much more out of reading psychology articles for all my other classes. The class may not be as enjoyable with a teacher other than Teresa Treat next year, but the things you learn will still be very practically relevant to your studies and research.",
    "Good overview to statistics. Take it if you're not a huge math person. Just beware of losing points for minor problems on tests (e.g. make sure to box your answers), and be sure to ask TFs if grading seems off -- they're grading a lot of exams and can make mistakes.",
    "Psych 200 is a solid introduction to statistics, a requirement for psych majors, and an easy QR. Professor Treat is terrific. She is almost obscenely knowledgeable about statistics, and she does a great job of making the material understandable. Workload is very light, and the tests are never as hard as you think they will be. My advice: take this course if you need it for your major or distributional requirements. And don't buy the SPSS book. I didn't use it all semester.",
    "For those needing to take an introductory statistics course in the spring, this is a great course. I shopped Stat 100 as well and thought Professor Treat to be a much better lecturer. Doing the optional practice problems as homework is very helpful and only takes about 30 minutes. If you can keep up with the material, the tests are not very difficult.",
    "While it is a required class for a psych major, I encourage you to take it even if you are not. A lot of the material covered is relevant to real life and would help you greatly in general.",
    "This Stats course is much better than the Stat 100 courses. Even if you're not into psychology, this course is easier to follow and you learn how to use SPSS, which is MUCH more relevant than minitab.",
    "The class is a great way to learn the statistics needed to do psychology\/social science experiments. It is very practical based and included how to use the statistical software while skipping over mathematical proofs of concepts. It is also not too much work. I would highly recommend it to someone who wants to learn statistics -- it is much better than anything in the Stats department.",
    "Psych stats are fairly easy and the format (lecture handouts that you fill in while watching the prof on a document scanner) is actually really helpful, as you are more engaged in lecture. The class definitely helped with my current research project and is not difficult if you do the practice problems. The test grading, however, can be harsh for things like format\/boxing answers, which is frustrating.",
    "Great course. I came away from this class with an intuitive, conceptual understanding of statistics. You have four exams, plus weekly online quizzes, which makes it difficult to fall behind. If you have a knack for math, you won't find this class too difficult. And if math doesn't come easily to you, don't worry; Professor Treat provides you with an incredible support system. Teaching fellows hold office hours every weekday, and there is a review session for every exam. A word of warning, however: it is not a gut class.",
    "Yes- the class was interesting and not too much work.",
    "Great class- recommend it!",
    "Great course for learning stats from square one; in exchange for a faster pace with more material to learn, we did not have to complete the projects this year, which is a plus; quizzes are alright but the SPSS material was sometimes confusing; exams are pretty good; Prof Treat does a great job of making this material easy to digest",
    "take this if you're a psych major. obviously. but don't dread it, or think you can ditch all the classes. just go, od the work, try to learn some stats, and it will be pretty decent and you'll learn.",
    "This course is fine. Not too difficult given that it's a math course. Definitely just teaches you how to do problems not why things work in the way that they do which is fine and practical (especially since most of the people in the class are taking it because they have to, not because they're interested in it) but takes some getting used to.There is no textbook, you just fill in the blanks in this workbook that Professor Treat lectures from. It's fine (just feels like elementary school) but it's something to be aware of.",
    "Psych Stats was the most straightforward course I've taken at Yale. For some this may be a negative, but for me this is exactly what I needed to balance a tough schedule. Instead of a textbook, the teacher prints out notes which you can pick up at Audobon. Then during class, she puts up the slides and lectures while you copy down her notes. Later in the week, you take online quizzes. There are plenty of practice problems and practice tests. Like I said, very straightforward. Probably the best way an Intro Stats class could be taught. I took this one because it was the only stats with good reviews.Professor Treat is an awesome lecturer. Very energetic, funny at times, awesome at explaining things. The class is big, taught in SSS.If you're majoring in Psych, you have to take it. If you're not, it's a great and straightforward QR.",
    "A fairly painless survey of some necessary material.",
    "Yes, especially for people (non-math majors) looking for a relatively easy yet somewhat challenging QR. It's a requirement for Psychology, but certainly doable.",
    "yes i would recommend it, but i would tell them it is not at all an easy course.",
    "PSYC 200 is an absolutely phenomenal course - probably the best intro stats course offered at Yale. Do not be intimidated by the 200 level or Psych department designation! Students of any major can complete the course.The professor for Psych Stats is incredible - Teresa Treat has an astounding grasp on the course material and makes stats interesting and something you really want to learn. Her lectures always seem to go by very quickly, and for a majority of the semester the course material is not too hard at all.I cannot recommend this course more. PSYC 200 is one of my favorite courses at Yale and Teresa Treat is one is the best professors I have ever had.",
    "Absolutely recommend it. Great class for learning statistics, and it wasn't very hard.",
    "Probably as good as you can get for a statistics course. The material isn't very interesting and can be pretty hard at times but Professor Treat gives you plenty of resources. If you go to class and take good notes you should be fine even though the tests aren't curved and can be difficult.",
    "take it - it's a great, extremely painless intro to stats. it's easy, but you'll learn a lot and you'll (probably) retain that knowledge. professors\/TAs are always ready to help",
    "I would not recommend this course. It was supposed to be one of the easier math courses, however, it definitely was not. It went a lot faster than in previous years. Although, next year there is a new teacher- so I am not sure how it will be taught. I did learn a lot from this course...but the material seemed pointless since I will not be majoring in Statistics or Psychology.",
    "Not as easy as the reviews may say it is. That being said, if you stay on top of the material and consistently attend class and don't wait til the night before to cram the material for the exams you'll be fine. I'd say that compared to other QRs this is the way to go if you're not really a math person. Lectures can be VERY boring though, so be prepared.(Though Teresa Treat is quite a character and can be quite entertaining)",
    "This is a really good and surprisingly painless introduction to statistics. Professor Treat is awesome, and she and the TA's are all very helpful. They are all so accessible that there's no way you can not understand the material as long as you seek the help you need. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Take it. I learned much more than in Jonathan Reuning Scherer's version of the intro class. It's about as hard, but I understand the material much better with Treat.",
    "Take if you need it for credit towards major",
    "Solid course that is well-organized, well-taught, pretty interesting, very relevant, and pretty fair. If you go to class and keep up with the material, it can be very easy. But if you don't go to class and try to cram all of the material, it's not so easy. Try to keep up and use the TAs and Professor as resources- they're always willing to help. The class was at 9am (MWF) this year, which SUCKED, butyou need to quickly get over that. It also sucked that the final was on the LAST day of finals period. So if you want to be in Myrtle as long as everyone else, take another stats course.",
    "Be sure to go to every lecture. It was an early class this year, so it was particularly difficult. If you can't do that, take the regular stats class.",
    "I would recommend this course for psych. students (who have to take it) and students in relevant fields (like Cognitive Science, which I am in), but I would not recommend it as an \"easy QR\" for other students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It is one of the best taught classes I have taken at Yale. However, do not take this course expecting an easy A. It does require application but if you do that, you will be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's honestly really manageable (4 exams, no real cumulative final) The last exam has some cumulative material, but it is very manageable and Professor Treat makes sure you have all the resources to learn it well. The TFs hold office hours every single day, so if you ever have any questions, there is always the support available to succeed. Learning stats in a psychology context has made it so much more meaningful and interesting!",
    "Pretty easy and straight-forward if you're a math person. If you're not a math person, Professor Treat goes slowly enough and offers enough help outside of class that you can definitely get through the material without suffering too much. The only problem I had with this class was that the final was obnoxiously on the last day of finals week.",
    "Psych stats is a practical introduction to statistics to solve psychology questions. I would recommend this class to psychology and cognitive science majors if they are looking for a QR that will help them develop skills in statistical methods, but would not recommend this class to students in other majors who are looking to gain a general background in statistics or take a QR, because it is very psych-oriented. The class is not too much work and not too hard and the teacher is clear, energetic, and fair in grading.",
    "You probably have to take it. Just keep in mind that it's easy to let this class slide, though it's not hard. Keep on your toes.",
    "This is a great class. The material is very practical, and while the concepts might not be clear the first time there is lots of extra practice provided--and the TFs have lots of office hours. It was pretty miserable to have it at 9 AM, but if the course was taught later in the day it would have been quite enjoyable.",
    "If you need a QR, this is the class for you. I shopped intro Stat as well, and that class was awful. This is one covers everything you would expect from an intro stats class, and is not that much work, and the work that you do have to do is impossible to do poorly on. The text book is a series of workbooks that you complete in class, in lieu of notes, so you do have to make sure you either go to every class or know someone that does. Instead of problem sets, there are online quizes that you can retake as many times as you want until you get 90%.It's all low-key and very understandable, though the class does move quickly, and it's easy to get behind if you don't keep up. Overall, the class is extremely accessible and is great for fulfilling the QR requirement. Just make sure that you keep up with the class, or it'll be a lot harder than it needs to be.",
    "Good class, but the 9:20 lectures make it a little hard. Don't cram the weekend before the exam. It's actually relatively easy to just keep up with the notes.",
    "Yes, definitely - if you need a QR and have a math phobia, take th eclass. Honestly thi sis my 3rd attempt at a QR and I'm just glad that I did it because I learned a lot from the course!",
    "I would not suggest taking this class. Very boring and frustrating.",
    "Professor Treat was amazing. Unfortunately, she won't be here next year but if the course is taught anything like the way it was taught this year, it would be an excellent choice.",
    "One of the best ways to get a QR and learn a vital skill for interpreting data in almost any other class and in general life. It's taught very well and you learn a lot, especially if you go to every class and keep up with the practice problems and quizzes.",
    "It is a good math to take if you are willing to put in the time to go to lecture. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "You will be tempted to not go to class, because you think \"I can just get the notes from someone else...\" Just go to class anyway.",
    "Good straight forward course. Well structured, good pace, plenty of practice problems and quizzes to master the material.",
    "It's a great course!!!!! Take it as a intro stats course if you have never taken stats before! You will learn lots and it's not stressful! (just do the work necessary!)",
    "A great introductory statistics course, with an awesome professor. Prof. Treat is one of the best math lecturers around, and it's clear that she knows her material inside and out -- she easily fields all questions. The course is structured to support its students; we are asked to complete 10\/12 \"quizzes\" (actually problem sets) and take four exams. There are tons of ways to get help, if necessary.That said, I found the material a little too easy: it's heavy on memorizing steps, light on theory. But I also think it's better to take an easy but well-taught course than to take one that's challenging but ill-explained. There are many ways to make good material more challenging, but few strategies to simplify bad explanations.",
    "For someonewho thinks quantitatively, this class will be a total breeze. It's easy and you really do learn basic statistics.",
    "This class is a great QR. Professor Treat is extremely organized and knows what she's doing. The lecture itself is taught in a really understandable way. The quiz system is a godsend compared to other QR's problem sets, and the way that quizzes work actually allows you to LEARN from your mistakes, which is incredibly helpful. It's a really great class.",
    "Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are a theoretical math person."
