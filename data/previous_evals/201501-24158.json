   "comments": [
    "Absolutely a class to take for any one studying African issues.",
    "This course is focussed on US engagement with Africa. African students, in particular, will be engaged by the readings. But even students with only a superficial knowledge - or no knowledge at all - of the continent will find it a refreshing look at the myth and reality of Africa. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This is a survey course of prevailing political issues and phenomena in sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "Absolutely. Whether you are focusing in the region or you have no previous academic training on it (like me), it is really worth taking it.",
    "Yes",
    "Would absolutely recommend if you wanted to learn more about Africa, but I would not say that it is a beginner level class and requires some knowledge\/experience about Africa",
    "Great opportunity to learn about a broad array of challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "Would highly recommend for any student with interest in American Foreign Policy toward Africa. Also highly recommended for anyone with little prior academic or professional experience on Africa. Less recommended for students with vast experience on Africa and who want a view that is more historical or international."

    "Very much!",
    "this course deepened my knowledge of Africa greatly, through all the readings and discussions. I found it extremely interesting and I believe the knowledge gained from this class will help me in a global health career post-graduation.",
    "It allowed me to use various African countries as case studies for the larger social, economic, and political trends around which I have focused my studies."
