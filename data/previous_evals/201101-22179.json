   "comments": [
    "Avoid taking this course at all costs.",
    "Yes if you must pick a lab in general it is a good experience",
    "Lots of work, but enjoyable labs. Be prepared to spend a lot of timem working on reports and make sure you go to Dr. G with your questions right away. Saves so much time and he's a fabulosu lab professor.",
    "I wouldn't recommend Chem 117L unless it's a requirement. If you have to take it, it's not bad, but it's extremely time-consuming.",
    "I took this for premed requirements, but ended up really enjoying this course. A large portion focused on spectrophotometry and qualitative analysis of cations and anions.",
    "Yes. To someone who hardly have any lab experience, this is a good course to take.",
    "Definitely a great class: fun, engaging, and very hands-on. Initially I only took it because of the premed requirement, but I ended up really enjoying it. If you're taking Chem 115, definitely take the lab as well!",
    "I would recommend it. It is a very useful supplement to lecture.",
    "This course was surprisingly fun at times because the experiments were more interesting, but the reports were absolutely horrendous, as usual. For ahalf credit class, the reports need to be much less intensive. I wasted too many hours on Excel graphs and superfluous summaries when I could have been spending time trying to understand the chemistry concepts of the experiments.",
    "This is not a class you take for fun. This is not a class you take to get a good grade. This is not a class you take to get extra credits on your schedule. Chem lab should only be taken for major and\/or premed requirements. It is stressful and takes way too much time. You do perform several interesting experiments, but you can't focus on the cool color changes or things that you've learned. You are too busy worrying that you won't finish the lab on time, too busy writing the lab report while realizing you still don't understand what you did, and too busy stressing out for the very difficult pre-lab quizzes every class. Take it only if you need to. It's not worth it otherwise.",
    "If you have to take a chem lab, this is the one to go with. Although it is harder than the first semester of lab and although it is work intensive, having a great instructor makes up for it and you do feel accomplished by the year's end.",
    "Strengths: actual lab experience.Weaknesses: harsh grading and busy work.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you need the lab for pre-med, because it is very time-intensive and stressful.",
    "The lab isn't that great, but it's needed for so many majors and for medical school.",
    "Here is how you succeed in this class:1. Sign up for Walden Peer Counseling and DUH mental health counselors now. This lab will make you suicidal.2. Take Hindi. You\u0092ll be able to understand Dr. G.3. Get a pH.D.4. Peel all your skin off with razors.5. Drink hydrochloric acid for breakfastAnd only when you\u0092ve done these things will you have the strength to finish this horrible, horrible course. Basically, start filling out transfer applications NOW, or just run away to the humanities.",
    "It's a lot of work for such a small credit",
    "I would recommend it because it gives you a hands-one experience in the lab.",
    "You probably have to.",
    "This is Chem 116's cooler cousin. I preferred this semester to last semester, although I still think it's more work than it's half-credit designation. As long as you get in the mindset that you enjoy chemistry (just try it), the labs are kinda fun. You're never going to enjoy the hours that you're going to spend on the lab writeup, but hey, you can't have everything in a class.",
    "Take if necessary for major",
    "You probably have to take this course, so go ahead and do it. The material covered fit much better with the lecture course than it did last semester for 116L. The lab reports were sometimes pretty killer, and it's never great to spend your entire afternoon in lab, but you can't really do much about that.",
    "Take it only if they force you to.",
    "I think Chem 117 provides you with some basic laboratory skills, which will be applied over and over during the studies of a science major.",
    "I would only take this class if required for premed or major.",
    "it requires a lot of work. take it only if you must.",
    "Lots more work than last semester (especially over spring break). Quizzes are much harder, but Dr. G puts practice questions online beforehand. I thought some labs were fun and some were quite boring. Lots of work for a half credit class.",
    "You should only take CHEM117 if you are a premed or science major who is required to take it. It is neither interesting nor exciting. Lab papers are painfully dull and take forever to complete.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need it for your major. It is a ton of work, for only 0.5 credits. It is fairly easy, but the preparation, lab itself, and report all take a substantial amount of time.",
    "A lot of people take this lab because they have to, but it's still a pretty great course. It does feel like more time goes into it than I would like for half a credit, but the work outside of class was generally not too trying, and the lab time itself was sometimes surprisingly enjoyable. Also, it's a great way to hang out with people you would never otherwise spend time with!",
    "Not for non-majors",
    "Yes, this is a great intro lab course.",
    "I'm not sure why someone would be taking this if it wasn't for a major or pre-med... but if you're thinking of it, it's not worth \"just for fun.\" It's a good way to understand the basics of working in a chemistry lab.",
    "It is necessary for pre-med, but otherwise don't take it.",
    "Incredibly tedious, and the lab reports take FAR too much time for this class to only be 0.5 credits. If it was a 1 credit class I'd feel a little differently, but I spent far too much time on this for it to be only 0.5 credits. Don't take this class unless you really have a thing for chemistry or unless you have to take it for a pre-professional program. Dr. G is hilarious and great but that doesn't make up for how massively boring the lab procedures are.",
    "The quizzes can be difficult if you don't prepare ahead of time.",
    "If you took Chem 116L, I would recommend continuing with this course. Several of the experiments were more interesting than the ones in first semester, in my opinion, and they were mostly less stressful as well. I had an enjoyable experience in lab most weeks, and the course definitely teaches you how to use some important techniques and concepts that were not covered first semester. There is also a generally good correlation with the material being taught in Chem 115.",
    "This lab course is worth taking. It requires truly a lot of work but the feeling that you have learned things at the end is rewarding and priceless. It is very fun despite the heavy workload.",
    "Take it if you need to. Not worth it if not.",
    "Take it if you need to. The experiments are definitely a lot more intensive and difficult than the first semesters' and with that said, the lab reports are also a bit more complicated and time consuming.",
    "Most people take this as the spring part of 116L. It is a good lab course. A few of the lab reports were difficult and took a lot of time. However, there were also a few easy ones and the final exam is actually kind of fun.",
    "Chem 117 will definitely help you master the gen chem course material, at least of Chem 115. Take it if you have to and keep in mind that it's helping you. But I wouldn't exactly recommend taking it if you don't have to, because it is way too much work for only 0.5 credits.",
    "Chem 117L is more work than Chem 116L, but still very manageable. If you come prepared to the lab (preferably with some of your data sheet written out in advance) and prepare for the quizzes as the manual instructs you, you'll have no problem getting a good grade. The final is also reasonable and easy to do well on. You simply have to perform a series of qualitative tests to identify a mystery salt. If you need extra help, go talk to Dr. G. He will help you out.",
    "You probably have to take it.",
    "This class is not fun and it is very tedious, but I learned how to write a good lab report. It is a lot of work for 0.5 credit, so only take it if you need to.",
    "This lab is much more TEDIOUS then the lab during first semester. Prepare to spend lots of hours completing the report. Labs will be more stressful for this second semester because they are longer and a little harder. Prepare for lecture and lab the day before, so you can do well on the quizzes. The final though is quite easy (probably even easier than the one for 1st semester!) I recommend this course to a student who wants to further his or her lab skills.",
    "This course if recommended for students who like working in the laboratory.",
    "This is a class to take if you are pre-med and need it. If you're not pre-med, think again before taking it. It's not a bad class, but it's a lot more time consuming than you'd think for something only half a credit, and you don't learn anything new that you won't learn in lecture.",
    "I would take Chem 117 if it is a requirement for your major\/pre-professional program. I wouldn't recommend taking it just for fun, since it's pretty time-consuming and you don't learn too much material that you didn't already learn in lecture. THat being said, it does provide useful laboratory experience.",
    "Well just do what you gotta do.",
    "Yes. If you have to take it...",
    "Chemistry 117L is a direct continuation of 116L, and you should expect much the same. You learn standard laboratory techniques and spend much of the term learning how to identify unknown salts through a series of tests. One warning (which is true for any lab): this is much more than 1\/2 a course worth of work. I put more work into this class than I did some of my other full-credit classes. While the work is often not that hard, it is very time consuming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to other students. It is not too difficult, but does require a lot of time.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it for premed or major requirements. It is a lot of busy work and too much work for .5 credits. Quizzes are harder than in 116. Lab Reports are longer and harder. However, there is less busy work in the labs themselves. Final was actually pretty easy and fun. But the rest of the course - not so much.",
    "As it is now, 117 is an unbearable class. Take it only if you have to for your major (and unfortunately it's required for a whole lot of majors).",
    "General lab class-I found it to be relevant to CHEM 115 as well. Ie the material that we discussed in class was then covered in the lab which was helpful. I recommend not taking it on Friday-it is hard to have the 4 lab hours at the end of your week.",
    "It's lab. Enough said. If you're a non-science major or science major w\/o this as a requirement, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT. There's a lot more fun science courses at Yale. Why waste 6-10 hours on a report, 4 hours in a lab, and 4 hours doing pre-lab? If you're required to take it, deal w\/ it.",
    "Most people would take Chemistry 117L as a requirement for something else, but for what it is it is rather enjoyable.",
    "It's something you gotta do for premed. It can be fun.",
    "General chem lab corresponding to chem 115",
    "I mean, it's not the greatest, but if you have to take it, it's also not the worst thing in the world.",
    "The quizzes are really, really hard. Actually study for them.",
    "Chemistry 117 is very helpful in reviewing the general chemistry material, but, at times, can be challenging for Chem 113 students because the topics discussed in lab may not have been covered yet in the lecture course.",
    "A necessary course for a pre-med student taking 115. This Lab is a lot of work, but is a good introduction to the basics of laboratory skills.",
    "Yes because you learn a lot of the basics of chem lab work and how to use certain equipment. It also helps you understand chem 115.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Chemistry 117 is a great supplement to Chemistry 115. I don't recommend taking it just to take it because of how demanding it is. However, if you take it to use it toward a major or pre-professional program, you will learn a lot.",
    "If you don't have basic lab skills, definitely.",
    "Good lab",
    "If you are premed, it is inevitable. Otherwise, consider a more fun gen chem lab.",
    "If you don't have to take the course, don't take it. If you do, it's not that bad.",
    "Yes - still might not be worth it if not premed, but really not bad otherwise",
    "It's basic gen chem lab. Take it if you need to it's not that bad.",
    "I would recommend the course as it truly does elucidate the more abstract knowledge gained in Chem 115.",
    "Your standard chem lab class. The workload is very predictable so if you stay on top of your stuff then you'll do fine.",
    "The lab was more difficult than the fall semester, which caught me slightly off guard, but was fair and relevant to the material. Although some of the reports were painful, they did help increase my understanding of the topics. I'm glad that I took it.",
    "Good complement to Chemistry 115. Take the lab. It brings to life the very material you're learning in class; it's a good way to channel all of this material beyond books and exams.",
    "Gen chem lab is a course that one should take only if it is a requirement. The hours are long and the lab reports as well as many of the experiments are tedious.",
    "The course was unnecessarily tedious much of the time, but definitely gave a good grounding in chemistry skills. Not a half-credit of work though-- more like a full credit.",
    "Good for learning chem, but only take if you love chemistry, or have to because of premed. Difficult and time consuming",
    "Many people complained about lab, but it really wasn't bad. Pay attention to the lectures and do the prelabs and the quizzes ARE NOT HARD. don't leave lab reports to the last day, though I do know people who do, and get away with it. Don't go to lab tired, or you'll screw up.",
    "YOU ARE SCREWED HAHA",
    "I would say that it is hard work doing full lab reports every week, but worth the experience.",
    "Absolutely. Honestly, chemistry lab was the only thing that made chemistry lecture bearable. I loved chem lab, regardless of the large workload, and looked forward to it every week.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chemistry 117L. It's is a great set of experiments, interesting and prepare you for Chemistry 115, and lab courses in the future. The professor, Dr. G, is wonderful and anyone will be happy to have him. I cannot think of a better way to understand Chemistry and have fun while doing it. However, keep in mind that the work load is immense. If Dr. G ever says it would be in your best interest to start the lab report for a particular week(s) early, BELIEVE HIM! If you save things to the last minute you will not sleep in order to finish.",
    "Good general chemistry lab course, interesting experiments and the concepts apply well to general chemistry lecture classes.",
    "Chem 117 is a required class if you think you want to be a premed, and this is the single most compelling reason to take it. Otherwise, I would say that the skills it teaches are not necessary to complement chem 115 and the class itself is not fun or interesting enough to warrant the hours of time it sucks up each week.",
    "Chem 117 will eat up a lot of your time. Don't procrastinate on your lab reports--really, don't. And the lab quizzes are significantly more challenging than Chem 116, so be prepared.",
    "This course was something I did not look forward to each week as it required four hours of time on a single day plus many more hours of work writing the lab report outside of class. I would not recommend it for anyone not required to take the lab for a prerequisite.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Chemistry or any form of laboratory techniques.",
    "Take it if it's required. Otherwise, don't.",
    "I feel like most people who take 117 usually have to take it (pre-med or chem major)... but I can say I definitely enjoyed it more than 116. Be prepared to spend time on lab reports though!",
    "I would advise students to stay away from this course if at all possible. This class was the tipping factor in my decision not to continue with the premed track, as it embodies many characteristics I dislike about being a premed. Spending hours struggling with Excel or retyping procedures from the lab manual is not intellectually stimulating, and seeing classmates grade-grub for extra points on trivial matters is something that just doesn't sit well with me. These are my personal issues, however, and I would tell those who need this class for their professional goals to just bear it. Study hard for the quizzes, as they are much tougher than those from first semester, and do your labs as soon as possible. Those two steps will save your grade. However, this class is not enjoyable and is much more difficult than CHEM 116La, so be warned: proceed with caution. If I could do it all over again, I would NOT take this class.",
    "Lab takes up a lot of time, between preparing for the quiz, time spent in lab, and writing the lab report. It's not necessarily hard, just very time consuming. Dr. G was fantastic, though, and you do do some cool things in lab. My biggest advice would be to be well-prepared for lab. It will make time spent in lab much less stressful and help it pass quickly. Be very careful and make sure you read the procedure carefully. And don't wait until the night before to do your lab report.",
    "I would only take chem 117 IF you need it for your major. It's a lot of work, only half of a credit, and doesn't really relate to anything but the chem lecture.",
    "Chemistry 117 01 was a great learning experience and I definitely recommend it, especially to those who are taking a gen chem course because it really applies what you would learn in the classroom, and it often times made it easier for me to understand what I was learning in lecture.",
    "Yes, and during the same time as CHEM 115.",
    "if you survived 116L, then 117L will be a lot better. Just remember that all of the subtle tricks that no one tells you in 116L but screw you over then and make you stay in the lab until 5:30 for 2 days in a row still applies to chem 117L.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Although it is a lab and it is a considerable amount of work, the work is worth it in the end for some great experience.",
    "I would summarize the course as a typical laboratory course. It is good to take it with Chemistry 115 as they are closely tied to each other in material. I would recommend it to another student if he\/she needs to take it for his\/her major requirements.",
    "The worst class I have taken at Yale. Half a credit, a course-or-more's worth of work, and not particularly designed for learning but really designed to take a lot of time and be stressful. There are lab quizzes which cover material not pertinent to the course and not necessarily taught in lecture or lab. Really, any lab or course at Yale is probably better than this.",
    "To put it eloquently, this course blows. The prelab quizzes are irritating and can screw up your grade in new and interesting ways, the reports take hours (think 6-10), and most of the experiments just feel like a boring slog. While I was lucky to have a good, easy going TA, if you have a strict TA, your weekly lab will be among the least fun activities you can engage in on a weekly basis. Finally, as opposed to what other people have said about Dr. G, I found him to not be very helpful, asking you to repeat long experiments for minor flaws (too little product, not enough of a reaction) and never answered my 3-4 emails.",
    "This class is more difficult than the previous lab course, but the experiments and techniques are more interesting. The lab reports take a long time so I would not recommend this class as a distributional requirement, but it's not too bad if you need this class as a requirement for your major or are pre-med.",
    "Chemistry lab to go with lecture, not much more to it than that. Get ready for some seriously long lab reports.",
    "You probably have to take it, and you're probably not going to enjoy it.",
    "Chemistry 117L will be more tolerable than Chemistry 116L based on the experience you pick up in Chemistry 116L. The experimentsare also more interesting and involved, and if you put in a good effort you should be able to earn a good grade. That said, the course has an immense workload, and I would avoid taking it unless you need it for a major or prerequisite requirement.",
    "I would recommend Chem 117L to another student. I would summarize it as a very straightforward lab course that correlated to the gen chem classes being taught simultaneously",
    "Not unless you have to.",
    "This class is more difficult than first semester chem lab, so expect to spend more time on your lab reports."
