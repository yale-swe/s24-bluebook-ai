   "comments": [
    "I learnt how to read a lot of material very quickly and the seminar discussions were really challenging and fascinating. I definitely challenged my research and writing skills through taking this class.",
    "It was a wonderful opportunity to dive into some more theoretical texts and to engage with Prof Snyder. Totally unlike any history course I've taken at Yale. It pushed me to think much more deeply about both questions of freedom in how I write history and in how I lead my life.",
    "An understanding of history through a multidisciplinary perspective. We read literature, philosophy and political theory in addition to straight history which was a wonderful combination. This class was also heavily focused on Central and Eastern Europe which allowed us to get at interesting philosophical and historical questions through a region of the world not often covered."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There could have been a tighter link between the readings\/course content and the writing assignment. Although the freedom of the final paper was nice, it seemed quite detached from the rest of the material we discussed. It would also be very helpful to have a draft review or at least an outline review of the biography earlier in the semester so that we could get some feedback.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Snyder is totally brilliant, as are almost all the texts we read. Classes always felt organized and I came out of them with new ideas and insights. The course pushed me to do a lot of thinking. Weaknesses: The biography assignment was meaningful, but I would have gained more from another, shorter assignment in the middle of the term that was more directly relevant to the course content.",
    "Strengths: Fantastic reading material and strong lectures from Professor Snyder grounded in deep historical knowledge. The final assignment which was the *only* assignment for the class was to write a 10,000 word biography paper on a historical figure of our choice. While a bit unstructured, I loved this assignment and the freedom it gave us. Weaknesses: Class discussions sometimes felt like Q\/A sessions rather than freewheeling discussions. At times another professor would sit in on the class and participate sometimes to the exclusion of other students. This isn't a major gripe, but I found it to be a little bit strange."
