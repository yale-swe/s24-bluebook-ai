   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write and structure a modern essay.",
    "I learned a ton about how to write and how to appreciate the world around me!",
    "I learned how to write creatively while still writing nonfiction which is something I did not know how to do before. The readings each class accompanied our writing assignments very well and enriched every assignment that I wrote.",
    "Generally improved ability to recognize how an author made an essay \"good\" as you read it. Also a better sense of your strengths and weaknesses as a writer.",
    "From English 120 I learned how to write candidly in a sophisticated way. I learned how to take personal stories and turn them in to pieces of writing that are interesting and relatable to audiences outside myself. I learned how to effectively use drafts to improve my final essays.",
    "I learned how to read for craft and write with craft. \"Craft,\" as I understand it, includes literary skills and techniques such as voice (representative\/exceptional), parallelism (or repetition with a difference), and circular structure. I developed an ability to critically analyze modern essays. I also gained insight into weaknesses and strengths I have as a writer.",
    "I learned how to write great non-fiction essays.",
    "By reading dozens of essays over the course of the semester and discussing them with my peers and Dr. Hopper, I learned a lot of new writing techniques and styles that I was then able to practice implementing in my own writing pieces: a personal narrative, a \"place\"-based nonfiction piece, a humor piece, a social criticism, and a biographical portrait. I was able to develop my own writing process significantly over the course of the semester, especially because our assignments were due in a much shorter timeframe (1 week for rough draft followed by 1 week for final draft) than I was used to in high school.",
    "- Critical reading of short essay - extracting writing techniques from the assigned readings - Writing non-academic essays in English - Writing about the self - Descriptive writing",
    "I learned how to craft an essay effectively, and read essays more thoughtfully.",
    "Reading comprehension and analysis, how to write a good and interesting essay."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strenghts: the readings helped a lot, discussions about readings and taking notes, workshopping is incredible and a great way to add different perspectives to the reading. No weaknesses",
    "Strengths: many great essays assigned for reading. But the true strength was in the workshops, which allowed engagement with peers over everyone's writing and gave me a far better sense of what people get out of my work. Weaknesses: Reading essays, commenting on them through the blog, and discussing them in class was 90% of this course. Even with good essays it got rather boring sometimes.",
    "There is only one aspect of the course that I felt could be improved and it is the way we evaluate the texts we read. I feel as though we didn't get many chances to discuss how the content of the pieces we read successfully created a good essay. Sometimes we got caught up in the literary terms and devices in a way that didn't always feel productive. Outside of Professor Hopper's amazing teaching, the readings were a huge strength of this course. They were engaging, offered diverse perspectives, and I found myself re-reading them often for entertainment.",
    "Some strengths of the course include its wide range of genres and authors, the focus on improving one's writing, and the seminar structure of classes.",
    "Great readings. The teacher was really effective at helping the class pick apart the effective strategies in the readings. However, I wish she gave more specific edits on our papers.",
    "The course does an incredible job of bringing in a wide variety of texts, not only in terms of subject matter but also stylistically. I always felt very engaged with the readings and our class discussions were very productive. While I initially was intimidated by the fast pace with which we progressed through each writing assignment, by the end of the course I realized it had been very beneficial in helping me develop a more efficient writing process.",
    "Strengths: - Good collection of essays by major American writers. - Stretches to cover different sorts of interest Weaknesses: - Syllabus should include non-American (And not British) English writing. - Assigning few long essays that might be too specific and therefore distract that students who are not interested.",
    "Interesting readings, but sometimes too much during the end of the course. Good pace with the amount of writing."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This class is very interesting and fun. Even if you are skeptical about english classes, this one teaches you to write interesting personal essays.",
    "Yes, Dr. Hopper is great!",
    "This class is a great way to build creative writing skills. The readings not only helped my writing, but they were also just interesting and very enjoyable.",
    "This course definitely makes you more aware of\/comfortable with your own writing. And it helps you understand what makes good essays good, because the focus is on craft rather than analysis. I personally thought it made me improve as a writer, but day to day it was a bit boring- 90% of the course is reading essays, commenting on the blog, and then discussing them in class. Pretty sure I heard the term \"defamiliarization\" 100 times a week. The true strength of the course is in the workshops (the other 10%), where you get to engage with everyone's writing and hear what people get out of your own.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students, regardless of writing background or major.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course provides the opportunity to read the works of renowned modern essayists (including Martin Luther King, Jr., Langston Hughes, Jhumpa Lahiri, and David Foster Wallace) and improve one's own writing. I also appreciated that each essay topic was exciting, unique, and thought-provoking. Last, the 1-day tutoring extension for drafts and revisions (due a week apart) was an effective incentive to reach out to RC Writing Tutors and the Writing Center's Writing Partners for suggestions on how to improve one's essay.",
    "The readings were so fun, and the professor was great at helping us pick apart the readings for effective writing strategies. However, I wish she gave more-in depth critiques; oftentimes, her edits were too vague to be helpful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I went into English 120 purely because my Dean suggested it and I needed another WR credit, but I ended up really enjoying the class and think it is a very useful course to help develop key writing skills that are applicable in many other areas.",
    "Yes, but I would also advise them to not be discouraged to drop it. English 120 requires a lot of self-reflection that a lot of people are not capable of (and should not be forced to do in an academic context)",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. EVEN IF YOU AREN'T AN ENGLISH MAJOR, OR DON'T LOVE WRITING. FAVORITE CLASS AT YALE SO FAR.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, you read interesting readings and its cool to write an essay every 2 weeks, it shows you how much you can write."
