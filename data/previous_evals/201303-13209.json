    "After taking this class you will be able to understand books that few other people in the world are able to understand.",
    "The course provides a great intro to traditional and contemporary issues in modal metaphysics. Decent background in logic--not only baby logic, but ideally some modal logic--is preferable; otherwise the pace and additional workload could be steep. Although important issues in modal metaphysics-like essentialism, dispositionalism etc.-are left out, the course provides a very goodstarting point for finding one's one way into these debates. Definitely recommended."
