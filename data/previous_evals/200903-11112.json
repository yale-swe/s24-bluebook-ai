   "comments": [
    "A good class to learn how to critique scientific literature better and helpful to improve presentation skills. I feel like I have a much better idea of what to look for and be critical about when reading articles. Not really a basic learning theory class about parasites, but still good for learning overall strategies in parasitology.",
    "I would highly recommend this course as a survey of parasitology. While it doesn't delve deeply in any particular organism, it provides useful background for the entire field. Additionally, the course gives a nice perspective on the field from numerous levels, from molecular biology all the way through epidemiology. Most importantly, the paper critiques and presentations really help to build skills at critical reading of the scientific literature.",
    "The course covers a lot of parasitic diseases and also helps the student develop the ability to write a scientific critique and present scientific data in a coherent format. I would recommend that another student take this class, especially if they are interested in doing research involving parasites."

   "comments": [
    "Greatly contributed to my critical evaluating skills and ability to read scientific literature, which will be very helpful to my research and eventual dissertation. I feel like I learned basic strategies that are conserved in parasitology or unique, but class did not focus on direct knowledge learning about each parasite.",
    "This gave me a good introduction to the field and the specific lines of study one might want to further pursue.",
    "This course exposed me to the wide field of parasitology. I feel like I know more about the diversity and different research projects going on for each disease and that I have a greater understanding of the parasitology research going on at Yale."
