    "This is a continuation of Indonesian. If you want to learn the language you should take this course.",
    "Take L4. If you have made it to L3, this will just help you to continue to grow in your knowledge of the language, which will come in handy when trying to communicate in Indonesia or with Indonesians.",
    "If you are very self-motivated you should take it, if not, it will be difficult to get a lot out of the classes. Unfortunately a lot of athletes seem to take this course and do not put effort into learning the language, and therefore classes have many different levels of language proficiency which can sometimes be difficult for those who really want to improve. Fortunately, Pak does his best to accommodate all levels.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Hands down the best class at Yale. Must take.",
    "I loved Indonesian."
