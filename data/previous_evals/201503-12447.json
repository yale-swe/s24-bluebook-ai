    "MCDB 221L is a gem. It is not the easiest lab and it isn't a light workload, but you will come out having learned so much. You also get to work with flies, worms, fish embryos, sea urchins, etc. and use a ton of cool technology to view it. We got to use iPads and were able to take amazing pictures\/videos of things we saw. We even got to see worms bursting out of their mother and catch it on video! It may sound gross but it was amazing. Dr. Moreno is AMAZING. She is extremely knowledgeable, and she always makes sure we understand the labs. The lab reading is thorough and really prepares you for each lab day. That being said, it is a lot of work. I often spent 12+ hours on the lab reports for this class. The first half of the course is very lab report heavy, but the 2nd half of the course has a lighter workload so it's not as bad. Also, due dates are flexible if you have a midterm or another major assignment to prepare so do not let reviews about the lab reports keep you from taking the class. If you follow instructions\/lab report guidelines and keep up with the daily quizzes\/your notebook everything will work out just fine. Take the class!",
    "Probably one of the better bio labs available. You'll get to see a little bit of everything, and learn important techniques for if you ever want to do research in a lab at Yale. Dr. Moreno is great. I'd recommend this lab. The lab reports do take a long time to write, but if you know that going into it and are prepared to set the time aside, you'll be fine.",
    "only take it if you have to. its a lot of work and a lot of time",
    "This lab is not particularly difficult and is at the same time very interesting and can be fun. I would recommend this lab to anyone who does not have a very strong background in biology or in lab techniques because it is a great introduction to various topics and techniques.",
    "Such an amazing lab and one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. At first, the lab reports seem overbearing and too time-consuming. I would begin 3-4 days in advance and spend several hours constructing them, but the effort paid off every time. The first one is definitely the worst, but they get so much easier, and you don't even have to write any in the second half of the semester. I learned so much about such a wide variety of topics and techniques! Dr. Moreno spent a lot of effort in recommending Yale labs related to each week's \"experiment\". The final project was easy and informative. The class was such a relaxed and fun environment, and I learned more than I did in most of my other classes. If you're looking for a lab to fulfill the lab requirements for the MCDB major, TAKE THIS ONE- you won't regret it, I promise.",
    "Really only take this class if you want to improve your basic lab skills before working in a lab or if you have to. The workload tends to be a lot, and the lab runs really long. If you are trying to fulfill your basis bio lab requirement, I would suggest you look elsewhere before committing to this lab.",
    "The first half of the semester, the work-load was pretty heavy and for anyone who hasn't taken a biology lab before, it could be quite a learning curve for the techniques used and writing lab reports in a scientific paper format. That said, writing in this format will become a lot easier. Professor Moreno is wonderful and willing to accommodate any tricky schedules. She also supplies the class with tons of interesting material related to our lab each week, enabling you to find labs at yale working on something that you might be very interested in. This lab samples a number of difference techniques and topics in biology, and in that way it's great for anyone trying to figure out what parts of biological research they are really interested in. There is no final exam, which is awesome, but you should know that the first half of the class is harder and more time consuming than the second.",
    "A lot of work but definitely a lab course worth taking.",
    "If you need\/want a good bio lab that doesn't require concurrent enrollment in a lecture, this is a good way to go. It's very straightforward- a decent amount of work, but if you put in the time you will do well.",
    "One of the more miserable experiences of my academic life. The class was composed mostly of people with experience working in legit labs and\/or were senior premeds with many lab credits under their belts. I was neither of those, and I struggled badly. The pace is extremely quick, and if you're not one to grasp tough scientific concepts on the fly while multitasking on two or three different procedures at one time then this lab is NOT for you. The lab reports were also extremely time consuming and tedious (as all lab reports are), sometimes 10 hours per report. Others seemed to enjoy the class, but I loathed it because I was consistently lost. If you're a humanities person then I'd look elsewhere.",
    "This course is very hands-on and much more exciting and relevant than other intro lab courses (gen chem, physics lab, etc.). However, the lab reports are a lot of work and are graded pretty harshly.",
    "A little intimidating at first, but ultimately a great lab! Very interesting, always fun, and constructive. Expect to set aside several hours for the weekly lab reports. Pretty significant workload, but rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a chill bio lab that fulfills whatever distributional requirement you are looking for. I found the labs quite fun, and though they can run a little long, the time flies by. Don't know what the grading was like, but my TA was pretty lenient, especially when it came to statistics.",
    "See question 1. I would not recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Model organisms lab. Basic biological lab techniques.",
    "MCDB 221L was a lot of work, but ultimately worth the time and effort. I learned a lot about different model organisms and about the research process. Professor Moreno was fantastic.",
    "This is a great lab, but with a lot of writing. I expect to devote many hours to long lab reports."
