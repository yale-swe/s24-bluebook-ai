   "comments": [
    "whole-heartedly recommend.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course for the following reasons.-It covers the whole US diplomatic history, which gives students a broad perspective on it.-It begins with basic knowledge, so non-specialists like international students can also follow the course as long as they keep up with its reading assignments.-It also focuses on up-to-date issues, so it is very practical.",
    "I'd recommend the course to students interested in US foreign policy specifically and to those interested in the policy world more generally.",
    "Yes. While some grad students might dislike the lecture+discussion format because of the time it adds to their schedules, it really is necessary to tie everything together.",
    "IR 720 provides a very valuable basis for understanding foreign policy - something crucial for all serious students and especially important for international relations students, such as myself. The class is accessible enough for people in other disciplines (some of my classmates were music majors, etc) but detailed and complex enough for grad students in IR, many of whom were in the course. I would certainly recommnend this class to another student (and have)!",
    "I would strongly recommend American Foreign Policy for fellow students. I appreciate the way in which the course ties together historic traditions and current events, and believe that the approach of the course is extremely practical and useful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it as an excellent survey course for American foreign policy history. The paper exercises were very helpful and the course broke down a huge amount of material into concrete and manageable themes.",
    "I would highly recommend the class for a better understanding of foreign policy and how it relates to domestic politics both historically and currently. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in government or politics in general. The principles taught are necessary to understand foreign policy and political decisions that are made now."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me understand the tradition and values of U.S. foreign policy, what are the politics behind it, and what are the institutions that are involved.",
    "As the first step to highly specialized research on US diplomatic\/political history, the course gave me basic but necessary background historical knowledge.Although it did not necessarily directly contribute to my research topics, it helped it.",
    "It's a good course for practitioners or if you're interested in history or political science.",
    "This course was really fundamental to my knowledge of international relations. Although the broad concepts were familiar to me, I had new insight into their complexities, histories, and how they fit together. I find that course material and discussions has changed how I read the news and how I discuss historical events in foreign policy.",
    "As a student at the School of Management the class deepened my understanding of US government and politics and the role it plays to effect both domestic and global and international economic and political settings."
