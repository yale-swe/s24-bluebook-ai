   "comments": [
    "It is an intense course. Take it only if you are really keen on learning french.",
    "I would recommend French 110 for a fellow student. I would say that if you're looking for an easy way to get your language requirement out of the way, avoid the French department. If you're serious about learning the language, though, it's the best program I've seen.",
    "An intro language class is an intro language class, but, that said, Intro French at Yale is the best way to do it. I\u0092ve heard the professors are all great but I had Ngame and he\u0092s not only the course chair but a fantastic and easygoing person and I loved going to office hours. There is a weekly test (half an hour, half oral and half written) and weekly composition (only 50 words), occasional quizzes, and a LOT of class participation. There is workbook homework every night but it\u0092s about half an hour to an hour\u0092s worth, if you really do it thoroughly. And the class meetings every day are enough studying\u0097there isn\u0092t much to do come Sunday night for Monday\u0092s test.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 110. It\u0092s been an incredible course, and I\u0092ve learned so much. I\u0092m excited that after being in this course for one semester, I can always participate actively in conversations at the French table, though I knew no French just a few months ago. Professor Ngame is terrific, and the French In Action method is awesome too. With his teaching and French In Action, the course is not only incredibly effective but also fun and exciting. In fact, the method is so much fun that we don\u0092t even realize how much we\u0092re learning so quickly. French In Action immerses you completely in French, so you learn naturally (without having to memorize vocabulary lists), and it\u0092s genuinely fun. We do have significant work each night and a weekly test, but if you really want to learn French, this is an amazing way to do it and I\u0092d recommend the course 100%!",
    "I would say that French 110 is a course for someone who isn't merely considering learning French. To take French 110 is to make a commitment to work hard for a semester and rapidly develop a grasp of the fundamentals of the language.",
    "It is the best course you can take if you want to learn the French language.",
    "This is a hard class with a lot of work (usually upwards of an hour and a half of workbook stuff per night) and has quizzes and oral exams every single week. That being said, if you are at all interested in French this is an excellent program and curriculum. I feel like I learned more French in 1 semester than I learned taking 3 years of Spanish in high school. Over all a great class and one that I would choose to take again if I had to re-make that decision.",
    "A lot of work, but managable. If you can take it with Ngame, it's certainly worth your time.",
    "Yes I definitely recommend it if anyone wants to start french.",
    "this is an excellent course. but lots of work",
    "Hard work, but very rewarding.",
    "Definitely take L1 French with Professor Ngame. He's a really great teacher, but also understands how hard it can be to be in class every day, so he's also very lenient. I learned more French in one semester than I learned of Spanish in 4 years of high school. It's a really good mix of immersion and structure.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for other students. It is a fairly good start for introductory French learning and you really get to learn a lot of things in a very short time. The amount of work may seem heavy sometimes but it will be worth the effort. I enjoyed most of the classes and I would say that the professor helped me a lot throughout the process. Prof. Ngame is very friendly, supportive and accessible and I\u0092m sure students in other sections are all very jealous. Definitely take it with Ngame."
