   "comments": [
    "solid class, teaches you want you need to know as an informed citizen in the age of terrorism, not a lot of work, as much reading as you want to do, but still interesting material.",
    "Pretty basic stuff, nothing you couldn't get from reading a good book or keeping up with current events. Pros: 3 weeks of movies.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject",
    "An awesome policy oriented course, something hard to find at Yale. I feel like I know more about both the policies and the players than ever, and it was all really interesting too.",
    "Take it.",
    "not a bad class though stuart is a turbo and wont let you use a laptop.",
    "Take it",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT",
    "Yes. You learn a lot, and it's all current and practical information.",
    "don't take this course it just so is not worth it. gottlieb injects his political beliefs into every lecture and you never know if you're getting fact or his spin on things. also he's an asshole. and lecture sucks, he never incorporates current events or changes his lectures to you know reflect WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD.",
    "BIN LADEN IS DEAD!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend it: the information is relevant, and the workload is practically 0 except for what you're graded on.",
    "Overview of \"terrorism\" - the word itself and what it has meant from the Crusades up through today. A study of counterterrorism efforts and strategies, focusing on America's perspective. Big lecture (not a gut, though not difficult),with a great professor& optional section. What more could you ask for?",
    "Solid course, will completely change the way you see the Middle East and terrorism. You don't need to be a political science major (I wasn't) to do well or understand things. You just have to want to be informed. Seriously, it will change the way you read the news and think about current events.",
    "great class about basics of terrorism and counterterrorism. definitely recommend it.",
    "good class on terrorism and CT. very informative. take it.",
    "Great class- Prof Gottlieb is an awesome lecturer, super interesting material, and not too complicated. Also: IN CLASS MOVIE SCREENINGS. What more could you ask for?",
    "Yes! It's a really cool class and you'll learn a lot (especially since I had no prior experience on this subject). It'll make you think about current events in a whole new light. There's a CRAZY amount of reading, but I took it CR\/D and think it went fine. Section is optional which is great. There's a short memo assignment that everyone did well on. The midterm is take home and pretty difficult but the final wasn't too bad. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this class. Professor Gottlieb is awesome, entertaining and a great lecturer. You also watch movies!",
    "Yes take it!! The class isn't that much work and you learn so much! It actually changed my political views on counterterrorism policy. Gottlieb definitely presents both sides though! You don't have to do all the reading, but make sure you read Gottlieb's book!",
    "Just take it - it's definitely worth it.",
    "Solid, interesting class. It's weaker when when Gottlieb goes off on all the theoretical stuff and the endless debate about what is terrorism and the liberty\/security balance, but really great when it gets into details of attacks and counter-terror operations. Take-home midterm is a chore because there are IDs and an essay, but memo is very fun, and final is fine, though some of its IDs very tricky, barely mentioned things.",
    "it is a great class to learn about al qaeda and understand the threat they pose to the USA.",
    "Definitely recommend. Lots of reading, but the material is really interesting and easy to grasp.",
    "take it.",
    "Ridiculously large reading list that no one should have to do. Lectures often repetitive and monotonous such that I didn't realize how interesting the material was until going over it for the final. But if you're committed the actual material is very relevant to the most important political issues today.",
    "Awesome course, up to date and you really learn a lot. Professor Gottlieb is a bit of a turbo but is an awesome lecturer and really knows his stuff. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "If you're at all interested in terrorism& counterterrorism, take this course. If you want to know what goes on in the bureaucracy that is U.S. government, take this course. Even though I'm a Political Science major, I'd say this course is very accessible to any background. You'll understand the news so much better after taking this course.",
    "Take this class, although be careful if you take it Credit-D, because if you don't go to class you can definitely mess up the midterm. You don't have to do the reading if you go to class and take notes, but for the take-home midterm definitely get familiar with some of the concepts from the reading because they look for you to talk about stuff from the reading, otherwise you'll get screwed.",
    "I would take this course if you are looking for another large lecture course, where you can easily get a B or a B+. To get an A- or A, I think you'd really have to love learning the material, and reading hundreds of pages from PDF files. If you want to do well in this class, get to know your T.A. and ask questions about the project requirements.On the midterm, he would have multi-part questions such as \"describe how religion affected the origins and actions of ... \" In all these cases he wants you to break the question into two parts: 1) origins 2) actions. He took of massive points from a lot of people because of the ambiguity of the questions. So be careful with that.I didn't find it very interesting. Most of the information you have probably picked up from reading the news and watching movies.",
    "I took this course after hearing good reviews from other people but was for the most part disappointed. The main problem is that terrorism& counterterrorism is much too narrow of a topic to fill up an entire semester's worth of work. This course should really only take about 4 weeks, but must somehow fill up 12. The result is that every lecture, though 1.5 hours long, seems to be void of content. It's mostly just memorizing random group names and etc without doing any real critical thinking.If you're just looking for an easy course, you could take this one. You don't really have to do any of the readings if you're willing to sit thru all the lectures and handwrite notes for the final (he doesn't allow laptops).",
    "Terrorism and Counterterrorism is an amazing course, very pertinent to current events. It does a great job illustrating both sides of the issue, offering insight into both explanations and tactics of terrorism as well as the tools and challenges of countering terrorists. It's a lot of reading, but if you find the subject matter fascinating, it's quite enjoyable. Rather than teaching you what to think, it really teaches you how to think about difficult issues like torture and liberty vs. security.",
    "Take it, its interesting, relevant and fun.",
    "This class is phenomenal and I would absolutely recommend it (and have already). Interesting material with an interesting presentation, and Gottlieb is great. Don't be scared by the amount of reading--there are tons of small articles and you don't REALLY have to read the Martha Crenshaw book (it's boring).",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student because students become extremely well educated and informed on a matter of great importance to the whole world",
    "YES",
    "Pretty interesting course with easy grading.",
    "Very interesting class, not too much work but a great extra class. Just a take home midterm, 3 page paper and final. Very manageable and section is not required.",
    "Take it!",
    "Don't bother. There are better social science classes if you need that for graduation and it's not worth wasting a CR\/D\/F either. Lectures are too broad and repetitive, and I frankly learned nothing new. There are better classes at Yale; you should actually learn something new. My greatest accomplishment in this class was that I got very good at doing the New York Times crossword. Trust me, you really don't want to take this class. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
    "Beast of a class.",
    "Fun class. Must take.",
    "This course basically goes through the big debates surrounding terrorism (what it is, how it works, how it's evolved) and then the policies employed to fight terrorism (military tactics, intelligence, etc.). It's a great course and you should take it before you graduate regardless your major.",
    "Great course, not difficult. Take it for a senior credit. It's really interesting. You don't need to do the reading. Gottlieb is EXTREMELY biased though and sometimes his lectures were very frustrating because it feels like he spends more time bashing Obama than actually teaching. I generally enjoyed the class though, but make sure you take each thing he teaches with a grain of salt.",
    "Yes take it!",
    "A theoretical and strategic approach to terrorism and counter-terrorism. Good background. Some days fascinating, some days a bit dry, but overall a valuable and worthwhile course to take to understand current events these days. And you get to watch films during lecture and write a policy memo; what could be better?",
    "Terrorism and Counterterrorism is a constantly evolving topic that requires a very dedicated professor who's flexible and cares enough about the class to change his lesson plan. Gottleib was not one of those professors. He had literally 20 minutes of material to teach each class. Once, instead of just emailing individuals or sending out a list, he held a lottery to assign each individual (in a 250 person class) a terrorist group, wasting about 25 minutes of class time. He shows movies instead of teaching, and is possibly one of the most arrogant professors I've ever met.",
    "A good\/decent course but not a great one.",
    "Big lecture with a lot of athletes, which makes it feel like a gut. The work isn't too demanding (take-home midterm, two page \"memo\", in-class final, sections optional) which makes it feel like a gut.But the material is extremely interesting and Gottlieb does a fairly thorough job going over it in lecture. The readings are also rather extensive, although I doubt very many people did them.All in all, recommended, although Gottlieb has a clear neocon bias so if you're turned off by that you might want to to elsewhere.",
    "Yes. Really interesting class with an awesome professor, and it focuses on a lot of relevant issues.",
    "Not worth it.",
    "Good class, TAKE IT! I think every self-conscious student should take this class to get a better understanding of terrorism - where it comes from, what drives it, why it happens, how it works - to better appreciate the world's politics.",
    "Great course! Not too much work, and great BALANCED perspective on terrorism. Optional section was nice. I think you could really get a lot out of the course if you do all the reading. too bad there is just so so much...",
    "have you read the news for the past 10 years? great, you understand the course.",
    "I definitely learned a lot in this course. I also really liked the way it was structured, including both terrorism and counterterrorism, and pre and post 9\/11. I also really enjoyed the memo and really learned a lot in how to structure it. My one complaint is there seemed to be vast differences in how different TAs graded the memos. The essays on the final were also extremely broad, which made them a little difficult to answer. But despite these few minor things, I really loved the course. It added a lot to my study of both the Middle East and US foreign policy, though you certainly did not need that much background to take the course.Professor Gottlieb is an great lecturer. He's very entertaining, and definitely made the class that much more enjoyable. He's also extremely nice and always willing to help the students with anything that they need, with both the class, but also with general career advice.",
    "if you'r elooking for a class where you barely hvae to do antyhing...",
    "Good course, does a good job of summarizing the history of terrorism and then highlighting modern terrorism and showing it's historical context.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student, no matter they're background or lack of background in political science.",
    "Yes, it's a good class.",
    "The course is a good overview of the major issues raised by the specter of terrorism and how one could deal with them, including the evolution of the practice of terrorism throughout the centuries, the techniques used by terrorists, the motivations of terrorists, and how the government attempts to lessen or eradicate the dangers of terrorist activity. Emphasis is placed on modern vs. tradition terrorism and the debate of liberty vs. security in counterterrorism implementation in democracies.If you're interested, take it. Shop it, though, to see if you like Prof. Gottlieb's lecture style. I didn't, and I left the class with a sour taste.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There is a lot of reading, but don't be intimidated. After the first three weeks, you will have a good idea about how to prioritize the readings. However, I think it is important to note that even people who are taking the class credit\/d should still go to as many lectures and sections as possible. This shouldn't be a problem because Gottlieb's lectures are good and the material is relevant to current events. The take-home midterm and in-class final exams are very reasonable.",
    "Great course looking at the evolution of terrorism and counter-terrorism strategies pre and post 9\/11"
