    "Anytime is fine.",
    "The course is really great in terms of the freedom to talk about religion and related issues that are usually considered taboo outside of the classroom. It should be available to students on a need basis as it is now.",
    "Considering the fact that religion rarely becomes a part of the main discourse of this School, it was really a valuable course.However, the discussion in the class was sometimes confusing because of the lack of clear directionality."

    "It was sad to see the syllabus change within the first few weeks of enrollment. Karla's original plan seemed to have such a coherent direction. To adapt the course to student interest seemed to be a decision for the worse, as students did not know enough about religion and its spatial implications to guide the interest.The course coverage was too broad, and presentations were led by students that didn't have a firm anchor to tie their topics back to. Karla was charged with a difficult assignment of uniting alot of threads of interest in a way where students from diverse backgrounds can converse on some sort of common ground. I understand that the student base was diverse in order to encourage discussion across the diverse approaches towards religion. However, this common ground was frequently not established before discussions can occur.",
    "Everything was clear and useful. Especially, it was worthy that the instructor was trying to shift the course sequence in order to meet individual interest and topic.",
    "The syllabus are continuously modified to suit students' presentation and topic. I think maybe less students' presentations and more instructor's lectures and discussions would be better."

    "Since I've visited many religious buildings which were impressive, I expected to discover the relationship between people's minds and spaces. Through various broader topics, I could consider about this topic deeply. Therefore, I think my expectation was met well.",
    "The course went really well I'm quite satisfied with it. I expected more Karla's presentation on August Perre and other modern architecture cases."

    "To create architecture which provides people with some senses is one of the most important aspects of design, and is needed for current architecture. By considering religious architecture, I could rethink the true meaning of architecture. Also, since students had various background, it was good opportunity to have other view points.",
    "Religion is one of my interested area and the course is perfect for me. I learned a lot from the class and Karla is always helpful as a teacher and discussion leader."
