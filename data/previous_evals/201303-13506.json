   "comments": [
    "This is a class that wants to talk about theory of narrative but doesn't dare assign any theory. It's disjointed and incoherent. You read wonderful things, and then don't talk about them. Your papers are basically self-directed. The instructors are a mixed bag: they're all clearly brilliant, but some of them clearly resent having to teach lit 120 and refuse to put any work into the class.",
    "This class is hilarious. Really easy writing credit (only three short\/medium essays!), zany teachers (seriously. They all have cool accents too), and the reading is just novels, including fairy tales and Virginia Woolf. Take it! It's a blast!",
    "Take it for your writing credit or if you are a lit major. I would not take this for fun.",
    "Due to professors tag-teaming lecture, Mondays were in turns irrelevant, rambling, a little wacko, and incredibly professional. Section was what made this class worth it. I had Ayesha Ramachandran as my section leader, and it was one of the best class experiences I've had at Yale, bar none--which I was definitely not expecting from an introductory course. She is fantastic at moving along and eliciting discussion, and is incredibly smart and pushes you to do better without a hint of condescension. This course was GREAT because ofher. Judging by other classmates' reports, I suspect I would have had a very different experience with the other professors (not necessarily bad!).",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is looking for a fun, low stress writing credit with a great reading list. But be warned: it's chaos. The lecturers are all brilliant, but in that quirky, literature-professor kind of way that makes you feel like the class is always wavering on the brink of mayhem. If you go into it with the right attitude and a good sense of humor, I think you might enjoy yourself in this course. But if you're looking for a serious, well-ordered introduction to literature, look elsewhere.",
    "A good course, with a reading list that helps one read in a new and exciting way."
