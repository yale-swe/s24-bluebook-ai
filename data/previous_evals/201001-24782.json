    "A portrait of a period, as in the course title \"Age of Cathedrals,\" that takes the paradigmatic construction of the middle ages as the opportunity to discuss artistic, literary, religious and intellectual developments of the time. This seemed truly to be a course in the Humanities and represented a sort of broad intellectual discussion that I always imagined of college. The course material is primarily French.",
    "Take it. Bloch is a expert and the lectures were great. Not much work either. Look out for graduate students and more reading than possible.",
    "Not about cathedrals as much as literature, but still interesting.",
    "Yeah, take it if you want to take one course on medieval thought, or medieval architecture..."
