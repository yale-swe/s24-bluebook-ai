    "I would totally recommend this class for students interested in taking a course that will really make them think but that also will be something fun to look forward to every week.",
    "A chance to combine fiction writing and political philosophy in a creative and engaging way. Allows you to bring many aspects of your life and experiences to each class. Totally recommended, especially with Crowley. It's a real challenge to write a good utopia, to craft the world you have to stick to in the story.",
    "Definitely take this class! It provdes an opportunity to think about problems in society and to explore your personal social and economic values in relation to other peoples. Writing my utopia challenged me to think in new and exciting ways about my writing.",
    "Yes, because it pushes us to think critically while juggling the art of fiction writing. It is a unique but enriching experience particularly for those who might already enjoy writing fiction and would like to try a new and interesting genre.",
    "Yes! Great class and really expands your thinking about society.",
    "In this class, as it was taught my year, you'll read philosophical and fictional utopias, and you will also write your own utopia fiction. If you are interested in this topic, even if you are not a creative writer or philosopher, check out this class!This was a fun class. The readings are excellent, and the discussions can be wonderful if you make them so. Same goes for the utopia writing project. Basically, you'll get out of this class what you put into it."
