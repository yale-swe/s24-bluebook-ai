    "Interesting course with a TON of reading. She told us the first day that on heavy weeks we would have to read 150 pages, but we ended up having to read about 200 pages per class (400 a week!) I don't think I would've taken the class had I known it would have so much reading. You reading a lot of cool stuff you wouldn't read otherwise, but it's a lot of reading.",
    "I'd summarize this course as a great introduction to Russian literature in the post-Tolstoy\/Dostoevsky era. Everyone knows War& Peace and Crime& Punishment, but some of the most interesting literature comes after that in the tumult and mysteriousness of the 20th century with writers like Chekhov, Bely, and Zamyatin. Highly recommend this course.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. The syllabus is coherent and wide ranging, and professor Fink is sharp and enthusiastic and approachable.",
    "Excellent",
    "Absolutely! Fantastic course! Fantastic professor! Just be ready to read. A lot. But it's worth it. Professor Fink has a great way of connecting Russian lit to your daily life, so you end up learning a lot about yourself, too. Glad I stumbled upon this course. It's a gem.",
    "Hilary Fink is a great teacher, so I'd recommend this class for that. I liked some of the books on the syllabus, but I don't think the roster is as good as the \"Part I\" version of this class, so it might be worth comparing syllabi before choosing this one.",
    "This is a survey of twentieth-century Russian literature as it relates to its contemporary culture and politics, and the narrative Professor Fink paints of this relationships is coherent and fascinating. The books are largely great, with a few duds thrown in to exemplify Stalin-sanctioned work but also with many masterpieces. Professor Fink is a wonderful, kind, completely brilliant educator whose enthusiasm for the material is contagious. Everyone should take a class with her. There is a lot of reading -- the survey is ambitiously broad -- so I was sometimes frustrated because I was unable to finish all the pages. Still, a terrific course if you want to keep reading.",
    "I would recommend it, with the caveat that these books are vastly different from one another. This course is about exposure, and students will read some genuinely awful stuff - alongside some real gems."
