    "Instructor: Ranran Wang \u00a0Ranran was wonderfully organized, was willing to meet outside of the classroom to explain difficult topics, and could explain them in a way that was different and complementary to Edgar's explanations (which was useful when a topic wasn't fully understood in class).",
    "Instructor: Ranran Wang \u00a0The teaching assistant was very accessible and took active interest in the progress of the students.She also engaged students during the class discussions.She was also very lucid in her explanation.",
    "Instructor: Ranran Wang \u00a0Ranran was helpful and responsive for all of our questions. It may be helpful to hold regular TA office hours for students to ask questions regarding problem sets or other course work. I wasn't clear on whether this was available to us this year, so it may've been just a matter of communication.",
    "Instructor: Ranran Wang \u00a0Ranran was really helpful in making herself available to student questions and concerns. I thought that her review session for the midterm was great and helped assuage many of my concerns and make my study process a lot more streamlined. Ranran replied to all of my emails promptly when I had questions about the problem sets."

    "This class was amazing on multiple levels. I have two suggestions. First, the problem sets seemed like busy work and seemed disconnected from the material. Also they were graded freakishly harshly. Second, the course seemed to sag in the middle. I don't know if it's because you missed two classes. But it sort of lost focus and cohesion for a while. So maybe you could try to keep the same level of commitment and intensity next time you teach the course.",
    "I really appreciated the mid-semester check-in\/survey that Edgar had us complete, which allowed us to tell him what we thought was working or could be improved with the class.",
    "Question 1: I thought the readings offered a very broad view of the literature and were not too long. Question 2: The problem sets were not too long and helped solidify our understanding of the calculations behind the aspects we were learning in the readings. Question 11: Professor Hertwich was very friendly and a joy to have leading the class. He made sure we were all learning the material and understanding the things he was explaining."

    "The in-class open discussions.",
    "All of the course materials and readings complimented by Edgar's insights and commentary were invaluable.",

   "comments": [
    "Discussion can be improved. The course should have a strict no technology policy.",
    "The graded bits. The problem sets seemed like busy work and didn't reinforce learning. Also they were graded freakishly harshly (even worse than ESA which I thought set the bar for that). And the midterm seemed similarly disconnected. The final (a 48 hour timed essay) was alright. But overall maybe you could figure out an improved way to give us work and evaluate that work.",
    "Better structure to prepare for class: I'd suggest to have students send in questions about the literature in advance instead of doing \"quizzes\" to make sure we read the material, that's more something for undergrads. Making students come up with their key questions also ensures that they have read the material, and is the best starting point for a fruitful discussion.",
    "I think the final exam assignment could've been interesting as a semester-long project. Overall, I wanted more time to think through and assimilate the breadth of course material into a more meaningful response. It even could've been helpful to receive the prompts a week or a few days prior to the 48-hr exam time window, as there were many other resources that I would've liked to draw from in my response. Anything that could've helped us to be better prepared would've been welcome.",
    "After three straight hours, the lectures seemed to drag on a bit. I think that there could be more discussion among the students to splice up the lectures. I also think that Edgar could work on the pacing of his lectures a bit more so that the lectures weren't going over the course period."

It was in that sense very useful if you care about climate change and impacts on the future, and I think because it relates to so much it is important for everyone in this field to understand (whether it is forestry or material science or energy, etc.).",

You're not going to hear trite un-informed truisms about climate mitigation (\"solar is grrrreat!!!\") that you hear in other (ahem) energy policy classes at FES. You're going to do a review of the scientific literature of climate mitigation in each sector of the economy. And you're going to talk about it. And you're going to learn some stuff. And ultimately you're going to be freaked out because it ain't pretty (there are no easy answers). Cool class. Also Edgar is super nice.",
