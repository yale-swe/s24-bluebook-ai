    "Yes. Its multiple disciplinary nature has much to offer to a variety of students.",
    "highly recommend this. a good seminar to learn about art and ritual (of religion) in theory and in practice",
    "This is a course about the main religions in East Asia. I would definitely recommend it to another student. Because one can get a basic sense of the multiple religious believes in East Asia, and also learn some primary ritual theories that are very useful in examine different kinds of rituals.",
    "I would recommend it to other students. It is a very good class for anyone who is interested in East Asian Art or East Asian history.",
    "YES. Even for someone with little\/no background in HAA, it was an absolutely fantastic course."

   "comments": [
    "enhanced my understanding of Buddhist art and ritual and developed my skills in reading and interpreting visual materials",
    "Religions and rituals are one of the most important aspect in late imperial Chinese society. Through reading the materials and preparing my own term paper for this course, I have developed a more profound understanding of the Chinese rituals, especially those in Buddhism and folk religions.",
    "I learned a lot from this class. I learned how to look at East Asia from a new perspective, and I also learned how to analyze images and ritual ceremonies.",
    "I plan to work on ritual in my own work, so the ritual theory readings will be particularly helpful. In addition, I was able to write my final paper on material culture of music, which is something I have been thinking a lot about in my own research, and thus allowed me to delve deeply into research that is both relevant to the course (Tibetan Buddhsim) and my own interests."
