    "Acting: round the world.",
    "Very much a theory course, with more than half of the class time over the semester spent at a seminar table in discussion of the texts (which are drawn from the whole history and geography of acting theory). Nonetheless, the practical work feels very connected and useful as a result, and a course with Daniel is always a blast.",
    "An overview of many important theories on acting as well as their connection to practical applications of their ideas. If you found 110 boring or confusing, this will make some of the same material way more exciting and clear.",
    "Yes if you're an actor you should take this class.",
    "A great survey of acting techniques and theorists. be prepared to read and create.",
    "This class gives you a great overview on a lot of different acting theories from all around the world. You understand them in a new light because you are putting them into practice but this not really an acting class so don't take it if that's what you're looking for."
