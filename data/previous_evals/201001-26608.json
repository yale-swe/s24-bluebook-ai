    "Great course, overall. The discussions were very helpful in developing my own studio project as well as situating myself as an architect in contemporary discourse.",
    "More advance notice on readings might have been useful, with a printed course packet, as there was occasionally confusion among students as to the sequence of readings. Student-generated questions were sometimes frustrating in their lack of specificity.",
    "The student presentations were less focused than the lectures in the beginning of the class.",
    "The material for the course is incredibly interesting, but unfortunately I think Karla needs to more closely curate the student presentations to fit within her overall syllabus. At times the class seemed to wander as students figured out what they were interested in, as opposed to be more carefully guided into the overall discussion.",
    "this course is a little confusing because there is a strong syllabus, but student presentations tend to obliterate the sequence. perhaps students should each pick a week and study one of the architects in the syllabus."

   "comments": [
    "In retrospect I myself would have appreciated a stronger focus on lectures by Prof. Britton, whose knowledge of the subject was clearly outstanding, with less time spent on presentations by students.",
    "My expectations of the course were different than how the course actually materialized. I think the study of classical architecture as a methodology that ties into a larger continuity of architecture is quite interesting, but I was hoping that the material would be presented in a way that is more applicable to contemporary discussions or architecture. The issue of methodology could be particularly insightful within a school who's design pedagogy does not teach a methodology, and I think among a student body of almost exclusively designers, there's the opportunity for a much richer discussion.",
    "my expectations were high and i was a little disappointed by the course -- again, the sequence and choice or architects to present were strange."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided a great opportunity to explore my paper topic with support from Prof. Britton.",
    "The value of the course to me was high, because of the freedom to study material of my own interest. However I was often frustrated with the level of discussion the class produced. Partially I think this could be helped by Karla steering the discussion more, and partially I think because in a seminar like this, the discussion is only as good as the enrolled. This comment is not meant as any sort of slander against my classmates, but more that I think the school does a poor job with their core history and theory courses and ensuring that everybody as a sufficient base knowledge of the history and theory of architecture. I found the students in the course woefully undereducated on the foundation of the subject matter, and therefore the discussion often frustrating.",
    "i learned about architects about which i knew little, which is pretty great after more than ten years in thep profession."

   "comments": [
    "I found the professor's teaching clear and directed.",
    "I think Karla could be much more effective in setting up her syllabus and content and goals of the class and forcing the material and the projects to adhere to that. I think this was somewhat lost because she handed over a lot of her syllabus to the TA, Lis Cena. While Lis was great at always providing a counterpoint to the discussion, I feel he exceeded the limits of what his role as a TA should have been and had too much influence over the content of the course in a somewhat disorganized manner.",
    "Karla is an excellent teacher. Lis made excellent comments and really participated in the course throughout the semester. They made a really wonderful team!!",
    "karla is really smart -- i wish she had talked more about the architects she had written about. lis is great, but took too great of a role in the class. he is articulate but not clear, which often hindered the conversations."
