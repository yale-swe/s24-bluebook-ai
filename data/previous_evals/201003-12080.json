   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this course. For someone not majoring in econ or continuing anything in healthcare, I would suggest this to improve knowledge and be a well-rounded citizen.",
    "Great course. I really enjoyed it. Much less work than most classes, and Prof. Forman isreally a great storyteller and teacher. Also, you come out knowing much more than you do in most classes. (The only drawback this semester was getting all those incongruous, sometimes bad, often boring lecturers in. But that's not likely to happen again.)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a great survey of the healthcare system in the United States. Unfortunately, we had an odd set of circumstances, where Professor Forman was away for most of the class. However, it was beneficial to hear from the other professors that taught our class.",
    "Really interesting class with good guest lectures. Unfortunately, for us, Professor Forman got sick during the semester, but I would still recommend the class.",
    "Yes, not a lot of work and I learned a lot",
    "Health Econ is a great class, for econ majors and non-econ majors. Everyone needs a good background on the U.S. health care system and this course provides a good way to learn about all of the aspects of the system.",
    "Economics 170 is a primarily policy \/ political science oriented overview of healthcare in the United States, although some topics such as pharmaceuticals, value of a statistical life, analysis of healthcare as a market, etc, required basic knowledge of microeconomics. I would recommend the course to anyone. Lots of very prominent guest lecturers with real experience in the field, and Professor Forman is great. It is relevant to everyone, since everyone will eventually be a consumer in this extremely complicated system, and it also gives you the background you need to formulate an informed opinion in the national healthcare debate.",
    "Love this course. It is highly recommended.",
    "Yes! Take it. It is relevant and interesting. A subject that I think everyone ought to know.",
    "Would definitely recommend Econ 170 for the future. It is information that any person living in the US needs to know, and sheds great light on the healthcare system as an entity here. Even if you have no interest in economics per say, take the course just to learn about what Medicare\/Medicaid\/SCHIP\/HMOs etc. are - it is invaluable information.",
    "Absolutely take it. You learn interesting things from interesting, impressive people.",
    "Paper, midterm, final. Interesting material. Tough class but it is taught really well.",
    "This is a survey course on the US healthcare system and recent reforms. The economics component of this course was not particularly heavy and the work was really light. You just had to really know the material in the Q&A packets to do well in the course. Everyone does really well so it takes a lot more to really stand out.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Very recent and informative. Not very much work at all.",
    "An amazing class with relevant fascinating topics. It was really a privilege to have such an incredible speaker series. Strongly recommended!",
    "Yes. It has a reputation of being easy, and I disagree with that. If you really want to do well and excel in this class, you better know your health econ.",
    "Very informational course. Forman is a great lecturer. The guest speakers were all impressive.",
    "It's an interesting survey of the economics of the American healthcare system. Sometimes it gets very boring though. Some of the guest lectures are good, but other are horrible. Don't expect any international comparisons: we only studied the US system.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, especially if Professor Forman is back. The material is very interesting and Professor Forman is definitely great at teaching the class.",
    "Yes, it teaches you a great deal about how our current healthcare system operates.",
    "YES YES YES YES YES! Without a doubt, one of my favorite and most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. You will learn so much about health economics and the history, current status, and future of our healthcare system There's only 2 classes a week. No section. 1 short assignment. 1 midterm. 1 6-8 page final paper. 1 final. The tests are more than do-able. And you will learn a lot about one specific topic (of your choice) when writing your final paper!",
    "Yes, definitely take it. You'll learn a lot and have the chance to hear some amazing guest lecturers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, particularly premed students. I think it's really important for those planning to enter the medical field to have a good understanding of the field, including the bureaucracy and politics involved. Any student that wants to learn about the health care reform and the reasons behind some of the provisions should also take this class. Before taking the class, all I knew about the reform was what had been presented in the news, and now I feel as if I have a very thorough understanding of the bill (perhaps even better than some politicians...).",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. Definitely take this if you are a human being who will need health care at some point, which pretty much covers everyone. This made me want to go into health care in some capacity, even though I decided last year that pre-med and becoming a doctor were not for me. It's so surprising how much stuff you will learn in this class that you would have never known otherwise, and it becomes clear why this debate about health care is so complicated. Definitely my favorite class of the semester, despite Howie being out sick for much of it.Howie is also a boss by the way. Take the course just so that you can interact with him, if nothing else. He knows so much about health care and the economics behind it all. You will benefit greatly from taking this course. You'll be that much more well informed, not just about the big debate, but about a possible future career as well.ALL PRE-MEDS BETTER TAKE THIS CLASS! KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY GETTING INTO!",
    "Yes! Its geared towards making you informed about the intricacies of the US healthcare system rather than the economics behind it so if you're interested in the healthcare space, this class is a must take.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in health and\/economics. The course was fabulous. The information was interesting and clearly conveyed. The work and grading was incredibly fair. Professor Forman was very eloquent, kind, and approachable. The TAs were fabulous and very helpful. Overall the course was the best I can imagine it to have been.",
    "Yes! Interesting, however not too difficult (but that may be a plus).",
    "You learn the entities in the healthcare system and get relevant stats in your head. If you are pre-med, take it.",
    "Yes; I learned more in this class than all my other econ classes with the exception of financial markets",
    "It was a straightforward class on the economics behind healthcare in not only the United States but also other nations, and is very important information that many people do not completely understand."
