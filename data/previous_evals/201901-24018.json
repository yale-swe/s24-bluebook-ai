    "This class provides an excellent overview of U.S., China, Korea relations in the modern era. It has enough of the pre-war history to provide context, but does focus primarily on North-South Korea issues. The readings are informative and Professor Rank does a great job of boiling down the main points for students to take away. I highly recommend it for all students interested in Korea, as well as students interested in China or IR more generally. Professor Rank provides a unique perspective into the diplomatic process given his background in the U.S. Foreign Service. He knows how to interpret government documents and provides revealing insight into how they are written. His writing tips interspersed throughout the class are invaluable and have made me a better writer. While the class is retrospective, it also provides space for students to explore current Korean issues. Each week a group of students is tasked with providing news updates relevant to the course content and Professor Rank is good at stimulating discussion about what's going on. The final simulation of four-party talks was an absolute highlight and I believe we learned a lot through the role-playing exercise. Finally, Professor Rank is a wonderful person. Intelligent and insightful, he makes these issues accessible. Easy-going and accessible, he welcomes dialogue with students and is a joy to work with. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale so far and I highly recommend it.",
    "A run-through of the history and dynamics behind the Korean Peninsula. But beyond the content, we also spent a considerable amount of time learning how to write effectively and concisely for policy. We learned how to write info memos, action memos, talking points, negotiate, answer press questions, etc. Basically State Dept. 101!",
    "Historical knowledge about North Korean nuclear crisis, the diplomatic context behind it, and how to write a good policy memo",
    "This course taught me very applicable skills in the field of foreign relations. Having just retired from the field, Professor Rank taught us how to write different memos and opinion pieces, holding us to the same standards he would hold himself to when he was in the field. In addition to that, Professor Rank included simulations of various exercises (such as murder boards--aka press briefings--and summits) that would allow us to think and participate like diplomats. By the end of each class, Professor Rank would provide us a Rule of Diplomacy. When the course ended, we had around ten rules that we should keep in mind if we were to ever join the field. Overall, it is one of the most adaptable classes that I've had at Yale in terms of taking what I've learnt there and using it in the real world.",
    "We learned how to write action memos and different types of forms that can be used in foreign service. As well as the history and interests between China, the Koreas, and the US.",
    "I learned a lot about the policy process and how to write policy papers. Further, a lot of historical background necessary to make policy decisions was learned.",
    "I learned what its like to be an officer in the foreign service, including how to write memos and talking points, negotiate, and talk to the press. I also learned a ton about the Korean peninsula and its diplomatic history.",
    "A new understanding of the history of the Korean Peninsula, the current political struggles between the DPRK\/ROK\/US\/China, and the in's and out's of diplomacy.",
    "I background history of the Korean peninsula crisis and US\/China's involvement"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: This course provides an excellent historical introduction to Korean affairs and enables students to dig into current issues. Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "Great way to learn about a super interesting and relevant topic in global affairs, even if you're starting with little to no background. Also one of the only Yale courses I've taken that also teaches practical skills without being overly \"pre-professional\". Dave does a fantastic job creating a welcoming and engaging classroom environment too. Perhaps there could have been more focus on understanding the rationale behind each country's policy position and analyzing outcomes, as opposed to just learning history -- but there's a lot of time and ground to cover, so understandable.",
    "Strengths: Interactive activities like simulations and press 'murder boards', distinguished guest speakers. Weaknesses: Dave's preferences for the assignments could be made clearer earlier in the course. Discussions for the readings could be conducted better. In future courses, the roles of Japan and Russia in Korean Peninsula could be also explored.",
    "Overall, this was a very good course. The professor is a bit picky with what he wants so it takes time to learn that and apply it, but once that is understood it gets a bit easier to do the writing assignments well. Further, participation is weighted pretty heavily, but I found it hard to get into a speaking rhythm since it wasn't always necessarily open discussion, but more questions asked and someone raises their hand to answer.",
    "I really liked how practical all the assignments were, and Professor Rank is awesome.",
    "I enjoyed the simulation, and the readings were interesting. I think one area for improvement could be less of a focus in grading on simply writing in the style of the state department, and maybe more on ideas\/content.",
    "Overall this was a great class, and professor Rank taught us a lot about diplomatic writing. I do wish there was more room for opinion conversation in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course is well-run, has interesting content, a manageable workload, and a delightfully engaging professor.",
    "Yes! The situation on the Korean Peninsula is such a unique and pressing topic in today's world, and this course does a wonderful job in exploring the complexities and historical background behind it. Besides that, all of the practical assignments such as writing policy memos, debating, engaging in simulation were so fresh for someone who isn't your typical GLBL major. Dave has such unique experiences and really cares about giving feedback and making every student feel heard during class.",
    "If you would like to learn about Korea, sure!",
    "If you are interested in foreign relations, then YES. Definitely take this course. Not only is Professor Rank a great person to teach the ins and outs of the field, but he also brings in a lot of experienced guest speakers who are currently in the field that provide a lot of insight. Furthermore, you will learn how to write like a diplomat--short and concise but impactful. This class is a great first stepping stone into the world on international relations.",
    "This class is amazing. Very informative on the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. Professor Rank is very experienced and able to answer any and all questions about foreign service. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "Yes, I do feel I learned a lot and it was an interesting course, especially for those interested in future foreign service work.",
    "Definitely. This was my favorite class Ive taken at Yale so far.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in either 1.) East Asian politics, or 2.) working for the State Department. The class will help you with both interests.",
    "Absolutely. A fascinating course that breaks the work down into manageable weekly chunks."
