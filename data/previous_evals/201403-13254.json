    "CHNS 162 is a good fourth year Chinese class. However, you should not expect to have many opportunities to practice speaking Chinese. You would learn a lot about China from Su Laoshi's wonderful stories and his comments on new vocabs. In addition to vocabs in the textbook, he often introduces many concepts and vocabs related to the topics, which is fun. I would recommend this class.",
    "yes, I would recommend it as long as you can handle the courseload - which was quite heavy.",
    "I enjoyed this class, but I feel like I learned more about Chinese culture than the actual language. Most students in the class were advanced, and we didn't really practice grammar or anything that much. Not too much work, and tests weren't too bad.",
    "Much more work than CHNS 152 sequence. Su Laoshi is great, but he seems to favor non-Chinese students and male students. If you can get over that you'll learn a lot!"
