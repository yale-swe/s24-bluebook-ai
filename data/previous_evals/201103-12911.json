    "Take this course if you wish to continue Japanese. There is a bit more work than 3rd year Japanese, but honestly, it isn't overwhelming and Murata + Seto are pretty cool professors. You'll have to do a bit more Kanji than you used to but hey, that's what separates the literate from the illiterate in Japan isn't it?",
    "Japanese at Yale is amazing, and Japanese 156 is too! It was actually my first Japanese course at Yale, and the first day was a bit intimidating since Murata sensei speaks very fast (but this is ultimately helpful as it helps you get used to natural Japanese), and some of the students are really strong. But if you put in the work (which could be several hours a night), study and read, your Japanese improves incredibly quickly. The course readings are really fun, and you learn a lot of vocabulary and conversation practice is big. Albeit the 'drama and films' bit in the description is a bit exaggerated. The course brings you to a level where you can (and DO) read real literature, newspapers (albeit with a dictionary), etc, and converse about really interesting topics."
