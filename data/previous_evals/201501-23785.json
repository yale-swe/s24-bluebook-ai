   "comments": [
    "Yes. It was a 2 part course. The first half of the course was a political\/military history. The second half was a social history with great emphasis on religion.",
    "This is a great course if you want to learn more about Late Antiquity. The content is extremely useful to know and you will receive a good amount of content knowledge from the lectures and in-depth knowledge from the primary sources we read during section (though I don't know if the course will have a section in the future). Honestly, if anything take the course for Professor Lenski. If you're smart you'll know that its not always the course but the professor. He's really great and helpful!",
    "The study of the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire, looking at all facets: tribes, economies, invasions, civil wars, environment, degradation, religions, etc. An incredible course! Take it!",
    "Interested in Rome and the Med from 200CE to 800CE... ? Yes. Great the course is good.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It is really well taught by Professor Lenski, whose lectures are very clear, well organized and readily accessible online, and it covers very interesting material. The courseload was manageable, we had a lot of readings, but the exams were fair and the papers fun to write. Professor Lenski is a world expert on the subject, so it is really worth to benefit from that by taking this course to understand better the Late Antique world.",
    "Excellent course if you're at all interested in Late Antiquity be it from a religious or a political standpoint.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in Western and Near Eastern history. The class covers a wide range of topics from every aspect of society in Late Antiquity, as well as some continuation from Classical history. There's really something for everyone- whether you're interested in culture, religion, military history, legal\/bureaucratic development, or just the big picture of history in general. The professor is a great lecturer too- he's quite entertaining. There is as much readings assigned in this class as any history lecture. However, I find the texts to be highly rewarding. A lot of the things you read in this class will be fundamental to your understanding of Western civilization in general. I personally feel that a some of the ancient sources still have the ability to affect present lives in potent ways (particularly Athanasius, Augustine, Gregory). There are two major writing assignments: the first one is heavily guided and not at all challenging, and the second gives you total freedom to explore your own interests. The professor is willing to provide a lot of help with research, etc. This class should be very worthwhile to anyone interested in history- it covers a very intriguing period in the human past in an efficient manner."
