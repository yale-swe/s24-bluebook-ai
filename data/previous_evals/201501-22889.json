   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS. Professor Frame is fantastic, and the class is very straightforward. If you are deciding between this class and 115, this should be the obvious choice. Weekly Psets are short and to the point, and all exams are open notes.",
    "MATH 116 is a great alternative to MATH 115 for those that are interested in evaluating certain calculus concepts from a different perspective. The biomedical applications brought to life many mundane topics. Some of the material is difficult to understand, it is very foreign to what is seen in high school calculus classes, but very rewarding to work through. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "MATH 116 is a great first math course to take at Yale, especially if you are not looking to major in math, because it exposes you to the major fields of mathematics without going too in depth. As a science-oriented person, this was the perfect level of math for me.",
    "Would 100% recommend this course over 115 just for Professor Frame.",
    "A fun, relaxed QR for those who need it...not a gut but definitely possible to do quite well. Prof. Frame is a wizard. Beware that the course contains a high math content to science content ratio, despite how the syllabus and course description look. Great class though.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!!!! If you have the choice between this class and Math 115 take this class in a heartbeat!!! You won't regret it!! My favorite class this semester!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend MATH 116 for a fellow student. The course material was interesting, and the professor was very helpful. This is a good alternative math course for someone who needs a calculus credit for their major or for premed.",
    "This is a great alternative to Math 115 (That's what it was made for!) The small class size is really helpful when asking questions, and the problem set lengths are very manageable. Professor Frame is wonderful in office hours - he helps you with anything you need, just do the homework! He's also a lovely person. It does move rather quickly though, and even with the homeworks I often felt I fell behind.",
    "Amazing class, amazing teacher. If you need a calculus class take this!! Professor Frame is an incredible teacher and always willing to help students. So many office hours. Easy class if you pay attention and make sure you know how to do all the PSET questions, because exams are open-note.",
    "Yes! if you want to take a math to fulfill calc requirement for premed, you should take this course. One pset a week, one midterm, one final.",
    "A course perfect for premeds. This course really presents math in a whole different way, and it has changed my conception of the meaning and nature of mathematics. You learn about actually very advanced topics like eigenvalues and eigenvectors that are not covered in calculus courses, so don't make the mistake of thinking that this is a calculus course. There is weekly homework and a midterm and final.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Math 116 over Math 115. From what I've heard from my friends who took Math 115 this semester, Professor Frame is a far better professor than any of the Math 115 professors. Professor Frame is honestly one of the kindest professors ever -- he's so easy to approach, so friendly, and so easy to ask questions without ever being condescending toward students. He makes the material in the class very accessible and always takes time to make sure that everyone understands what is going on in class. Professor Frame's homework assignments and exams are also always very fair, as he's more interested in what we can apply than what we can memorize. The material in Math 116 is also extremely interesting. We do a lot of work with differential equations and population modeling, and I found the application of mathematical principles to biological concepts far more interesting than the material in a standard calculus class. In all, I couldn't recommend Math 116 highly enough. Take it with Professor Frame sometime in 2015-2016 before he leaves -- you won't regret it!"
