    "Absolutely wonderful course. Professor Snyder is the expert on Eastern European history, and he takes the time to make his lectures some of the best that you will receive at Yale. The world of Eastern Europe is fascinating, and Snyder lays out the entire history of the region. His lectures are funny and thought provoking, and the entire subject matter is definitely worth exploring, even if you are not a history major. As a physics major, I really understood new things about how to approach history through taking this course. There are certainly a lot of readings, but they really are worth it. The exams are reasonable and the people are amazing!",
    "It is a good class. I would advise you do all the readings, as it is very helpful for following lectures, for discussion sections and for the map quiz and midterm. The midterm was straightforward and it mirrored the class, too: an interesting and clear class.",
    "HIST 264 is the BEST class I have ever taken at Yale, and Professor Snyder is the best professor I have ever had at Yale, BY FAR. He is genuinely the smartest person I have ever met, a preeminent scholar in his field and both super engaging and funny. I would STRONGLY recommend this class to anyone, STEM, non-STEM, History majors and non-History majors. Eastern Europe is an extremely complex and interesting area that people don't know enough about, and studying the history of this region of the world is key to understanding today's European and global politics and economics.",
    "Its really a shame that Snyder is taking time off next year cause the man is a straight g and this course is absolutely lit. Prepare to be lowkey depressed, but also laughing at the man's bizarre gulag jokes. Take it if you have the opportunity.",
    "Truly life and major changing.",
    "It is a broad survey of post 1914 Europe. I would recommend it, but only just. I think there are better history courses to take than this one.",
    "Eastern Europe since 1914 has a kind of cultish status here at Yale; that said, I was not enamored with the course. It's definitely good - and Professor Snyder is definitely smart and informative. In spite of these facts, though, I didn't love the course's structure or its very dense, intellectualized readings. In other words, I am not leaving HIST 264 with any sense of how people have lived in Eastern Europe since 1914 - instead, I know some high-level concepts about how nation states form and what a state is. If you like political and intellectual history, however, you will probably enjoy this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as it focuses on a region of the world and parts of history that many people don't study, even though it has so many implications for other areas of history and for the current state of the world today. Snyder is a brilliant scholar on the subject and is a very witty and engaging lecturer. Just know that there is a vast amount of material to cover and that the readings can be pretty excessive at times.",
    "In one word, intense. In another word, amazing. Hands down would recommend this class to any student at Yale. It covers the history of a part of the world that is very often neglected in the West and is taught in a manner that will literally blow your mind.",
    "An amazing class -- take it. I took the first half of the course (HIST 263) and actually recommend it more highly because I left class each day knowing things that I had known literally nothing about before. This class, on the other hand, illuminates things I had known before (WWII, the Holocaust, Cold War) from a totally different -- East European -- angle. Eastern Europe is a fascinating region, and Professor Snyder is the best lecturer at Yale. Everyone literally sits on the edge of their seats while he talks. I learned a lot of new ways of thinking about history in addition to just learning about a region that at the beginning of the year I knew nothing about. In terms of grading, there are 2 midterms, a map quiz, and section participation (discussion questions, presentations, etc.) are the whole grade, so it's technically not \"a lot of work,\" but each midterm requires a LOT of preparation because there's so much material on each exam and the exams are so infrequent. That structure isn't for everyone but it works and also offsets other history classes (for history majors) well. I would recommend this class to history majors and non-history majors alike. Accessible without a lot of information on the subject but illuminating even with some background info. Fabulous class.",
    "Eastern Europe from 1914 is a phenomenal course. Snyder is one of the most distinguished professors at Yale for good reason. Unlike some other big name professors, he's a brilliant, passionate, and funny lecturer. I would recommend to any student with any interest, but I do not think it fits well as the centerpiece of a schedule. There are only three assessments in the semester and they are all fairly easy if you study for a few hours. . There is no written assessment and the exams are all 50 minutes, so you are never really pushed to internalize and consolidate the material. Ultimately, Eastern Europe from 1914 is entertaining and impactful, but not necessarily gratifying. Still, great second, third, or even fourth class for students interested in any subject. The subject matter is relevant today and some of Snyder's ideas will change the way you view the world. Even if you can't take the course, get a copy of the syllabus and drop in for a lecture.",
    "ugh, it's not really as amazing as people say. You go into it thinking \"Europe Eastern? Sounds like a fascinating part of the world I'd love to know more about\", but then you realize that it's just a shit-ton of messed up countries that arent even that interesting.",
    "This is a must take class before you graduate. I'm so glad I did. It's also very little work.",
    "Highly recommended. As a history major, I think this Eastern European history lecture class with Prof. Snyder is one of the best history lectures at Yale. It teaches not just Eastern European history but also history of society and how to view the world. Prof. Snyder is a legend, too. Exams are not so hard but the reading can be a burden sometimes.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class. The best history lecture at Yale. Prof. Snyder is hilarious and brilliant. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes!! You learn so much interesting material about a region that is largely left out of survey history courses!",
    "I would not recommend this class. Overall, I was disappointed with Eastern Europe since 1914. I am a history major, and decided to take the class based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews I read on Yale BlueBook. The class is taught poorly, however. Although I recognize that it is not easy to teach a history of this region that achieves both breadth and depth, I felt that Professor Snyder tended to teach highlights of the history in his lectures, making a broad understanding of the chronology difficult. For instance, there was an entire guest lecture on the intellectual history of post-First World War Czechoslovakia, but the partition of Germany into four occupied zones after the Second World War was not discussed in lecture and brought up in as if it had been. If you take the class, you will find yourself before the exams filling in major holes in your knowledge with wikipedia. In addition, the course has far too much assigned reading, which no one does. Much of the reading is mostly irrelevant to the lectures and to what is tested in the exams. This needs to be corrected, as it really detracts from the focus of the course. Perhaps Professor Snyder expects students to gain the information not imparted in lecture from the readings, but this too is unreasonable, given the sheer volume assigned. If you decide to take the class, do not buy the expensive course packet. All you need for the exams are the books assigned, and the course packet is of course expensive. I think that this course has the potential to be great, if these issues are resolved, as the course material is fascinating and Snyder is a talented lecturer. However, until then, I would not recommend taking it.",
    "I would highly recommend HIST 264 for anybody generally interested in knowledge or learning. If you are not a history major, I would recommend Credit\/D\/Fail because this class is a little bit too much for a non history major.",
    "Take this class. There are many great history lectures at Yale, but this is one of the best. Snyders lectures are virtuosicweek after week, he effortlessly connects minor details to form compelling narratives. Exams are fair. And youll come away with a much deeper understanding of events that influence contemporary politics.",
    "Good lecturer, lots of reading but you don't need to do it all. Interesting stuff, expecially the first half of the course!",
    "History of Europe since 1914 with one of the leading world academics on the subject. Snyder is a rockstar. Great class. Midterm and final neither of which are particularly hard. Prepare for the map quiz in advance. Take good notes and go to lecture. Snyder is not a lecturer to skip out on.",
    "If Professor Snyder is still teaching this, take it. It is a quintessential Yale class and an amazing opportunity to learn from one of the most accomplished scholars in the academic world. Also the material is fascinating and not really covered in any other class at Yale.",
    "Snyder is overrated as a professor. His lectures jumped all over the place and had a lot of unnecessary fluff. His books are good but he sets way to much reading that no sane person would get through with a normal course load. The grading is fair and the topics are interesting, so take it if you want to learn more about the topic, but I wouldn't rank it among the upper echelons of Yale courses.",
    "Take this class if you want to hear someone deliver a lecture in speech format every day. Beware that there are no slides and Snyder just talks throughout the lecture vaguely following an outline. No computers allowed so be prepared to write a lot. If you're taking this credit-D readings are not essentially, but most are compelling and interesting. If you show up to class, study and go to section you'll be fine.",
    "HIST 264 is really an amazing class. Eastern Europe is such a fascinating yet under-studied part of the world, and Snyder is the best lecturer to take you through it. It's just three tests and a lot of reading, but no essays or other large assignments. I would recommend it for anyone - it's a really accessible yet interesting history lecture.",
    "If you find political and military history interesting, take this class. I didn't plan on taking it but one lecture and I was hooked. Also, very little work.",
    "A great class overall! I learned so much about Eastern Europe and now feel like I have a much deeper understanding of WWII and the Cold War from a non-American perspective. The class seems super intense at first but if you come to lecture and study hard for the exams, you are almost guaranteed an A. The grading of the exams is pretty lenient, and the exam itself isn't hard. Don't be intimidated by the crazy history majors who already seem to have a ton of background knowledge or somehow have time to do all the readings. You don't have to have either of those things to do well in the class! I see this as a great thing because I hate classes that advertise themselves to non-majors but then screw over the non-majors in terms of grading. This class does not do that at all--it is a great way for non-majors (like me) to take an interesting history class with a rockstar in the field without hurting your GPA. I started it Cr\/D and ended up converting it to a grade when I realized how chill the grading was. Would definitely recommend the class!",
    "Really interesting lecture by one of Yale's foremost historians. But in section we didn't spend much time talking about the reading. It was nice in some ways that we only had 2 short exams and a quiz, but with no written assignments I'm not sure how much students really get out of this course intellectually. Definitely worth taking though- it's a fascinating course with a pretty light workload.",
    "This is the best lecture at Yale. The material is not only very interesting but is presented by what is probably the most engaging professor at this school. The work is quite manageable. You won't regret taking this class",
    "Basic intro to Eastern Europe from World War 1 to the present. And I don't mean basic in a bad way. I mean it really gives you the tools to understand this part of the world in this crucial century.",
    "This class was HARD for me as a non history, non humanities person. But Snyder is a GENIUS. Still don't know if I \"Credit\"ed or \"D\"ed, but I REGRET NOTHING. SNYDER IS AMAZING.",
    "An amazing course--a must-take and one of the best at Yale. The course explores an often ignored or belittled part of history and tells a nuanced story of the difficult and convoluted past (and present) of Eastern Europe. The course definitely broadens your perspective on the region, but also deepens and enhances your understanding of common historic events such as WW1, WW2, the Cold War, etc., by providing accounts and information from non-traditional sources.",
    "This is a good class, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. What Professor Snyder doesn't know about Eastern Europe probably isn't worth knowing, but be warned that the lectures are extremely dense and often difficult to follow.",
    "Definitely. Fascinating material, excellent lectures. It's a classic.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Amazing lecture, engaging discussion sections, and such an interesting topic. There is a tendency to think that you know a lot of what happened in the 20th century from other history courses but this shatters that perception entirely. Learned a ton and covered a lot of new territory that I had never been exposed to.",
    "I took this class after taking Cold War, wanting to learn more about the same time period from the perspective of the Eastern European countries and hoping to come out of the class with an understanding of life under the Soviet regime. While I learned a lot of political history about the various Eastern European nations, I don't think I got what I wanted from the class. It was also frustrating in many ways: especially in the second half of the course, we jumped all over the place and it was hard to find a cohesive structure. The readings are dense (in some cases, inaccessibly so) and hefty. Professor Snyder is clearly an, if not the, expert on this topic. His depth and breadth of knowledge is impressive and comes through in the course, but sometimes does so more in snarky asides and comments that imply a distinct sense of intellectual superiority rather than in a genuine transfer of knowledge between the professor and the students. I thought it was inappropriate that he asked the students in the course to purchase two of his own books as well as one of his wife's. I was also somewhat offended by the number of days of lecture that Professor Snyder missed. I understand that he has other obligations, but I signed up to take this class in large part because of his knowledge and prominence, so I was a little surprised that he missed six days of class, instead sending substitutes or recording video lectures. Overall, I'm not sure that I'd recommend it. If you're interested in the topic, you'll definitely learn more, but you might find yourself dragging through parts of it.",
    "Fantastic class. Lectures are engaging, Tim Snyder is a great speaker, and the exams are straight forward. There are a lot of readings, but you really don't have to do them all (though I do really want to go back and do some of the ones I missed now, because they are really good). A great humanities class for a STEM major.",
    "Take it if you are somewhat interested in European history. Or if you just want to take a really good class.",
    "This is the best class I've taken yet!!!! Absolutely take this course!!!!",
    "A must take no matter your major",
    "Definitely! This is one of the best history classes I've had at Yale. Take it if you're at all interested in learning about European history from a different angle.",
    "would recommend to another student.",
    "Yes!! Take this course. It is a lot of reading, but Professor Snyder's lectures are so interesting and entertaining and wonderful overall. I would also highly recommend taking HIST 263.",
    "Incredible everything, he's a treasure of Yale. Reccomend for anyone with an interest in Eastern Europe.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone interested in the big trends of 20th century Eastern Europe. A truly excellent course, with an excellent professor.",
    "HIST 264 was a great course that taught me about major developments such as the rise of Hitler and Stalin in Eastern Europe!",
    "I would recommend this class to potential history majors.",
    "This is a must take for people who are interested in history. There is a lot of material but you learn so much from the beginning to the end of the semester.",
    "Do you have any interest in political history? Then you should absolutely take this class. Even though it's a time period (particularly WWII-era) that many people already know a lot of about, you'll realize how little you know about many of the states of Eastern Europe and every lecture will blow your mind and reshape how you think about history and politics. It can be a depressing topic - you cover some of the darkest moments of the world's history - but Timothy Snyder is such a gifted and brilliant lecturer that you will not regret for a second that you took this class.",
    "Only take this class if you are actually interested in Eastern Europe and are prepared to do a lot of reading and self-teaching. Snyder runs through content so quickly it is extremely difficult to keep up. Overall enjoyable, but not as amazing as people made it out to be.",
    "Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer, and this class should be taken by any Yale student, even without the accompanying lecture covering Eastern Europe to 1914. The material is heavy, and some of the readings (which are not covered heavily in exams or in some sections, depending on your TA) are hard to get through, but Professor Snyder handles it as best as it could be handled - professionally. There is a level of detachment necessary in this class, and a focus on the historicization of events like the Holocaust (i.e. how could a thing like this occur), but these things are touched on without ever forgetting the horror caused by it, the atrocities committed, or the failure to respond immediately by the West. Take this class - it is fairly easy and incredibly straightforward, but even just going to the lectures will give you such a strong appreciation for the past, and even the present struggles of the UN and in Ukraine.",
    "I would highly, highly, highly recommend this class to any Yale fellow student, whether or not he or she is a fellow history major.",
    "BEST HISTORY CLASS AT YALE. Snyder is amazing, even if you don't take this class you should go and listen to his incredible lectures, it's like watching a movie in a theater.",
    "HIST 264 is a course that explores the history of eastern europe starting from 1914, and moving all the way up to 2014. In the course of 100 years, eastern europe undergoes massive changes that reflect the wider world around it. The revolutions and counterrevolutions, as well as economic, and social trends within the area of study are a microcosm of the world as a whole, and the politics of the world, often plays out most dramatically in eastern europe. As a whole, the course is excellent for both history majors, and those with an interest in history. It is both accessible and engaging to those with an interest, and is detailed and in-depth for majors. I would highly recommend taking this course.",
    "HIST264 is a crash course on modern Eastern European history, as taught by an excellent lecturer and more than competent TAs. The lessons it makes on nationhood, the right to authority, and politics in general can be widely applied but the framework it chooses sets the scene perfectly. It may not change your worldview, it may not alter your perspective, but this class will permanently inform your understanding of some of the most brutal regimes in history, and how they still affect us today.",
    "The course is considered to be one of the best history classes at Yale. I didnt feel that at all. Strengths: The course has the world-famous Eastern Europe expert, Timothy Snyder. The material and readings can be quite interesting and offer an appropriate combination of literature, political analyses and primary source material. You also read a bit of original translated Eastern Europe written works. Section and section discussions can be fascinating and entertaining. Weaknesses: Many Yale students love the lectures. But I think most Yale students are just wooed by good public speaking. The lectures are honestly very poor and have fundamental educational problems: (1) The lectures have no structure or order. They are complete and absolute chaos most of the time. I think the mark of a brilliant professor is to structure and organize the material in an enlightened way: students leave with frameworks in their mind and are able to intelligently discuss overwhelming amount of material with other people. If a professor doesnt structure his thoughts, the class has no added value. I could just read the books and get the same information! (2) Professor Snyder just comes in and wings it. He has a few sheets of reference notes which he uses to speak super fast about a bunch of different, complicated material. One second, he is in Prague 1923 and another second he is in Bucharest 1977. (3) You are strictly not allowed to use electronic gadgets to take notes which adds to the frustration of his speaking speed and chaotic teaching. (4) He uses no slides. Although this can be ok, it really isnt in this class. The class is a blackbox in terms of material (there is too much and you need to choose what to learn) but Snyder teaches whatever he feels like teaching that day and its impossible to follow fully. For half of the term, I couldnt even hear what he was saying because he wouldnt use a microphone. Good public speaking is not enough to make a good lecture (although it is a critical component) and as usual, I think Yale professors need to be educated in the art\/science of education before they can educate. PhDs are not indicators of teaching ability. The lecture handouts are also utter and useless chaos. There is a random list of people on the handout, from a poet in Austria in the 1920s to the name of the treaty between Russia and Ukraine in 1660 to a Polish far-right nationalist in the 1970s. He doesnt follow the handouts trajectory at all and most are just used for ID memorization. There is too much reading. It is pointless. There were weeks when we had to read a 400-page book for Tuesday and a another 150 pages for Thursday. It is simply impossible and I think almost no one does all of the readings. Professors should not be in the business of giving a lot of reading in the hope that some of it would be done. I am certain the TAs and professor know the reading problem well and they actively ignore it. The map quiz was an insult to our intelligence. Many people are weak at geography but youre just catering to the weakness if you give such an easy map quiz. The exam duration (esp. For the midterm) is too short. We are expected to write substantial essays in ~30 minutes and we are graded on the criteria that we have a strong central argument and evidence. However, it is hard enough to write a paper well from home. To ask us to write a good essay in that time is counter-productive, un-educational and any product would not be a true representation of our abilities. How to improve: -Professor Snyder should either allow electronic devices or add slides (with some structure) or improve his handouts or prepare more for his lectures or slow down and engage the classroom -Reduce the amount of readings to the important material everyone is rightfully expected to read -Increase the exam time for the midterm and final --Reduce Section participation grade (20%) It breeds unhealthy competition and a war to contribute"
