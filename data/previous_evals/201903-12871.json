   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Everything I need for life. Nah but actually it doesn't just teach ecology, plant ID, geology, and art - it teaches you how to think about the natural world and really just to question everything presented to you analytically. Great teacher and great group of people.",
    "I never thought I would say it, but this class completely transformed the way I think, reminding me how to understand the natural world that I have forgotten. I will never see any forest the same way!",
    "I learned a broad range of information about the natural history of New England, including tree identification, geologic history, and land use history. I gained insight into the many factors that can affect a landscape.",
    "How to assess a site, how to identify popular trees in New England, how to view landscapes from historical perspectives.",
    "I developed various skills relating to botany and dendrology. However, most importantly, I learned to appreciate the natural environment around me and understand networks of ecology that I had no idea existed before.",
    "My entire worldview has changed. Everything around me seems infinitely more dynamic and beautiful. I now see the world around me as something to be appreciated and learned from rather than exploited and ignored.",
    "This course changed how I view nature. I learned how to identify some trees and plants in the region, how to assess soils and topography, and perhaps more importantly, how to think about natural history in broader terms. We all learned how to think of a region's past land use history and how\/why it came to be like the forest it currently is. I didn't anticipate this going into the course, but I also gained an appreciation for things like natural history collections and artists that deal with natural history. The course was very broad, but that made each class different and exciting.",
    "I had no idea learning this much was even possible in one semester. We learned everything from tree identification to landscape interpretation to even nature in art. This class will really open your eyes when it comes to the natural environment around Yale.",
    "I developed a broad overview of plant ecology, also learning how to identify twenty of the most common New England tree species. Beyond these practical field skills, I left this course as a more observant human being both in nature and in forming connections between human history and natural history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's the best",
    "The course is a high time commitment, but it's definitely worth it. It's a good introduction to natural history.",
    "Strengths - it is so fun! We go on so many field trips, you bond with your classmates, and you learn so much along the way. I feel like now, when I enter a site in the forest or simply walk down the street, I view the landscape in an entirely different way because of all that I've learned in this class. Also, Marlyse and Julia are the absolute best! Weaknesses - None",
    "A major strength was the series of extremely interesting lesson plans. The class would take field trips nearly every class and actually learn from nature as opposed to a textbook. A weakness might have been the confusing syllabus\/assignment due dates (this was fixed very early, however).",
    "The class was structured very well.",
    "This course is awesome because each week you get to go somewhere new and learn about a new topic. I always greatly looked forwards to Thursday afternoons, and each class I feel like I gained a newfound appreciation for something that was previously hidden in plain sight. Natural history is such a broad subject, and Marlyse and Julia are so knowledgeable and willing to answer questions. I really appreciated how they connected topics in the course to relevant social issues. An important part of the course was the weekly journals at our places in the woods. This journaling was enjoyable and relaxing, but I think it could be altered. I think it would be cool to have a new site assigned to us each week where we could practice or observe what we had learned in class on our own. Perhaps this would defeat the purpose of doing our observations about changes in time, but I feel like it would be nice to deepen my understanding of the concepts we talked about in the course by practicing at a relevant site.",
    "I'd say the only real downside to this course would be that there are so many cool field trips planned but logistics and scheduling make it difficult to actually follow through with every single one. Other than this, the course was extremely well organized and ensured that we covered all aspects of the New England Forest through different engaging lessons in the field every week. The way the class revolved around tangible observations makes the lessons applicable in everyday life and resulted in students knowledgeable about the trees and landmarks they see simply walking down a city street or a park.",
    "Strengths: The main strength of this course comes from the structure and focus of being an outdoor, field-based class. Field-based learning gave me the chance to see, study, and practice analyzing real examples of the types of forest succession that we studied in the readings. It could be improved with more clear expectations of readings and question submissions in the first half of the class. Once we used the canvas calendar to view when assignments needed to be completed, the expectations became much clearer. However, it would be helpful to have this schedule up on Canvas starting at the beginning of the semester rather than one-third of the way into the semester. Also, it should be a science credit! I engaged with biology and ecology in a more intense manner than my high school classes, and it supplemented a lot of my knowledge from previous environmental classes."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, 40000%. The class is such a squad and there truly are no other classes like this one.",
    "EVST 007 is one of those only-at-Yale niche, transformative classes that every student should take. For those curious about the world around them, this class offers a transformative experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I would recommend it more strongly to students from somewhere other than New England, but I think it could be beneficial to anyone who wants to take it.",
    "YES! If you want to take a class completely different than any other you'd find at Yale, if you want to leave Yale's campus for a bit every week, if you want to change the way you view the world, then yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student - it taught me so much about the natural world and the knowledge that can stem from seemingly simple observations.",
    "Yes! It teaches you so much about the world, and the professors and students who take the class are all incredibly bright, friendly, and collaborative.",
    "Yes. It's a dynamic and interesting class with excellent teachers. I learned about things that I have never even thought about before. You also get to go outside, which isn't something that happens with many other first year classes.",
    "Do yourself a favor and please take this class, even if you're not interested in a major related to the environment. The lessons you learn in this class will really open your eyes to the natural history of where you'll be living for the next few years and the way its set up the class ends up a super tight knit group by the end. I can honestly say that this course was the only one I really looked forward to this semester.",
    "I would recommend any and all students with even the slightest interest in learning more about the natural world to take this class. Going to this class each week was the highlight of my first semester at Yale. Julia and Marlyse are great, and it is worth meeting them in this awesome field-based course!",
    "Yes, this course was amazing and I loved the unique outdoor learning environment."
