    "This class is God's gift to Yale students, and I waffled about whether or not to write that at the risk that Lofton would scoff at it. She doesn't want you to worship her, but it's hard not to when every class is so dynamic and interesting and makes you feel like you're getting somewhere with this whole college thing.I've been in a lot of classes where you ask a lot of questions and answer none of them. I've been in a lot of classes where you get all the answers but that leaves you with nowhere to go. Lofton's class imparts a sense that there will always be interesting work to do if you look at the world in a searching and analytical way, and she models that for you by way of her seemingly bottomless supply of energy and enthusiasm for what she does. I've never felt more rewarded for doing the work for a class - it pays off tenfold because you get to participate fully in everything Lofton is offering up.And if you're as lucky as our class was, you'll leave the class with a group of good friends who were united in a common endeavor and in the fun that we had.",
    "Absolutely. It is so engaging and so fun and you learn so much. I am absolutely a better thinker and will forever see the world differently.",
    "If you're not a religious studies major, take this class credit\/d. It's really fun, Lofton's great, and the material is interesting and enjoyable, but the grading on the assignments is tough, and it's not always clear what Lofton is looking for.",
    "If you can get in, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS. You'll look at everything with a more critical eye, be more keen to societal pressures, and have a better sense of what trends to buy into and which to just disregard.",
    "Religion and Popular Culture was quite the experience. At times it could be really frustrating, not knowing what exactly was going on or understanding what Professor Lofton was saying or how we were supposed to write our papers. But then we got to watch, read and talk about everything from Miley Cyrus to Lady Gaga to Wal Mart to Star Trek, and it was just awesome. We covered such interesting topics, and Professor Lofton is such a great and hilarious professor. Also, student presentations almost every class were a great opportunity to get insights into an even wider variety of interesting things, and having the chance to give a presentation was a lot of fun. Take this class if you get the chance- at times it will frustrate you, but you'll look forward to going to classevery week and you'll look back and miss the class and Professor Lofton once you're done",
    "This class is awesome. It's not just a class on religion; it's more of a class on critical thinking. The readings are VERY reasonable (45-60 minutes per week) and the discussion is great. The grade is based on a midterm, a final 12 page paper, and a couple small assignments. This is the best class I've ever taken at Yale, but it's no guaranteed A.",
    "This course was fantastic. It totally changes the way you will look at popular culture and religion. The readings are almost all extremely interesting; there is work involved, but it is manageable. Professor Lofton was able to assemble a really interesting group of other students so class was actually super super fun! The written work is hard; Professor Lofton does not really say what she wants from the paper until after they are due, and her grading is fairly arbitrary. She is totally there to help you along the way, though, and you get to write about really fun topics! I definitely learned more about popular culture than religion, but I would absolutely recommend the class.She is great! Super fun! SO KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT EVERYTHING! Makes the class one big family. When she speaks, you just want to soak up every word of wisdom that comes out. Very there for you during open hours. Again, the grading is frustrating in that I still don't know what she wants from anything, but I am so happy to now know Professor Lofton.",
    "If you have an interest in the material, you should definitely take this class. You will learn a lot and laugh a lot. Professor Lofton is a little intimidating at first but the advice a friend of mine gave me when I came to him feeling frustrated is very sound I think: \"That's just the way she is. If she fights with you, fight back.\" Once you do, you'll find class to be pure fun (in a really intellectual way; this isn't an easy course).",
    "Thisis a great way to get exposed to the art of the cultural critique. You will learn a lot about religion and popular culture, but since the class centers around the examination and analysis of specific cultural artifacts (like Miley Cyrus videos, professional wrestling, etc.) you won't come away with broad understandings of religion\/pop culture necessarily. This is by no means a drawback to the class because what you do come away with is an incredible ability to engage in a discussion about what these artifacts mean for who we are now. Through a series of short analytic reviews that culminate in a longer article-style essay, you will figure out how to craft cultural critiques (think Slate or places like that). The class discussions are almost without exception incredibly interesting and engaging, and Professor Lofton creates such an informal but focused atmosphere that you'll constantly be laughing even as you dig through concepts like \"ritual\" and \"catharsis\" in culture. The reading increases as the semester goes on, and by the end it's a fair amount between each class, but the readings are always great and generally not very dense even if they are sometimes lengthy.",
    "This course is wonderful. Professor Lofton is an outstanding professor. You have to do the reading to understand and appreciate the course, but there's not much of it.",
    "Just take it. This class will change you.The workload is only greater because, and I'm not lying, you will find yourself wanting to spend extra time on the reading\/work for this class. Everything we discussed was just so engaging and relevant to how we interact with the world on a daily basis. Religion doesn't just hide away in churches and prayer meetings - it's everywhere. This class will help you see the religious components of Miley Cyrus, Balinese Cockfighting, Baseball, and Elvis. Religion is even nestled between the folds of Lady Gaga's meat dress. Conversely, pop culture is a staple of contemporary religion, which is just as interesting to learn about.",
    "Take this course. It's not easy - the seminar moves at a very fast pace, and the writing assignments, while short, take work - but definitely worthwhile. This isn't the sort of class that you leave with a tidy set of knowledge gained, but rather it seeks to develop your skills as a cultural critic through examination of the intersection between popular culture and religion. Professor Lofton is fantastic, the readings are fun -- seriously, take this course.",
    "You\u0092ll practice cultural criticism, read some fascinating stuff, analyze YouTube videos, and spend time with Kathryn Lofton for a few hours a week. In other words: a class worth taking.",
    "if you're willing to do ALL of the reading and actually be engaged in seminar discussions twice a week, sure. one of the better classes i've had at yale, but it's not as easy as the pop culture bit of the title might suggest. however, the readings etc were a lot better than a dry old history course or something."
