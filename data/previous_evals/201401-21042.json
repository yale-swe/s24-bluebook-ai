    "Yes! Definitely take this class if you want to learn more about all aspects of the Homeric tradition.",
    "This is a great course on the Iliad. Professor Bakker is an amazing teacher of the Iliad. I would recommend this course to anyone with a background and interest in ancient Greek.",
    "A truly truly incredible class. This is really a class about analyzing language: syntax, morphology, prosody. But that by no means should be taken to mean that you don't get into philosophical questions surrounding the text; you just do so in a very different way. Being exposed to Professor Bakker's style of reading restored my conviction that close reading can get at meaning actually in texts. This class is always first and foremost about the language; the meaning follows naturally on the rigorous study of words and syntactical structures.The close reading you do is close reading on steroids: it never feels forced; it always feels significant. The class has a fair amount of reading, but definitely not unreasonable (my Greek is not great and I had no problem keeping up); once you get into the groove, you can actually read Homer quite quickly. Both exams were very fair. The final project is a commentary on 15-30 lines, which is pretty neat. In class, you take turns translating; it's a really nice seminar environment. (Some evaluations from earlier years warn against taking this as your first L5 class, but it's really totally fine). Homer is like nothing else I have ever read and deserves at least some of the credit for why this class is so wonderful, but the other half of the equation is Professor Bakker, who is simply extraordinary. Professor Bakker makes Greek grammar feel intuitive. He seems so deeply at home with it, that by the end of the semester it's hard to avoid internalizing the conviction that it is neither rigid nor random, but deeply poetical and totally internally consistent. I can't imagine a better class to sell one on how special the experience of reading Greek texts in the original is. It's hard to pinpoint to what extent this has to do with Professor Bakker, Homer, or the class itself, but I found taking it to be a very very special experience. It sort of breaks my heart that it's over. If it is offered, take it; take it. Take it. I almost didn't and my semester would have been so much less interesting. If you are going to have FOMO about something, have FOMO about this class. Or just take it.",
    "If you like reading Greek, at all, you'd be doing yourself a disservice not to take this class. Reading Homer is hands-down incredible, and there's no one better than Professor Bakker to do it with. For the most part, the class is focused very closely on language and meter, though we did spend some time reading Homeric scholarship. We read about 200-300 lines a week; it was challenging but manageable, and by the end of the semester my fluency in reading had improved by leaps and bounds. The final project, a commentary on a short passage, was a great exercise and really rewarding."
