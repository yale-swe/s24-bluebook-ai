   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course is that it gives students a chance to program more than they may normally program if they are not computer science majors. The weaknesses of the course are 1) the lectures are pretty terrible because the professor rambles on about unrelated things so students don't learn much, 2) the professor was late to every class, which sends the message that his class is not important to him, and thus, it was not very important to the students, 3) there are only 3 assignments for the entire semester, one of which has already been solved online in multiple different ways, so students are not really challenged intellectually, and 4) the grading system was horrible. Students received a 50 or 100 and nothing in between. Either the code worked or it didn't and no homework solutions were posted so this style of grading did not facilitate any learning for the students.",
    "Lectures were useless. TA was quite helpful. Professor was out of touch with the students and their diversity.",
    "This course is great as it is - the psets are challenging but fun",
    "More structure to the course material would facilitate learning",
    "More structure is necessary for this course to improve. Rokhlin is a genius, but not a great teacher."

   "comments": [
    "If a student is interested in earning an easy A without having to go to class, then sure, I would recommend this class to them. If a student is hoping to learn anything, I would not recommend the course. I'm honestly surprised that the professor is allowed to keep teaching this course. It's the worst, most unorganized class I have ever taken at Yale in my four years and the professor and TA both seemed like they did not care about the class at all.",
    "Very low workload, but interesting homework. Homework is doable without attendance. If you do attend class and ask questions however, you have the opportunity to learn from a very distinguished researcher",
    "Take it if you want an easy computer science course. Some interesting material but overall very low workload."
