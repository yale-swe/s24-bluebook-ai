   "comments": [
    "While professor Bruegemann's lectures are a bit dry and repetitive, his dedication to the class surpasses anything I would expect out of a Yale professor. He spends much of his time constantly adding supplementary material online, most of which are reasonably interesting if you bother to take the time to at least skim it. However, if you are not interested in economics enough to major in it, you will probably not be interested in macroeconomics.",
    "Yes, important to be able to think about macroeconomy",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in economics. This course is not as math based as micro. It is more focused only on the relationship between individual variables in different models. This class also really helps us to see how different models can show that different things will happen in our national economics. It becomes really interesting to be able to evaluate different models used in making predictions about the future of our economy.",
    "This class studies different models of the macroeconomy. I would not recommend it for someone not considering majoring in economics - the models are fairly boring and do not immediately explain what is happening in the world.",
    "I would recommend it for someone in the Economics major but not for non-economics majors.",
    "Bruegemann's macro is really good. His notes are very helpful and the tests\/psets are very fair. Also, the professor is very approachable, something you don't see with Nordhaus' course. Overall, its a great way to get a core course out of the way.",
    "Hard, boring, and horrible. Take it if you are an econ major, otherwise stay far away from this course.",
    "Only take it if you are econ major, otherwise its sort of a waste of time because you grasp the concepts of macro economics in intro already.",
    "It was very detailed and very thorough, which is great. But lecture was often very dry because of this and i wish it was more clear what textbook material was irrelevant so I didn't waste my time reading everything. Problem sets were often killer and could take upwards of 8 hours. Do take this course though if you want a strong micro foundation for all the macro theory you do.",
    "Yes, perhaps because recessions are just really awful and it'd be nice to have people know how the economy works before they find themselves in positions of authority where such information is vital and has huge ramifications.",
    "Yes. I mean you have to take it if you're an Econ major. And if you don't have time to take it with Nordhaus in fall then this is your only option and it's a good one.",
    "For an econ major, this course is a solid grounding in macroeconomic modeling without hardly any math(derivatives must be taken, but you're usually walked through the process). Problem sets don't take that much time and the tests are straightforward (if you study :D). I, however, am not an econ major, and took the class because I wanted to learn macroeconomic theory apart from a whole bunch of formal math. Because this class seemed designed to give econ majors a solid (read, sometimes tedious) foundation for further study of the macroeconomy, I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone in my situation. The semester is basically spent building up to ~2 monolithic models of the domestic economy. International trade, wealth inequality, etc is not covered. Objectively, however, this class does very well exactly what it sets out to do. Prof. Bruegemann is pretty nifty, in particular. Just don't take this as a random So credit.",
    "Its alot easier than macro, and I can't imagine Nordhaus is THAT much better than Bjoern. Lectures were are VERY dry, and it was difficult to deduce what the important information was from day to day. However, model summaries are posted before each test and are extremely helpful. The problem sets were very good in terms of being an appropriate level of difficulty.",
    "If you are an econ major you obviously have to take this.",
    "Yes. It is quite good.",
    "This is a terrible, terrible class that you will have to take if you are an Econ major. There is nothing you can do. Accept your fate.",
    "It's a core class for the major, but I wouldn't take it otherwise.",
    "This class is not the most engaging one you will take at Yale but you certainly do learn the material. Prof. Bruegemann goes a bit slow but he is pretty thorough when it comes to explanations. The psets are pretty long and at times tricky so don't save them for the night before. It is also much smaller than the fall Intermediate Macroeconomics lecture if that matters to you.",
    "Overall, I would highly recommend ECON 122. It really taught the basics of the macro economy and provided the framework behind which to build and analyze models. The course was not too much work and was truly a pleasure to be a part of. Again, although this course is a must for econ majors, I still recommend it too anyone wishing to learn a bit more about how our economy works.",
    "Take it with Nordhaus in the fall.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. There are better courses at Yale and while I do think it improved my understanding of how the economy of a country works, I think what I learned could have been taken in in a shorter time span. I.e. technical details could have been left out and replaced with more real world exampels. Also the psets are hard, and take long. Most lectures are not worth attending, especially as they took place at 9am and I regularly could not help dosing off..",
    "This is a basic intermediate economics course, as advertised. I imagine you would probably be better off taking it in the fall."
