    "This class was fun! Regardless of your background you will learn a lot about both linguistics and literature\u0097the ways they intersect are really pretty cool, and there's a lot of room to explore the aspects of each that interest you.",
    "ENGL 284 combines linguistic and literary academic study ranging from African American dialect to Miltonic syntax and Henry IV to In Transit (by Brigid Brophy). Take it!This course serves as a model for interdisciplinary study. Its strengths include balancing literary and linguistic perspectives in looking at interesting and influential prose and pose. It successfully pushed all students to think in ways that they had not before. Though it was surprisingly fruitful to combine linguistic and literary study, the professors were honest and forthcoming\u0097they were excited when analysis was productive, but they never forced meaning or pushed an idea for the sake of having one. I really enjoyed how the class spanned across such a large literary time frame and linguistic concepts while managing not to simply \"just scratch at the surface,\" which is easy and natural for a class with a lot of information cover. I also like how it gave its students a lot of choice and self-determination in what to pursue in studying and writing up the assignments.The work load is very manageable and it is well designed\u0097you truly learn and grow with each assignment. There is a medium amount to a lot of reading, but it is also gratifying.",
    "Having never taken a linguistics course, it was an interesting introduction to what the discipline is about and a couple different subjects. The readings are decent and not too much. For whatever reason, most of the people in the class never did them, and that's where our class was weakest. The discussion quality wasn't that great. If the class dynamic had been better, I think the class would've been very good, so worth checking out, especially if you haven't taken any linguistics and want to learn a little.",
    "Yes! This is an absolutely wonderful, low-stress course, where you get to study some really fascinating issues and then read some great books. I enjoyed it tremendously.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with some Linguistics background and an interest in understanding or thinking about how literature and linguistics overlap. There is a good deal of reading, so only take it if you are prepared to spend some time with the texts.",
    "I would highly recommend it! It's a great class, with manageable reading and workload. The texts you read are a great group, and most of them classics.",
    "Basically, the dream course for students who are interested in both subjects, especially in the intersection of the subjects. We covered a lot of linguistic concepts, but we also went in-depth with literary analysis. I felt the integration was successful, and the professors were excellent. The course was constantly intriguing, always enjoyable, perfect."
