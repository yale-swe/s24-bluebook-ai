    "Terrific class great instruction",
    "Class atmosphere and opportunities for participation and discussion were great. Very valuable course for anyone who plans to work in land conservation\/management in the intermountain west and the southeast.",
    "1. Some reading materials were missing from the classes website.3. Presentations would have worked better with a smaller class. With a class the size of ours one presentation would have been sufficient, and would have prevented us from extended classes into reading week.6. The pace of the class was just right for the first half of the semester when the science of fire was the focus. During the second half the pace slowed and topics weren't as well covered. Euromi, Bruce Keleman, Stella and Tom were good speakers, but the CT-based speaker wasn't very good. Would have preferred lectures instead of the movies shown (was hard to hear during one of them because people, including the TA, kept talking throughout).",
    "Question 2: Ann is one of my favorite teachers at FES. She is very enthusiastic and encourages the class to participate. She always makes time for our questions."

    "Ann is an extremely open engaging professor. Very excited about the subject matter and willing to dedicate lots of time to answering questions.",
    "Ann Camp",
    "discussing controversial\/current issues regarding fire policy and management",
    "The course is very applicable to on-the-ground work, though it covers theoretical aspects well too. Many of my classes rely too much on theory and scientific papers, while this class gave me more \"real life\" skills.",
    "Relevance to my intended research. Subject material is fascinating. S-130\/S-190 supplemental course (rate of learning during it was incredibe and it complemented what was happening in the normal class very well).Coverage of the science of fire.Professor's interest and passion for the topic.",
    "The team dynamic between the TA (Matt) and Ann. They worked well together and complimented each other's knowledge and experience in the subject.Good opportunities for class discussion added alot to the class as well."

    "Multiple choice on midterm was confusing.Presentation\/paper schedule needs to be re-evaluated.As indicated in Question 11, the structure\/material of the second half of the course could be improved.Professor could be better prepared to deliver the lecture (minimize the amount of reading directly from the Powerpoint slides).",
    "Could be taught with a bit more organization.The end of the course sort of tapered off without real clear direction, content, or organization. It would have been nice to have more content added to the final sections of the class."

Knew that the professor had a lot of experience with the topic.I think that fire will be an increasingly important and powerful disturbance as climate change progresses.Because a smoker jumper was the TA! (JUST KIDDING!)",
