    "English 114 was extremely helpful, and is a course all incoming students who are not confident with their writing should take.",
    "English 114 is a great way to get your writing up to speed. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a serious literary analysis course because it is primarily about writing construction. Also, you might get a little sick of the word \"beauty\" after a certain point. Overall though, a fun course that involves lots of looking at art and lovely things.",
    "I would recommend this class for sure. It is taught well and extremely helpful in terms of increasing one's writing ability. It is also extremely interesting and fun.",
    "Great class for getting your writing to a college level. I would recommend it."
