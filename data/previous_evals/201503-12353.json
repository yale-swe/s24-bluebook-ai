   "comments": [
    "Math 112 teaches you AP CALC AB. I recommend it because it was a relatively easy class, but helped me brush up on old topics that I forgot about.",
    "Yes, if you put in the work it isnt that bad at all.",
    "It is a basic into math class",
    "If you have a shaky foundation in calculus or are unsure of how prepared you are for math at Yale, this is the place to start. It will make sure you have a solid basis of knowledge moving forward into 115 or 120.",
    "This course teaches you the basics of calculus and gives you tools to go further. Even if you are generally not a math person, this course is still essential to you knowing the world and how it works.",
    "I would recommend it. I liked it.",
    "Hard, but rewarding",
    "It was a challenging class for me specially since I came from a very poor math background. If you find yourself in the same situation as me, I'd recommend you to think twice or three times before taking the class. If you don't need it for your major, avoid taking it at all costs.",
    "I would summarize Math 112 as a course that becomes increasingly difficult as the semester passes. At the beginning, the course is easier; but, the content quickly becomes more difficult. I would recommend the class, especially since its an essential prerequisite, but I would suggest that future students utilize the textbook and their professor to do well.",
    "I would recommend Math 112 to students who have a solid pre-calculus background. At times it was intimidating to have students who already had taken calculus before in the class because they would already understand the material and the instructor thought we all did. The class is quite challenging if you have taken calculus before but the workload is not too much.",
    "Everyone should take math, a beneficial QR, but 112 01 is a bit early in the morning and is also pretty boring",
    "Take this class. Kind of necessary but if you can take it with Dylan Allegretti, you should. He's great. Go to review sessions, take many practice tests. It is a very fair class. You will learn a lot and the instructors are very approachable."
