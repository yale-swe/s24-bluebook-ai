    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you think you know nothing about the Caribbean, this class will give you a great foundation in the history and politics, along with a forum for really interesting and passionate discussions.",
    "Take it if your interested in the Caribbean. Great and not too much reading. Really knowledgable Professor.",
    "If you think you'll love this class you probably will. I did. Anthony Reed knows so much about Caribbean poetry, and if you have any interest in Latin American or Caribbean literature, definitely don't miss out on this class. That said, it was my most challenging this semester. Even though it's only once a week and one long paper for the whole semester, discussion was REALLY challenging, and Professor Reed is not afraid to shoot down (well, maybe not shoot down, but disagree openly) with your contributions. People take the weekly blog posts REALLY seriously, and tend to write at least 600 words when only 250 are required. This was a serious pain. There were only 6 of us in the class, including 3 seniors-- 2 of whom were English majors-- so expect to be in the company of people who know their Derrida, Hegel, Milton, what have you. I'm not sure how harsh of a grader Professor Reed is, but I imagine it's pretty hard to get an A from him.Most of all, though, some of the books we read are really incredible, and it's a shame that they are absent in most English lit classes. The contemporary poetry toward the end is kind of new age and bizarre, but so worth it.Take it, but expect to be challenged.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to read a lot of Caribbean poetry without too much of a workload. The texts are well-chosen, and the professor is very likable. The discussions in class are, for better or for worse, what you make them."
