    "A pretty chill lab course overall. The first few labs with Wyman are torture, but don't let him scare you off. The later labs are really cool (e.g. messing around with the frog NMJ) and it does help with understanding the concepts taught in lecture. One of the easier options for fulfilling the bio lab requirement.",
    "Neurobiology lab was probably the most well-taught and engaging lab course that I've taken at Yale. The experiments are fun and interesting, and they all tie in exactly to what has been taught in lecture at the time. The way that lab reports and notebooks are graded really should be an example to other lab courses in that it encourages critical analysis of the data as it was obtained and your ability to ask questions and draw conclusions from what was observed in an experiment. All of the professors and TAs did an amazing job of helping out during the experiments and explaining things. One warning though - it has a tendency to run to 6 or 6:30, so be sure to plan around that accordingly.",
    "I think this was an excellent lab course. It really helped bring to life the material that was being learned in class. The instructors were very willing to help explain the concepts that were being studied and were really excited about the information that was being taught. One of the things to note, is that this lab often does run long, but so it really means a lot to have a good lab partner or a good lab group. Try to have fund with what you're doing, and the time will pass much much more quickly. There's a lot of cutting into animals and putting probes in their eyes, so be weary if that really isn't your thing. But a pretty cool lab overall.",
    "Great lab class, highly recommended. Can be a little helpful with the class, but a lot of the stuff in the lab is generally supplementing the class, not necessarily going over any of the major topics in the class. Nevertheless, very chill lab that is pretty easy compared to the class it's paired to. Lab report for every class that has a 2 page maximum limit double spaced so yeah, not bad at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this lab if you're taking neurobio - it makes the material covered in lecture make so much more sense and the labs we did were not only interesting but also fun."
