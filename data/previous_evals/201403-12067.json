   "comments": [
    "If you are a heritage Russian speaker and would like a formal introduction to Russian grammar and composition, this is probably the best class available.",
    "I would recommend this class to any heritage Russian speaker who knows how to speak Russian fluently, and speaks it at home, but wants to improve their reading and writing ability. It is really cool to read the Russian literature your parents always talked about and to understand how remarkable the language is-- to really feel its power! It is also cool to learn how to write formal literature essays in Russian rather than just birthday cards for babushka. Also, the grading is SUPER lenient and the assignments are fair. Overall fun, but could be disorganized\/frustrating sometimes due to lack of structure.",
    "A great course (and really the only course) for a heritage speaker of Russian who knows how to speak but not necessarily how to read or write. We did a lot of helpful grammar exercises, worked on tricky spelling rules, and got to read two short stories (Pushkin and Chekhov). The one thing it is important to keep in mind is that the experience of this course changes based on how good your grammar is coming in -- for me, I had no writing schools and sparse reading skills at the beginning, so it was a lot of work for me to get to a comfortable point when we had almost instantly been expected to read and write. Julia is very understanding and evaluates us based on improvement, though, so I would not let that stop you from taking the course!",
    "RUSS 122 is an overview class geared toward students who can speak the Russian language, but have had limited formal education in it. The course starts with an introduction to the alphabet, basic spelling skills and progresses to more higher-level grammar. Throughout the semester, students also read two works of Russian fiction and prepare a formal presentation for the class on a topic of their choice. I would recommend this class to Russian-American students deeply committed to bettering their language skills. The course is not easy, and students who do not intend to utilize the course to complete their language requirement should take it C\/D\/F, especially if they are less experienced in the Russian language. If you absolutely need a language credit, this is a great choice. But if you're simply looking to become better acquainted with your first language, be aware that the workload is not light and the learning curve can be potentially rather steep.",
    "Great course if you're a native Russian speaker but have never studied it formally. Students in the class start off at many different levels, and Julia understands this and tries to accommodate it. You might not come out a Chekhov, but your Russian will certainly improve, regardless of how weak (and entertaining, for your relatives) it was when you started.",
    "Yes, would recommend. Good review of Russian syntax for native speakers with some good literature as well.",
    "An overall fun course with lots of interesting material. The homework amount is standard and helps tremendously. One may have to work harder outside of class depending on their level, but Julia is a great professor.",
    "There is bi-weekly homework assignments, readings of famous Russian writers (like Chekhov and Pushkin) and a oral presentation assignment on a topic of your choosing. It is a must take class if you are a Russian speaker. the workload is manageable and the class is very fun."
