   "comments": [
    "A great course that will give you a data-driven background in issues of health equity. Academic-intensive (based on peer-reviewed papers), which was a little surprising to me, but this solid foundation will make you feel like you are picking up on key take-home lessons. Panter-Brick is a good professor and the workload is flexible.",
    "The obnoxious people in this class ruined it for me. However, the theme is important, the readings are interesting, and CPB is fantastic. If you take it, just cross your fingers that you get people who are interested in engaging conversation.",
    "I will recommend it to Juniors and Seniors who want to take an Anthropology seminar! Its a great wealth of knowledge you learn!",
    "Every week covers a different topic in health equity and health disparities. You'll have a list of readings to choose from for each week, so you can each bring different perspectives to the discussion in class. Over the course of the semester you'll write a few critical analyses on the readings for the week, which are tough at first, but are a great skill to have. Best part of the class is learning from Prof. Panter-Brick, who is just inspirational.",
    "I'd recommend the class, as it really opens your mind up to a lot of interesting and difficult questions in global health. Panter-Brick is really nice and chill and has unique experience. Though if you're looking for something very informative\/organized, this class might not be for you. It was focused on discussion, which was as good as we made it as a class.",
    "ANTH 453 is interesting and relevant to anyone interested in public health. Professor Panter-Brick is amazing and easily one of the best professors I have had in my time at Yale. The material is challenging but rewarding.",
    "ANTH 453 is an exciting course that really challenges the way you'll approach health problems. Professor Panter-Brick is extremely knowledgable and is a very interesting person to talk with. I highly recommend this course to students interested in health care and global health.",
    "Manageable weekly readings, 3 4-page critical analyses, and 1 final 10 page paper. It helps to talk to her before writing to get a feel for how she wants you to write the papers.",
    "This was a really great course in health disparities & health equity. The readings were interesting and Professor Panter-Brick is amazing! Definitely take a class with her. 3 short critical analyses and a final paper wasn't too much work either. Really glad I took this.",
    "IF YOU ARE LUCKY TO GET INTO THIS SEMINAR, TAKE IT!!! You learn so, so much and Professor Panter-Brick will change the way you study and think about global health. ANTH 453 finally gives you an in-depth lens of EQUITY to look at pressing issues, which is something that critically missing from other global health classes. We covered many themes, such as race, gender, mental health, and violence. Come to seminar prepared with the readings and the discussion will be much more rewarding.",
    "Health Disparities was an really disappointing class. We covered topics that, in theory, would be very interesting - but class discussion ended up being prof panter-brick asking us about how we felt about the different things we talked about, instead of actually leading us together as a class to actually learn constructive things about the topics. I felt like I learned very little - we had a few \"critical analyses\" that are basically memos\/reading responses, and then a final paper, and a little reading each week. It was very little work, and was an okay introduction to the topics - but it felt like we learned very little, beyond for the buzzwords in the field. Professor Panter-Brick is really nice and was happy to meet with us one on one, but just did not lead our class discussions in a productive way, or assign interesting readings. It ended up being a really disappointing class."
