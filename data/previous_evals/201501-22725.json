   "comments": [
    "I would recommend RUSS 142 to students who were raised in Russian-speaking or culturally-Russian households and would like to have formal instruction in the language. The course entails both study of grammar and composition, as well as a development of speaking skills through class discussions and short speeches.",
    "This class is the follow up to the first semester of heritage Russian. Take it if you liked the previous semester. For me personally, I felt that the pace of the spring semester was a lot slower than that of the first, but that might just be because I hadn't really read or written in Russian before this year. If you're a more advanced student that has more of a less of a solid grip on Russian grammar, I would not recommend this course, especially given that there are plenty of graduate courses you can enroll in. A lot of the class is composed of minutiae, because there are less literate learners that are exposed to the specifics of grammar for the first time.",
    "Russian 142 is a class for heritage speakers that centers around improving reading and writing skills. We read two main texts, learned grammar rules, and wrote several essays. The essays were short, never more than two pages and the readings were manageable. Russian is a difficult language to begin with, but the professor made it much less intimidating. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "It's fun, easy, you get to read Russian short stories in Russian, and it's a pretty light workload. Your grammar can also improve a lot, though grammar exercises are annoying. You'll improve your russian and make babushka happy!",
    "This is the continuation of 122, so if you liked that class, take this one! Learn more grammar, read some Chekhov and Doestoevsky (I guess this varies from year to year), and get some more practice writing. It's a bit more work than 122, and the expectations are slightly higher, but it's still very manageable.",
    "Very useful course for reinforcement of Russian grammar, a good opportunity to write in Russian when it is otherwise not really needed in this country, and another reason to read more Russian literature."
