    "It helps me understand how costume develop during different period, and knowing the basic concept of costume designing.",
    "I really loved this class. Jane and Ilona are so encouraging and gracious, while still giving really valuable constructive criticism. I have learned so much doing all the research and reading all the different plays we are assigned. I can't wait to take part b next semester!",
    "The slideshows about costume history for a specific period of time that we are studying are extremely helpful. They help to set us down the right path for our research. There was one instance in which we didn't get a chance to review the slides and when we brought in our work for the first round of critiques, it was apparent that we needed some help finding the right research for the period. The critiques in front of all the class are very valuable and what has been most valuable is having the second year directors come in every two weeks to critique our work and have a conversation about the costumes with the guidance of Jane and Ilona. That to me has been the most valuable.",
    "I think doing designs for shows as we look at the history of dress is fantastic. Doing it chronologically really helps to understand how each era influences the next."

    "It would be great to go over terms for each era a little more specifically. They are terms that would be really helpful for first week research."
