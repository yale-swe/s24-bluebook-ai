    "Yes. Good for grasping the basics of Italian language and improving understanding.",
    "Yes, the italian department is great. Everyone is very excited about teaching italian and very knowledgable.",
    "Would recommend. Amazing professor. Easy to learn.",
    "Great intro language course. All the faculty are so encouraging and helpful. Even if you aren't taking to the language as easily as other students, if you give it some effort you'll do well in the class."
