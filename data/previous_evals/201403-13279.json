   "comments": [
    "The Japanese language department at Yale always seems to have such engaging, and honestly, fun classes, and I would definitely recommend their classes in general to someone looking to learn an East Asian language.",
    "This course is demanding, as all Japanese courses are, but also worth it, like all Japanese courses. The workload can be a lot sometimes, but you see very clear gains from putting time into the class. The atmosphere is also a very unique one; it's very relaxed and much like a seminar. You can feel free to speak your opinions and class often becomes a conversation. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to continue their study of Japanese.",
    "Japn 150 will definitely help strengthen all areas of one's Japanese learning. The readings are very interesting and manageable, and the structure of the course truly helps build one skill on top of another.",
    "Like the rest of the program, a phenomenal class. My section was 6 people, which meant that everyone became friends, especially after embarrassing ourselves speaking Japanese for 225 minutes a week. I found the assignments disappointingthey were more mindless answering of questions, and I would have preferred to do more cohesive writing in essay form. The grammar was also presented so whimsically that it was hard (even in English) to imagine their use cases, much less remember them. Otherwise, the content was engaging and I felt like I grew proportional to the amount of time that I put it, which was about the amount of the average Yale class."
