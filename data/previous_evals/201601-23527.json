    "(+) practical experience, fast-paced learnings, amazing mentor in my preceptor (-) Dr. Stahl",
    "I think the project and preceptor that we are matched with are integral to the experience we have with the course since this is where majority our time is spent and what we do in terms of content. So for me, no weaknesses, but I wish the course wasn't so late on Fridays. My preceptor was present and receptive and I think we worked well together.",
    "This class provided me a great opportunity to go outside of the classroom and do a practicum in the \"real-world\" setting. I certainly learned a lot.",
    "Provides valuable firsthand industry experiences although I found I needed to proactively prod my preceptor to initiate the project and move it forward."

    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Listening to Dr. Stahl during the practicum meetings was a lesson in how NOT to be persuasive. For example: Interrupting people in the middle of their ideas to impart \"lessons.\" Every five minutes. I think Dr. Stahl has tremendous opportunity to grow as an instructor, starting with connecting better with students. We are too polite to say anything and the way he comes off to me is intimidating, paternalistic, outdated. Some suggestions are: - Connect with students on a personal level so that no one feels so awkward in class or with him - Do this by being vulnerable with us, sharing his own failures and self-knowledge instead of \"lessons\" - Make the discussions more interactive on a group level than on a one-to-one or teacher-to-class level - Use discretion in when to impart lessons. It becomes insufferable when they are long-winded and occur every five minutes - Read the subtle cues in students' body language; read the room - Change the meeting room from the Wienerman room to a room in LEPH; the space is small and the chairs are uncomfortable - Consider asking the students for feedback more often",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0He needs help managing time of the course so that we are able to finish in a timely manner.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Dr. Stahl is very responsive, and he always gave great suggestions. He also did a good job organizing the 3 meetings across the semester, facilitating learning and making sure we all learned something from each other, encouraging us to share what could be improved for our practicum experience and trying to find a way to address it.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0He provides valuable feedback on project obstacles. I appreciated getting feedback from someone with a breadth of industry experience.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Helpful and responsive"

    "Could be a helpful and productive experience if taking good initiative to get started early; the semester goes by too fast to get a late start",
    "Great practical experiences",
    "I think I would recommend this to another student but to be very sure of what experience they want to have and what they are expecting to learn at the end of the semester. Something new or just experience.",
    "Great class, especially for those who do not have a lot of real-world experience before graduate school. I highly recommend it.",
    "Valuable experience applying classroom concepts in the real world. Actual quality of your experience is heavily dependent on your particular assignment."
