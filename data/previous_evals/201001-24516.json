    "yes -- make sure you write about something you love because you will spend a huge portion of your time on this topic and so you should enjoy what you research",
    "You have to do it... I would definitely recommend a one-semester essay over a year-long one, though!",
    "You've gotta get it done! Best approach it as a chance to finally go for 'depth' after four years of courses that expose you to 'breadth'.",
    "I have no idea why you would ever write your senior essay in a class. Doing it this way is a million times better and more satisfying.",
    "Yes.",
    "The spring term essay will feel a little rushed, but is worthwhile. The year long essay seems to be completed my most students in about the same amount of time as the semester long, but requires considerably more research time."
