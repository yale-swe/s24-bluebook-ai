    "It is an interesting class that provided a great introduction to the field of disability studies through a cultural lens. I would recommend it for people who are interested in changing the way they think about disability and the value of disabled life. However, it is a lot of reading and the papers require thought and planning.",
    "Everyone should take a course in disability studies (and, seeing as Yale now only offers one course, this is it). Of course, I'm biased, given that I'm an individual with an invisible physical disability, but it is a minority population (nearly 20% of the US) that almost no one acknowledges. In a semester when I had a professor in charge of who gets into the major I'm applying to question my ability to handle the work given my physical condition, having this class felt like a safe space where no one was questioning the legitimacy of my being here or my own experience. I may never be proud of a disability that causes me pain on a daily basis, but I am overcome with an appreciation and love for the disability community, which was only cemented by this class.",
    "This class will give you a good sociological handle on disability studies, which is great. It mostly focused on disability theory, however, and doesn't have much literary analysis.",
    "Interesting class! If you at all wondered about disability while at Yale, this is the class to take. There are a lot of readings and sometimes we did not have enough time to talk about all of it in class, but many were interesting.",
    "This is a great class if you want to learn more about the disability rights movement in the US. The workload is not super heavy.",
    "This is an amazing class that should be required for all Yale students so we can all be less ignorant about the invisibility of disability in society!"
