   "comments": [
    "I learned how to use anthropological theory and modes of questioning in order to unpack the geopolitical power dynamics inherent in human rights.",
    "This course provided a unique perspective on human rights. My background is from a policy perspective, so this course was an opportunity to understand the anthropological aspects of human rights.",
    "provided interesting and wide-ranging perspective on human rights",
    "I learned about methods of thinking and research in anthropology, which was totally new to me. I learned to ask questions about authors' positionality and to think more critically about the structures (UN, NGOs, etc.) that make up the human rights world.",
    "Great course to expand your critical thinking skills. The reading assigned is diverse, challenging and interesting and gives a great introduction to anthropological literature. After this class, I believe I can successfully analyze an ethnography from a human rights perspective.",
    "This course gave me a historical and theoretical understanding of the human rights regime. Like most people, I came into the class having learned about the United Nations in a relatively dehistoricized and depoliticized manner. I knew that such a perspective was incorrect, which was mainly why I took the class--and it really payed off.",
    "This class was my first time taking an ethnographic approach to human rights disciplines that can often be very legalistic, dry, and impractical. In this intersection of human rights theory, culture, anthro theory, and history was a unique and valuable way of learning and writing about how different conceptions of \"rights\" and \"human nature\" can be useful politically and socially or, on the other hand, fraught.",
    "I learned how to think critically about human rights and how to use diverse theoretical texts, either together or independently, to understand systems & power structures. Also learned a lot about the history of human rights & how it functions in practice."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very creative and engaging syllabus!",
    "The topics of the course were very interesting, however I felt like the class could have been organized better in terms of which readings were paired with which. I found myself confused at times about how the class was supposed to build on topics discussed from week to week. Also class discussions were overall mediocre.",
    "I found the in-class aspect of the course to be very engaging with a lot of participation. Some of the weeks had a lot of reading, particularly the week with Eichmann in Jerusalem, and it was harder to engage with the material in depth. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the readings and going to class!",
    "readings were great, continuity was difficult, and class discussion was poor",
    "The presentations were a good way to get each piece that we read introduced, although I did not feel as though I had a good sense of what was expected of me in the content I should have covered and the angle I should have taken on the presentation. The workload is pretty large, and it was disappointing to me that we usually ended up discussing the pieces in pretty general terms -- we seldom zoomed in on interesting moments in the text, and if we had, I think it would have been easier to parse out an author's bias, the nuances of their argument, etc. All the readings are very interesting, and I often felt as though we didn't do them justice!",
    "Strengths: interesting reading, wide variety of class discussion Weakness: not much diversity in terms of weekly assignments (just reading responses every week)",
    "The strength of this course is that it really made students examine the structure and economy of the human rights regime. We were forced to deconstruct the general blob of \"human rights doctrine\" in our discussions, in order to understand the bureaucratic and political side of the issue. A weakness of this course is that it was very fast paced and topical. At times it felt that we were unable to fully engage with theory. Which is understandable, considering how dense much of it can be.",
    "The course was strong in that the reading list was pertinent, challenging but reasonable, and discussed in detail during each seminar. Assignments like short weekly responses and a one-time presentation kept us on top of the reading without breaking our backs mid-semester. Everybody was up to speed and engaged. Unfortunately, the seminar had its quiet\/awkward moments where people were unfamiliar with the denser corners of anthro theory that were explored. Next time, it might be a good idea to include some more rudimentary intros to the thought process\/terminology in the reading list before they get to Foucault, etc.",
    "I really liked the course--I thought the readings were great and the discussions and activities we did in class were thought-provoking, engaging, and helped me understand the readings better. In terms of improvements, I think getting feedback or a little more guidance on the reading responses, especially toward the beginning of the semester, might have been helpful in terms of being prepared for class.",
    "I think the course benefitted from having two instructors with different backgrounds."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wishing to think more critically about the issues of power, representation, language, geopolitics in human rights.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Samar and Professor Erami are great professors and very knowledgeable, however I felt like the course itself was poorly organized and I did not learn much more beyond what I already knew before I took the course.",
    "This class is a great choice if you are interested in learning about human rights from an anthropological perspective. If you are expecting to learn about policy, you won't, but the perspective the course provides is valuable to understanding human rights. The class was a good size and had discussions with active participation. Most of the readings were very interesting and engaging.",
    "ehh, it depends on the extent to which you engage with the material and readings prior to class. If you do the readings well, then class discussion can be fruitful.",
    "Yes! As someone interested in human rights, this class allowed me to explore it from a different perspective. I can now say I love ethnographies and find them invaluable to human rights advocacy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to engage in discussions of internal relations and aid in a self-aware manner. A lot of the class had to do with understanding the history and politics of the human rights regime--history and politics that many actors from Western countries would tend to ignore.",
    "For sure!",
    "Yes--a really interesting & important subject, and the readings & professors are great!"
