   "comments": [
    "This seminar focused a lot on economic research papers on various different networks, from the basic understandings of how networks connect people and papers on theoretical situations and game theory. Overall, I found it very enjoyable to be immersed in a course that really explored human interaction from an economical standpoint.",
    "This is probably not relevant because the prof is a visiting professor.",
    "I would recommend this class!",
    "Each week, the class focused on a different topic within social networks. We all presented two papers about social networks over the course of the semester. Each class started with student presentations, and Professor Laclau lectured on the related topic for the remainder of the time. Doing the readings was not necessary, and it felt like the class was not engaged during student presentations. The subject matter was interesting, but class was not lively and demands were too low.",
    "Definitely",
    "The content of this class sounds amazing, but in reality you will get absolutely nothing out of it, which is a shame given how interesting the material sounds like it could\/should be. The plus side is that workload is super minimal -- probably the least amount of work I've ever put into a class at Yale before. But I would trade that for the ability to walk away saying that I'd actually learned something. Professor Laclau though is incredibly sweet and incredibly smart, and hopefully if she teaches this class again she will seriously consider revising her syllabus.",
    "Yes, extremely rewarding course that covers an interesting yet complex subject matter"
