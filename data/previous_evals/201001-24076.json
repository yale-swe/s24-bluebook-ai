   "comments": [
    "take it - its hard and not really just about africa but global south\/developing nations",
    "survey of the economic history of a bunch of regions\/countries around the world whose development efforts yield insight into how nations operate in an international economic context. shows you how and why some countries are poor and others rich. people who haven't taken this class have less of an idea of how the world works.",
    "This is a history which surveys economic articles to better understand the history of international development and its intellectual trends. Be prepared to read econ articles.",
    "Definitely take this if it I offered again",
    "It's a great seminar - you do interesting readings and write a lot. But it's a lot of work and if you're taking another or more than one other seminar, that's something to consider. It helps if you have some basic econ knowledge. Not all the readings are technical but it's just helpful in understanding the issues.",
    "Great overview of major issues and case studies in international development.",
    "I would summarize it as a work-intensive course that really teaches you to write succinctly and express your thoughts in front of others. There is definitely an economics component to the class, so be careful if you think it will be all history. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Weekly readings and discussion on a different topic in development economics and history each week. The readings are dense but satisfying in that they don't seem too repetitive (at least at first). The discussion is very long and intense, every week: we spend an equal amount of time on each reading, going around the room hearing from everyone in the class. This class worked only because the kids in it were almost all very engaged. If, perchance, half of the kids one year were uncommitted, it would be a big problem."
