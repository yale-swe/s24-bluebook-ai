   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to another student as a way to fulfill a language requirement. Or even if you are done with the requirement as a way to have a more relaxed, easy workload class.",
    "Spanish 150 is a great class. If you put in the time and effort, your skills will definitely improve. There isn't a ton of written work, the readings are interesting, and the format of the class makes each class day interesting and full of discussion.",
    "If you are at all hesitant about your knowledge of Spanish or your ability to speak it, this is a great class to take because it is relatively light on work, yet it solidifies your speaking and writing abilities.I'd recommend this class to a student that said he\/she wanted a Spanish class that would improve their speaking and writing abilities, give them a relatively light workload, and allow them to take future Spanish classes with a confidence in their abilities",
    "Great if your level of Spanish can take it.",
    "Brilliant way to spend a couple of hours every week practicing spanish and learning about latinamerican culture. Definitely take it.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your speaking skills. It's a pretty standard discussion-based spanish class with a bit of writing and a fair amount of reading. Valle is a kind teacher.",
    "A great class for getting better at speaking the language on the spot, not for learning more grammar. The homework is generally light, with a couple of writing assignments. However, you read a book at the end which can be time consuming if you are a slow reader in a second language.",
    "Very good class to maintain and improve spanish speaking skills. The class is pretty easy in general."
