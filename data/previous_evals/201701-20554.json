   "comments": [
    "I learned how to create networks and use leverage points within networks to generate climate action. Besides learning about network theory through various readings and lectures, I worked in a group on a project with one of Paul's clients to practice the theories I learned about in class.",
    "This class did a lot to shift my perspective. I began to see the world through a new lens: the systems thinking lens. Taking this class allowed me to be acutely aware of effects that happen as a result of networks and possibilities of change through altering networks. Furthermore, I learned how to think creatively to find solutions that can tackle wicked problems rather than short term fixes that cause more harm than good. While there is still a lot to be learned in the complicated fields of systems thinking and network thinking, this class was an incredible introduction that opened my eyes to a lot of powerful tools.",
    "The course delved deep into humanistic communications and network theory. We had a lot of opportunities to apply these skills and materials to our work on stakeholder projects, and also oyr deliverables. The class discussions were also a fascinating way to learn.",
    "this class changed the way i think! now i consider problems in terms of systems and networks instead of linear cause-and-effect thinking",
    "I learned about systems thinking. I learned to think about systems thinking. Honestly, I'm not exactly quite positive what else I learned in this course.",
    "I learned how to think in terms of systems and apply that toward solving any wicked problem using network-building. Not only was I exposed to interesting theory, but I was able to work on a potentially groundbreaking project that was incredibly pertinent to my interests. I'm leaving this class with a set of tools that I will use for the rest of my life in tackling large problems relating to society and the environment."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - the group projects were really exciting and it was fun to feel like I was doing something real Weaknesses - the lectures are hard to keep up with. Paul has thoughts that go a million miles per hour which makes for a somewhat manic lecture that is very high level and so hard to follow.",
    "Strengths: how applicable the class is to the real world; getting to practice the theories we learn Weaknesses: organization, respecting time",
    "The course has many strengths. Its main strengths are the fact that the material is fascinating and also that you get to work on real world problems in the course. Furthermore, the professor for EVST 312 is truly an inspiration. One area for improvement could be the amount of feedback students get. While those who speak up a lot in class naturally get a lot of feedback, students who quietly submit all their writing assignments will get not get sufficient feedback on their work.",
    "The course could be improved if it was a bit more structured and do students would come into class knowing what material to expect every week. The strength of the course is that the material is fascinating, and we loved learning about how communications applied to the wicked problem of climate change. The course could be improved by highlighting its structure that builds every week on top of each other more clearly.",
    "This course is all over the place. There seemed to be a terrible lack of communication for a class that was supposed to be about communications. Lack of communication between Prof. Lussier and the class, Prof. Lussier and the TFs, between the graduate and undergraduate classes. There needs to be a better job of letting everyone know what the heck is going on. This class's lectures were its strengths. I always found it interesting to go over examples and go over the theory we had learned in the readings. In terms of the projects, in my opinion Prof. Lussier let us flounder for too long before stepping into help us. Some of the groups had significantly less experience than others did, and that showed. He expected us to figure things out, and when the project process began going sideways, he seemed very shocked by this."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It should really be called applying systems thinking and network theory to climate change--a much better description than \"advanced science communication.\" I would recommend this course. It is very different from other courses I've taken at Yale--very group project based. Make sure you feel excited about both the project and your group before you commit. I took this class without taking the first semester, which was totally fine. I engaged with this class a lot and I think Systems Thinking is a really important vocabulary and mentality to have in terms of climate change.",
    "Try to find someone who's taken the class to talk to before embarking upon this insane journey. Paul Lussier is actually insane. Once you accept that fact, it gets better. Dealing with Paul is a great bonding experience - got really close with my team because of it lol. This class basically turned out to be a consulting practicum with some decent readings and then 2 hours of listening to Paul talk and trying not to laugh\/cry\/get called on. Definitely not a good fifth class.",
    "If you are interested in generating climate action and learning how to navigate politics, science, communication, etc. given the current administration, then you MUST take this course. It gives you the tools necessary to create a better future. Paul Lussier is a fantastic, passionate instructor who cares more about his students' learning and well-being than anything. Yale bucket list class for sure",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has interest in sustainability or Climate Change. The course offers such a unique and powerful perspective, on how to influence people and systems to achieve desired outcomes (in the case of this course, the ultimate desired outcome is to manage climate change and repair ecosystems). Also you get to work on some really cool real world projects, which is a breath of fresh air for people who are tired of learning theory and taking tests all day instead of applying theory. Paul is also an inspiration, and worth having as a teacher.",
    "Paul is a fascinating lecturer, professor and mentor. The class is on humanistic communications and network theory, which are rather more abstract, theoretical and complex compared to other classes. The course has a fascinating component of projects, and we work on real projects with institutions and companies such as Nat Geo and Virgin. The course really builds humanistic communications skills and brings a wholly different approach to climate change and how to approach it. The course goes way beyond stating that climate change should be solved by innovation and renewables or policy or one specific approach, and creates many opportunities to think about how to build networks to really approach the underlying societal causes of the problem.",
    "I'd recommend EVST 311 over EVST 312 -- the fall semester course makes more sense and prof. Lussier teaches it more clearly than 312. It's probably because the ideas he teaches in 312 are still developing.. They're both unique classes since you get actual experience working consulting-style with an environmental client. I got to travel to my project's location for a weekend, which was an amazing experience.",
    "Ehhhhhhhhhhh. That's my answer to whether or not you should take this class. If you do take it, start it out CR\/D and see what you think. In my opinion, the systems materials themselves were quite interesting, but that's honestly the lesser focus of this course. The greater focus is the stakeholder project, which is interesting, because you get to work with a real-life client, but can end up becoming quite the clusterf*ck, especially if there is a lack of coordination between the graduate and undergraduate groups, as was our case. The project can really start to eat away at your time, especially towards the end of the semester and if your group starts to disengage (I myself was guilty of this).",
    "This is a really important class to take if you want to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to approach and work towards solving wicked problems like climate change. It made me reconceptualize people and society in a very powerful way and has provided me with a set of knowledge and tools that I am sure I will use throughout my entire career. This class is pertinent to things beyond science and the environment, however all of the group projects stem from those two sectors in some way. The projects are really great and will make you feel like you're doing something meaningful and productive in the real world toward positive change. The readings for the course are a little dry and there is a significant disconnect between the projects and the class, but the course is still great and I recommend it to anyone interested in systemic change."
