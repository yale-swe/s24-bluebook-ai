    "I would recommend Sociology 660 to another student. The literature covered is fantastic and the class discussions are even better. Soc 660 approaches the material from an interdisciplinary point of view and offers an opportunity for students from many different departments to learn a tremendous amount the \"black community\" in the United States.",
    "A great class which would help prepare you for an Orals field in Black urban studies. The wealth of texts provide a really great glimpse of urban spaces in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Extremely wide spread of soc. (and some econ) readings that helps de-ossify what people think soc is, in the humanities."
