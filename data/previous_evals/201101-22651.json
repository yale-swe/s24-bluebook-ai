   "comments": [
    "Great class that gives you a sense of all the issues with intellectual property law in the digital age. Any heavy digital media consumer, entrepreneur, or law student should take this course. Just a bunch of readings and written response for the most part and then one final project that lets you be creative.",
    "I would recommend it but it has moved to Stanford so you can't take it till Elizabeth comes back :(",
    "If they were techies probably. From a legal point of view, too much software talk.",
    "I doubt Elizabeth will be teaching this again, so I have no idea who would teach this, but it was a great class. If it's anything like it was this year, definitely take it.",
    "Yes I would, but as a non-computer science person, I sometimes felt a little out of depth. Also I believe Elizabeth is leaving next year so I don't know if this class will be offered again.",
    "This is a great course for someone who knows a lot about the Internet. Naturally, the course attracts more technologically minded people, so the conversation tends to assume a degree of knowledge about the Internet and Internet culture. I would say that being fairly conversant about the Internet and technology is a requirement for anyone thinking about this course.The readings are fascinating and the syllabus is very well put-together.",
    "Good Class. Good Discussion. Chill, cool professor. Fairly easy readings. If the issue sounds interesting to you at all you should take it.",
    "An excellent overview of intellectual property in general and intellectual property with regards to emerging technologies in particular. Though a two-hour class is certainly long, I never felt it--the discussions were always illuminating and interesting, as was the reading. Both the teacher and TA were super knowledgeable, as well as funny and engaging. Highly enjoyed.",
    "If you have an interest in technology, take this course. It describes the legal world of the internet, a largely unlegislated body.",
    "She's not offering it again, but it was definitely a great class.",
    "Yes - very interesting course looking at the development of copyright, trademark and patent law given the rapid pace of innovation in American society."
