    "not a requirement. took as audited elective.",
    "This required course is not directly connected to anything else in the curriculum, and thus could occur at any time.",
    "Yes.",

    "reasonable in terms of the sequence.",
    "The sequencing of this course with respect to others in the curriculum was not objectionable to me.",
    "I guess it is important where it is since we will take Urbanism studio in the spring...I think it is a potentially excellent class that right now has many flaws due to its instructor and makes me question its relevancy at all.",
    "Yes, I think so.",
    "Yes.",
    "The course seemed repetitive especially after the urban history requirement. After havingtaken Dolores Hayden's American Cultural Landscapes and an urban history seminar in undergrad, I was already very familiar with most of the examples shown in the class.",
    "I was very surprised that this course (presented the way that it was) is a required course. This should be an elective because it is geared toward a very specific type of person and not helpful to everybody. I think that it could be worthy of a required course spot if it were changed a lot and presented in a much more useful way.",

    "Yes",
    "I wonder if the course would be better suited to occur in the studio urbanism semester andsomehow help inform the studio work.",
    "I do believe this course was properly sequenced within the curriculum(as a 2nd year course). However, it may have been more beneficial to have it in the 2nd semester of 2nd year given that the focus of the studio will be for an urban proposal at a larger scale. This would have been a way for many of the planning, zoning regulations, variances, etc. detailed in the course to become specifically executable initiatives."

   "comments": [
    "great. very logical.",
    "-The assignments were unclear, overly complicated, and required too much time doing \"busy work\" rather than actually delving into the topic. Also, the assignments were not well-linked to class resulting in confusion since the knowledge needed to complete the assignments was rarely presented in class.-I really appreciated the over-all concept of the assignments and their unconventional approach.",
    "Material presented in this course is well sequenced and conveyed in a relatively clear and concise manner, an attribute to the instructor's expertise of the subject matter and the many years that he has taught the course.",
    "ok",
    "This class was too much work. Having six projects and a test is just too much at this school.",
    "This course is reasonable in that it deals with 'real world' issues. The gap between this and the issues we deal with in Design Studios are problematic - although this is an indication of the problem of architecture in general.",
    "The \"games\" that we were asked to do as assignments were extremely poorly explained. Essentially the teaching methodology seems to have been to learn by doing, and what was explained to us in class were simply the principles through which we should approach the assignments. The problem with this pedagogical model is that we were taught the broad ideas and then asked to apply them to specifics, without ever having learned anything about the specifics. Zoning codes are complex, and without ever being taught anything about how to apply them I felt that we were left in the dark to complete the second \"game.\" Overall I found the course frustrating, and although Professor Garvin's intentions seemed admirable I do not feel I learned very much from the course.",
    "The lectures felt repetitive (the same examples came up all the time). Additionally, the assignments were always handed out without enough explanation\/time for questions.",
    "The assignments could have been better explained by Prof. Garvin and the TA's. The way it was presented assumed that we had some background in planning and real estate terminology and it would have been really helpful to start from the BASICS.",
    "Too much emphasis given to housing. I don't see what housing needs to take up an entire half of the course.",
    "I think the material in this class is important as part of the pedagogy, unfortunately it is taught by a bombastic, out of touch, sexist man in a bowtie. It is truly unfortunate that Yale is stuck in a prior generation. I hope it enjoys it slow but steady fall from the elite schools due to its willingness to maintain professors such as this one.",
    "The lectures were interesting, but due to the repetition of some of the subject matter they could become tiring toward the end.The assignments, however, were incredibly valuable. The guests that Garvin brought in had impressive credentials and insightful comments. I thought the simulation of real-world situations, while somewhat out of the ordinary, were valuable precisely because of that.",
    "Sequence and syllabus - appropriate.However - what is NOT appropriate in my opinion is the difference in the lectures and homework. The homeworks have to do with development - for which the process\/approach is not explained in lecture. This has been most frustrating as the two parts of the course do not come together until the 'games' or the final exam. The entire semester they are almost separate and the development part is not taught but rather left for us to research by ourselves without any experience. In my opinion the introduction to planning was excellent - the introduction to development was not. Yes I did learn a lot by doing that part by myself - however it simply stressed me out more than it did help me learn it. So the assignments are questionable.",
    "This course focuses entirely too much on the role of the private sector in development, largely concerning itself with an understanding of how to make a profit--which is not the only motivation for, or method of, urban planning",
    "The lecture portion of this class is an embarrassment for Yale University, not to mention the school of architecture. I am in many ways offended that I was forced to attend it in order to get my degree, and disappointed that this is the education my very high tuition buys. Alexander Garvin is clearly a well-educated and well-traveled man, with many insights into what makes a successful planning or development project. But this was not made at all evident in the lectures, which were unbearably dull slideshows accompanied by common-sense observations (NOT analysis). I already know that parks are great and that people like to shop. It would have been far more helpful, perhaps, to at least look at plans of these projects that could be analyzed in-depth to understand what subtleties make them successful. Furthermore, no slide should be shown more than twice in a semester. We saw a huge number of the same images over and over, every class, with no change in the accompanying rhetoric. The most useful parts of the class were the \u0093games,\u0094 but because we were expected to figure out how to do these assignments on our own they were probably much less helpful than they might have been if some of the issues had actually been addressed in the lecture.",
    "The sequence seemed confusing to me. The course is perhaps trying to cover too much history and instead should focus more on 20th century American examples - and less examples at that. Covering less examples in class more specifically would allow the professor to focus more on what is new to the students - the financial and political situation behind each project.",
    "The lectures did not inform us in any way whatsoever how to do the assignments. They vaguely discussed corresponding topics, but left us out to dry on the homework. We had to research a ton of information that we had no clue about because we touched on 10% of it in class. The actual lectures could have been done in a 3 day seminar because they were extremely repetitive. They should have focused more on the specifics of the course because that is what we were expected to know for the homework assignments. Very poor execution here.",
    "The material is broad and basic. We did not look at any one situation in depth, apart from a few shopping malls.",
    "When a class is instructed in such a manner, it doesn't encourage students to attend. It lends itself to doing other work in class and read the text afterwards since it is the lecture verbatim.",
    "Assignments were worded poorly causing confusion. Instead of the teacher taking responsibility for this lack of clarity, the students were reprimanded.",
    "I appreciated Prof. Garvin's emphasis on \"real world\" problems. I felt the assignments complemented what we learned in class.",
    "I do not think the body of material is representative of what is essential for an architect to know. Maybe zoning and laws. Urban planning techniques, certainly, but those were never discussed. All this class was about was how to make money, not how to create a vibrant urban environment. I have had many urban planning classes in the past, and this class paled in comparison. All Professor Garvin cared about was the wonders of gentrification and changing an area by forcing ethnic peoples out.",
    "The assignments were unclear - the handouts were not written clearly and we were given no explanations in class. The TAs were sometimes helpful, sometimes not. The games would be much improved with better organization and explanation. They are the most successful part of the class (in terms of engaging us with the material) but were in general frustrating because of the lack of clarity.The content of the class is too narrow in focus. The case studies shown were primarily American. What about alternative models of development, or non-Western models?I feel like I'm coming out of the class without a real understanding of the development process. The material in the lectures is too basic, and was often repetitive. We were mostly shown \"before and after\" photographs of places. Much of the material is redundant with other courses (Intro to Urban Design). The games were much more interesting in terms of content, but again, they suffer from a lack of clarity.",
    "The body of material was interesting enough, although the lectures themselves were repetitive and not at all engaging. The 'Games,' though tedious, gave some interesting insight into the world of commectial development and city planning.",
    "the material is relevant, but this class needs to decide whether it is a development class focused on zoning and financial analysis, or if it is a history of urban development. Hard to teach both in one class, should work more in tandem with the urban planning class of 2nd semester.",
    "I thought the material seemed very dated, while I don't doubt it's value I question it's relevance beyond simply providing some historical perspective on planning. It's clearly evident that this course has changed very little in the past 10 years, which is a little disconcerting especially considering it is part of the core curriculum.I thought the assignments were horribly organized and extremely cryptic almost as if we were intended to fail so that we could come in to the following class and be lectured on how inappropriate our proposals were. I really don't understand the structuring behind these assignments, obviously the time is going to be devoted on the front end, actually doing the work, not after we've submitted something and then been told all of the \"obvious\" mistakes; why not give a precursor to the assignments so that we can at least engage them with some sense of intelligence particular to the context. I think the course could benefit from more intimate engagement with the material (i.e. a section or weekly meeting with TAs regarding the content of the course). The lecture format is very convoluted and speaks very little to the actual work we do for the class. The lecture material is extremely redundant and lacks a certain criticality, almost to the point where it feels anecdotal.",
    "Much of the lecture material detailed case studies of urban proposal an their relative effectiveness. I feel that some of the number crunching and hyper specific facets of the making a re-development proposal(as given in homework assignments) were hardly covered during the lecture time. This made for ill-informed proposals because very little of the relevant subject matter was directly covered for teams to make coherent and synthetic proposals that juggled a number of contingencies. Much of the lecture materials seemed to have been covered in the first year course given by Alan Plattus. I feel that this course should more so invest in the intricacies of developing a strategic proposal and less about cursory, historical information about case studies."

    "I wanted to get a general overview of development and planning. got it.",
    "-I had high expectations for this class since I understand the importance of knowing how development and planning works within the field of architecture. However, I was frequently disappointed with the quality of the lectures and never felt as if I had learned as much as I should have about the topic.",
    "I expected the course would convey the main concepts of urban planning and development and the political implications and hurdles involved. The course and instructor met these expectations.",
    "None, and if I had any they would not have been met. This course sadly needs a new professor.",
    "I thought the course was going to be a more in-depth look at \"planning\" but there was too much overlap with intro to urban design last semester.",
    "My expectations for this course were to learn the basic principles of urban planning - not so much how to make a lucrative development venture as what one needs to know in order to design successfully at a larger scale than a single building, and what the criteria are for judging such a design. While it would seem that the course was set up to do just that, I do not feel that we were taught principles as much as we were given example after example, without much of a clear explanation of procedure or design.",
    "I expected to learn the basics of planning and development - how to communicate with planners, city officials, developers, etc, as a way to understand the basic issues. I approached this class with enthusiasm; I thought it would give me some real-life exposure to the incredibly complicated and interesting problems of planning.Instead, I was indoctrinated into Alex Garvin's incredibly narrow-minded ideology of what \"good\" planning and development is. He routinely presented only one side of the key issues, lauding people like Jane Jacobs and her New Urbanism loyalists without presenting why the other 50-90% of our profession does not subscribe to this school of thought (my apologies to Dean Stern). I was so fed up with how many times something was described as \"good\" or \"bad\" without due explanation or seeing things from another perspective.",
    "I was originally disappointed because I thought the course was entirely about planning and the first segment of the curriculum involved development, not planning per se. This I have come to realize is valuable to learn as well. However, I think there is enough content here in Garvin's course to fill two courses, one in development, and one in planning.",
    "No expectations. I learned a lot about the history of American city planning and different case studies and approaches - and also on development in New York in particular. However, that said I think that the class could do away with the cramming of both into one semester.I was definitely challenged - but at times the challenge was too burdensome causing undue stress on most students in the class.",
    "My expectation was to develop a broad understanding of the history and methods of urban planning. This was only partially met (see other answers).",
    "I expected to learn about planning and development, not anecdotal urban history. What I did take away from this class I mostly had to figure out on my own.",
    "I expected the class lectures to cover more of the specifics behind each project - the players, the money, the politics.",
    "I really thought that this course could have been extremely interesting and useful. I was sorely disappointed with how poorly it was presented and how much I ended up actually disliking the subject matter altogether by the end. I think that with a different professor\/approach this could be taught much more effectively and I would have enjoyed it much, much more.",
    "I was expecting to look at a variety of case studies and learn about their theoretical position in history. After a clear understanding of built urban conditions, I would have enjoyed and appreciated doing comparative analysis and formulating my own opinions. This class was a series of images thrown at us and only discussed on their most basic boring level. I believe that the breadth of this course is only required to cover all of Professor Garvin's many connections and achievements throughout his career.",
    "It seemed as if the same slides appeared weekly. I wish more examples of non-American planning projects had been shown as Americans are not known for their urban renewal.",
    "I expected to learn the basics of property development and urban planning. Prof. Garvin conveyed the information clearly. I appreciated his focus on development, as that is what I'm interested in learning at this point in my career.",
    "I expected to learn about urban design, instead it was only about development and how to completely abandon \"Architecture\" in order to \"sell out.\"",
    "My expectations for the course were, unfortunatley, low, and the course did not exceed them.",
    "I had little to no expectations for this course",
    "My expectations were only partially met for this course. As stated above, I would have appreciated a class that was more about detailed figures, amounts, allotments regarding loans, financing, acquisition as opposed to brief historical case studies. Not that case studies of urban proposals aren't important, but most of what Prof. Garvin lectured upon was covered by lectures given by Prof. Plattus the previous year. Whereas much of the subject matter involved in developing a convincing redevelopment proposal was foreign to most students, I feel the course would have been more beneficial confronting issues pertaining to proposal strategies."

    "helped give me a big picture perspective of planning and development, which is useful to my work in community development finance.",
    "The course is valuable in that it introduces concepts of planning and development as they relate to the political and public relations processes that are not otherwise covered in the overall curriculum of the school. Any direct impact or relation of material covered in this course as they relate to the design studios is unclear. The course seems to be most valuable to those who will pursue a career in urban planning or jobs in the civic realm after graduating. Having an overview of the topics and prominent figures covered in the course, however, is beneficial to any student of architecture.",
    "This course has little value to me, despite Professor Garvin's clear enthusiasm for the material. I feel the material is a bit out of date and is directed at the premise that planning is a pursuit to make money, as opposed to a professional responsibility of maintaining our cities. Although Professor Garvin does have many anecdotal stories that assist in the presentation of the material.",
    "This course was to superficial to b e of any real value. There needs to be less slide show lectures and more comprehensive view of planning.",
    "While I think that I could have learned a lot from a course like this, at the end of it I was very disappointed. The two biggest problems with the course for me were a lack of clarity of what we were supposed to do for the assignments (and conflicting information from the TAs when we asked them) andthe fact that we were never given critiques or comments on our work, we were only judged by it. We were never told what was wrong with what we did, only that it was wrong.",
    "Not valuable at all. In addition to being extremely narrow-minded in terms of what type of planning it valued, there was no self-consciousness whatsoever to the extremely capitalism system which it championed. News flash: some of us are optimists. Some of us might be interested in discussions where the \"winner\" isn't ALWAYS determined by the bottom line profit. If he is going to teach this way, I think at the very least he owes it to us to have some recognition of how extremely closed-minded he is.",
    "Valuable for sure.",
    "Valuable from the aspect of considering socio-political and economic factors as well as integration of design into site and its relationship to the urban context. Also valuable in terms of understanding different laws, history and case studies.",
    "This course, due to its focus on profit-driven development, was of less use than a broader course exploring the full range of the discipline of planning--as this is the only compulsory exposure to that discipline in the curriculum.",
    "The majority of this class was a waste of time for me, and covered material I had already learned in urbanism classes but far more superficially. What might have been valuable for me was the content of the \"games,\" but these were mainly just frustrating because there was little to no instruction as to how to do them well.",
    "The course was valuable in that it opened my eyes to how projects actually happen with money and developers and city politics. The history and examples were mostly a repeat.",
    "I thought that this course could have been much more valuable, but failed in having hardly any value at all.",
    "I do not understand why this is a required course. This was possibly the worst class that I have ever taken. Professor Garvin's lectures were centered around his achievements and his connections. It was a class in learning what Alex Garvin has done with his career. I am very disappointed in this class.",
    "Lower valve than the other courses that were being taught at the time. More valuable classes are available in a core curriculum than this class.",
    "This course has been extremely valuable to me. I now have a much better understanding of how the development process and planning regulations work.",
    "I do not feel this course was of value.",
    "This course did not hold my attention throughout the semester. Professor Garvin has his own personal enthusiasm for his subject, and although he tries to communicate such enthusiasm, the content of the lectures is neither intellectually or aesthetically stimulating.",
    "very little, needs to be taught in a way that explains to students why this information is important to architects today, which it is. Garvin presents himself in a way that turns off the majority of students.",
    "I'm not sure this course, atleast content wise, is worthy of being a core requirement in the curriculum. I feel I took very little away from this course other than a cursory idea that planning is dictated and implemented based on a for-profit strategy and nothing more a point re-iterated by the professor himself when he stated that one could only be a \"good\" planner if he \"was a good deal maker\". I think planning certainly should have a place in the curriculum but I'm not sure where or whether it should be required, atleast not the this course.",
    "I did find merit in the course because it forces you to confront the real logistics of getting things built on a larger scale, which inevitably forefronts the diverse contingencies involved in such an endeavor."

    "I thought Garvin was a great lecture. Loved all the photos, before and after, that he has collected over the years.",
    "-The TA's were generally knowledgeable and available.",
    "The instructor is knowledgeable in the subject matter, and often expects each student to achieve a comparable level of expertise, despite this being the only sampling of the subject matter that we receive in the curriculum. Overall, lectures and concepts for success were conveyed clearly. However, expectations for game assignments were often not made clear, and teaching assistants providedlittle clarification of expectations. The instructor should provide more directly his expectation for the scope and direction of the two assignments so that the students can produce work that will make the two games more beneficial for all involved.",
    "There was a serious inability to communicate from the course instructor to the students as to what the assignment was more often than not. Although this only occurred twice (2 major projects) it really points to the fact that the course material (and it's presentation methodology) has not been revised in the four decades he has been teaching this course. This is terribly unprofessional and I am certain had the school a serious planning department it would never stand.",
    "The TA's were not helpful, I'm not sure that they did anything.",
    "Explanation of each assignment and a review session would be helpful. The assignments were not explained well and if there was a review session, it was held too soon to the due date to be effective. Grading seemed sporadic and ineffective.",
    "Professor Garvin's lectures were not uninteresting, but I felt very strongly that he needed to synthesize the information into some kind of conclusion, rather than simply presenting a lot of examples. Furthermore, the textbook for the class reads very straightforwardly as a rehearsal or transcription of his lectures. I found it quite frustrating to attend a lecture that I might as well have just read in the professor's published book.The TAs were very helpful, but in one instance for the zoning assignment my group asked one of the TAs whether, if we were working in a larger group, we were to work together and make one submission or several. He told us several, which apparently was exactly the wrong information, and turned out to be very frustrating in the end.",
    "Garvin is obviously ridiculously intelligent and knowledgeable about planning. However, his enormous ego and nauseating arrogance regularly made it impossible for us to actually appreciate how effective he might be. His class was like a guided tour of his c.v., complete with plenty of patting himself on the back and bragging every step of the way. I literally have never met a more conceited or self-aggrandizing person in my life, and I have worked for Zaha Hadid, so that should tell you something.",
    "Garvin is certainly well qualified and connected and he puts it to good use with his invitation of guests to the class for juries, presentations, etc. This I would say is the most valuable part of the class.",
    "TAs were helpful. Instructor was well versed in the material.",
    "The lectures were repetitive and often of little value in relation to the assignments. The assignments were more informative, though they would have been of greater benefit had they been better integrated into the lecture sequence. In all, the instructor's reliance on personal experience and anecdote revealed a lack of critical engagement with either planning or development.",
    "Professor Garvin does not present material effectively in the lecture. He clearly has a lot of information to share, but does not do a good job of conveying it. I think he would benefit from focusing the lecture on specific projects, and doing more in-depth analysis that would be relevant to the \"games\" instead of such anecdotal presentations.",
    "Garvin knows what he is talking about - and I definitely appreciate how he went out of his way to bring in outside professionals for the games and final review. He effectively tried to create a professional atmosphere for us to work in.",
    "I think that it needs a change. I didn't particularly agree with the way it was presented and I don't see Garvin changing that at all.",
    "The lectures were boring and repetitive. A series of Professor Garvin's photographs that highlighted his many connectionswith the Urban Planning Community. I do not care about how much he as achieved nor do i think that it should be a central theme of a required architecture class.",

    "average. very little interaction",
    "The TA's were somewhat helpful when completing some of the ill-explained \"games\"\/homework assignment given by Prof. Garvin. However, I often found it quite cryptic as to why things worked out the way in which they did, often the TA's couldn't effectively explain the outcomes either."

    "The class could have been at hour lecture and would have been as effective in conveying content if not more effective. People's attention spans don't really last for 2 hours. Plus there was often a lot of overlap in content which to me suggest redundancy and inefficiency. I also think that the content of the course could have been updated for contemporary issues. Why we didn't talk about the housing problems of today in a imploding economy would have been a really interesting discussion which was barely even scratched. In summary, My suggestions for the course would be to consolidate time and material covered and giving it an update",
    "Replace Garvin. It is a sad loss because he is so smart, but his total inability to teach objectively (or anywhere close to objectively), or have any recognition of how narrow-minded and arrogant he is has totally stifled the learning in that class. I feel so short-changed by his class, because I feel like his ideology saturated it so badly that I learned only 1 way of doing things. Every day I sat there I couldn't believe how angry I was at his efforts to brainwash our conception of cities and planning and turn us into, and I quote from him, \"Garvinistas.\"",

Its narrow focus on establishing the planning framework for fostering private-sector development omits much of what constitutes the discipline of planning and thereby leaves much of the class, whose interests may differ from those of the instructor, with little material of ongoing value.",

    "I did not expect to come away from this course with the impression that I now have. From the course title and description, I expected to learn truisms and rules of thumb about urban design, arrangement of park space, basic zoning laws, etc. Instead, the course was far more about looking at cities from a developers point of view, learning a number of anecdotal tales about cities gone right or wrong, and for what reason.First let me comment on the course structure. There is a SIGNIFICANT disconnect between the lectures and the homework, to the extent that it often felt like I was assigned work from an entirely different class than I was attending twice a week. The lectures, while informative, were not structured in such a way as to make the examples readily applicable or memorable. Surly Mr. Garvin is a highly experienced, knowledgeable, and accomplished planner, so it seems rather unfortunate that there weren't more instances in which students could take advantage of those attributes.It would be to the benefit of the course for the lectures to be delivered as primers to the assignments (or 'games,' as they were called). For example, the final 'game' dealt substantially with zoning a territory within New York City. In lecture, however, we are rarely shown zoning maps and changes across time, but rather photos of how places change. It's difficult as a student new to urban planning to make the leap from an imageto a map when having so little experience in the discipline.One of my favorite aspects of the course was the way the final exam was delivered, with a presentation in the middle which we were asked to evaluate in a written response. This sort of exercise would be hugely helpful to have done throughout the class, if not as an assignment, then in lecture. Instead of the 'before' and 'after' photos, students could be shown a particular area, it's zoning map, statistics, etc. in ADDITION to photos, then shown what the proposal for that area was, evaluate and hypothesize the results, THEN discuss what actually happened.Ultimately, though, I am very happy to have taken this course. It is the only class I have taken so far in my academic career that I have been asked (required, even) to think about buildings not as Architectural objects, but as merely urban accumulations of capital which have a quantifiable effect within the city. It is both terrifying and refreshing to hear someone complain about an oval tower because the column grid would disrupt the retail space below and cut into development profits.-Karl Schmeck",
    "I'm not sure this course, atleast content wise, is worthy of being a core requirement in the curriculum. I feel I took very little away from this course other than a cursory idea that planning is dictated and implemented based on a for-profit strategy and nothing more a point re-iterated by the professor himself when he stated that one could only be a \"good\" planner if he \"was a good deal maker\". I think planning certainly should have a place in the curriculum but I'm not sure where or whether it should be required, atleast not the this course.",
    "Less about historical case studies, more about detailed development proposals and explanation of specific terminology\/facets of the proposal. Potentially think about making the course coincident with the urbanism studio -- with a slightly re-tooled emphasis on the course material."
