    "I would definitely recommend this class as it is a thorough basis of Italian presented in an interesting way.",
    "I would recommend Italian 110 to another student. It was an intense class for me because of my inexperience, but anyone who has even a basic knowledge of Romance languages should find it doable.",
    "Yes. The language is very pretty and its nice to be able to read the language and speak.",
    "Yes, definitely take italian 110 if you are starting a language at Yale. The class has weekly quizzes and tests every two weeks or so, but they are not that bad at all. The Italian department is really fun and you get to meet a lot of the professors throughout the semester through Italian tables, etc. Also, the language itself is great and fun to speak. I Definitely recommend it!",
