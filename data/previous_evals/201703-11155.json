    "I learned a lot about France's colonial history, which I didn't know much about at all before taking this course. It's a very important subject.",
    "I learned that French literature isn't as scary to try to read as it seems. Reading novels and essays in French is definitely within reach and it opens up a whole world of amazing writing and thought. I generally improved my French reading and writing and had a good time.",
    "This course was more than an introductory French literature course; it was a thought-provoking analysis of what history means and how it was conducted in Francophone world through literature."

   "comments": [
    "The class sometimes felt like a history class. Not to say that that was bad. It just wasn't exactly what I signed up for. The class was also basically a post-colonial class, which isn't really in the name FREN 170. Just being clearer about the expectations\/course content would be great.",
    "This course is an excellent way to learn and enjoy French literature. The low-stress policy of marking homeworks complete\/incomplete made it so much easier to just do homework and not worry about a specific grade, but instead work on learning and improving my skills."

    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in French history or anyone who wants to improve their French language skills. There won't be as much literary analysis as in actual literature classes, but that's to be expected since it is after all a language course.",
    "This is an excellent course! Professor Jarvis is interesting, thoughtful, and curates a wonderful curriculum. The class is very approachable and accessible and very interesting.",
    "This was a fabulous class! TAKE IT!"
