   "comments": [
    "French is tough, but it's amazing to look back at the progress from the first day of class to the last.",
    "Very difficult. The weekly tests are not ideal.",
    "If you are taking French 120, it is likely due to distributional requirements, so this recommendation will make little difference.You learn a lot in French 120, but the workload is large, certainly in line with a 1.5 credit class.",
    "Sure, French 120 is your typical level 2 French language class.",
    "The second semester of French has more grammar and less vocab. It can get confusing at times but it is manageable and very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. This class is incredibly similar to French 110, but seems like a lot more work. During the class you cover more advanced verb tenses and review what you learned in the past. It was sometimes difficult to concentrate because FiA seems to drag on towards the end."
