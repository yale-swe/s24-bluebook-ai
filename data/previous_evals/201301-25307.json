    "Great intro to Latin poetry, if you want to read some Virgil this is the class for it.",
    "A great introduction to Vergil. A manageable pace.",
    "I would recommend it to a medium-experience level latin student who doesn't want to be too challenged",
    "If you're interested in Latin, take the course. You have to read the Aeneid at some point.",
    "Interesting text, sometimes gets a little too detailed but overall, gives you a good understanding of the Aeneid",
    "Vergil has a lot more new vocab than Caesar or the intro stuff. That takes some getting used to. It's best to use an online site, esp Perseus Project, to be able to look up the words quickly to write your translations. Writing it down is necessary because of the high frequency of new words."
