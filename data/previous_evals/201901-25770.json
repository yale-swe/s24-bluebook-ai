    "I'm not sure if this is even going to be seen, since there aren't that many people in the program but shut down the program? The research itself and the lab mentorship is fine, but the administrative support for the program is incredibly lacking. Probably moving the program outside of the DUS's direct purview and have a faculty member available as a track advisor would be an improvement, as Prof. Kankel and Crystal already have a ton on their plate. The requirement to have schedules signed by both the DUS and DGS is a pain and should either be facilitated by the department or just changed completely."
