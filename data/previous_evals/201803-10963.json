   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write in an entirely new way. I had never written criticism. It was refreshing and will certainly prove useful!",
    "Aside from getting a rich introduction into figurative art, both contemporary art and a bit of art throughout history, we touch on so much cultural material. As for a skill, you're encouraged to take ownership of your subjectivity, and if it is amateurish.",
    "My writing skills developed an incredible amount during this course. I learned not only how to describe art both effectively and in a compelling way, but also how to write with confidence. Prof Spillane emphasized that with each piece we wrote for this class, we should make our own opinion clear and be unafraid of saying what we thought rather than repeating the thoughts of others. My visual analysis of artworks also continually got better as I went through the course - I learned how to look closely and see beyond the surface of each piece.",
    "I learned how to write about art in a less formal way. Also, how to critique art in a way that anyone reading could understand.",
    "How to make compelling arguments about art through writing, as well as working knowledge of the most important figurative artists active today",
    "I learned how to examine artwork and write effectively about it without alienating my reader but also still claiming authority over the subject.",
    "I never knew how to write about art in a creative sense or without rewriting all of the information I had learned before and this class forced me to really think critically and independently about specific pieces of art.",
    "Learned about figurative artists.",
    "exposure to great currents and discussions in the world of contemporary figurative art, a great focus on improving writing skills and finding your own voice"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A weakness is that there are a ton of very small assignments. You quickly realize that they do not take much time, but the sheer number of emails and assignments is frustrating. The main strength of this course is the amount of feedback you get. Professor Spillane is so generous with her time and is really invested in helping you write the best piece possible, each and every week. Try to watch the films if you can. It feels like a lot, but they are great.",
    "The material was the class' strongest asset. Most class periods, however, did suffer a general lack of direction, such that there was no guarantee everything you read for class would be even discussed. Later into the class, it gets to the point where it becomes pointless to do much of the readings and viewings. Class itself would still be engaging, but often its unpredictability slipped into this sense of lack of focus.",
    "This was an incredible course! Prof Spillane gave so much feedback on every piece of writing we turned in and all of it was so thoughtful and helpful when editing and considering what to do next. The class discussion was interesting and well organized. If there was one drawback to this class, it was the amount of reading material and videos\/films to get through before class. It wasn't unmanageable, but it was enough that it could feel overwhelming if you didn't stay on top of it, especially since we didn't end up talking about most of it in class. Sometimes that made it seem as though the readings\/videos were unnecessary except for the one or two she would choose to discuss.",
    "There is a lot of reading and a lot of it goes undiscussed. However, everything I read and watched was so interesting. I also wish that we talked more about art. We ended up speaking more about the way people wrote about art.",
    "I loved the weekly essays, and we always received super detailed and helpful feedback. The readings, while interesting, felt randomly chosen, and since there were so many of them, class discussion could be unfocused. I think the seminar would improve if each meeting's readings were focused around a more specific theme that we could dive into, rather than jumping around as we often did. I feel like I consumed a lot of content without actually engaging with it super deeply.",
    "I think one weakness of the course was how many readings and videos\/movies were assigned for homework each night. There was never enough time to complete everything but also never enough time to actually discuss everything in detail in the way my peers and I hoped. The strongest factor of the class was the workshops. I loved being able to read the work of my peers and also receive critique from them. I also enjoyed the weekly blog posts. They were a great way to explore a new topic at the beginning of each week.",
    "The discussions we had in class were extremely engaging and fascinating and I wish we could use those for our papers and blogs posts because they were so packed filled with thought that it was hard to really unpack them during class. A lot of the time we never talked about the articles or movies we watched for homework which was a little frustrating. But overall everything we wrote made me want to explore this kind of writing and sparked so many conversations outside of class.",
    "readings and videos required for the course were always excellent and highly interesting but often it felt like there were too many assigned per week that we did not even get to discuss in class."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! Make sure the deadlines fit with your schedule, and that you have the time to devote to the writing assignments.",
    "I would, even to students who don't consider themselves as arts-centric or who haven't even taken an art class before. This is really a class about writing and how to approach writing about a topic you may be unfamiliar with with a confidence in your perspective. I feel like this deeper lesson gives it broader appeal.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Margaret Spillane is a wonderful professor. She truly cares about her students, facilitates stimulating conversation, and gives so much helpful feedback. If you can take a course with her, do it! If you are interested in art and\/or journalism whatsoever, you will enjoy this course. It's not a gut - there is quite a bit of reading and writing, but it is most definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, I became a much better writer.",
    "This course is super helpful for developing your writing skills and learning how to think about contemporary art. If this sounds useful or appealing to you, take it! The workload is intense but manageable, and the essays are always fun and open-ended, requiring lots of creativity.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a great way to get into writing about artwork and learning about artwork if you have no prior experience.",
    "Yes, this course is great. Youll learn a lot about art and how to write. You dont need a lot of knowledge going in.",
    "yes -- but be prepared for a lot of (worthwhile) work"
