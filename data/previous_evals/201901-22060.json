    "Prime Ideals, Dedekind Domains, Number fields, class groups, and units. Good extension of Algebra and really cool to see applications into current and past problems like FLT. I gained more insight into how Algebra as a field, hehe, is used to solve problems, by creating special structures that are just nice.",
    "Dedekind domains, the class group, Diophantine equations",
    "I learned mainly about the commutative algebra of Dedekind rings and rings of integers, ramification of primes, the class number, the unit theorem, and applications to diophantine problems in number theory.",

    "Material is interesting, Prof. Auel has definite passion for the material. We did a lot of review between each lecture making it manageable as it is a grad class. Not many problem sets, which I like, because it's fun to think about problems than to consider concepts like prime ideals.",
    "The material is very fun!",
    "Professor Auel was wonderful, but I would have liked for the course to have more homework; as it was, we did not get a chance to develop out skills and intuition outside of class.",
    "The material was super interesting and Professor Auel is a wonderful teacher! We got psets back very late and without any grades, so it was hard to see how we were doing in the class overall."

    "If you have taken Galois, some complex definitely consider it if you are interested in NT. ANT just adds a layer of algebra to NT things and goes beyond it in so many ways to tackle really simple, but challenging questions like FLT. You don't have to take Modern to take it, but I think it would have helped.",
    "Yes! I thought the subject was fascinating",
    "Yes! Algebraic number theory is beautiful, and also essential for so much of modern number theory",
    "If only Asher Auel was staying at Yale... I would recommend anything he teaches to Dartmouth students!"
