   "comments": [
    "A comprehensive survey course in pharmacology. I would recommend it since it basically teaches the grounds for pharmocological research in all fields.",
    "Intro to pharm is a good course that ocvers a lot of different drug classes. It discusses the physiology of these drugs, and sometimes stresses the physiology and basic biology over the actual mechanisms of the drugs. It is hard to adapt to the different teaching styles, but overall it is a good course.",
    "I would recommend this to other students.",
    "I think it is a good survey course that someone interested in pharmacology should take due to the topics covered and introduction to the phases of drug development covered in the MERCK modules.",
    "Pharm504 is a good class to understand the main concepts in pharmacology. It introduced us to several types of drug mechanisms, delivery forms, the process of the drug pipeline in the U.S., and pharmacokinetics. I would recommend it to other students, even if they aren't considering joining a pharmacology lab."

   "comments": [
    "Taught the background information necessary for research in the field.",
    "This course gave M2P2 students an excellent overview of Pharmacology.",
    "I became more aware of some of the active areas of investigation in the field of pharmacology as well as better understand the drug development process.",
    "It gave me an idea of the process it takes for a discovered target andinhibitor to eventually become a drug available to patients. I am interested studying cancer, and it introduced me to drugs for treating cancers and their mechanisms. It is also useful to be able to understand measures of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
