    "Really recommend writing the senior essay as a way to gain a working knowledge of economic analysis. After taking econometrics, still wasn't prepared to work with an actual data set and thought this was invaluable to an undergraduate economics education! Writing models especially isn't something you do in most classes.",
    "Yes great",
    "Do it - you feel accomplished at the end!",
    "Great Opportunity, but it is what you make of it. Take advantage and be conscientious.",
    "Yes, if there is a question you have in mind.",
    "A lot of work, but the reward is so huge - it's an exponential utility function!",
    "Great choice for senior year. Perfect!",
    "If you're thinking about writing a senior essay, think about why you want to do it first. For self-satisfaction? Because you think every person should? Because you want to go to grad school and have independent research to show for it? Because you want to be a \"better econ major\"? Because you want to learn more about a particular subject in economics? I personally did enjoy it in the end, once I turned in my thesis, but it was a tremendously stressful process because it really just hovers over your mind as \"that thing you haven't quite finished just yet\" and that's not necessarily the best feeling to have senior year -- and it's compounded by the fact that it was an optional thesis. If you do choose to write a thesis, make sure you pick a topic you are actually interested in learning more about, and not just something you've chosen so you have something to write on -- this is what will get you through the hard times ,and also is what will give you the \"econ is actually pretty cool!\" moments. In short, I'm glad I did the senior essay, but I wouldn't do it again. I also didn't procrastinate on the thesis - and worked on it regularly throughout the year - so that could've added to the stress as well.",
    "This question does not apply.",
    "Independent research. Experience largely contingent on who your adviser is",
    "Yes. do it if you want to grow",
    "Depending on how much work you completed during the first semester, this semester will be highly work-intensive, but nonetheless ultimately rewarding. Make sure to work consistently throughout the semester or else the final few weeks will be a struggle as the early April 1st deadline will creep up on you very quickly. The early deadline, however, is a blessing in disguise as it allows you to truly enjoy the final month of your senior year."
