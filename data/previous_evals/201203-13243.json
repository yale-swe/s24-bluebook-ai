    "Be forewarned: this is not a class about the Odyssey. It is better described as a course about different authors that sometimes reference the Odyssey a little bit. If you are attracted to most of the authors on the syllabus, you will enjoy the course. Just be willing to go along for the ride and you will invariably discover a new nuanced topic that you have never encountered before, and those moments make the whole thing worth it. This was a fun, quirky class that, truly, sometimes defies description.",
    "YES!",
    "A study of Odysseus and the ODYSSEY across the years. Started with the poem itself, looked briefly at classical receptions, then moved to the modern period with works by Byron, Joyce, Kazantzakis, Kavvadias, Seferis, Atwood, Walcott, and others. Prof. Syrimis is great in class, and the selection of texts was varied and interesting."
