    "I would absolutely recommend taking Ital 130 with Professor Papallo. He is so organized and fair and passionate about what he teaches. He made the semester really enjoyable.",
    "Although most of the Italian teachers are really good (I'd pick time over instructor) Taylor is great and helpful. Plus, he bakes cookies! Last day of class, we ate funfetti cookie sandwiches while playing review jeopardy for the final. Can't to better than that!",
    "Yes.",
    "Italian 130 is basically just reviewing in a little bit more depth and solidifying the basic grammar rules of Italian, all of which were learned in L1 and L2. This means that it is much less difficult to do well in than in L1 and L2. Therefore there are two ways to approach to class. The first is if you actually want to learn Italian\/go to Italy\/become fluent etc. If this is the case, then the review and experience that you get in Italian 130 are invaluable. The second option is if you need an easy class\/need to fulfill language requirement. Italian 130 is also good for this since it is not hard at all to do well with not much work.I know this because I had both mindsets at certain points in the semester. In the beginning of the semester I thoughtI wanted to go to Italy over the summer, fulfill L5, and become fluent. Therefore I worked hard in L3 and felt my Italian improve by leaps and bounds. Then, later in the semester I decided that I didn't want to learn Italian, and the class basically turned in the one that I didn't have to worry about. I stopped doing most of the work and still did well. So Italian 130 can really be what you want it to be.",
    "Italian 130 is definitely just a review of Italian 110 and 120, so if you did well in L1 and L2, you literally have nothing to worry about. At times, it will seem very repetitive and easy, but if you like Italian, stick with it so that you will eventually be able to take higher level classes. There are also plenty of good films and the workload is just the right amount.",
    "Italian 130 02 is a great follow-up course to L1 and L2 Italian because it reviews all the grammar covered previously (so no worries if you didn't speak Italian all summer long) but also introduces new ways to use the grammar and new phrases\/idioms so itstill feels like you are gaining new knowledge. And there's more opportunities to do fun activities because everyone's at a higher speaking level where you can perform entertaining skits etc. too.",
    "Italian 130 both reviews the basic concepts learned in Italian 110 and 120, and it also helps to cement\/improve upon those basic concepts. I would definitely recommend taking L3 Italian if you like the language and culture, and if you want to continue mastering the Italian language.",
    "Yes, as long as you're prepared to put in the time.",
    "A solid continuation of the grammar basics in Italian, with plenty of fun activities, music, and movies. A fun and easy course!"
