   "comments": [
    "interesting class if you've taken some type of philosophy class before. only 3 papers and a final, not a ton of work if you know the stuff. you can choose your paper topics and due dates too!",
    "Definitely preferable to Poli Sci department's Political Philosophy classes. After all, philosophers should be teaching philosophy. Classes like this are what college is all about.",
    "Covers too much basis in one semester",
    "It's a great class. Lots of reading, which you will want to do. But really strong lectures and section.",
    "A general survey\/overview of the major political philosophers. Mostly interesting, sometimes a little boring.",
    "Take it if you're interested in learning a lot of the basics of political philosophy, and reading a lot of different authors. HUGE reading load - I barely know anyone who came close to doing all the reading. But the workload isn't bad. Two short papers, a longer one, and a straightforward final.",
    "Introduction to Political Philosophy is a fantastic course to take if you attend lectures and get into writing the papers. If you are looking for a quick HU credit this probably isn't the best bet, but if you commit to going to lectures and writing good papers you will get a ton out of the course. I can't comment on how good the class is if you have already read a lot of the texts, but if you haven't I highly recommend taking the course before graduating as you will be amazed after the class how common these authors our in our everyday lives even today!",
    "A survey of the political philosophy of the Western canon. I would recommend it as it provided great insight.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone even vaguely interested in philosophy or political science. I had an extremely positive experience in the class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it gives you some valuable points from which to have mature thoughts. But, I was often frustrated with this class because I never knew what do with what I learned or what to believe.",
    "Yes. It's a great class if you're interested in Philosophy at all, because it will really help you systemize your understanding of philosophical ideas. Lectures and sections are highly thought provoking. You end up learning a lot about these famous philosophers and are pushed to read great philosophical texts.",
    "This class was essentially a survey into a catalog of the greatest works of political philosophy of all time. The class tells a compelling story about the progression of human political thought, from Plato to the present. I would recommend the course insofar as I believe it provides anybody pursuing a liberal arts education with a background in this school of thought that is very important to understanding what we see around us today.",
    "Great survey to political philosophy. Pogge is a great lecturer, and if Daniel Putnam is still the TA get him--he's beyond fantastic. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in political philosophy in the slightest. It's definitely not a gut, but it's a great class if you put in the work."
