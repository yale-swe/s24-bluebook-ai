   "comments": [
    "Mold Making and Casting is a great way to learn techniques that are probably unfamiliar to you like plaster, rubber, and alginate mold making and casting in plaster, wax, and other materials. I certainly learned a lot in this course and I am confident that I would be able to work on similar projects on my own now. In addition, the course design has you take the skills you are learning and apply them to art projects, which gives each skill a sense of purpose. It is a fairly significant time commitment and you will have to come in throughout the week to work on projects. Sometimes things will seem very compressed. I took this course as a non-art major, but I still enjoyed it very much, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It was alright. Just alright. Mostly because it didn't know what it wanted to be. It should have been a technical course, but it tried to be a studio course? But there just wasn't time for that, a week for a project that was expected to be large? No way. Then the next week it was on to the next thing. I just wish it had been one or the other. Instead I came out confused, like, what did I just do? It was fine, but the syllabus was both nebulous and overly ambitious to the point where I knew there was a lot to do, but I didn't know exactly what that was or how to do it.",
    "It's a fun but time-consuming class and an important skill. I'd recommend it if you are willing to put the work in.",
    "I would recommend it but I would tell them that it requires a lot of time outside of class- the class was four hours per week and we were expected to do six hours of work outside of class per week (and often it turned out to be much more than that)- so I would recommend it but only if someone really wanted to learn this process and was willing to devote at least ten hours per week to an elective class.",
    "It's a great class to try something new and get a little dirty, stretch your creative side, and create art.I would recommend it because it is truly something unique and it can be a lot of fun when you get excited about completing an a project.",
    "Art 125 is like a cooking class with plaster. The class teaches you skills to complete sculpture assignments.Yes, I would recommend it to another student."
