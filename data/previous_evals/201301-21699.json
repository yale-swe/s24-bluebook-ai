    "It is definitely the best of the four physics courses, so pick it if you can. Second semester is a lot harder than first semester because it mostly involves modern physics, but this means that you learn a lot more in the second semester than in the first semester. (And the curve is still really good even though the course is hard.)All of the topics covered, EM waves, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology are taught at a very high level. Really, don't pass up the opportunity to take this course. As far as the math requirements, you really should take multi in the fall if you haven't already, and linear algebra is useful in the spring. You don't have to take MATH 230-231 to take this course.",
    "I DEFINITELY recommend this class to another student if you enjoy math and science. You will learn so much and class with Baltay is the best.",
    "A great class if you want to study physics. The material is very interesting, but it's also a hard class. There are problem sets every week which is pretty manageable, but it sucks when there are problems that you don't know how to do--which happens often. But if you want to major in physics, this is a really great class.",
    "Very good. Very Hard. Sometimes far far beyond the realm of easy comprehension. This course will push you and it will be fantastic, but sometimes you will question why you are taking it.",
    "Strong introductory course into pre-quantum mechanics (stuff like photoelectric effect, compton scattering, davidson-germer experiment), quantum mechanics, relativistic electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology.",
    "Physics 261 is a very good intro physics class, though be warned that it is significantly harder than its prerequisite physics 260. Topics covered include quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology. The quantum isn't terribly difficult, but keeping track of the relevant equations and concepts can be daunting. General relativity is definitely the hardest part of the course. Try not to get lost in the mess of indices and (sometimes) awful notation and just focus on the main ideas and key equations used for problem solving. The cosmology is a little more qualitative, but has some GR thrown in there. Overall, it's interesting but certainly not the cakewalk that 260 is.",
    "Baltay oh Baltay, you'll get used to his quirky joke and condescending tone. He has a big heart, and big palms too. Definitely continue PHYS 260, you'll learn a lot by the end of the year. Make sure Baltay does not break his arm, otherwise he would go through Quantum Mechanics really quickly from PowerPoint slides and finish General Relativity and cosmology, which had never been done for a long time. That would mean a more fun physics exposure, but more materials to prepare for the final exam.",
    "For someone who breezed through 260, the material in 261 was extremely difficult. Baltay continues to be a brilliant lecturer throughout the class, but went a bit fast for me to keep up this semester. Part of this might be because he broke his arm, and started using powerpoints instead of writing on the board. You cover the basics of quantum, GR, and cosmology- all very beautiful subjects but not exactly made for freshman and sophomores to learn. Take it for a challenging, but rewarding semester.",
    "If you've taken 260, you probably know the deal by now. The material is very cool, and it's not difficult to do well, but some people might not be happy with the level of mathematical rigor.",
    "Take it! You learn get a soft introduction to quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology -- it's a lot more interesting than it sounds.",
    "This class is really for physics majors. We did mostly quantum mechanics, relativity, and cosmology, and it was pretty overwhelming for a lot of the time. The content was pretty dense, and we learned a lot of stuff not very thoroughly. That said, I think it was still worthwhile in that it was amazing to be able to say, \"We derived the Heisenberg uncertainty principle today!\" to my suitemates. It is obvious that Prof. Baltay loves this stuff, and makes you buy into it, even if you're a bit (or very) confused.",
    "It is not just any intro physics course, be aware of that. It is very challenging.",
    "Everyone who is serious about Physics or Engineering should take Physics 261. Prof. Baltay presents many of the important (and interesting) ideas of Physics, such as Quantum Mechanics and General Relavity; the former is extremely important for high-level engineering, and General Relativity is interesting subject matter. In this class, you will avoid all of the useless number-crunching and tedious problem sets of the other Physics classes. Highly recommeded - take it! Baltay is an awesome professor.",
    "An in reducible thorough physics course that will blow your mind from beginning to end. I highly recommend it.",
    "I didn't really understand anything before I studied for the final. General relativity is basically taught out of a book that the professor wrote, which is cool, but there's a lot of new math and techniques that you need to know before you understand any of the conceptual stuff. It was pretty hard. Low work load though.",
    "Tougher than 260. Material is hard to digest as math is often prohibitive. Still an interesting course and Baltay on the whole is interesting.",
    "It's a good course if you enjoy physics. Problem sets are pretty straightforward if you read the textbook. Challenging but definitely doable.",
    "I would recommend physics 261 to anyone who is truly interested, it is worth it if you love the material.",
    "While 260 was largely a review of fairly standard freshman physics, 261 leaps into much more theoretical realms (quantum mechanics and general relativity). In that respect, it is certainly more geared toward physics majors, but anyone with a keen interest in these subjects should consider taking it, regardless of major. Workload is very manageable, and tests aren't horrible.",
    "I was overall disappointed with Physics 261. Going over quantum mechanics and general relativity with freshmen sounds like a really cool idea, but the math required to go into either of those subjects at an interesting level was definitely beyond anyone who took this course. Professor Baltay assured us many times not to worry about this or that part of a derivation, but then spent a lot of time doing out the gritty algebra--making his choice of what parts of the math to skip over seem pretty arbitrary. Our course textbook was also pretty simplistic and uninteresting, and most of the homework consisted of doing unit conversions.On the plus side, being introduced to quantum and GR is still pretty cool--the fields themselves are fascinating (although I still would not be comfortable saying I know much about them).",
    "Physics 261 covers EM radiation, quantum, general relativity, and some cosmology near the end. I'd definitely recommend it. Some of the lectures move pretty fast, leaving the whole class confused, but the material that's covered on tests and problem sets is more manageable. On the whole, it's a little bit harder than 260, and a lot weirder, but not anything that a person who did fine in 260 couldn't handle. Take it!",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. And possibly one of the best taught science classes at Yale. The course is a rigorous introduction to several important topics in physics, most notably electromagnetic waves, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology. It dives deep into each of these subjects, unusually so for a freshman course.The quantum mechanics is intricate and in-depth. Professor Baltay actually goes a bit further than the textbook, and gives a solid foundation to quantum mechanics. Working closely with Schrodinger's equation was very cool.General Relativity is where the course particularly shines. It is apparently very unusual for freshmen to learn GR, especially in a mathematically rigorous way. And while the notation and the math are challenging, Professor Baltay did a great job of conveying the important ideas and notions, and what was important to take away from GR.In the last two weeks of the course, we applied the GR we had learned to analyzing the structure of the universe, and seeing some fascinating results. Professor Baltay is an expert on cosmology, and I very much enjoyed getting a taste of how cool the subject is.The course's homework was straightforward, but still helpful. And the exams were challenging, but reasonable. The textbooks for E&M and quantum are well written and decently helpful. And for GR, Professor Baltay gives every student a booklet of his notes. The notes are helpful for reviewing, but would be difficult to learn GR from without his accompanying explanations.The only thing that I would like to see changed is more practice with the notation of general relativity. The notation is difficult no matter what, but practice would have given us a more intuitive sense for what was gong on when we got into the thick of GR.Professor Baltay is eloquent, extremely clear, and is especially talented at conveying understanding. He's also a brilliant physicist, but just as good a teacher as he is a scientist. His lectures were tremendously engaging, and he was very helpful with answering questions that came up in class.For a few weeks during the course, Professor Baltay lectured from projected notes rather than from the blackboard. He went a little bit faster than usual, which could sometimes be difficult to follow, but he posted the notes online, which helped tremendously for reviewing.If you liked Physics 260, especially the more mathematical parts or the parts you definitely didn't cover in high school, you'll love Physics 261. I would absolutely recommend taking it. You'll come away with afantastic background in physics and a deep understanding of what's going on in the universe on the smallest and largest scales.",
    "We went over some cool topics like quantum and general relativity, but don't expect anything rigorous. I would still say the class is worth it, though, to be able to see the material and go deeper if you want to.",
    "261 is a great class for those who have a strong math and physics background. The homework is less rigorous than 200, but the material is more complex and interesting.",
    "This is a great class! The material is incredibly interesting, and Dr. Baltay is amazing. It gets a little tough, but is so worth it.",
    "Physics 261 is a continuation of the first semester course featuring an overview of Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, and Cosmology. The workload for the course is the same as last semester; however, some of the material covered in this semester may be more difficult than topics covered last semester.",
    "definitely recommend it if you like physics. it was very hard but very interesting",
    "Physics 261 is unquestionably more difficult than Physics 260. The concepts are more advanced and modern, and the midterm and exam questions are much more conceptual than the mainly-quantitative exams in Physics 260. Especially when dealing with General Relativity, for which Professor Baltay prepared his own notes packet in lieu of a textbook, I felt hopelessly lost, and Baltay took very little time to go over concepts that virtually the entire class had trouble understanding. If you are considering taking this course, I would first very carefully evaluate whether you are definitely planning on going into a physical science or other field that requires advanced physics. If you're not a physics or engineering major, this class is definitely not for you. I took this class as a social sciences major simply interested in continuing the 2.5 years of physics I had taken up to this point (as well as knocking out my QR requirement) and deeply regret taking the class."
