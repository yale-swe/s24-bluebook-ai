    "Nothing else to say here.",
    "This is a relatively advanced course. At least some background in biology and chemistry will help a lot.Bradford is a good educator who cares about not only what, but also how students learn. At times he assumed we knew more than we did, but he was always thoughtful about his teaching method and the subject matter.",
    "Excellent pedagogy. This semester, the professor was in a bit of a bind since in the future it will be offered as an upper-level seminar, but this semester was an intro course. As a result, the course material was forced to vacillate between somewhat advanced and quite basic. Overall, the professor did a great job of balancing this challenge, bringing along people with no background in the material but also presenting challenging ideas. I would recommend this course to anybody with an interest in soil ecology, soil science, or soil management.",
    "1. The textbook contained too much information to absorb in this class - but I liked how Mark extracted from it what he found most important, and I'll be glad to have the textbook on hand as a reference going forward. The papers we read were excellent in terms of pushing the limits of my understanding and provoking me to think in new ways.2. Some concepts could have used extra - and slower - explanations.",
    "This course was very useful, but there are some things that could be improved.",
    "The course was excellent but covered too much in too little time.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Mark is an excellent professor with a brilliant mind who clearly cares a lot about student's learning. That said, I would have learned much more if I had had adequate background upon the course starting--the institution of prerequisites for next years course should rectify this problem. Also, I don't know if this can be addressed, but Mark literally speaks so rapidly that it is difficult for me to follow sometimes.Overall though, excellent and enjoyable course.",
    "Q7 Prof. Bradford is a good teacher, but he does mumble and talk rather fast making it hard to understand what he is saying.Q9a Field trips did not address common soil science field techniquesQ9b Lab activities were hindered by lack of lab equipment necessitating waiting in line to use scales\/meters.Q9c The in class stats session was complete waste of time because it was much too basic and we did not accomplish anything. Knowing how to sum and average in excel should be an assumed qualification for graduate school.",
    "I have no interest in soils but Mark was a cool prof.",
    "I thought the class discussions were particularly well-run, interesting and useful. I especially liked that only a few papers were assigned for each one, making it actually possible to read and discuss them each.",
    "Question 5: Mark was very receptive to student input and made some very important changes to the course based on our input. i greatly appreciated this and I think it made for a very productive class.Question 3: Our discussions of carbon and soil carbon were especially interdisciplinary and very helpful.",
    "6)I anticipate that many will comment on the pace of this course. While the professor's in class delivery was undeniably rapid, I think it was appropriate to cover the necessary material and imparted an asssumption that we were knowledgable and had done the reading--and that assumption is refreshing and appropriate for a masters level course. Michael Strickland did occassionally go too fast when answering questions.9) The lab work for this course was excellent and a definite highlight. The ability to engage in a professor's field work through a course is an infrequent opportunity at FES, and this course sets an excellent example that should be emulated. Labs were extremely well run (with the exception of there being a shortage of some equipment) and the field trip was very well executed."

    "Learning everything you need to know to understand soil science research papers.",
    "-relevant, up-to-date readings and discussion",
    "The focus on ecology and nutrient cycling was much broader than other soil classes I have investigated. Mark is a good teacher and can stay focused on the big picture. Also he drew in many \"state of the field\" ideas that gave me a much better sense of what scientists have a handle on at this point and what we still do not know.",

    "The overall framework that Mark presented for thinking about soils and the state of soil science.Mark's lecture style!The discussions - interesting papers, and Mark is extremely good at leading a discussion.",
    "I loved that the field\/lab work was part of a real project and therefore relevant, rather than an exercise in reading directions. That was much more motivating, and it was good to understand that those techniques ARE actually used by professionals.The textbook was helpful. The instructor was very receptive to student questions and interested and clearly enthusiastic about helping students understand concepts.",

    "The discussion part, where students could learn beyond the textbook from the instructor.",
    "The lectures were consistently outstanding.I enjoyed the field trip to Queens. Working with Mark and the TAs in the field and in the lab was a great learning experience and also very inspirational.I enjoyed the selected journal articles that we read for discussion sections. The fact that they were relevant and so contemporary made them very valuable. They also linked very nicely with material that I was covering in other classes.I was especially impressed by Mark's consistent focus on how he teaches and why he focuses on certain areas. His candid comments on how he structures his assessments and what his academic expectations are for grad students were refreshing. I was most impressed by his willingness to be self-critical and to be flexible and try out new approaches during the course of the class.",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps for those who want a more taxonomic approach to soil science, a separate optional lab\/field course could be offered, but from the perspective of someone more interested in soil ecology I feel that more emphasis on taxonomy would be unnecessary.",
    "The pace of the class was too fast given that there were not any pre-requisites. The material was taught very quickly with little time to digest certain concepts.I also would have liked to learn more about how soil \"matters\" in different contexts - re: climate change, in policy making, human interactions, etc. Sometimes I felt we learned such small details about the chemical properties of soil but we never applied it to real world scenarios. Maybe the prof should not have taught the material is if not everyone in the class was interested in going into academia.",
    "Making sure everyone's on the same page, though prerequisites should help in future semesters.",
    "-unpredictable tests. the first was reasonable but the second was needlessly easy.-some of the readings were very advanced and hard to understand at our level.",
    "I would have liked it to cover a bit more soil tax so that I could make more inferences about soil type, moisture regimes etc. at my field sites. Mark's idea is that that is something you can learn easily if you need to but having someone who has done it before show you the nuances is really important in any tax class from plants to birds. You need someone to show you what to look for and then you can move on learning on your own.",
    "preparation for the first exam",
    "Would be good to look at one (and only one) soil pit.",
    "I think the textbook reading assignments should have been presented as \"if you don't understand something in the lecture, or want\/need further detail, check out this section in the textbook.\" I only used the textbook in that way, because the level of detail was much greater than what was required for the class and I did not have time to do the reading for my own interest at this point.I also would have liked more of the lectures to be given by Mark. I enjoyed working with Mike the best in an informal way - I really liked the sessions he ran for us on analyzing the lab data. The lectures of Mike's that I really enjoyed were the ones at the end - on soil organisms, and the section of the statistics lecture that he gave.",
    "The discussion readings often seemed to start from a point where students might not have had much understanding yet. Perhaps having an in-class summary of where the readings are going or some sort of background prior to discussion days might have helped give students a better starting point to understand the basis of the readings and what to look for. I think this would have generated better discussion.Also, the instructor is enthusiastic, but the primary thing I would change would be to ask the instructor to speak a little slower, especially during lectures. Since the class is learning, it takes a little time to absorb material enough to be able to ask questions and take notes. I know that this was especially difficult for many of the international students.The other thing I would suggest regards exams. The class was given no prepfor the first exam and word-for-word assistance with some of the questions for the second exam, probably to help make up grades for the first. I would suggest an approach in between these two, perhaps with a couple sample \"old\" or hypothetical exam questions with sample answers a week prior to the first exam. Perhaps the instructor could go through these example answers to highlight what the key elements of a good answer are and what a couple pitfalls may be, just to make sure students are on the same page as the instructor.",
    "Clarity on prior knowledge that the professor assumed students possessed.",
    "Lab session organization, equipment. Statistics portion.",
    "Having practice exams from a soils class as oppose to another subject.",
    "The design of the tests. The first test may have been too hard, but the second one was too easy, especially since it covered less material.",
    "too much textbook",
    "The speaking rhythm of the instructor.",
    "Mark is thoughtful and responsive teacher who takes his pedagogy very seriously and I appreciate this a lot. However, he needs to slow down the pace of his words at key moments in class. Often, he speaks too quickly and leaves us all wondering what it is that he just said. He generally did a good job pausing to ask for questions, but the speed at which he was going prior to the pause makes it hard for me to formulate questions (and I had many)in time before he takes off again at breakneck speed.It would have been nice to have had more clarification early on about the nature of the final presentations.It would be helpful to have a TA-mediated review session before the first exam.",
    "1) Discussions. From the articles chosen to the way in which the discussions were run. Some articles were above a level that seemed appropriate for the class.2) Preparatory sessions for both the mid-term and final exam. TA should have a little bit of material prepared to kick off the session and should strive to provide less dismissive answers to questions."

My own research interests lie in aquatic systems so I especially wanted to get a better feel for some of the major ecological processes going on in terrestrial systems, which I feel like I definitely got from this course. Soils are such an integral and important linking system between other systems (aquatic, atmospheric, etc...) that there's really a lot of important stuff that anyone could learn from this course regardless of their previous background and research.",

The big idea that came out of this class, which was the extent to which we don't understand many things about not only soil science but many areas of ecology - and the extent to which you need to be discerning about the science that you read - is something that transcends soils and will impact the other classes I take. I also really value that the specific knowledge I gained about soils is not the type of stuff you memorize and file away, but rather the beginnings of an understanding of how many complex factors relate to one another. This understanding still feels somewhat diffuse and hazy to me, but I feel like I at least have a sense of what are the moving parts in the system, each of which I can delve into more in the future.",

I think in lab it helped that there was some friendly competition between groups to see who could do things most efficiently.",

This was not such a taxing assignment that it 'sucked', as many group assignments end up doing.Disadvantage: coordinating schedules. This group was pretty great at working together, so the disadvantages were relatively few.",

    "The group presentation was well designed and a good assignment. It enabled us to go in depth on a topic where we had to read a lot of primary literature, etc on our own. It was great to do in a group instead of on our own, as we got to split up the work and help each other understand the concepts that we were presenting. I really enjoyed it.",
    "We were able to effectively split up lab work and for the final presentation we were able to explore a complex subject from a number of different angles.",

    "For the fieldwork and labwork we worked in groups. As with many groups, it was a mixed bag. Some of my partners were very helpful and we worked well together. Others were more of a struggle, but I think that the struggles are valuable experiences as well. In the field, some of my groupmates simply did not have much field experience and it was an impediment to our getting the sampling done in the short time window that we had in Kissena. It would have been helpful if the instructors had emphasized that everyone needed to be more familiar with the procedures before we went out.I also did some group study in preparation for the midterm and the final exams. It was a self selected group and we were very productive and mutually beneficial.",
    "Advantages: Opportunity to become closer with class peers. Opportunity to learn about a topic beyond the purview of the general coursework. It was a pleasure to observe all of the group presentations--we were quite an impressive group after all!Disadvantages: Finding a presentation topic that would be of future relevance to all three members of the group."

Answer briefly and concisely on the exams.",
