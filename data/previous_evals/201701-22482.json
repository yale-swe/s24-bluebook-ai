   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about cell signalling pathways, the ways different types of cancers work, the clinical implications and treatments available, as well as the way clinicians think about cancer. I also improved in my ability to efficiently read papers about cancer research, and gained insight into the way researchers think about investigating\/ answering cancer questions.",
    "This course gave significant insight for me into the history of cancer biology, the canonical problems and approaches of those in the field, and of emerging new areas that may offer exciting new research and treatment options. One thing that I learned at the course's outset, which I had no understanding of at the beginning of the course, was the system by which tumors are graded and scored, as well as the pathological analysis of tumors via histologically stained slides. I had no idea how difficult it was, or what to look for in a tumor specimen. Very interesting.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of cancer biology and how it relates to patient treatment.",
    "Learned many of the fundamentals of cancer biology. Additionally, covered many recent articles that helped develop my skills in critically reading recent literature regarding cancer research and become more familiar with some of the experimental techniques in the field.",
    "It really tied together my understanding of different fields of cancer research."

   "comments": [
    "The strenghts of the course are in its organization, and in the drawing from faculty and physicians to teach. The order of classes made a lot of sense and helped to learn. Further, having the experts in the field teach the classes was not only inspiring but also extremely valuable because we could ask questions to the people who were\/actively doing the research. I thought that the quizzes in recitation were unhelpful, and found that I often tried hard to focus on the minutiae of the paper rather than the concepts and experimental methods so that I could attempt to do well on the quiz, since it felt like thats what they often focused on. I would have gotten more out of a longer discussion of the papers and their methods than the quizzes. I wish there had been a little more immunology, and less of a focus on the cell cycle. Finally, an extra lecture on genomics would be really interesting.",
    "This course spent a lot of time focusing on basic cell biology (i.e. cell cycle) that I have seen several times in other courses in undergrad and at Yale. I believe that other graduate students at Yale are also familiar with this material. I did appreciate the historical perspective of how researchers learned about the importance of certain processes, but felt that sometimes there was too much focus on this, especially at the beginning of the course. I would have liked more of an emphasis on recent topics in cancer biology. Some lectures were very engaging and informative (i.e. Sam Katz, Jun Lu, Marcus Bosenberg). In particular, learning about mouse models of cancer was very interesting. I would have liked to see more of this so I could learn about the methodology that is currently being used to study cancer. Some of the quiz questions seemed to focus on trivia-like questions as opposed to big picture, conceptual questions about the reading. I found this frustrating. I'm an MD\/PhD student who was required to take this course for my departmental requirements. A lot of material in this course was redundant with the medical school curriculum (the first few weeks on 'clinical aspects of cancer', all of the cell biology related lectures, many of the disease focused lectures at the end of the course). I wish I had the opportunity to take a more advanced course about cancer (i.e. the cancer seminar) instead of this course- I think I would have gotten more out of it and been more engaged overall.",
    "The course provided some clinical insight into the cancer problem, which I like very much. However, some of the lectures are a little easy for us. Personally I have learned a lot of the them in cell biology classes.",
    "The variety of lectures gives a broad overview of the field. I would say that the recitations are a definite strength - I felt that we were really learning about these areas, and our TA did an excellent job leading discussion. It was also good practice for public presentation and small group discussion. Largest weakness was probably the amount of \"required\" reading. At first, I tried to keep up, but I quickly fell behind, and eventually realized that with so many papers and chapters assigned each class there was no way to actually stay on top of the material. This shifted my thinking to that of many - that the readings were really just suggestions, and for the second half of the course that's how I viewed them.",
    "I thought the course syllabus was very well thought out. Sometimes I think the instructors tried to cover too much in a given class period, although this was necessary given the timeline of the course. Perhaps presentations could be better timed to fit in the allotted class period.",
    "The strengths of the course was that it was well organized with a variety of speakers covering a broad array of topics."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, this course filled in a lot of the gaps in my knowledge about cancer, and piqued my interest in other topics. I think anybody who wants to research cancer or is interested in cancer research would benefit greatly from this course!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with no background in cancer biology. For students with even a little cancer background, I think more advanced courses would be appropriate.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to first year graduate students considering a project in cancer biology, as it is an excellent overview of the field.",
    "I have already recommended this course to some of my peers as I found it an excellent way to learn more about cancer biology. I feel much better prepared for my future research in this field.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to get an overview of the main principles of cancer biology."
