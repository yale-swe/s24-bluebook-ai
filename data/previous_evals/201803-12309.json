    "I developed an understanding of multivariable calculus. This included intuitive skills that helped to determine how to approach and solve problems.",
    "I learned about calculus in multiple variables, including derivatives and integrals as well as vector calculus and different coordinate systems. I learned how to problem solve and take problems step by step.",
    "I learned about various mathematical concepts and picked up quite a few skills. Plenty of it was quite interesting. It was the first multi-variable calculus class I'd taken so I had an introduction to the next level of mathematics. Built on my previous knowledge greatly.",
    "Learned how to do double and triple integrals by hand",

   "comments": [
    "This class is just one whole weakness. From the fact that there is ONE single good instructor to how poorly written the tests were.",
    "It should have been more focused toward teaching toward the midterm and final.",
    "Some sections are weaker than others. I had a friend in another section that was getting more structured teaching that would've been beneficial.",
    "I really liked how much resources there were in this course, especially the practice problems available and Ximera. The course builds on itself with the material gradually, and it gets more difficult especially after the first midterm. I think the only thing that I wish was improved was if there were solutions to all the problem sets.",
    "Felt that course material was not tied towards any sort of real world application. What is curl? What are the physical implications of a conservative function? I know it's a pure math class but I would have enjoyed a bit more engagement with real-world applications. However, I do feel that I picked up skills and how to use the ideas and concepts to solve pure math problems.",
    "Anibal was a good teacher but taught as if this was a proof-based class or perhaps similar to what he taught at Princeton. The course as a whole is terrible. It moves at an extremely fast pace and the \"curve\" is messed up by the students who have already taken multivariable (there are quite a few). Many students fall behind and do poorly.",
    "This course doesnt focus on applications. You learn how to do things but dont know what any of them mean. Feels pointless.",
    "It requires a lot of extra practice. It would be better if we can cover more problem solving techniques in class."

   "comments": [
    "No unless you have Sudesh.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student though the other student would have to be good at working on his or her own and reaching out for help at office hours when it's needed.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I learned about calculus in a great depth, and this class did a good job in exposing me to the various aspects of calculus. It was challenging and sometimes I would be really confused as to what I am doing although it was a computational course, but I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend it, the math is important for doing anything higher level. The course was fine, didn't blow my mind but I'm happy I took it and moved to the next level of mathematics.",
    "Only if it is required",
    "No unless needed.",
    "Do NOT take this course unless its a prerequisite. Its not fun and doesnt feel insightful.",
    "Yes if they need it for a stem major."
