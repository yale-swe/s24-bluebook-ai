    "Definitely take it as soon as you can! Freshmen year is a good time to start, I wish I had!",
    "Research for credit.Your experience depends entirely on your PI. There wasn't even a group meeting component when I took it. Definitely worth it to do a year long one...otherwise you won't have substantial enough work for a senior project.Having our final papers due on Spring Fling was a bitch.",
    "You have to.",
    "Chem 490 is a great way to get research experience and to try out what graduate school in Chemistry might be like. It's also a good way to form good connections with professors and grad students. I learned more doing research than I have in any of my classes so far.",
    "If you're taking 490, it's probably because you're a chemistry major and have to take it. How it goes depends on whose lab you work in. If you find a good lab, it should turn out to be a really good experience. My only regret is that I didn't do research for credit before my senior year.",
    "Chem 490 is a requirement for the major, but it is also a great opportunity to start learning research techniques and methods of thinking. Definitely take it if you are majoring in chemistry or just like research.",
    "Good opportunity to figure out if chemistry is something you want to pursue later on. 10 hours a week isn't too bad"
