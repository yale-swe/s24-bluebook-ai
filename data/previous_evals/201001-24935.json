   "comments": [
    "Okay, so, here's the deal. Measure Theory is awesome, Fourier Analysis is fine, and ODE's as explained in Beals makes ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NO SENSE. Professor Neusel was a bit of a train wreck, but she was only here for the year, so, yeah, take it if you must, and just be aware that the semester will start out great and then turn into misery by the end.",
    "Math 305, unfortunately, is not the fabulous class Math 301 with Prof. Howe was. However, if you enjoyed the material from 301, you will enjoy this material as well. The teaching varies depending on the semester, and I don't believe Prof. Neusel will be teaching it next year, so shop it first.",
    "Math 305 was sort of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the material covered was pretty interesting. However, the book (Beals) is awful. There are numerous typos, mislabeled hints, and incomprehensible proofs in the book, and it can be pretty frustrating trying to learn from that. Prof. Neusel was sometimes unprepared for lectures and didn't seem to really have her heart into teaching, but she was a visiting professor so I don't believe she'll be teaching it anymore. Anyway, Math 305 has interesting material, but check out the professor before you sign up. It's notorious for attracting poor professors.",
    "Good material. Hopefully they'll assign a better prof next time around.",
    "The material is more interesting than 301, especially the unit on fourier series and their applications. The professor this semester (who was visiting) just copied the book onto the blackboard, so we learned entirely from Beals, which became a problem at the end because the textbook got sloppy. I would recommend the course to a math major if you get a decent professor.",
    "Don't take this because you're interested. It's not interesting. Take this because you're a math major and you need the sequence of analysis. The material is incredibly disjointed and boring. If you're interested in measure theory, take measure theory and integration. If for god knows what reason you're interested in ODE, take a diffeq class. If you're interested in Fourier series, this class will teach you absolutely nothing you didn't already know about them.",
    "Math 305 is one of the better math classes I have taken at Yale so far. The course material was interesting and near the end of the semester you focus on two topics which are great applications of the course: Fourier series and ordinary differential equations. It is a good continuation of Math 301.",
    "You learn some measure stuff, some Fourier stuff, and some differential equations stuff. It's a little random at times. Easier than 301.",
    "This course is pretty easy, but the material is dry. It's just second semester analysis, and the book is horrible, and the homework problems come from there, which sucks.",
    "It's hard. But it's interesting. If you were comfortable in 301 and it, go for it.",
    "I recommend taking this course, because it will help cement the material you learned in 305.",
    "Tough class, exams not well prepared.",
    "If you liked Math 301 or 300 you should take this course.",
    "would recommend it. the textbook was full of errors towards the end, though."
