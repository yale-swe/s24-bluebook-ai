   "comments": [
    "This is a multifaceted look at development assistance, a subject of very practical importance today. If you're interested in the politics of aid, take it! You won't find a better one. And Simon is awesome and brilliant!",
    "This class is really interesting, I really enjoyed it even though I'm not into poli sci. If you have any interest in international affairs, take it. Great professor too.",
    "if you can get in, TAKE IT. It's a total gem for those interested in development assistance. The focus is on politics, which ends up being so much more interesting (to me) than the logistics.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interest in the subject. The readings are not terrible and Professor Simon rarely bases the lectures on them.",
    "If you're interested in global affairs\/social and economic development studies, definitely. You need that interest to gain a lot from the readings, which were fairly heavy each week (but necessarily so).",
    "Take this class, one of my favorite seminars while at Yale. The topic is engaging and one has the sense that this is pertinent. Prof. SImon is wonderful with his students and cares deeply about making sure that we understand the concepts. He goes above and beyond!",
    "A very interesting overview of the problems that arise with development assistance -- what works, what doesn't, and what will have to change. There are 3 short papers and a 15-20 page final term paper which is very open-ended. Definitely take it if you're interested in international development.",
    "would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in international development and political science",
    "I would reocmmend this to any student interested in development work, especially those who don't know where int he field they fit. I would also recommend this to students who are interested in the topic and want to learn more about what makes effective assistance.",
    "Political science 430 is a great class on aid -- you will learn a lot about all the different aspects of aid",
    "I would recommend the course to MBA students interested in development and politics."
