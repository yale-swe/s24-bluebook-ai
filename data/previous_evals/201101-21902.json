   "comments": [
    "Yes. Prof. Chang is clearly very passionate about the material and you'll come out of the class appreciating Chinese literature a lot more.",
    "Great class, but you should have some humanities writing background as the class evaluations are based on papers.",
    "I would recommend this. Opened up my eyes to a new genre of literature, and getting to know Professor Chang was worth taking this course. Her skills as a scholar are unparalleled. Moreover, the class was one of the most relaxing I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this course! You will love poetry and develop a greater appreciation for Chinese women's literature! Because the course is taught in English, I was able to go through a lot more material. However, I really want to read the pieces in their original text now!",
    "I would definitely take this class! A very interesting course about Chinese women writers throughout Chinese history. The class is fairly low-key and the workload is pretty light (mostly reading and three manageable papers spaced throughout the semester), and Professor Chang is just fantastic. She makes class really fun and her lectures are always engaging. I'd never taken a Chinese literature course before, but I learned so much in this class without having to spend that much time on it. If you're even remotely interested in Chinese literature I would recommend this course!",
    "This is absolutely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I learned A LOT and was never too stressed out to enjoy the learning experience. Professor Chang makes this course so wonderful. She's truly a gem. Take it, and make sure you do the reading and allow yourself to think about the poetry on a deep level.",
    "Recommend!!!",
    "It was very fun. The workload was perfect, but occasionally there would be a lot of reading. So watch out for that. Overall I really enjoyed the course!"
