    "I learned a lot about post colonial literary theory, learned how to read fiction when applying it to theory, and also learned to articulate my own theoretical ideas",
    "You learn a lot about the core texts, debates, and methods of analysis in the field, in addition to reading some great \"world literature\" while thinking about these themes. An incredible class that reshapes the way you think about texts entering the world.",
    "This class was an absolutely fantastic comprehensive review of world literature and theory and an incredible exposure to concepts, themes, and authors that I can't imagine not having read.",
    "I understood what the world was at last.",
    "This course offered a very helpful survey of postcolonial literary theory and contemporary theories of world literature. I developed a much broader and more nuanced understanding of the current intellectual terrain, the politics of the \"world literature\" debate, and the ways in which authors adopt or refuse those theories in their creative works. I was also pleased to read quite a few novels and authors that I had never encountered, and to place those works in conversation with more canonical texts in order to generate some exciting new questions."

   "comments": [
    "The course covered varied literatures and academic texts that provided a useful overview of world literary theory. It was very useful and satisfying as a student to see how the material built off itself as the course progressed. It felt like one long conversation rather than several stuttered fragments of one, and that was really helpful.",
    "The course really hinges on discussion, but sometimes we'd get so engaged with one text we'd forget to talk about others",
    "I absolutely loved everything about this class!!!",
    "The workload was rather high.",
    "I really appreciated the arrangement of the syllabus (theoretical works paired with creative fiction works) as well as the cadence of the class discussions. We usually spent the first half of each session with the theoretical material, and then shifted to the novels, which we could then consider through the lens of the questions we had already posed as a group. I found this method very productive and engaging. The weekly forum posts were also helpful in generating group discussions. For such a small class, we had some really stimulating and exciting conversations. My only suggestion for improvement might be to build in some time throughout the semester to periodically loop in earlier readings and discussions -- though the readings flowed from week to week, it was easy to lose track of some thru-lines on a longer scale."

   "comments": [
    "Any student would learn a lot from this class about how the world is dealing with multiculturalism, and the texts assigned for it are fantastic reads. Professor Newell is also highly engaged and leads and mediates discussion really well.",
    "Yes yes yes, but be ready for your head to hurt for a while.",
    "Absolutely - a phenomenal course with an even more phenomenal professor.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Though it did require quite a bit of writing (weekly posts, plus a longer final paper than most other courses), it generated some really interesting discussions and questions, and the materials prove helpful across many different disciplines and fields of interest."
