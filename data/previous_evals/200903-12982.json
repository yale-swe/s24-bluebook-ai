    "The class contained a lot of great material. Unfortunately discussions were very undirected and chaotic.",
    "there was a wealth of information presented in the course but not in any logical or clear manner. Besides the themes of each week's topic the course lacked in overall structure.",
    "The sequence was clear - it is impossible to cover the entire architectural history of Venice in one semester - so it was smart to focus on specific architects and their projects each week. The one research assignment was a bit daunting - but was helpful in training us to deliver long presentations and directing a class discussion. After the class presentation, the paper seemed superfluous. Also the paper was difficult to research for - since a lot of the resources were in Italian.",
    "The course has been very clearly presented by the professor and it has had a very clear structure.",
    "i thought it was a great sequence of material, an excellent view of the history and architecture of the city and how it influenced or was influenced by the surrounding region. i think it was a good balance of historical and more modern work and architects.",
    "the course relied too heavily on student presentations.",
    "The body of material for this course was rich and wonderful. I wish, however, that the course had been less rigidly structured around student presentations. There should have been much more emphasis on discussing the readings. Also, Dan should have lectured more formally instead of interjecting with such frequency in the midst of student presentations.",

   "comments": [
    "I expected this course to give me a broad look at the city - which it did. Student presentations kept class interesting. I wish we could have met with Peter at the end - scheduling problems interrupted the class too much.",
    "I hoped to develop a thorough knowledge of Venice as a historically complex place of architecture and culture. I believe that this expectations have been fully met.The professor has great knowledge of the subject matter and has been very informative. The structure of the course has allowed for a great deal of discussions among students, which has provided a very active learning environment.",
    "yes, overall i found the course very informative and i was excited to focus my research on a very precise topic.",
    "My expectations for the course were met. I learned a tremendous amoung about the city of Venice, thanks to the care and intelligence of my classmates and the great insights of Dan.",

   "comments": [
    "The class was valuable as a discussion of modern intervention in a sensitive context. Also as a story of a city, Venice is incredibly interesting since it features so many cultural and historical intersections.",
    "It has been great to not only learn about Venice, its history, architecture, culture and urbanity, but, in the mean time, to also engage in discussions about architecture that extend far beyond the main theme of the course. I have found this course to be very valuable in these terms.",
    "this class has a fairly high value to me - it fit in well with the other classes i was taking this semester, adding to my overall understanding of a place and it's history and context within the architectural scene.",
    "This course opened my mind to a number of new ideas and possibilities for thought.",

   "comments": [
    "The instructor was an extremely valuable resource but could not present information in a concise and logical manner.",
    "Dan is incredibly informed - but perhaps could edit his commentary and the content of the class to keep the discussions more focused.",
    "Daniel Sherer possesses great knowledge on the subject matter.He has been very energetic in sharing this knowledge with the class and constructing an environment where further learning can take place.The structure of the course has been instrumental in achieving this.The students were required to present a full lecture, each week, which has resulted in extensive research done by our part. During the presentations Prof. Sherer has been very involved and has further informed our interests on the specific topics.I felt this course to be truly advanced and serious. In return, completing the research and actively contributing in the learning environment has been a great pleasure.",
    "dan was incredibly effective - he conveys a deep expertise of the subject matter, engaged us all as architects and not historians, was passionate about the material, and encouraged us to find a piece of the material we were passionate about as well.",
    "professor sherer possesses an incredible encyclopedic mind however his persistent knowledge of all things sometimes limits the discussion.",
    "The class simply should have been taught in a more effective and careful manner. The student presentations were strong, but because of this, the students tended to teach the class more than Dan ever did.",

    "The course needs more structure",
    "I think the paper was an extra requirement after the presentations. The class was a success because the students were particularly passionate and invested in the subject matter (perhaps due to the concurrent Eisenman studio).",
    "It would have been nice to have had the chance to hear Prof. Eisenman speak to our class in the context of the subject of the course. Perhaps next semester something should be organized to make up for this missed opportunity",
    "i think the inclusion of the tradition of the biennale in venice and its effect on the city and architecture would have been great.",
    "i would vary the student presentations with more guest or professor lectures which extend the discuss to greater extents...i can only image what the last class would have been like...",
    "Student presentations should have been shorter. The reading list should have been less focused on history and more focused on theory(more Tafuri!)",
    "The Venice seminar indirectly set a bad trend this semester that was out of the instructor\u0092s control. As a student within the elective it was easy to see that the material discussed and produced was different than the studio production of each student in the class. However, on the surface, students that were not enrolled in the course saw the Venice studio-elective combination as a setup that validated developing the same work for two classes. Throughout the fall, I definitely noticed an uptick in reusing studio material for electives or the same work for two electives. When these students were asked about this process, most of them typically referred to the Venice studio-elective combination as a way to validate their actions, even though they knew nothing about the elective course material or the Venice studio. Taken back by these responses and the school's recent actions when it came to work integrity, I made sure to distance myself from these students and to produce four very different projects in all four of my classes."
