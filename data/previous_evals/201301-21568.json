    "The class moves at a much faster pace than 132, yet it didn't feel overwhelming. I actually put less time into Chinese this semester but that depends on your starting point (I was very uncomfortable speaking in Chinese before last semester). You'll watch Chinese dating shows, have more discussions in class, and have the chance to revise essays before delivering your oral presentations. The class has become a strong community even across sections, and Liu laoshi is as perfect as ever! I truly feel so happy and lucky to have gotten to know and work with my classmates and Liu laoshi; they were and are wonderful.",
    "Chinese 142 is a challenging continuation of Chinese 132. The work load gets heavier since you learn more lessons per week, all with more challenging vocabulary than the previous semester. However, it's so rewarding. Your Chinese gets a lot better and you can concretely tell that you've improved. Definitely take it, since Liu Laoshi is such a great teacher.",
    "If you can take it with Fan Liu, take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student because it is a very well taught and immersive class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 142 to other students. Liu laoshi is fantastic. Homework takes 1-2 hours each day, and the class meets 5 days a week. The work is more tedious than difficult, and hard work is rewarded proportionally in this class. This is mostly a recommendation for the 132 142 sequence, since these courses have to be taken together anyway.",
    "Chinese 142 is a high-workload, high-reward class. Homework and studying for the daily quizzes maybe takes up an hour or more a day. On the other hand, your Chinese level will very noticeably be elevated.",
    "Chinese 142 was absolutely amazing. It was my favorite class even though I'm premed and an MCDB major. The professor, Liu Laoshi, is the sweetest lady in the whole world. She is so much fun, so energetic, so happy, so effective and efficient and great at what she does.Liu Laoshi makes Chinese so exciting and fun to do to the point where I felt I'd be okay with just doing Chinese homework for hours a day. Just being in her presence makes you a much happier and lively person. She brightens up your day and makes learning so so so enjoyable.She cares about you outside of the class, asks about how your day is, talks to you personally if you're depressed about something going on in your life, asks what you're doing for vacation, informs you about fellowship opportunities, has lunch with you to discuss your life (something that lots of professors don't do, in actuality), and so much more. She is your professor, your role model, your mother, your friend, etc.Her ability to teach a foreign language as hard as Chinese is unparalleled. I've taken numerous languages before with different professors back in high school, and she is by far the greatest.She has so much experience. Before Yale, she held VERY HIGH administrative language department roles back in China. After that, she worked at Princeton for a few years. And now, she's at Yale. So she clearly has phenomenal credentials which would explain why she is so extraordinary.She is an incredible human being and an incredibly understanding and intelligent professor as well.This class is a MUST TAKE if you're a heritage Chinese language speaker.The following is an personal testimonial from myself that I used as a caption for a photo that Liu Laoshi and I took together at the end of my year with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo my Chinese professor, Liu Laoshi, who is in fact the greatest professor I've had at Yale whose class I just finished taking today:I will miss you so much that it makes me really really sad to think that you won't be my professor anymore next year.I learned so much in your class--a lot of Mandarin. But most of all...so much about myself, who I am, what I stand for, and what matters in life.You cared about me as not only a student, but as a friend and like a son. That meant more to me than any applicable grammar point.You were always there to sit with me for hours to go over essays that had endless egregious errors. You were there for me when I was struggling with my sexuality with my parents and willing to have lunch with me and offer to transcribe my future novel into Chinese. You were there for me when I felt directionless...unsure of where to go in life.It really hurts me to think that I won't be able to experience your smiling face every day, and your positive energy you seem to always have no matter how bleak things may be.You made me realize that every cloud has a silver lining. Thunderstorms end with thin rainbows. Sunsets are always followed by sunrises.In this picture, I am smiling...but inside, I'm crying--crying that I am losing the one class and the one person that made me excited and happy to go to class every day. Crying because I know that I'll never have a professor who is as amazing, compassionate, and caring about me as a human being as you are.You taught me much more than just a language. You taught me what it meant to be happy. And for that, I will be forever grateful to have had you as a professor. You made my freshmen year truly worth having. And I wouldn't give it up for anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
    "Compared to the first course (lv3) it is much more work. In the first few weeks, you go through two sections a week. Be prepared to put in more time, especially if you thought the first course was relatively easy compared to your classmates because you started at a higher level.Also, the focus of learning shifts from learning vocabulary to learning grammar (at least for this year). Quiz material is just passages from text, having someone read the text to you while being able to write is down is a sufficient indicator on how you will do on the quiz. Most passages are word for word, or close. The tests did not focus on listening-> writing as much as grammar and writing sentences. This is subject to change though, so be careful.I would recommend this class to another student who took the previous class, because it just makes sense to. You fulfill your requirement, its a good class.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 142 especially if Liu lao shi happens to be teaching it. It's a difficult course with a lot of work, but if you keep on your toes it should be doable."
