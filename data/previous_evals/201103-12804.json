   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to everyone. This is perfect for those you looking for a nice bio lab that is not so stressful and doesn't feel like a waste of your time. I definitely learned a lot and wasn't stressing out about the course.",
    "Jack should be considered a teacher for this class, he helped so much and was very supportive! Challenging lab! You get to work on frogs, earthworms, grasshoppers and do NASTY stuff to them. Haha. Hope that piques your interest. Grading is not too difficult, but this lab is exhaustingly long. Don't count on making it to your dinner plans on lab day.",
    "This is a pretty good lab. Much less work than gen chem or orgo. Bob's labs are pretty long and he talks a lot, but after him it gets much more interesting.",
    "I would recommend this lab. Jack is the best! However, be warned, the labs were extremely long (til 6pm), and not always successful, however, that was a learning experience on its own. My only real criticism is that there was a lot of waiting around since Jack and Dr. K were the only ones who really knew what was going on. There were no full lab reports required - just the results and discussions. They also weren't due after each lab, but try to do them right away or else they'll be pretty painful.",
    "Neurobio lab is a great lab course - the experiments you do are very interesting and allow for you to develop a range of techniques, from dissection to using microelectrodes to measure the electrical potential of photoreceptors in Drosophila. We do a lot of electrophysiology in particular. Professor Kronengold is excellent and very helpful. What's nice about this course is that you are able to explore on your own, as opposed to other \"cookie-cutter\" labs in chem and physics. Finally, the write-ups are not exceedingly long or difficult, with the professors asking you to analyze your findings.",
    "The labs can be frustrating and very tiring, but at the end of a day they are a worthwhile experience and supplement MCDB 320's material very well. Jack was awesome!",
    "Yes, take this lab. The fist session you may be overwhelmed and frustrated that you won't be able to leave until 6 p.m. but you will ultimately end up forming a community and really gaining practical knowledge and a heightened understanding of what is being taught in the Neurobiology course. By the end, you will be a master at dissecting frog leg muscles and nerves. Hopefully they will get better oscilloscopes next year."
