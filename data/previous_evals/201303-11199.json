    "An amazing course! The material is engaging, practical, and presented in a informal manner. Skolnik makes a point of getting to know each student and making himself more available than professors who are on campus full time.It is a very good introduction to global health, building from a solid foundation that is set at the beginning of the semester. It is taught in a very interactive style that is incredibly engaging and teaches you quickly how to synthesize, use and present the material quickly. At the end of the course, you are able to have a conversation about the global health without struggling for information. Truly amazing!",
    "This class is a very accurate and comprehensive introduction to global health. It is interactive and students often get called on in class, so doing the readings is paramount. It is also a good lesson in public speaking.The IMHE database website (heatmap) is supremely important. Bookmark it and study it in your free time.I would definitely recommend this class to another student, it teaches a lot of important qualitative life skills that most other classes do not bother to teach. It is also a great introduction to global health.Professor Skolnik is an excellent instructor. He is willing to take time out for students and give them advice on all sorts of things.Zerrin, our TA, is also excellent. She will be the TA for Spring 2014 as well, and she sets out so much time to help students with any questions they may have.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in global health or is planning on becoming a doctor, in which case I believe they should know more about global epidemics. However, if you're only slightly interested I wouldn't suggest this class as it is a fair amount of work and you might get bored of the subject material.",
    "This is by far my favorite course I have taken at Yale so far. If you are in anyway interested in global health you must take this class. It really gives you a new perspective on the world that I would not have had otherwise. If anything, just take the class for professor Skolnik, he is amazing and funny and incredibly smart and is a pleasure to meet with three times a week (I was in his section too). The reading is not bad at all! Skolnik writes the textbook so expect it to be very easy to understand and enjoyable to read. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Yes, absolutely take it. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and Skolnik is a phenomenal professor.",
    "Awesome introduction to global health. An unusually direct, practical, and non-academic class for Yale - in the best way possible. You come away with a much better understanding of the basics of global health, though little in depth knowledge. Professor Skolnik is very available and very willing to help you out, and the TA was also excellent. Also not too much work, especially for a WR credit!",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Take this class - if you can get in. There's a lottery every semester so good luck with that. But if you can make it into this class you will never regret it. This class confirmed my desire to pursue global health as a career and every topic was extremely interesting to learn about. Even if you're not pre-med or public health, you will enjoy this class.",
    "Take this course! You learn several key points in global health. Going into this course, I thought it would be a lot of reading on specific cases, and I was very happily surprised to see that each lesson focused on a few main messages in that area of global health. Professor Skolnik is amazing and makes the class really fun.",
    "Solid WR credit. Skolnik is self-obsessed, but it's almost endearing. Can be a drag at times, but it's important and worth taking.",
    "If you are interested in global health, take it. If you are not, still take it.",
    "Incredible course. Learned so much just by listening to Skolnik talk about problems in global health. Great introduction into global health, and really makes me want to take more classes.",
    "I would recommend it because it is a good overview of the current state of health in the world, and it is not too much work. The professor is very involved and engaging.",
    "Good luck on getting in the course! You learn a lot, Prof. Skolnik is amazing, and the classes are entertaining. The professor is quiet the character so be prepared for that. And make use of the course. You will rarely find a professor who is so willing to invest in his students, so well versed in his subject, and so professional. The classes are very well structured and I think everyone should be required to take this class before they leave Yale. The class is an introduction to the inequalities that persist in the world, and as a student from a developing country I think I learnt to view the problems I have seen throughout my life in newer light.",
    "It's really good. The discussion style is awesome",
    "Yes. This course is a phenomenal introduction to the field of global health for the uninitiated. Skolnik is great and very available to talk outside of the class about work in the GH arena. Although also valuable for textbook knowledge, taking full advantage of this class means getting to know the professor \/TA \/ other students. HLTH330 is another option that might better suit students with some experience.",
    "I would recommend the class for those who would like an introduction to key concepts in global health. For those who have extensive field experience working in global health, or for those who have taken more applied global health classes, then 330 might be more relevant. One must be open to learning introductory level material. The course load is fine.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in public\/global health and want to get a better understanding of disease around the world. Also recommend this class to pre-meds and other's interested in health-related professions in the future who may not know what area of medicine they wan't to go into. This class gives you an understanding of perhaps where you can have the biggest impact as a health worker.",
    "I would recommend HLTH 230 to another student. I feel you learn a lot about a very relevant topic. I feel I have more knowledge leaving the class and about something I never knew before. I feel every student should have some knowledge of global health. However, I would say it is difficult being a student not majoring in some sort of health studies. At times I felt I was one of the few student who didn't have outside knowledge of global health. That being said, I did well in the class and do not think it detracts much from the experience.",
    "Health Studies 230 is an excellent and eye opening experience. The professor is one of a kind. He is engaging, interesting to learn from and listen to, and most importantly, encourages discussion and dialogue.",
    "If you are at all interested in public health you should definitely take this class. It covers all the basics you need to know, as well as providing useful information for those interested in actually going into the field (both premeds and non premeds).",
    "Yes!! If you get in, take it! You will learn so much, and it will help you become a better, more critically thinking student.",
    "This is a great class. Skolnik is the highlight; he is extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and gets the class inovlved well. Try to get to know him out of class! Otherwise, the content is a good introduction to the health problems facing the world, and the ways people have tried to deal with them. As a non-premed and non-health student, this was immensely informative, and inspired me to look more into the field.",
    "This class is truly amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has even a fleeting interest in global affairs, global health, or policy. This course is truly a crash course in the major issues of global health and the thinking that goes into coming up with the solutions for these problems with help any student who takes this course grow in their field of interest, even if it isn't health. You will learn so much about how to think critically and succinctly. Also, the professor wants you to succeed to he will take the time to make you a successful student. I couldn't speak more highly of my experience in this course.",
    "Absolutely! This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale in seven semesters. The readings and papers were exactly what I needed to learn the material, and I felt that the time I spent on them directly translated to learning. Section complemented the course nicely. Professor Skolnik calls on students directly and it's disconcerting at first, but you'll get used to it after a couple weeks. Everyone actually contributes and learns much more because of it! Overall, a fantastic survey course that successfully conveyed a number of key principles in surprising depth.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Regardless of how much global health experience you have had in the past, you will learn so much from this class. Professor Skolnik is an amazing lecturer and a real Yale treasure. Even given the fact that he was only on campus three days a week, he was always making time to meet with students to discuss global health and offer career advice. If you're taking this class in Spring 2014, you'll also have Zerrin as a TA, and she was absolutely fantastic this semester. Workload is entirely manageable: three 5-page policy briefs, a midterm, and a multiple choice final. However, one thing this class also taught me is that the field of global health, at least at Yale, is a magnet for obnoxious type-A personalities who are absurdly career-driven. Perhaps it was a result of Professor Skolnik's reputation within the global health community, but it was obvious that many students in the class would repeatedly go out of their way to impress or suck up to him both inside and outside the classroom, perhaps thinking that his good grace would be their ticket to a glamorous global health summer opportunity. If you're the type of person who gets turned off by that kind of behavior, you won't make many friends in this class, but you'll at least still learn a lot.",
    "Yes. Prof Skolnik is a great professor to learn from, and you can get so much just by sitting in class and listening to him. Also, the policy memos were very fun to write. If you choose your countries well, you can find a wealth of information in the Lancet, on NGO websites, and other scientific journals and learn so much from the research experience.The class offers very practical information. About as pre-professional as one could get at Yale."
