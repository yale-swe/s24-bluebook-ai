    "I would recommend it to a person interested in the specific modules or who had little experience in wet lab research. I think the physicists got more out of the course than the biologists in terms of learning new techniques. I don't think this quite replaces a rotation, especially since we don't get any choice about the modules in which we participate. It would be nice to have more options; for example, I would have liked to try something purely computational.",
    "Recommended for all PEB students. It's a great way to pick up new techniques and think about research questions from several different perspectives. More importantly, it's an important bonding experience for PEB students who come from a number of different departments and thus don't interact on a regular basis otherwise.",
    "It is definitely a must for people who wants to be exposed to research done at the interface of wet-lab experiments, theory and computation."

   "comments": [
    "I did learn about particle tracking and coding, but I think I would have gained more from a full rotation in that regard. Four weeks isn't long enough for us to be independent, so it was mostly running code that was given to us rather than learning to write it ourselves. It was a fun course, and I enjoyed it, but I don't think in the end I gained as much as I would have from a full rotation in any one of the labs. The modules were also all fairly similar; I would have appreciated a bit more breadth.",
    "I want to incorporate the elements of wet- and dry-lab into my research. This was definitely a good prelude and experience to allow me to further think about the different ways to do it."
