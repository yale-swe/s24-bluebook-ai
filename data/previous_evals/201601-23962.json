   "comments": [
    "Take this course. Period, end of discussion. I dont care if you have no interest in trains or French literatureyou dont need to. The course had great discussions of thought-provoking works across a wide range of time, and is taught by a thoughtful, passionate, and helpful professor. I unexpectedly learned a lot about writing, close reading, and literary analysis. A true hidden gem that I recommend very highly.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. Professor Cadieu did an incredible job curating a course around the niche subject of trains. I never thought I could ever be so excited about trains, and yet this class made me so. We looked at trains as literary symbols and political tools. The course materials were diverse in genre and style (literature, poetry, film, art... also primary sources at Beinecke). Professor Cadieu is excellent at talking with appropriate rhetoric in-depth about different genres. I also think it was a very effective course in its focus on writing. I never knew I could write so many sentences analyzing just one sentence from a text... Prof. Cadieu taught us to be close readers and articulate writers. She also taught great revision skills. I would without a doubt recommend this course to another student.The close reading and analytical skills you get from it are great. The class is always engaging - I never looked at my watch to see when it would be over. Also the projects are interesting. For example, we got to build things at the CEID! And, the workload is completely reasonable. This was my favorite course so far at Yale.",
    "Yes! Please take it -- you will learn so much, and you will enjoy doing it!",
    "Take any class that Professor Cadieu teaches. She has high expectations but will help you surpass them if you go to office hours and participate in class. She is absolutely brillant but also absurdly kind and really cares about her students. Trains (FREN 307) is a cool class in that it lets you look at many different literary movements (from 1890 to the present day) with one particular theme in mind. Talking about trains can also be a fun break from more uptight classes."
