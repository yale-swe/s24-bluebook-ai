    "This course is an amazing way to learn the nuances of ecology and to really get a sense of where the field is at. It's intellectually stimulating without being overly challenging, and is incredibly well-taught and engaging.",
    "This is a great class. It's mostly a course on community ecology (big focus on coexistence) and it's big on theory. There's a lot of math, but understanding the mathematical basis of theory is crucial for ecology, and this is a really good course for getting more exposure to that and learning that. The structure is lecture on Tuesdays and activity\/discussion on Thursdays, which I really liked. I took it credit\/d as a second semester senior, and I know I would have gotten a lot more out of it had I been devoting more effort to doing the reading.",
    "A fantastic course if you're interested in research\/grad school in ecology. This course surveys the main areas of community ecology, right up to the present day. It is still definitely something of a survey course, but after taking this class you'll feel prepared to wade into the ecology literature or show up to a conference and understand the active questions at the heart of the field. Vasseur is great, and the class is very informal. You'll have opportunities to swap ideas with grad students and speculate about unsolved problems - great preparation for grad school if that's what you're considering. The workload is very manageable and the exams are fair. The class definitely has a theoretical slant, so don't expect to learn much about fieldwork or your favorite critter. But if you are interested in the \"big questions\" in evolution and ecology, take this class!"
