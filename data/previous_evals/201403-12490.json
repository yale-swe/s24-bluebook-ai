   "comments": [
    "This class is great fun and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in playing chamber music with their peers. The time commitment is perfectly reasonable - studio class is every other week; groups have one one-hour coaching each week and are expected to rehearse at least an hour independently (many will do more than an hour). First semester repertoire is chosen by the coaches but students have second semester input. If you like playing chamber music (and want to get credit for it!) by all means take this class.",
    "Chamber music for undergraduates at Yale, at its most organized and high-quality. Introduces you to a community of undergrad musicians and gives you a way to play great chamber music with coachings and performance opportunities. Lots of time for a 1\/2 credit, but worth it and always fun.",
    "A fun chamber music experience that I highly recommend. Everyone in the class is very talented by the end.",
    "Take it if you want to get credit for chamber music. If you're a wind player, be warned - audition with a group already in mind because they don't really know about the needs of wind players.",
    "Do it! It's about 3 hours a week of chamber music--what's wrong with that?",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you love music. You'll get to perform with a group of musicians, prepare a complete piece every semester. It's a lot of fun, and it gives you the opportunity to meet all the other music-minded undergrads. The coachings are great, and so are the biweekly seminars. Definite recommend.",
    "Fantastic class where you get to play fantastic chamber music with fantastic people. The final performance at the end of the semester is highly rewarding, as are the bimonthly studio class performances. The grad student coaches are almost always excellent musicians and excellent teachers who can give you new perspectives on playing.",
    "Music 220 is a great class for any student interested in playing chamber music. Though you must audition to be admitted, there are eight groups so many people get in. It is a very rewarding experience, since you will see how much you improve playing a piece over a semester. I would highly recommend it to another student, because it has definitely helped me grow as a musician throughout the semester.",
    "Yes!! I loved this class, and was lucky to be put in an amazing ensemble; definitely grew a lot musically, and it's just wonderful to perform with a group of talented musicians and listen to others as well.",
    "If you're a serious classical musician at Yale, take this class! It is not hard to do well, but having it be a class makes everyone (for the most part) take the music\/rehearsals\/coachings much more seriously.",
    "MUSI 220 is a course that encompasses structured chamber music study, with weekly group rehearsals and coachings with either a faculty member or graduate student assistant. There are also (roughly) biweekly studio classes in which about half of the groups perform movement of the piece on which they are working. At the end of the course, the Sunday before reading period, there are two final concerts, each with half of the groups performing and about 2 hours in length, which, while interesting and musically enriching, is a significant time commitment as reading period begins (attendance is mandatory at both). I would recommend this course to another musically inclined student (it's audition only) because it's a really neat opportunity, getting credit for chamber music. The coaches are all amazing, and listening to the other groups is a valuable experience as well.",
    "Great course if you want to play chamber music and receive very helpful coaching.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another musician. The class is a perfect opportunity to play chamber music with other students. Since it is an actual course, everyone has more incentive to keep up with the music\/rehearsals\/ etc.",
    "Of the most animated and thoughtful music instructors I've ever had. Her coaching s always gave me new angles to interpret and play the music.",
    "Chamber music has been one of the best things I've done at Yale. If you like playing chamber music, take this class - it forces you to learn 2 amazing chamber pieces per year, and to be surrounded by inspiringly awesome musicians."
