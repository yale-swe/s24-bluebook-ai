    "I would definitely take it if you are interested in finance or hedge funds or just want to learn more about the industry - great senior seminar.",
    "Take this seminar if you are passionate about finance and will be working in finance post-graduation.",
    "The course is great for anyone interested in understanding the landscape that hedge funds operate in. It provided a good balance of the technical material so it is manageable for most.",
    "Yes, definitely! Econ 444 is seriously one of the best econ classes I've taken at Yale. The material is fascinating, challenging yet understandable. Professor Pascutti is one of a kind and you will not regret taking a class with him! He will tell you stories that will blow your mind and leave wanting for more. It's a lottery process getting into senior seminars but if you do get in, take it!!!",
    "You must have a background in finance to take this course. Overall it lacks structure and can be overwhelming. It was often difficult to figure out what we were expected to know for the midterm as well as problem sets.",
    "Great class and a MUST TAKE (if you're interested in the material). Really caring prof. who puts in a lot of effort.",
    "Yes",
    "Grading is sketchy if it exists.",
    "This is basically two totally separate classes. First half is a fly through of Corporate Finance and option math with psets and a midterm. It is not difficult math and barely requires a calculator (PEMDAS stuff) but it is tricky. Second half is qualitative on the industry as a whole. If you are ever thinking about working at a Hedge Funds definitely take this class. It gives you a great perspective on the whole industry and all the positive and negative aspects of it. Prof Pascuitti is very chill and really fun in class."
