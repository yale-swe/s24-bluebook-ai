   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely. The work is manageable and enjoyable. It never felt like that much, though I'm sure it was a considerable amount. I looked forward to writing my essays. You'll be inspired by the majority of the pieces you read, and you'll want to better your writing to the level of these authors. It's essentially creative writing for non-fiction. Doesn't get better.",
    "The course introduces you to a variety of different types of writing. You get to read essays by excellent writers, and get your writing critiqued by professional writers. It definitely widened the scope and improved the quality of my writing.",
    "English 120 is a good class because it finally allows you to explore essay writing outside of the context of high school book reports or research papers. You have 5-6 papers that you turn in both rough and final drafts for. Mr. Ball was a very good teacher, but a little slow on the grading.",
    "Take the class. If you can write, you'll really love it. If you can't, it might be a struggle for you, but you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "This was a great class that helped me hone my writing skills in various genres of creative non-fiction. Its strengths lie in its small size and great class environment, which led to some great and interesting discussions over texts. It's a fantastic seminar class that allows you to make friends and personal connections with your peers and professor. Some of my favorite memories of this semester are from English 120, and I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "I'd never really done non-analytical writing before this class, and at first, I missed having literary works to write about and I wished I'd taken something like English 127. However, I feel like this class ended up helping my writing a lot, and I enjoyed the essays we read. It was a good first English class to take, and Mr. Ball is funny and intelligent.",
    "It is a comparatively fun writing course for students with some writing ability. The papers do not exceed 5 pages, the feedback from the professor is thorough and helpful, and the discussion style of the course keeps the student involved in the material. Also, this is a course where one can appreciate the abilities of his peers and be appreciated in return.",
    "Lots of reading, lots of writing. I would recommend it.",
    "ENGL 120 is an excellent class. Mr. Ball is a top-of-the-line professor who makes his instruction easy to understand, to remember, and to apply. He takes great care to return your work with plenty of feedback. He does have a high standard for writing, which makes the class both difficult and rewarding. I became very close with my English class, partially due to the intimate writing topics, but also due to the comfortable environment Mr. Ball cultivated. He also invited us over to his house for dinner at the end of a semester, which was the perfect ending to a highly-enriching, fun class.",
    "I wouldn\u0092t recommend English 120 to another student. I didn\u0092t enjoy writing in the style we were writing and I don\u0092t feel as though my writing improved."
