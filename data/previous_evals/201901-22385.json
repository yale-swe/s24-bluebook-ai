    "This class solidified my foundation in cultural studies, supplementing the huge gap left by my other department.",
    "An awareness of the space I can stake out for myself as a participant in class and how I can signal my intellectual stance through multiform participation with the materials and with others.",
    "A way of thinking historically about African-American Studies and Black Studies as fields as they coexist with other realms of inquiry in the contemporary academy.",
    "In Theorizing Racial Formations, I gained exposure to many different disciplines and methodologies that I had not studied before. Throughout the semester, I kept coming back to the questions: What is African American\/Black Studies? How does one produce responsible interdisciplinary research? What has been accomplished in the 50+ years since African American Studies and Black Studies became disciplines and departments? And, what remains to be done? Although I was encouraged to think broadly about interdisciplinarity through the readings and class discussions, I was also given the space to interrogate my own ideas and research goals through the assignments. I gained more familiarity with library resources, relevant journals and archives, seminal texts, and the state of the field.",

   "comments": [
    "There were some weeks with far too many readings which meant that not every text received the attention it deserved, and folks were not able to read everything, even if they wanted to. Also, I'm not sure why we read \"Between the World and Me.\"",
    "The strength is the course's richness and breadth, covering a wide range of contemporary and classic debates in Black studies, while it's weakness is its attempt to cram too many readings into too little space. The result of this weakness was overly selective reading on the part of the students, while the strength was the student's ability to find room to maneuver through the material as they desired.",
    "While we received feedback as a class, it would be helpful to receive individual feedback. It is very difficult to chart one's performance otherwise.",
    "I would suggest reducing the number of readings, especially at the end of the semester grew quite heavy. I also would consider allowing students to present important works in their discipline in lieu of having several weeks dedicated to fields of study that are important (i.e. political science, quantitative sociology, anthropology) but have complicated relationships to black studies that cannot be captured by one monograph. In other words, I think the class right now is trying to be 50% survey of disciplines and how scholars have sought to think alongside African-American intellectual traditions in those disciplines and 50% a survey of the canon of African-American Studies as an established field. I think students may be better served, depending on the direction of the Department writ large upon its 50th anniversary, by a survey of the African-American Studies and Black Studies canons. I say this because I think the dual-admittance policy at Yale ensures that students get the disciplinary training in their respective (white) field of study and that Racial Formations should be uniquely undisciplined. By this I mean, I think several weeks need to be dedicated to black feminist thought and practice, black Marxism, blackness and psychoanalysis, and how blackness relates to structuralist and post-structuralist thought. I think of essays like Brady Heiner's \"Foucault and the Black Panthers\", Sylvia Wynter and Edouard Glissant's essays in Alcheringa (in addition to \"For Opacity\"), an excerpt of Baldwin paired with an excerpt of Between the World and Me, and a greater emphasis on blackness construed globally through figures like Denise Da Silva whose work is dense, but even 5 pages of could instigate an important conversation. Additionally, I think of contemporary trends via the queer of color critique, which brings race, sexuality, material and libidinal economies to the fore, and the Afro-pessimist turn that is bringing affect, history, and ontology together in exciting ways. These themes are foreshadowed by CLR James, Du Bois, Anna Julius Cooper, and Ida B. Wells (and then also by Hazel Carby, Hortense Spillers, Barbara Christian, Patricia Williams, Sylvia Wynter). Just some thoughts.",
    "Overall, I felt that the course structure was beneficial and served its purpose as an interdisciplinary core class from African American Studies from which students will build their own research throughout the rest of their respective programs. The syllabus was well organized and each week's topic directed my reading toward specific questions that shaped the course and encouraged me to think about how various methodologies and disciplines inform my own research. The assignments were well-timed and useful without being overwhelming. I appreciated ending the course with a research proposal rather than the typical research essay\/article. Given the large class size, the reading load seemed imbalanced regarding class discussion. The conversations were difficult to follow and participate in because the class wasn't building a common vocabulary and it felt dominated by a few voices. Near the end of the semester, the class seemed to find a comfortable zone for conversation but that seemed to be more by happenstance than by design or instruction.",
    "More queer theory and gender studies on the syllabus",

This course is great for students who want to test a few of their ideas for future projects and tweak their research agenda in a room full of scholars from various departments with different investments and skills.",
