    "It's a standard L1 romance language class - it's a fun language, but the course is not well-structured. The curriculum is not at all geared toward speaking the language (there isn't even an oral component to the final!). Instead, grammar\/vocabulary is emphasized. I would prefer to be somewhat fluent in a casual conversation after one semester than well-versed in the subtleties of the subjunctive\/conditional tenses, but I can't really judge the language program until L3-L4. Prof.ssa Lyons was great, though. This is certainly no criticism of her efforts.",
    "This is a great way to learn so much Italian in a short period of time. Prof. Lyons is really nice and willing to help you outside of class. I literally learned more in a 1\/2 year of this class than all of high school spanish.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to start a totally new language with others who are new to the language too. The speed at which you are expected to master tenses and vocabulary is challenging but manageable. There during each unit there would be vocabulary quizzes and chapter test"
