    "I found this class to be both uninspiring and inapplicable to what I am interested in.",
    "The class provided a great opportunity to delve deeper in watershed processes and attempt to understand complex problems at the edge of what we know or think we know...",
    "It is difficult to comment on how well the instructors taught the course because the instructors didn't actually teach the course. It is a course taught almost entirely by students. Frankly I think it was a waste of resources to have two instructors and a TA for this course. During most class sessions the instructors sat amongst the students and participated in discussions minimally.",
    "A forest hydrology course is essential to this program and I was very happy that this course was provided this semester. The profs seemed a bit like they didn't understand the readings sometimes which made some discussions a bit tricky.Good articles, if not a bit dense to get through sometimesThe speakers were great overall. I like this model of class.",
    "Field trips would've been great. Would've liked a more interesting set of assignments. You didn't need to understand the papers to write the responses.",
    "I think this is a great idea for an advanced course and should be taught each semester, just changing the specialty\/ field.",
    "Most of the time, the bi-weekly readings were interesting and useful, but I did wish the professors and\/or the TA had vetted some of the articles more carefully beforehand, as there were certain ones which were either impossibly dense or seemingly unrelated to the week's topic.I also wish the professors and\/or the TA had done more prep work with the visiting speakers so that the speakers could have discussed the topic which we had read about beforehand. Generally the visiting speakers spent most of their time presenting about an altogether different topic (usually whatever their current research focused on). Not that those topics were uninteresting, it just felt like a lost opportunity since we were really quite prepared to discuss the topic which we had read about.My primary comment about this course, however, is my disappointment in the total absence of professor lectures. I knew the course was going to be rooted in journal articles, but I was really hoping for at least some participation from the professors. I was often confused about some of the basic hydrological\/biogeochemical principles underlying the article content, and wished there had been a little more background instruction. The student presentations rarely accomplished this task, the TA was not readily available for outside help, and the professors did not provide any background reference materials for those of us that may have desired it. The few times Professor Saiers jumped in to address a question were very valuable, I just wished that had occurred more often."

    "A few of the speakers led engaging lectures, however, about half of the speakers were hard to follow and uninteresting.",
    "The opportunity to consider watershed topics in depth and hear from some of the leading researchers in the country.",

    "The format of this class was unusual. We read 3 papers and discussed one week, then the next week the author would jet in and talk to use about what we had read. It was great to concentrate on the primary literature and to meet the author and ask what about this, what about that, etc.",
    "Mostly interesting papers.",
    "I did like the style of reading the articles, writing about them, discussing them, and then being able to focus and understand what the speaker was talking about.",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "The class structure was awful. As experts in their fields, the professors should be teaching the subjects, particularly complex and difficult one. Instead, the class structure was such that students gave presentations on subjects that they knew very little about and guest speakers presented on extremely focused subjects with little relevance to an interdisciplinary impact-focused school like F&ES. What is the point of having professors if they don't teach?",
    "I would have appreciated some ability to influence which speakers and which papers we read... unfortunately the topics were not all interesting too me. If the class had some choices we may have been able to maximize the \"interesting\" topics rather than have the professors dictate to us what there interests were.",
    "Discussions of the readings chosen by each invited lecturer were never actually discussions and assignments functioned mainly as a way for the instructors to gauge whether students had read the assigned papers. There was little time left after a speaker's talk to engage in discussion.",
    "Some work about the same topics, but from different authors would improve the learning.",
    "The choice of topics. Few of the students seemed to be engaged in the papers that we discussed and the guest lecturers who joined the class. I think the choice of topics didn't reflect the management and applied focus of the student body.",
    "maybe more of a focus on a specific watershed issue that relates to management",
    "It would have been nice to have a little more mix of presenters - my favorite presenter was the first because he still seemed to be conducting research directly with students. Also, it would have been nice to have a female hydrologist present (given that females' work was frequently cited by their male counterparts).",
    "Matching readings and presentations could be improved upon, though this is difficult if the speaker makes changes in presentations, available papers, etc.",
    "The format of having students lead the discussion was useful, but I think there could have been more balance in terms of having the professors do some of the lecturing as well. I think I would have learned more if Raymond or Saiers took over a bit more.",
    "More integrative assignments.",
    "Discussions were extremely boring and often we would feel guilty if the discussion leaders asked a question we were not sure of and then no one could answer. I would have liked the instructors to take a more active role. It is good to have student involvement, but I would have liked to hear their academic perspective on the article, why it's important, and what they think could be improved. The style of a boring discussion where we tried to tear down the validity of the author's work seemed unhelpful for my learning.",
    "The professors need to take a more active teaching role in the class. The class was presented initially as being a good but comprehensive overview of watershed hydrology for all students to take regardless of their background. But the professors did not help teach any of the necessary underlying concepts to bring the class up to speed. That was a disappointment, and made the class very challenging especially since some of the scientific readings for the course were very high level papers.",
    "It should be smaller, and every student should be required to give a presentation.",
