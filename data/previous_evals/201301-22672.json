   "comments": [
    "Take notes on the powerpoints given in class because most likely they will not be put on ClassV2.",
    "Yes, this class was worth it. However, it's basically a recap of Spanish 120 with more intensive grammar lessons. Though they may need some better stories, I feel much more confident with the language.",
    "Take it if you have too. Reymundi is as good as any other.",
    "It is a good course to finalize grammar study in Spanish. It helped that we did a lot of review in the beginning, and I felt my Spanish speaking and writing improved immensely.",
    "It's going to be pretty much the same as L1 and L2 in terms of format, except you should expect significantly more writing on quizzes and exams. I would say this course definitely favors those with strong writing abilities.Also, be prepared to spend some concentrated time on the homework. Give it 30 minutes a day and you really won't have to study for the tests at all.",
    "Reymundi was great. She's the best spanish professor. Incredibly nice, but also helpful, funny, made class fun and truly interacted well with students. Take her if you have to take spanish IIIYou're probably taking the class b\/c you have to. Expect 30 min\/ night of hw. Plus an hour or two to study for each test\/quiz\/redaccion.",
    "Expect to do a good amount of work and be ready to prepare for exams, but definitley useful in learning the language.",
    "This is a great class! I think all of the language classes at Yale are excellent, and this one definitely met my expectations. You will learn a lot and your proficiency in Spanish will definitely improve throughout the semester.",
    "Great L3 class. Not too intense. The readings were interesting if you wanted them to be. Take it!"
