    "Q 1 - there weren't really any readings or text books for this class. Cases were presented in the form of guest speakers. Many of these speakers were not really very engaging. Some of the sessions were not very relevant or useful. The theoretical lectures on business analysis models, etc. in the beginning of class were more useful. It would have been good to include more lectures on client engagement and dealing with different client situations. These concepts or lessons were not conveyed through the guest lectures, as was intended. Q4 - the pace of learning was slow because these guest lectures were not as relevant and did not always drive home the lessons of client engagement and business and environment that we needed.",
    "This class is the arena to trade theory in for practice at FES. My experience was incredibly valuable and challenging, but it will differ on which client and group you are assigned.",
    "There are no readings in this class that I was aware of -- you primarily learn through your interactions with your teammates and your client. The guest lectures were interesting but I didn't get a ton of learning out of them. This class is helpful in gaining consulting experience, and was helping when interviewing for internships. I will take this class again.",
    "The class is a very interesting space to have direct contact with a client and work on a consulting project.",
    "I thought this course would cover consulting cases and how to build frameworks and model business data, but it turned out to be heavily focused on project management and administrative tasks. I wish Maureen had lectured more herself, I didn't find the guest lectures that useful."

    "i liked the client projects and the structure of creating the plans for the client with relevant & useful feedback",
    "The experience of dealing with a real-world client and project. There is so much to be learned from actually dealing with team dynamics, client expectations and requirements, practical aspects of project implementation, etc.",
    "The speakers were very informative and were a nice supplement to the client projects",
    "If you don't have a lot of experience working on real projects for clients, this will probably be good exposure.",
    "The best aspect of the course is the exposure to real organizations and projects.",
    "Getting to work with a client >>> very good experience.",

   "comments": [
    "i think the bar is set very low for this class and students take advantageous of that. a second deliverable, like a useful tool, or some other takeaway should be part of the assignments. 5 page report is almost nothing and seems vacant for a team project.",
    "The guest lectures. There were too many and not all of them were relevant or engaging. Most students were quite disinterested. It would have been good to have more lectures that directly addressed theoretical concepts or best practices around team norms, client engagement, dealing with sudden\/major changes in the project and unforeseen circumstances, etc. It would also have been great to have a few more days when no class or meeting was scheduled so that teams could use this time to work on the project.",
    "Dedication and selection of the clients- the client was not involved at all which made it very difficult to succeed",
    "The client projects this semester were disappointing and poorly formulated. Although this is called a Business clinic, most of the projects were for non-profits, which is not the point of the class. The guest lectures were a random compilation of subject matters and areas, and I didn't learn anything or find them interesting or relevant. They really need to be refined into some kind of cohesive theme or structure, because as it stands right now they are just a bunch of random people sharing fairly basic information. I felt that most of the class assignments were busy work- the short in-class presentations were totally pointless and distracted from the client work we were supposed to be doing. The final paper was also pointless for our client and was just extra work for us. Maureen is a very nice woman but needs to align her class better with what students are interested in and what's going on on campus. When the CEO of Unilever came to give a lunch talk, she should have encouraged her class and guest speaker to go, instead of chiding everyone for leaving class early. She doesn't seem to be very plugged in to what's happening.",
    "The most challenging aspect of the course is the group dynamic with individuals who might be taking the course for different reason than you. The guest lecturers were not that valuable to the actual coursework. They provided the opportunity for student to meet practitioners but provided little to no value-add to client projects. This class required a lot of out of class client time but I would suggest either scaling back guest lecturers or add class time to go over best practices more thoroughly. These lectures would go over the basics of how best to manage a team dynamic, how to communicate concerns while still appeasing a client, how to write a \"business-formal email,\" etc. Those skills would have been highly valuable to our client work.",
    "Class time is not the most helpful; I appreciate the guest lectures, but felt like they made for more diverting story time than helpful business experience tips.",
    "Since it is a class, it may be better if projects are designed more doable within limited time. Otherwise, evaluation of the deliverables should not only based on how well the results look like.",
    "The clients were mostly public sector, NGO, or small boutique companies. Even the teams that worked with large corporate clients seemed to work mainly with their CSR arm. Would have been more educational to have clients that actually deal with business operations.",
    "This could be supported with readings.",
    "I didn't see the value of in class lectures and speakers. I think the clinic could be structured like the EPC clinic, with only a few good speakers and check in meetings so we can focus our time on project work.",
    "i wish we could do a field trip. also, some text books or QUANTITATIVE support for our projects throughout would be helpful and very professional.",
    "It is not a direct aspect of the course, but some clients are not very responsive\/useful in providing information. This generates a delay in the whole project and sometimes harm the pace of the class. On the other hand, Ms. Burke know this, and is flexible with the deadlines."

    "The teams were very helpful to learning. There should be more instruction on how to work in a team and delegate work.",
    "Advantages= expertise of group members and their interest in the topic. Disadvantages= teammates do not always take the project or our scheduled meetings very seriously, coming late or leaving early. Often they would leave their work to the last minute.",
    "This isn't your typical group work because there are two individuals constantly checking in on your progress and work product--the professor and the client. Additionally, you do not get to pick your group in this class. You might get placed with personalities and interests that do not fit with yours.",
    "I learned a lot from the experience of my group mates, and really appreciated that Maureen gave us the opportunity to provide feedback to each other. That was really interesting and helpful.",
    "Discussion and seperation of work is helpful. One can also learn to work in a team.",
    "Some of my teammates had no experience with research and I feel I spent too much time tutoring them on basic skills like how to do a literature review and how to model\/visualize data. This course needs to have a prerequisite like academic writing, or data analytics. Working on a team of equals in a consulting context is difficult because there is no project lead and no one can fire under-performers.",
    "I learned a lot from my group. Each person brought their own strengths. The main drawback was scheduling - keeping up with the client calls, meeting, and editing on our own was challenging.",
    "Good experience working in a group in a structured way. I liked our team a lot.",
    "Diverse background generate useful discussions, and a better final product. On the other hand, we had different schedules and personal styles, which generated some negative discussions, and thus waste of time. The overall experience was positive, because I had to learn how to manage differences and keep the focus on the project."

Be aware that you may not get your first preference or a team that has the same approaches as you, and that there could be complications and changes in the project scope as you go along.",
    "Choose a client that you know will be involved.",
    "Take the class if you're jazzed about your client. Otherwise, this won't be a good use of your time. Feel free to skip the class sessions unless you're totally new to the private sector and group work- most of what the guest presenters talk about is not very interesting or new. Plan to spend a good amount of time jumping through Maureen's hoops- various random in-class presentations and requirements for \"business\" writing.",
    "Considering you do not get to pick your group, work hard at establishing a strong and healthy group dynamic. Work at this at the beginning of the semester while you have the time. Spring break will be a hurdle and time during which you're bound to lose momentum and then you return to high stress deadlines and an eroding dynamic. Also, if your group is open to the idea, assign specific roles or a calendar for when you switch roles. Everyone carrying every task sets you up for a high likelihood of diffusion of responsibility.",
