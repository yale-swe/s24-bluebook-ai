   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in reading tragedies then I would recommend this course. There is a lot of work and a lot of fast paced reading but I think it would be worth it if it was something you were passionate about.",
    "This is a great class for anyone who likes reading awesome plays and discussing\/writing about them! Professor Homans is fabulous--extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and kind. She helped make class discussions interesting. The plays you read are great and there isn't too much writing (4 papers). Lots of reading so beware, but I'm a slow reader and I still enjoyed the class a lot!",
    "Overall, I would recommend the course. Professor Homans is an extremely knowledgable and thoughtful professor, and you get to read and discuss some fairly seminal works as well as insightful, modern ones that have not yet become a part of the canon. While the class dwells a bit excessively on Greek drama (in my opinion), the reading list is a good one. Papers are not too long (about 1700 words, flexible) but require careful planning and thought. Just be prepared to do all the reading; you'll have the best experience in the class that way.",
    "Yes, especially if you can take it with Professor Homans, who is an amazing, incredibly helpful teacher\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you meet with her to discuss your papers and take the time to revise them under her guidance, you will get a great deal out of her class. It's a good survey course, so by the time you start getting tired of Greek drama, you will be on to Shakespeare, and some fantastic modern dramas will be around the corner. The material is generally interesting, and Professor Homans did a good job drawing links across the centuries. Most of the students in my class were freshmen who considered themselves strong English students, so the discussions were mostly interesting, and I learned a lot from my peers. I cannot comment on the experience of older students, but if you are a freshman looking for an English course to give you a firm grounding in many of the works of the literary canon, take Tragedy.",
    "Yes, I would absolutelyrecommend this course without hesitation. Tragedy with Professor Homans was my favorite class this semester. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll read amazing classic works and even some modern ones at the end of the semester. The amount of reading is no small feat, but 100% totally worth it if you find it fun like I did. If you like reading and are interested in tragedy, this is the class to take, and I would absolutely recommend taking it with Professor Homans. She is an incredible instructor who goes above and beyond to make her class the best possible experience for all of her students. She is extremely knowledgeable about the works we read and about tragedy as a genre, and her responses to students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 comments and ideas are always positive and constructive, which made me feel comfortable sharing my thoughts from day one. She is also very willing to meet with students to discuss ideas in advance of papers and always provides very constructive input afterwards, which I believe really helped me improve both my reading and writing. Phenomenal class, and phenomenal professor. Enough said.",
    "I am really glad I took this course. Although it covers material very quickly, I am really pleased with the survey of literature\/drama it provided me. I would recommend it to any student interested in getting a meaningful (if at times hasty) experience of a wide and important swath of books and plays.",
    "English 129 is defined by the books on its reading list. If a student sincerely wants to read the books and plays on the reading list, I would highly recommend this course. This class requires a significant amount of time and effort, but the work definitely pays off. The reading is all incredibly interesting, and it leads to many intriguing discussions.",
    "No. Unless you are a die-hard Shakespeare fan and enjoy reading Greek plays in your spare time, this course is not for you. You are usually expected to read a whole 100+ page text between classes and if you don't do the reading incredibly thoroughly it will be hard to make a comment. Because it's such a hard class, the decision to take it is self-selective. Don't be surprised if the students on either side of you have a sticky-note on every page of Hamlet.",
    "It's a lot of reading, but it's a lot of fun and you learn a lot.",
    "In English 129, we basically read a bunch of plays, from ancient Greece to modern Britain. The papers are manageable, and professor Homans does a reasonable job leading discussions. The class can feel rushed, since we read 1 play per class. I would probably recommend English 129, but with the warning that the you might feel like you're skirting around a million plays and not getting much out of the experience."
