    "Yes, because the class is comparatively reading-light while I feel like I learned a lot about how to analyze short stores and plays not simply from an author's perspective point of view.",
    "The section on short stories is better than the section on plays.",
    "Thisisatwo-partclassthefirsthalfisasurveyofcChekkhovsshortstoriethesecondpartisasurveyofthemajorplaytheteahcingandguidancewasgreat--takethisifyou'reinterestedincChekhov",
    "A great course--you'll come out knowing a lot about Chekhov.",
    "A really good intro to Chekhov. Chekhov's tough to read and it's nice to have MacKay help guide you through things. He's really understanding and interesting and if you have no theater\/Slavic background it doesn't matter. it's also light on work because Chekhov's stories are short BUT the literature is kind of hard to work through. If Nick TAs, TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. He's seriously the best.Overall, such a good intro to Russian Lit\/the Humanities.",
    "Yes - very useful as a Theater Studies student to know both the plays and the short stories of Chekhov; you won't find the latter in any Theater Studies courses about Chekhov, and it's really necessary to know. Also, the emphasis on the course is not on performance study. It's really useful to learn about Chekhov from a different perspective than just performance.",
    "I would recommend this for certain. MacKay is fantastic as is Chekhov."
