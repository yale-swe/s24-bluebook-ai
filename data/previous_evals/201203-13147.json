   "comments": [
    "GREAT introduction to highly debated medical events. I feel like I learned a TON in a very relaxed way, and can actually add some intelligent thoughts to current debates!",
    "Basic bioethics class. Not too difficult, readings are interesting. Latham is great as always.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it, but I wouldn't say that it is great. It's a good way to get an introduction to a very interesting subject, but you won't leave the class with very many answers. Also, it was difficult for me to understand whether or not this class was more religious studies or more political science. I feel like that wasn't articulated very clearly, so I was confused when we had to write a rather religious essay.",
    "Take this class! Really opened my eyes to many topics in bioethics. I thought this class would make me affirm what I already believed, but it actually made me rethink a lot of my views and become more moderately opinionated. Not a largely workload either - midterm, paper, noncumulative final.",
    "Bioethics was a really enjoyable, interesting, and manageable class. Latham is by far one of the most engaging (and engaged - he cares so much about his material) professors I've ever had. He lectures fluently for over an hour without notes, and it's incredibly easy to follow.Go to lecture because it's interesting and because it will thoroughly prepare you for the exams. Yes, readings certainly help, but it'd be incredibly difficult to do well in this class without going to lecture.",
    "YES YES YES YES YES",
    "Professor Latham is a really engaging lecturer and the lectures are always on really interesting and relevant topics. Lots of reading though, probably not necessary to do all of it. 9 am up science hill is a little rough, but the lectures are worth going to.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who enjoys moral arguments and has an interest in national and global health. If you are more interested in law and policy, this class may be a bit frustrating because it focuses on ethical arguments only, not practicality and effective policy.",
    "This class is a pretty thought-provoking course. It is sub-par compared to Bioethics and Law, but Latham still does a great job. It's not too much work, and a good 5th class, but hard to get an A in, so weight your options.",
    "Absolutely take it, especially if you are interested in the sciences; its a great first look into an area you may not have seen much of before!",
    "Yes, even if you don't think you need to. Every topic is important for our society, and Latham is a wonderful professor - one of the best I've had.",
    "Political Science 281 01 discusses issues in bioethics from distinct ethical and moral perspectives, which then relates to many issues and the way each of us faces them. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it was interesting and related to any aspects of life and the readings were not too much.",
    "Latham is an awesome lecturer, but the class was a little frustrating.",
    "easy course, you don't have to do all the readings (just the ones he referenced in class), a favorite course with premeds",
    "It's a little early, but the lectures were well-executed and usually worth going to. The workload isn't too bad, one 5-7pg paper, a midterm, and a final, so I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an introduction to bioethics!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially for anyone who is interested in medical research or pre-med. You will look at almost all of the major issues discussed in bioethics and the lectures are interesting and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class if someone is looking for an easy introduction to some current issues.",
    "Fantastic course. I took it to fulfill my So requirement, and it was both useful and engaging. Forces you to think through ideas and arguments any well-rounded person should know of.",
    "FANTASTIC CLASS! One of the few questions where I looked forward to going to section. The topics are all super interesting and the book is great because it's a collection of articles rather than a standard textbook. Also, Latham is a really good lecturer.",
    "DO IT. Everyone should learn about bioethics; these are issues all of us will have to deal with to some extent or other as everyone gets sick. Professor Latham is brilliant and the anthology he picked for the reading had many different arguments and really interesting cases. It's also not at all difficult, so a lot of bang for your buck! I took it as a fifth class and it worked perfectly as something that I loved but didn't have to spend much time on.",
    "Overall good course \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0Professor Latham said that if he taught the course again, he would change how he structured things (this was his first year teaching it) so I'm not sure if this feedback would be helpful, but the class was interesting broad overview of bioethics with a good workload and fair exams. However, grading varied depending on your TA, but overall enjoyable!",
    "This class is an interesting and low-key intro to bioethics. Lectures are nicely paced (though sometimes a little slow) and are interesting, and you don't have to take many notes to keep track of what's going on. Though readings from the book look intimidating, you can pretty much pick and choose which articles to read (the book is essentially an enormous collection of articles) and if you actually take a look they tend to be pretty interesting. One note: I went into this class thinking it would have a wider scope (animal hybridization, for example), where instead it focuses mostly on ethics within medicine (everything from abortion and in-vitro fertilization to stem-cell research and the ethics of giving people placebo drugs in randomized drug trials and more), which certainly has a lot of topics but isn't everything.",
    "very good",
    "Very interesting course with a pretty minimal workload - good fifth class. Lots of students don't come to lecture, which is a shame, since they're very interesting, and Latham is very knowledgable about the material. Exams are very broad and easy essays, though be warned: easy class does not mean easy A.",
    "yes would recommend,relevant heated topics discussed, presents both sides of the argument and leaves it up to you to think about where you stand",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the topics covered. The course covers them really well and in depth. I would describe this course as a comprehensive study of bioethics since the field originated.",
    "broad survey course on bioethics. pretty interesting class that looks at the issues from several angles. 1 midterm, final, 5-7 page paper, and section. My TA wasn't great, but Latham is a very engaging lecturer. Take it if you think you'll like the topics.",
    "I recommend this course. As Professor Latham says, at least one of the issues covered in the course will affect you personally sometime in your life. The requirements are reasonable, and the readings in the text were very interesting.",
    "Very interesting topics and lively professor, but did not enjoy 9am class at luce.",
    "Bioethics was a really good class, in my opinion. The workload was fairly light (1 midterm, 1 paper, 1 final) and readings were generally interesting. The issues covered in Bioethics were absolutely FASCINATING to me, partly because of my interest in public health, but also because they are dilemmas that we will face in our own lives and witness in the lives of our friends and family members. I would definitely recommend it. It helps clarify the real ethical issues behind things like abortion, physician-assisted suicide, etc.",
    "Prof Latham was an excellent and highly engaging lecturer, though the lack of lecture notes\/powerpoints made it so that it was difficult to know exactly what you missed if you didn't go to class. Exams were very fair and reasonable but so open-ended that expectations were not always clear. Benny was an awesome TA too.",
    "Yes, I would. It's an interesting way to become more familiar with ethical theories and moral ways of thinking about the world. Don't expect answers; expect to learn ways of thinking. Latham is quite engaging, although he does not use any slides, so don't expect visual stimulation, if that matters to you. Also, this means you'll need to get notes if you miss lecture. The paper is not too bad, and the midterm and final are both reasonable: just writing a few essays, very open-ended. Why not? It's a straightforward 4th or 5th credit.",
    "This is a great intro course that raised so many moral questions in my everyday life. It was incredibly thought provoking, profound and well-taught. Hopefully the sections will be smaller next time but if you're looking for a class that doesn't require too much work but is fun and truly interesting then take it!",
    "This is a great class to learn about general bioethics and ethical thinking in general. However, the subjects are broad and you won't find answers.",
    "Not too demanding and pretty interesting.",
    "An interesting, not-too-demanding course that covers current, ethical issues in modern medicine. You'll learn about topics ranging from abortion to genetic enhancement to global health justice. Professor Latham does a good job keeping lectures engaging, and the workload is not particularly demanding. Midterm, final, and a 5-7 page paper, which is actually relatively interesting and fun to write. Readings can be somewhat dense, but the book is pretty good overall. Section is ungraded, soit is pretty low-stress. If you're interested in thinking about the tough questions in medical ethics, take this course.",
    "Good class. Good introduction to Bioethics. Only problem is that it is at 9 am and it takes forever to get anything back\/graded",
    "Take it if you are interested in a casual class that will help you become acquainted with ethical theories and how they affect how we approach bioethics.If you have already taken Bioethics and the Law, the material intersects only slightly, and their approaches are entirely different.I enjoyed the class and thought the readings were really interesting.",
    "I would recommend the class but with the sidenote that there is a lot of reading and the course moves through a number of topics, not always with satisfying depth.",
    "Political Science 281 01 is a class that everyone should take. This is because everyone will die one day. When such situations arise it is difficult to act and think clearly. Therefore, it is important to have some experience with these kinds of issues and situations beforehand. Political Science 281 01 gives people that opportunity.",
    "Issues in Bioethics considers some of the most important questions in modern bioethics, ranging from end-of-life care to reproductive ethics and public health. The topics covered in this class will be of interest to biology and pre-medical students like myself, as well as to those planning to pursue medical law, public health, and other health-related fields. The reading for this course is highly variable, with some lectures having no reading and others having several hours of dense ethical texts. Almost all of the course grade is determined by a midterm, a final, and a paper, none of which are extremely demanding. However, each does require you to draw on specific readings, so you will want to keep up."
