   "comments": [
    "I speak and write French a lot better now!",
    "I improved my skills in writing, speaking and reading French.",
    "My knowledge of french grammar increased significantly. I also gained invaluable practice with both speaking and understanding verbal french.",
    "French 130 is a thorough yet quick-paced tour through foundational aspects of the language. Through the study of three books and two films varying in difficulty, the course covers a slew of fundamental tenses (pass compo, imparfait, plusque parfait, subjunctive), a large number of grammatical structures, and a great amount of vocabulary. The material also works to shape students holistically, aiming to achieve greater comfortability with the language. For me, this was the course in which French truly began to feel like a second language.",
    "In terms of knowledge, I learned a large amount of vocabulary, including colloquial phrases and idioms. Through daily practice and reinforcement, I learned and mastered a wide variety of grammatical skills. Constant discussion of French books and films gave me insight into French culture.",
    "I gained greater access to many more nuances of this beautiful language, bolstered by biweekly exams (in reading, writing, and oral production), reading short French novels (the best part of the course is discussing these!), and writing biweekly essays. My speaking skills in the language still need some work, but that will come with time and more practice, ideally in a French-speaking environment. The constant and thorough exposure to the language that a course like this provides work to emulate as much immersion in French as possible, and it certainly helps--even over short breaks I found myself coming back to the language a bit rusty!",
    "Grammatical knowledge, reading, and listening skills have been greatly improved",
    "I developed a better working understanding of the French language, engrained more grammar and vocab into my muscle memory, and gained confidence in my French abilities (given that we completed a handful of novels, which I never thought I could do).",
    "This course greatly improved my French. By coming to class every day, I built up a familiarity and comfort with the language I haven't experienced before. I enjoyed the balance of speaking, writing, and grammar, and think the world of Professor Koizim.",
    "- I developed skills in reading in a third language. - I developed my grammar in French which I did not take in the last 6 years. - Through the comprehension exercises, I have developed my French listening skills.",
    "I learned more french vocabulary and improved my writing skills"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was greatI don't really have any criticisms. I love Mme Koizim, and I liked the class materialboth the books we read and the films that we watched.",
    "Its strength is that it does a fantastic job of presenting the material in a contextualized manner which allows its students to retain it more effectively. I do not think that this course had any overwhelming weaknesses.",
    "I had a wonderful semester taking this course. I had a very good professor whom I credit for having incited my enthusiasm for the language. That being said, not every professor who teaches this course is the same; different teaching styles, of course, have different effects on different students. For me, learning a language requires a professor who is energetic, excited and relentless in his\/her instruction. Im not sure if I would have had such a great experience had I not had my specific professor.",
    "I cannot think of a single weakness. Madame Koizim makes difficult French at a relatively fast pace feel accessible, and works individually with students when they are struggling. This course was amazing definitely one of my favorite classes of Freshman fall. Of course it is difficult and intense at times, especially because of the daily workload, but ultimately, the routine and constant engagement are incredibly helpful in maintaining and retaining skills. The class is intellectually challenging in the sense that you must stay on your toes at all times. However, especially in comparison to an Art history course and an English course, it is intellectually easier, because being clear, concise, and accurate trumps being intellectual when doing analysis of the books and films.",
    "This course's strengths lie in the passion and focus of its professor (Madame Koizim) and the way it is designed to theme certain grammar and vocabulary lessons around a series of short French novels and films, each of which essentially comprise their own unit. Up to this point at Yale, much of French is based in a single teaching video series, so branching off of that and into a territory of sampling a variety of French texts and films was exciting and necessary. Some of the teaching material feels rather dated (the audio recordings, for example, can often be a challenge to parse), and the fast pace of the class necessitates that every unit seems to end as soon as it has begun, but this also means that we gain a great wealth of information by the end. I am hoping for the future that most of it has stuck!",
    "The strength of the course lies in the strong emphasis on listening and grammar training.",
    "I thought this was a very strong course Madame Koizim showed her dedication to us every day by prioritizing any questions we asked in class, by providing thoughtful feedback on all our assignments, and by crafting extra exercises whenever we requested extra practice on anything. This is a level of responsiveness to students that I haven't experienced in any other class. I always felt prepared for the exams because of our heavy preparation in class.I do think there was an extensive amount of busy work (with the audio tapes, the student worksheets, and the MMP's especially) that made it unnecessarily overwhelming at times.",
    "This course is like a work of art. It's fine tuned to target just what we needed to work on, and the structure of the course packet with works of literature and films was both enjoyable and challenging. I really appreciated the clarity of expectations. My only thought is that we spent a different amount of time on different grammar topics. Naturally, the ones we spent more time with were the ones I'm more comfortable with now. I wonder, then, if it would be better to focus more on fewer grammar topics, so as to really incorporate them into our familiarity with the language. One example is \"avoid + beau\" - while we covered it, I don't feel that I spent enough time with it to really feel comfortable, unlike something like imparfait \/ pass compose, with which I feel more stable due to the time we put into it.",
    "- Strength: forcing us to dedicate so much time for the course, which is very important for a language class. It combines exercises in all aspects: listening, reading, grammer and speaking, although the more time and exercises could be assigned to speaking. - Weakness: Not many weaknesses, but I suggest more exercises for oral production (E.g. recordings from home)",
    "This course was very demanding and the time put in it payed off. There isn't much more to do in order to improve this course."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend FREN 130! Take it with Mme Koizim! She's very scary at first, but she genuinely wants her students to succeed and she has a great sense of humor. The classes are very engaging. Be warned that the workload is substantial. You will have daily classes and homework, but if you're willing to put in the time, you will get a lot out of this class.",
    "I would definetly recommend this course to other students who are looking to become better at speaking and writing in french. Especially if they are willing to except the fact they will get out of the course whatever they put into it.",
    "This is a wonderful course, especially if you are lucky enough to learn under the instruction of Mme. Koizim. She is a fantastic professor and a delightful person. While the material is challenging at times, the course is organized and well thought out, so it is not difficult to find clarity and guidance when concussion arises. The book selection-- Le Petit Nicolas, Ltranger, and Monsieur Ibrahim et les Fleures de Coran-- are entertaining mediums through which to gain understanding of the various grammatical structures in the syllabus. It is nice that while learning French, you also have the opportunity to read good stories. This was by far the most enjoyable course I took this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is seeking to take their language, oral and comprehension skills to the next level, while also having fun. I would especially recommend it to freshman who want to bridge the gap between learning language at a high school level and learning language at a college level.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if he or she has the time and effort to devote to it. Taking a language course every single day of the week--with a hefty amount of homework every night--is no easy task and can be a frustrating time sponge, though the payoff is incredibly worth it. I started learning French from absolute zero at Yale, and within about a year, throughout this L3 course I could read short (and beautiful) novels in the language. That was incredibly exciting, and it's moments like that--finishing an entire book that would have been absolutely nonsensical to me just a few months back--that make the work worth it. Also, don't miss out on the privilege of studying with Madame Koizim!",
    "If you want to really learn French well and be able to speak it when you visit a Francophone country, this is the right course for you",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as long as they have the bandwidth and the space in their schedules to keep up with the intense workload and daily class meetings.",
    "This is a wonderful course. Though many complain about having class every day, I found it very helpful to learn the language. I feel much more comfortable with French, especially with listening comprehension and writing, after taking this class. The expectations are clear, and if you keep up with the work each day, it's very approachable and rewarding!",
    "Yes I would because it improved my French very much and brought my language learning skills on track.",
    "yes"
