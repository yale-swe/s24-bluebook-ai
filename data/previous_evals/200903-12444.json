   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student, but only if they find the topic interesting, it is a very specific class. I feel you really get out of the class what you are willing to put into it, in terms of spending time on the readings and preparing for the discussions.",
    "State and Society in Afghanistan is listed as an Anthropology class, but ended up being more like a political theory\/current events course. It had a good, small group format, but the discussions ended up being repetitive and disorganized. I wouldn't take it unless you're passionate about this area of the world, and willing to put up with very little structure.",
    "This class is for people who are REALLY into the study of Afghan people, but you can get a solid Soc credit for not much work, and its just 2 papers (that are pretty much unrelated to the class discussions\/readings).",
    "Take the course if you want to learn about Afghan society and if you don't mind sitting through failed discussion until Monsutti gives up and just takes over.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to someone who has a deep interest in Afghanistan. For someone with a general background, the class is extremely informative, but if you don't know much and are merely curious, the class might be overwhelming. The readings are dense, but very interesting, and usually sparked good discussions.",
    "Good course. Professor Monsutti has first-hand knowledge of Afghanistan and has lived among the Hazara people and focuses on their migration across the globe. It added a unique touch with this course. Many topics are covered, one each week - which is sometimes a good thing, but sometimes makes some topics last longer than the interest for them. Nevertheless, I learned a lot from taking his course from my previous general and basic knowledge of Afghani people and the current situation there, as well as the history.",
    "Yes, it is a relevant and interesting course, not much work, and the teacher is very knowledgeable and cool.",
    "For someone interested in either a straightforward historical narrative or an American-centered policy approach to Afghanistan, this course might seem maddeningly meandering and somewhat off-topic. But if you are searching for a more nuanced perspective, one that attempts to consider the country in and of itself rather than at the mercy of outside forces, this class offers a unique look into Afghan history and society.",
    "I would recommend this class provided you are interested in the topic.",
    "You don't have to do any of the readings, so that's good. Just a short mid-term paper and a 15 page final paper (both on topics of choice). So the weekly workload is pretty low, but the lectures\/class is pretty boring."
