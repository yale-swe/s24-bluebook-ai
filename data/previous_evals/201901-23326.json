   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "About the same, maybe a little less",
    "Aligned fairly well - having taken a class with Julie and Paul before, I knew what I was getting into - critical thinking and breaking the status quo.",
    "Overall, the themes and processes aligned with my expectations. I think I was expecting to be more comfortable with various CEID tools and instruments and spend more time experimenting\/tinkering, though it's possible our particular client challenge didn't relate to them as much as others. That said, it's so refreshing to be in a class that's truly about creative and critical thinking, coming up with something new and not just discussing \"the way things are\" now.",
    "I love the concept of this class, but I'm less thrilled with the execution. I liked the focus on the practice of innovation. It wasn't just about theories. We actually needed to innovate. However, the teaching team was more knowledgeable about theory and wasn't all that helpful with practice. I thought that I'd learn more practical engineering skills. Instead, I relied on the engineering students in the class who already had those skills. Also, for a course about disruptive innovation, the teaching team wasn't very amenable to being challenged. I deliberately challenged the assumptions of the course in some of my assignments, and from the comments, it seems the professors and TAs were not very amenable to this. I would have loved to start more of a dialogue about these issues. For instance, does designing better products lead to necessary incremental improvement, or does it propagate an unsustainable consumerist society? I mean, obviously, it's not so black and white, but where do we draw the line?"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Learned how to build a prototype; Weaknesses: Lack of direction and information about what was expected at some points throughout the semester; only had one month to come up with a final prototype which in the grand scheme of things is not enough time at all Suggestions: Need to have lab time outside of class to facilitate with prototype development; either limit the class to engineers and chemists or prerequisites met before entry; more guest speakers that pertain to chemical and mechanical engineering space and the investment\/business world; if end of semester presentation is a business pitch, need to bridge together the gap between the scientific and business world!",
    "Strengths - exposes us to many important ideas, tools, and processes in green engineering and design. Weaknesses - too much stuff to get through. All of it is important - but just not enough time to really fully digest and then implement all of the ideas in that final project. Not enough time for the final project. Maybe get rid of clients for the final project? They were restrictive. If the goal of the class is to really let our innovation and creativity run wild, I don't think the clients should be there. Instead, for the final pitch, have true investors and business people there that would be ready to invest into an idea.",
    "Given how high expectations are for teams, and that the course is intentionally designed to draw students from different disciplines and different stages in their academic careers, I would strongly recommend including expectations\/norms around teamwork, and also a chance for team members to evaluate each other. I think each team should be required to spend time discussing what skills and perspectives they bring to the table, what they hope to get out of the project, any particular skills (hard\/soft) they'd like to work on. I would make it a required assignment to turn in team norms\/goals\/expectations and have a TF check in with them about it.",
    "I really loved the guest lecturers who brought in real life examples of how this is done outside of the classroom. I would have appreciated more client based projects so at least we had some constraints or measurements of success and\/or stress. It was hard to make something for no-one in particular and not know if it was actually viable in the real world. Its hard to be motivated to make something if you don't think its viable. I thought the canvas site was very poorly maintained and organized. I don't think those that maintained it were really thinking of how the students would interact with it, and how they need to find and re-find information in the future.",
    "Strengths: Practice-based curriculum, impassioned lectures, introduction to new and exciting ways of thinking, a sense of fun, access to CEID, exposure to engineering tools, teamwork, diverse backgrounds of classmates Weakesses: Course logistics were a nightmare. The use of Canvas was confusing and inconsisent. Requirements were unclear. Announcements were sent out at the last minute. In general, communication was frustratingly insufficient. We didn't have enough time to properly learn how to use new tools and programs."

   "comments": [
    "Get ready to free your mind! Break through that status quo. Be sure to be committed to the project, which you'll spend a lot of time on. Choose your project wisely",
    "Really be thoughtful about the client project you choose and why you're choosing it. Is it most important for you to pick a project based on: the client itself\/how it relates to your studies? Skills you want to learn\/practice? The composition and compatibility of team members?",
    "Don't be afraid to make something really absurd that doesn't feel like it is sustainable at all. This class overlaps with the Innovator course at SOM. That may be great for some people, but others may find it repetitive.",
    "This is a novel class, and it's worth taking for the exposure to new ideas and tools. However, there's misalignment between the expectations of the teaching team and the material that's actually taught. Don't expect to walk away with concrete skills, and if you're not an engineer, make sure you work with one. Also, logistics are a mess, so you'll need to ask the TAs and professors a lot of questions to figure out what's going on."
