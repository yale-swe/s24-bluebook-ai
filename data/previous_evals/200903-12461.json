   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course with the caveat that there is far more policy than law involved.",
    "Lectures can be extremely boring especially if the class is still at 9:35. You won't learn much in lecture only in section if you have a good TA or through your final paper which is completely independent.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter the course is great.The readings are diverse and touch on Indigenous communities throughout the country and across time periods. However, make sure you test out Professor Blackhawk's teaching style in shopping period before committing, as his lectures can be very dry and unorganized. The TAs were all wonderful this year, which can supplement for the missed material in the scattered lectures. If you are interested in human rights, policy, and legal studies, you would really enjoy the material of the class, but it will take some initiative on your part. On the other hand, if you prefer a guided lecture course you may want to look elsewhere. Personally, I found Professor Blackhawk's lectures below average and would thus only recommend the course for someone sincerely interested in the aforementioned topics.",
    "If you're interested in learning about the legal history of Native Americans, this class is definitely for you. The readings are really interesting and you learn a whole new perspective on federal indian policy. However, sometimes Professor Blackhawk's lectures were confusing and difficult to follow.",
    "Indian Law and Policy is an interesting class that could have been even better if the lectures were better organized. Despite that, the readings were fascinating and I enjoyed the final project. However, there was a lot of work (both a midterm test and a midterm paper).",
    "I would certainly recommend the class to another student.",
    "This is an EXCELLENT class for those who are interested about how Native Americans responded to, and ultimately shaped, federal and local policy in the US. It is important to note though, for prospective law students, that law and policy takes a back seat to the \"history of\", hence the name of the class. Sometimes I wish we could have delved more into the actual policy itself, but the focus was really more on indigenous tribes and individuals as actors, and not so much on the federal government, which I really loved and appreciated. Professor Blackhawk is a GREAT lecturer, and while he's not much of a showman, if you pay attention, you are guaranteed to be engaged. For anyone who finds the subject interesting, I highly recommend this class - you can't go wrong.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone because the subject is supremely important, relevant, and interesting. The work is not very difficult and the final paper gives students a lot of freedom to explore a topic of interest to them.",
    "This is a really important subject. Professor Blackhawk is new, and still adjusting, but I think that the class will only get better and better.",
    "If you are interested in American Indian history, law, or American history I definitely recommend this course. Professor Blackhawk did a great job presenting the material. I learned a lot about our country's history that I had not learned in past history classes.",
    "Take EVERYTHING elseyou read on here with a grain of salt, first of all, because this is a first-year class. Things WILL change. Some will get better, some may not; that's just how these things go.Overall, I enjoyed this course. The subject matter is fascinating. Professor Blackhawk can give engaging lectures, and I think their frequency will increase when he's more at home at the university and has a better feel for his syllabus.You will have serious problems with a lot of the books. Blood Struggle, the focus of the first few weeks, is a heavily biased, poorly-written excuse for historical scholarship. Indian Removal, Parading Through History, and Professor Blackhawk's book are all very good - do the reading, you'll be happy you did come the midterm.A cautionary note to conclude: those who take this course (or who TA for it) tend to be a self-selecting group. This was not universally true, but at least in my section, we were always a step or two away from a shouting match. People have agendas, and some are simply looking for the data to back up their arguments. If you are such a person, please keep in mind that you're at Yale to argue, not to hear the sound of your own voice; if you are not such a person, remember that you'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
