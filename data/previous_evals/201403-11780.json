   "comments": [
    "I took this course because I was interested in autobiographies and needed a WR credit. This was a relatively easy writing credit--just 4 papers and weekly readings. I enjoyed most of the readings (especially the books), but prepare for long in-class discussions.",
    "I can only assume that the negative reviews of this course were written by people who are not intellectually curious or prepared for a somewhat politicized and opinionated discussion. It's a great class, and Professor Chanda really cares about her students and the material. That said, don't show up and expect everything to be theoretical; after all, you're reading the narratives of Middle Eastern women, and there are questions of ambassadorship, of authorial license, and of the concept of truth. Basically, you should take this course if you're even the slightest bit intellectually curious. I promise it's worth it.",
    "A definite must-take. This class expands the concept of autobiography and of writing as a feminist expression.",
    "This is a stupendous class that everyone should take. The books, the conversations, everything is really interesting and really gets ya thinking. It is about a book a week and sometimes more but Professor Chanda really gets you thinking and comes prepared with many different veins of conversation. This was my favorite class this semester."
