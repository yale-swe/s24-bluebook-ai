   "comments": [
    "Really useful course for the comp. I would strongly recommend it be taught regularly. It is inevitable to focus mostly on the literature, the one area of improvement would perhaps be a little more structure and time devoted to history.",
    "I think that it was pretty student driven which made it difficult because the course setup was unlike that of anything I have ever taken before for a Classics course. None of us had a fully comprehensive understanding of either the literature or the history which just showed to me that we either need 1) need more of these \"greatest hits\" kinds of classes or 2) the comprehensive exam needs to be restructured to meet the expectations of other Yale Classics courses. Zach did a great job, but I truly think that he was surprised by how little we knew.",
    "I think this course was dry well taught and aimed to prepare us as much as possible for the comprehensive at the end of the year. It would probably have been a little bit more efficient to just focus on main works like the Aeneid and Metamorphoses in terms of preparing us for the exam, but just speaking for myself I really enjoyed learning about less well known authors and their writing."

    "YES. YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE A CLASSICS (at least Latin) MAJOR. I truly hope they are offering it again because I walked out so much better prepared.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course to any Classics major studying for the comprehensive exam.",
    "Yes, definitely! Any other Classics major about to take the comprehensive exam should consider taking the class, as it will introduce you to a wide variety of Latin literature and Roman history which is important to know for the exam."
