    "Yes, interesting class without too much work.",
    "Good introduction to film and a number of interesting topics - documentaries are truly great and I learned alot.",
    "If you're interested in the subject and the time period, then absolutely. You'll get to watch a wide variety of really fascinating films, spanning from British Free Cinema to American countercultural works and even to avant garde Czech New Wave films like Daisies. Josh is the best. A really nice, laid-back, discussion-based course about great '60s films.",
    "Overall a good class with an interesting selection of films. Worth taking if you're interested in documentary film.",
    "A very interesting class with a light workload but a lot of rewards! I came in knowing pretty much nothing about documentary in the 1960s and left with a much deeper understanding of the different theories surrounding documentary at the time and the different global issues that were being tackled through film. I definitely think this class could be taken by people without a great previous knowledge of film or documentary."
