    "My initial description of the class would be that it is a lot of work but is also super rewarding. Problem sets\/exams often did not always reinforce the material from lecture. Many times problem sets\/exams seemed more like a test of proofing\/mathematical derivations rather than applying course material. The exams were always I took the class thinking the workload would be substantial, but I did not expect to spend such a significant amount of time on the problem sets--too many and too long. All of this into consideration, I would definitely take this course again, no questions. This course was off-field for me, but I have never been more challenged or gained so much knowledge from a class. My advice to another student would be take it but to take multivariate calc, diff eq\/ODE\/PDE, and fluid dynamics first (recently). I think I would have gotten more out of it with these classes under my belt, rather than spending significant time reteaching myself the math."

    "I wanted to take this class to really understand how fluid dynamics contribute to movement in aquatic systems. I got that--and SO much more. I am so glad I took this class and stuck with it. It was difficult and challenging but very rewarding. I am much more confident in not just PO but also in my math\/physics skills, in general."
