   "comments": [
    "YES - if you did not take a Physics class before. It's a great class, with an excellent professor who gives very clear explanations.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to just about any student.Simply put, this class teaches the fundamentals of physics in a very accessible manner, through some of the very improbable physics of Hollywood movies. But even more than that, this class shows how to apply theories in the real world, a useful skill that works even in the humanities and other forms of critical theory. Lastly, the way in which it covers estimation techniques, probability, and explaining your work as you go in a way that anyone can apply very quickly in any situation is a useful skill to have in the \"real world\", whether you work in a hospital, office, or deep in a coal mine.",
    "YES!! A great QR that you will learn a lot of physics from and do well in as long as you go to class.",
    "Great class. The majority of the class is spent analyzing movie clips to determine if they are realistic. Essentially Mythbusters as a class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Movie Physics to my fellow students. Make sure to take the course with Frank Robinson.",
    "Definitely try to get into this course. I took this to fulfill a science credit, and I am so glad I did. The class is not watching action movies for an hour, but rather learning the physics that allows you to critique and analyze whether what you see in the movies is actually feasible. Problem sets and tests involve watching movie clips to get estimations and data to plug into the problems and then solve. I learned a lot, such as very useful estimation techniques and general properties and theories of physics. Professor Robinson was understanding, funny, and a good teacher.",
    "Easy QR credit, but hard to get into.",
    "This is a great class. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
    "Would 100% recommend this class not only is it great fun it offers an alternative way of thinking.",
    "PHYS 101 is a great course! It is challenging, but definitely do-able. The instructor honestly cares about helping students understand the material. It is also fun to apply physics to Hollywood movies - it makes class more engaging.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The material is interesting, the professor is great, and the work load is not too heavy. Great QR class.",
    "Movie Physics is a great class for someone just wanting to get an easy science credit. You don't really need any strong physics background to understand the concepts and topics reviewed in the class. There is only one problem set each week which is really nice. I would recommend this class to another student who is looking for a simpler science course that is lots of fun. Being able to watch movie clips during class is really fun."
