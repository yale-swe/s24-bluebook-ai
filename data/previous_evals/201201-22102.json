    "Would definitely recommend it. Great reading list, wonderful professor.",
    "Virginia Woolf was one of my favorite classes I have taken in the English major. Woolf's writing is awe-inspiring, Professor Homans is an incredibly knowledgeable scholar and very supportive teacher, and discussions were enjoyable and interesting. The only real drawback to the class is the volume of the reading, which is sometimes overwhelming. While the senior essay component is obviously an enormous amount of work, it is also a great opportunity to trace an element of Woolf's work that you personally find interesting, and Professor Homans does a great job of helping with independent research to this end.",
    "Yes - the reading list is incredible",
    "Margaret Homans is a wonderful, accessible professor whom I believe would make any subject fascinating. While there was a lot of reading, the course material was challenging and rewarding inasmuch as it could be in a single semester. I'm skeptical about the ability to teach Virginia Woolf in such a short time frame, but it was one of the best courses I took at Yale.",
    "This course is AMAZING -- Professor Homans may seem dry in the first class but give her a chance, as she will prove to be one of the most thoughtful, well-versed, challenging and intelligent professors you come across at Yale. Also, Virginia Woolf is literally a brilliant genius and this class should not be missed.",
    "You know what you're getting yourself into: make sure you really love Woolf and have A LOT of time to invest in her novels and essays, plus tons of secondary scholarship about her. Be warned: the reading load is extremely overwhelming (often upwards of 400 pages a week, every week, including Woolf's novels, which are dense, exhausting stuff). Margaret is a rock-star academic, however - an amazing guide to Woolf with basically inexhaustible knowledge. My year, we also had the added benefit of great class solidarity, which made things more comfortable. This was especially useful during the terrifying 25 page research paper at semester's end.That said, Professor Homans is a real wonder, such a great balance of high academic expectations and warm, genuine encouragement during the hardest parts of the Woolf canon. She's an excellent facilitator of seminar discussion, and can hold her own with mini-lecturing when things get quiet or repetitive. Also, she has totally realistic expectations and understands that you can't always do 200 pages of secondary reading in two days - thank goodness. Truly lovely."
