   "comments": [
    "Take it! The combination of philosophy and literature illuminates the problems of human nature in ways that either approach by itself does not.",
    "An interesting set of pickings from the Western canon plus some non traditional works that in some way or another relate to character - a must if you've ever wondered about character, or if that topic sounds interesting. Generally manageable readings, two relatively short essays, and generally lots of fun discussion.",
    "Absolutely. It's so valuable to examine character formation in this interdisciplinary way, and so relevant as we practice the habits that form our character during our time at Yale. Plus, these are incredible books. A joy to read.",
    "This was a fantastic course. The readings were excellent. The discussions were engaging. It was well worth waking up early for. Definitely definitely take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class but note that it is not for the faint of heart. This is a class you should take if the reading list gets you really excited and you are willing to work very hard. The more you put into this class, the more you will get out of it. Start the papers very early and go to office hours whenever you can.",
    "This course is a literary and philosophical exploration of questions surrounding the topic of character. I found that the interdisciplinary set-up of the syllabus truly worked in this course. If you like approaching questions from a variety of different angles or making connections among different kinds of texts, you will enjoy this course."
