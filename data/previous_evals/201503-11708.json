    "If you're in Chinese, take this course. You kind of have to if you want to be proficient!",
    "I would recommend this course if they like Chinese, however if they are just doing it to fulfill a language requirement, it is not for them.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 130 to another student. The coursework is rigorous and class is engaging. While the class may sometimes be repetitive, it is extremely effective in teaching Chinese.It has a reasonable amount of homework that is relevant to the content we learn in class and useful.",
    "For a student coming from a high school Chinese program, L3 at Yale can be a bit of a shock because of how demanding it is. A student who starts Chinese at Yale might be better acclimatized. I think it is a good course for starting the transition between starting to learn Chinese and starting to become fluent in it.",
    "Quite difficult on account of memorization requirements, but entirely worth it."
