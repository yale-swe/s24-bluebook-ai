    "I would recommend 160 to those who want a good conversation-based class in order to retain and improve their speaking abilities. The coursework is interesting without becoming too complex, and I really did appreciate the opportunity to utilize French three times a week. It's a very basic introduction to France and the French culture, legal system, history, etc. - so nothing groundbreaking there, just a chance for conversation.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student wishing to gain a high-level overview of contemporary France. I would say that there is a higher than average workload, but ultimately that this is the best way to learn another language. In addition, the small class size is a boon.",
    "it's a basic overview of french culture. good readings, good vocabulary to know. shop around for the right section though, because the teacher will make or break it.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class, as soon as you become an L5. I learned so much in this class, the topics were interesting and applicable to anyone interested in French culture, and the chance to practice your speaking\/listening was phenomenal. Expect a decent amount of work though, especially if you want to get the most out of this class. This wasn't one of those gut language classes that you take to boost your grade. It doesn't have too much busywork, as I felt like I was getting a great amount of information out of everything we did, but I did dedicate a few hours preparing for each lecture."
