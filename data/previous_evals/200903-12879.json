   "comments": [
    "It provided good practice in speaking spanish and exposed the students to very interesting and sometimes controversial topics. I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to improve or practice spanish.",
    "Basically, we read an article, a short story, or about 20 pages of a novel every night and then discussed the reading in small groups in class the next day. There were also 8 written assignments, so don't think you won't need to have a solid grasp on writing and grammar. I would recommend this class as the workload is not overwhelming and it's a good starting point in L5.",
    "This class is rewarding but hard. You don't realize that your Spanish skills went up until the end, when you're doing your actual Oral Final, but they do improve. :) I didn't learn much grammar or vocabulary but I can definitely communicate better, so I would recommend it. Prof Diaz is a hard grader though.",
    "Spanish L5 is a great way to improve Spanish speaking abilities if yours aren't that great, or just get a credit learning new and interesting things about the Spanish-speaking world while staying on top of your language abilities. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "If you are looking to improve your Spanish in a relatively low-stress environment, definitely take this class. You have 3 quizzes, 2 oral exams, and 8 written assignments (in Spanish, generally 2-3 pages each. not hard) for the whole course. You basically have to read something in preparation for each class, then come prepared to talk about it. I was in AP Spanish, but I was pretty much tongue-tied coming into this course. I improved, and you will too. If you're fluent, this probably wouldn't be too interesting. Professor Diaz is the greatest!! During shopping period he comes off rather strict, but he is really low-key and very very funny. If you want to take this course, Diaz is the way to go.",
    "This was a great class to keep up your Spanish without having a huge time commitment. I recommend it for students with a lower command of Spanish and those who want to just keep up their ability and improve it a little. It's also just very fun and Professor Diaz is the best. You should definitely try to get him.",
    "If you're looking to talk about common issues and practice your Spanish at the same time, this is a great course. Absolutely take it with Professor Diaz.",
    "If you want to enjoy a relaxing class, with lots of opportunities of getting to know people and practice your Spanish, take this class.",
    "Spanish 150 is a good class, especially for freshman, if you took AP in high school and want to retain your Spanish speaking ability. Your speaking won't necessarily get much better, but you get to talk about interesting issues and read interesting stories in a very laid-back and conversational tone. You get to do the majority of your speaking in small groups and\/or partners, so the whole atmosphere of the class is very comfortable and unintimidating. Professor Diaz is great! I would definitely recommend him as a teacher, if you can get him. He's extremely nice and funny, but also knows what he's doing. It's also a good course to fulfill your foreign language requirement early. Unlike the L1-L4 classes, it's only 3 days a week, and you only have to take one semester, and then you're done with foreign language. Also, the amount of work in Span150 is very manageable - usually just a couple pages of reading with one writing assignment a week, at most. The quizzes are extremely easy, and the oral exams require preparation, but they're graded pretty leniently.",
    "Enjoyable class - the emphasis on speaking makes it attractive, since that seems to be a weakness of most high school language programs. Also, the ability to converse is very valuable and a good skill.I would recommend this course, although it is probably best suited to those with a good handle on grammar and tenses."
