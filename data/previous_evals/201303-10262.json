   "comments": [
    "Overall this course covers a variety of interesting topics, and with only two take-home exams, the workload is very light. This means that the course was a lot less stress than some other Math courses, but also meant that the wasn't much incentive to delve into the topics that weren't on the take-homes. The course focused too much on equicontinuity (and deriving things rigorously in that section) at the expense of covering some more interesting applications. In future years, I would recommend that Prof. Coifman spend more time on the applications (or the course doesn't make much sense cross-listed in applied math).",
    "AMTH 260 deals with the topics of vector spaces, fourier series, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and limits. Though differential equations is not a prerequisite, I would not recommend taking this course without that class. It is also necessary to have a strong background in linear algebra. There were only two take home midterms during the semester. Because of the lack of formal work, students have to motivate themselves to make sure they understand the material. I would recommend the class as long as students are willing to put in time outside of class to understand the lectures and have taken several math classes previously.",
    "Amazing class, just wish it was more example and real-life based with real-world problems. We learnt essentially some linear algebra, some dif eqs, and some real analysis. Fun easy class and 2 take home midterms that are all do able. Good class. No homework, and it's okay cause the questions on the take home really summarize what he wants you to get out of the class anyway.",
    "A good, although highly non-standard, class. Material is covered in an order that makes sense to Professor Coifman, but might not make sense to you until you read over you notes the next week. The class often circles back to take a new view on topics covered previously, and the information weaves together in interesting ways. The material is interesting--you will enjoy it if you enjoyed linear algebra.The class is not stressful. The only assignments are a few take-home exams (which are really more like problem sets and clearly \"for our own learning.\")",
    "I took this class after having taken linear algebra and differential equations. The course helped me revise and further my understanding of a lot of the material seen in these classes. It also complemented PHYS 410 (classical mechanics) very well.The course does a good job at balancing abstract mathematics (analytical proofs) and examples of how to apply the material.Professor Coifman encouraged us to ask questions, gave us problems to solve (or complete) and put the emphasis, not on formal work, but on what we learned.I recommend having a study group. This well you pace your work and discipline yourself.",
    "This class is really about taking your own initiative. You will get out what you put in, and if you review your notes often, do the optional exercises, etc., it can be very rewarding and eye-opening. If you fall behind, however, the class will become very hard to follow. A physics background helps because many of his examples are based in physics. Also, the textbook (Mathematics for Theoretical Physics, or something like that) is so useless that I wouldn't buy it. Professor Coifman will refer to pages in it maybe once or twice throughout the entire semester.",
    "Really chill. If you want to explore a random assortment of topics without a heavy workload, take this class. However, it's really on you to learn it.",
    "Definitely take it! There's little work and you get to learn a lot of awesome math. I came in hoping to learn functional analysis relevant to machine learning, and it certainly gave me the tools I was hoping to come out with.",
    "Great class. Take it if your math skills are up to par.",
    "It's a quirky course in the math department that spans multivariable, linear algebra, and differential equations. There are a lot of applicationsof the material to physics. The workload isn't too much but you will have to do a lot of legwork to get the mathematical foundation that Professor Coifman works off of in class. Otherwise, you can quickly get confused. Overall, it's a good class if you want to go more in depth into the topics covered in math 120, 222, and enas 194.",
    "One of the most relaxed but still demanding classes at Yale. This semester we only had two take home exams counting towards our grade. No problem sets in this class. Professor Coifman is the man. The lectures are interesting and leave you wanting more. It was probably one of the easiest math class you will ever take, but that does not mean you will not learn as much as in the other class. Coifman just does not want to stress you. He thinks students need to take time to appreciate the beauty and the power of the tools we are learning. I 100% agree with that.",
    "Great class, Prof. Coifman is a wonderful teacher (despite being brilliant). You'll want to adopt him as a grandfather"
