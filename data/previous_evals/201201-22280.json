   "comments": [
    "The format of this course was unusual - the grade was largely based on problem sets and a course project, with no exams. That being said, the homework assignments were often difficult. There was a lot of computer simulation required (using R) - for one of the homework assignments, my code was about 10 pages, and I didn't quite know what was going on in the algorithm half the time. If you've never programmed before, you may have a rough time trying to learn the syntax on top of all the probability concepts. The concepts themselves were quite interesting and not too difficult to understand, given a solid background in basic probability; if you're into quantitative finance, you'll use a lot of the course material someday. Lectures were dry and not all that necessary because all the slides and notes were online. Even homework submission was online, so you never had to see the teacher or TAs to do well. The final course project took some time to complete in the middle of reading week, but hopefully you would choose a topic that interests you, so that you find the project both enjoyable and instructive.",
    "Fascinating but frustrating. Jing Zhang is new to teaching this course, and the connection between the textbook (http:\/\/www.stat.yale.edu\/~jtc5\/251\/stochastic-processes.pdf) and the slides is a little tenuous. If it had not been for the strong TAs and my familiarity with R, I think I would have struggled a lot with this course. By the final project, I was surprised by how much I had actually learned.That said, I think I'm going to look back on this course years from now and realize that it really changed and clarified the direction of my studies. It introduced me to a lot of Bayesian concepts related to machine learning, and I think I'm going to spend the rest of my time here exploring these subjects.",
    "If you take this course, don't take it with Jing Zhang if at all avoidable. It's beautiful math, but unfortunately hard to enjoy when taught by someone who reads directly from slides that are copied verbatim from the textbook (which was written by the guy who USED to teach this course, Joseph Chang). Also, it's not listed as a pre-requisite but you definitely need differential equations, and some R programming would be really helpful (doable without, as I did, but you need help from people who do know R).I found it really sad that such an amazing subject was done such a disservice by this course.",
    "Stochastic Processes covers a lot of reasonable material. Professor Zhang is not a particularly great lecturer but Chang's textbook is really solid and the problem sets make you think. That said, getting a good grade in the class is extremely easy. I'd say take it for the material since the quality of instruction varies wildly.",
    "A 200-level math course with a rewarding final project and a relatively light workload. Start the problem sets in advance and this course will be a good experience.",
    "Yeah, important class",
    "I would recommend this course, as stochastics is highly relevant to a variety of fields, including finance, science, and tech. While the lectures could be improved, the material is absolutely essential and fascinating.",
    "The material is both highly interesting and relevant (with applications in many areas, including finance). Problem sets were fairly easy and help you to master the material. The lectures were a bit dry.",
    "The problem sets are a nice blend of programming, proofs, and computational problems. If any one of these three is very unappealing to you then maybe this isn't the right class for you. However, the material is interesting and if you like a variety of problems, this is a good choice. Easier than 300 level math classes if you are looking for a math elective that isn't really hard. TAs can be very helpful if you are stuck on homework, which makes up 70% of the grade. Final project wasn't bad either.",
    "Some of the problem sets would have been extremely difficult if not for the help of the TAs.",
    "Very easy if Joe Kim is the TA and Jing teaches it.",
    "Definitely would recommend!",
    "I would not recommend this class at all. the material is very useful and the psets are interesting but the class is very very poorly taught and i dont feel that i learned that much. Absolutley dont take this if you do not have to",
    "Great course - very interesting material and not too difficult. Professor Zhang is an excellent instructor and very personable. There are no exams, and the problem sets are not too long. The final project is also pretty cool.",
    "Interesting subject matter, but the class moves EXTREMELY quickly. The problem sets were very difficult, so you had to be on top of your game, especially because lectures tended to be really hard to follow.",
    "The course has the potential to be great, but I would take it with another professor.",
    "The material is interesting in its own right. The quality of the course will really depend on who is teaching it. If you want a course that isn't bad work-wise I'd definitely shop it to see who the prof is.",
    "It's hard to say because the teacher changes every year. The book is very clear and the material is \"useful\" (as far as a math class can be useful). The workload was very manageable, but looking back on the course I don't feel like I learned that much."
