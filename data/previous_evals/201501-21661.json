    "Really great class! You'll learn lots of interesting astronomy, things like the evolution of stars, orbital mechanics, blackbody radiation, and optics\/telescopes. The night at observatory was also a great experience. This is a great introduction to astronomy--so long as a you are a little bit comfortable with math.",
    "It's an introduction to Stars and their formation, it is an interesting class but you have to sit though some boring lectures at times. All in all I'd recommend you take it if you're interested in space or stars. If you just need a science credit this class is alright for you as well.",
    "Take this if you think you might be serious about astronomy. Even if you're not but you want to go beyond \"a walk through the solar system.\" Kind of dry but easy material and not much work.",
    "Astro 210 is perfect for gaining an understanding of how stars work. Whether you are a stem major or not, if you want to understand how stars work, and other astronomical principles, then I highly recommend this course. Even if math and science isn't your cup of tea, the course's math is actually easy to understand with something as low as basic calculus, in reality algebra is the most common style of math used in the course. I went into the course with not a lot of physics experience, but the main physical aspects that are discussed are basic or well taught. If you have an interest in astronomy, I highly recommend the course."
