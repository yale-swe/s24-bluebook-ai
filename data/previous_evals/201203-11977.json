   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of writing, so be warned, but the content is fascinating and you'll learn a lot while studying really interesting works of French literature, theater, and cinema at the same time! I highly recommend it.",
    "This is a good class! A lot of work, but manageable. I learned a lot!",
    "As all language classes it's a lot of not-too-difficult yet repetitious work, so while it's not a difficult class it does take time. If you're taking a lot of other difficult classes and don't have a lot of extra time I wouldn't recommend it, but otherwise it's a pretty standard language class.",
    "You study a piece of media (book,song,or movie) and then you have a discussion about it in class, almost like a literature class. You have assigned work on different topics of french grammar that you are expected to complete outside of class. You go over this work from time to time. Every couple of weeks you will write an essay in french, the length gradually increases over time.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student if they are interested in all aspects of the french language - grammar, vocabulary, film, literature, culture, etc. The work is a bit demanding, but still manageable nevertheless. And the type of assignments due varies from day to day which is great.",
    "Madame Allain is great! Take French 150 with her! Solid class. Lots of great readings. I really enjoyed the semester. Make sure your classmates are talkative--it will affect the dynamic of the class greatly."
