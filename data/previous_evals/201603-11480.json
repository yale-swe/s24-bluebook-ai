   "comments": [
    "From day one, Prof. LaPalombara emphasized that if we wanted to see exactly what made us so lucky to be at Yale, all we had to do was look to our left, and look to our right. Because of his trust in our capabilities, Prof. LaPalombara pushed his students to hold themselves and each other accountable for learning the material by emphasizing the importance of group contributions. Moreover, because he curated the members of this class, I felt that the diversity in the room contributed significantly to the quality of discussion; and I really learned the importance of teamwork--an unlikely lesson to glean from a classroom setting.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of how and why the global financial system developed, how countries have adapted to it, and about global economic inequality.",
    "\"The business of business is doing business!\" Milton Friedman, 1970. PLSC 152 taught me an immense amount the interactions between MNCs, the state and society (especially in the developing world) and the consequences for all parties involved. The ethical, practical and legal conundrums that modern MNCs face around the world are rarely discussed in political science, but as this seminar demonstrates, the area deserves a great deal more of our attention.",
    "I developed knowledge about the forms of foreign direct investment, as well as country case studies that I never would have heard of otherwise (i.e. Chiquita in Colombia). I gained some insight into what business school could be like, given the case studies that we learned about.",
    "This course was an incredible analysis into the realities of our globalized world. We tackle the importance and effects of multi-national corporations from a multitude of perspectives. Professor LaPalombara's expansive and impressive personal experience and overall general knowledge was a valuable asset for the class in our discussions on many difficult topics.",
    "We've all read about multinational firms in the media, but this course has provided me with the theoretical framework coupled with real world case studies to better understand their workings. In this class, we discuss questions ranging from why firms go abroad to how they operate ethically (or unethically, most of the time). You will also work in groups on a assigned case. We also went to the Center for Foreign Relations for a talk on the Amazon forrest. A bonus: you get to listen to Professor LaPalombara talk about his life stories and working experience.",
    "While the course was intended to explore the relationship between multinational firms and governments in the developing world and the questions raised as a result, I felt that I did not develop any deep insights or knowledge through this course. The readings were less academic in nature than I would have hoped, and the lectures during the seminar felt a bit disjointed from the overall topics of the course. I also would have appreciated a greater sense of debate and opposing arguments within the course material.",
    "Developed a greater understanding of the complex interactions between global firms and national governments and explored several interesting case studies that allowed for a greater in depth analysis of these issues. This class made me constantly question the things that I thought to be true and evaluate the issues in a new light.",
    "Nothing more than a few facts. During the case studies, you'll often find yourself applying basic logical and moral arguments over, and over, and over again.You're never introduced to a new way to consider an issue. This class would be much more interesting if I had just finished a JD\/MBA. Alas, I am just an undergrad and it was incredibly boring, which is sad because I had high hopes.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount in Global Firms and National Governments. Given the growing power of multinational corporations and the frequent inability of governments to regulate them, the material in this class felt current and necessary. In particular, the opportunity to dive beneath the headlines and explore questions of FDI, host nation\/home nation dynamics, CSR policiesamong other topicsbrought depth and nuance to my understanding of the international political economy. I emerge from the course better equipped to analyze modern business trends and locate specific incidents within their global and historical context. Thank you for a terrific semester. I feel privileged to have been a part of this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were the students in the class--LaP puts together a really high achieving and smart group of students. That being said, the second half of the class relies entirely on student presentations and discussion questions, which means that class can skew pretty far from the core of the topics we're supposed to be discussing.",
    "By far the best element of this class is the format. After a few weeks of lecturing by Professor LaPalombara, the course switches into a case study approach in which students function as teams. Those who aren't presenting the cases, are themselves also in teams and are assigned questions to debate and report on after the presentation. The result of this is that we get to know our classmates and also seriously debate each issue associated with the cases. Moreover, as each case comes from a different country and relates to a different company, no two lessons are alike and one really looks forward to every lesson.",
    "A major weakness is the form of the first half of the course, in which the professor lectured on various topics as we listened to him. There was basically no discussion and I found myself zoning out for a lot of it. It felt like the professor pontificating on how he saw the world, which wasn't really what I signed up for. The case study presentations were good in that everyone got to participate at some point, but the discussions afterward often felt pointless. Were we supposed to come to some conclusion? Or just talk until time was up? I also *hated* that the professor often mixed up the names of students of color (but never any white students). This happened with the Asian and African-American students in the room, even when the students in question looked nothing alike. It's frustrating and has literally no excuse, aside from the professor not caring enough. I never got very specific feedback on my essays for the class, which made it hard to calibrate how I would write the next one.",
    "The case studies were very important in applying the ideas from class discussions and readings. I will never look at Chiquita bananas again, as well as multinational corporations (for their power in influencing the world). Another strength is the care with which Professor LaP chooses the students in the seminar - it was an incredibly diverse and dynamic group, and everyone brought important contributions to the seminar.",
    "Strengths: manageable workload and manageable readings that were well-balanced throughout the semester. Weaknesses: I would have appreciated much clearer feedback and guidance as to expectations on assignments; more academic papers within the syllabus; more diversity of perspectives within the syllabus; more economics-oriented content within the syllabus; and lectures that had a better connection to the topics discussed in the course.",
    "The case studies were fun and a good way to learn and interact with peers. The readings were relevant and interesting, and not too much to digest. I would have preferred more specific questions on the 3 short papers. The final definitely made me learn a lot of the material, however I would have preferred a paper option that was slightly shorter than the one offered, or a mock case study for FDI where we had to make investment decisions on behalf of a firm or a national government.",
    "Strengths: -I really appreciated the structure of the course. Having the team presentations follow the initial weeks of lecture and discussion helped to bring the key themes into vivid focus. The team presentations were also fun to prepare and a great way to engage every student in the weekly discussions. -The trip to NYC was a treat. Not only was the talk at the Council on Foreign Relations stimulating and the subsequent dinner delicious, but the trip also helped to promote class camaraderie. Given the seminar format of the course and the emphasis on team presentations, this opportunity to nurture ties of friendship was incredibly valuable. Areas for Improvement: -Perhaps my main suggestion would be to extend the number of class hours. The material is incredibly rich and 2 hours of weekly course time cannot always do it justice."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!! Take this class if it is offered. LaPalombara is fantastic.",
    "An incredible class, not only in terms of its subject matter but also the care with which LaP chooses his students to ensure a very high quality of learning and engagement. I would strongly recommend this course to any student",
    "This is an INCREDIBLE class. If you're at all interested in the political economy of the developing world and are curious about concepts like mercantilism, corporate inversions and relations between states and MNCs, this is class is an absolute must-take. Professor LaPalombara expects a lot from his students and than can be scary at first, but by the end, if you give it your best shot, it'll certainly be worth it.",
    "Yes! Amazing professor and you get to know the other students pretty well.",
    "I wanted to enjoy this class, but I didn't. I wouldn't really recommend it. I just felt that the class discussions were rarely engaging. The first half of the course involves the professor lecturing--basically pontificating on his view of the world \/ various stories from his life and occasionally asking a question. Then it moves into small groups - one group presents a case study every week while everyone else discusses questions they pose. This portion of class was more interesting, but I can't say I ever looked forward to going to class. The reading is light and the 3 essays you write were pretty straightforward (just make sure you read the prompt well). The final was reasonable, though be wary of the IDs.",
    "If you can get into this seminar, absolutely take it! Professor LaP's vast depth of experience and knowledge should be enough to convince you from day one. The first few weeks may feel like a lot of LaP speaking, but that's just a way for him to set up the framework for the rest of the weeks, which are almost completely case study discussions. The course (roughly summarized) examines the power and influence multinational corporations hold in the world, and I'll never look at them the same way again. Another huge plus is the care with which Professor LaP chooses the students for the seminar. It was an incredible range of diversity in background\/experiences, and everyone contributed to class in a meaningful way. Overall very eye-opening course. You have a choice of final paper or final exam.",
    "yes",
    "While I entered this course with high expectations (and was thankful for getting in, given that this is a fairly difficult seminar to get into), this proved to be one of the least enjoyable courses I have taken in my time at Yale. There were certainly positive aspects to the course: the week-to-week workload was light (with manageable readings, three 1000-word response papers evenly spaced throughout the semester, a 20-minute presentation, and a final paper or exam); the professor selected a great group of students that was diverse in terms of both academic background and experiences; the professor has a wealth of experience in the realm of multinational corporations in the developing world; and there was an enjoyable class field trip to the Council on Foreign Relations in October. That said, I generally regret having taken this course and would have certainly chosen a different course to fulfill the EP&E Political Systems requirement if given the opportunity. As a more economics-oriented EP&E student, I found the course to have less of an economics bent than I had anticipated, and I wish that the course syllabus contained more academic papers as opposed to merely news articles and case studies that were less academic in nature. While many enjoyed Prof. LaPalombaras lectures, I often found them disjointed and hard to connect to the topics being discussed. Additionally, writing the 3 papers proved to be a frustrating experience. The professor gave very little guidance as to what he expected from these assignments, yet tended to grade these papers fairly harshly as if these expectations were in place, and it proved difficult to discern how exactly one could improve based on his comments on our papers. I also found the professor quite unapproachable, and wished he had maintained a better sense of impartiality, both with respect to the course content (I felt that the course provided a very one-sided, anti-globalization perspective that did not give much room for debate or opposing ideas) as well as with respect to students in course (as I felt that he did maintain a sense of favoritism to some degree with respect to some students). In short, it is unlikely that my review will be of much relevance given that it is likely that this is the last semester this course will be taught. That being said, if it is taught again, I would recommend either shopping this course very thoroughly to make sure that you will enjoy it for the entire semester; exploring some of the other options to fulfill the EP&E Political Systems requirement with a more economics-oriented course (as the lack of in-depth material on globalization and international trade proved disappointing); or looking into other courses (such as Prof. Rose-Ackermans Ethics & Multinational Business or Prof. Shapiros Business and Government after Communism) if the topic of business-state relations interests you.",
    "Yes. Prof LaPalombara is a distinguished Professor from whom you will learn a lot. I got to know my peers very well in this class and learnt a lot from them - the amount of interaction among peers is arguably the biggest strength of this seminar. Overall, a good overview of the main controversial cases involving the interactions between national governments and international firms making foreign investments.",
    "No. First off, this course is hardly a seminar. Professor LaPalombara lectures for an entire class period and attempts to tell you \"the way it [the world] is.\" His attitude makes him appear worldly at first, but eventually he just seems condescending. During the case studies, you'll often find yourself applying basic logical and moral arguments over, and over, and over again. I don't think I had one truly stimulating intellectual conversation during this class. By the end you'll be begging for the class to be over.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. If youre interested in learning more about corporations, their growing international influence, and the social, economic, and political questions that accompanies this, look no further. Through case studies, lectures, team presentations, and classroom discussion, you will explore all of these questions. The course also features three short papers and either a term paper or a final exam, each of which dovetails perfectly with the material of the course. To top it all off, Professor LaPalombara is a total legend. After 69 years of teaching, he not only remains sharp as a tack, but has also distilled the enterprise of teaching into an art and a science. He is a consummate scholar who knows the course material like the back of his hand and can rattle off statistics, anecdotes, and thoughtful commentary on practically any topic. In addition, Professor LaPalombara is witty, charismatic, and attentive. His charm and humor, particularly during the lecture-based segment of the course, makes every class an enthralling experience. If Professor LaPalombara decides to teach the class again next fall, sign up in a heartbeat. You will not regret it."
