    "Anyone who wants to improve in Spanish has to take this course. It has a manageable workload so there is no reason not to take it.",
    "I would certainly recommend taking any class taught by Nicholas Goodbody. As for the subject itself, I would recomment taking Spanish as opposed to another language for two reasons. First, it is one of the most relevent languages one could learn. Secondly, from my experience of taking the class as well as hear-say from other students, the spa",
    "I recommend this class to other people because its not a ton of work and it is worth 1.5 credits",
    "Spanish 120 03 is a thorough course that really improves your Spanish proficiency in a fun and interesting way. However, be prepared to work for it, not too hard but every day for half an hour to an hour. The instructor is also really good. If you want to learn Spanish, you won't regret the class.",
    "Yes it was intersting",
    "I would recommend it with Senor Goodbody. He made a typical Spanish class fun and entertaining."
