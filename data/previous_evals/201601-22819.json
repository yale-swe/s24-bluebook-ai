    "It fills a necessary need in the NELC Dept., namely, providing a place for students of cuneiform to practice their skills by reading actual documents.",
    "Would only recommend to students who want to do a PhD in Assyriology or are already doing one",
    "The course is an introduction to the ins and outs of reading and publishing cuneiform texts. You learn a lot about the different scripts and idiosyncrasies of texts. Highly recommended for all cuneiformists. It is fun, at times difficult, but always enlightening."

    "This course helped me to develop a necessary skill.",
    "It's embarrassing that this course did not exist before and is not regularly taught, and Enrique should be commended for teaching a much-needed practical course that teaches the basic skills needed for our profession.",
    "Things learned in the course will serve me well for the rest of my Assyriological career. The importance of this course cannot be overstated. Assyriology is a text-based field, so learning to read from photos and tablets is a cherished skill."
