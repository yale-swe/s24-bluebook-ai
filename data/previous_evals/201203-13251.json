    "You engage with a lot of topics (we did social entrepreneurship, europe's economic crisis, german national identity, read some excerpts from modern german lit etc.) met with a bunch of world fellows and guests, and went on trips to NY and the YUAG. If you want a good class that improves your already decent german and allows you to deepen your engagement with a topic you are generally interested in, this class is good for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are good at german.",
    "Yes. The syllabus is very interesting and leaves a lot of room for learning what you want.",
    "Yes, the course is good if you already have a very good basis in German and want to improve your speaking and expand your vocab. The workload is fine and you will have to write short essays and a longer one in the end. There is a lot of speaking in class and a lot of diverse activities.",
    "I would recommend the course. It was interesting--there were some kinks but I think they will be worked out in any future iterations. In a nutshell, the course takes a look at different aspects of German culture through different modules lasting ~2 weekseach. For example, we discussed the European financial crisis and German identity, among other things. The workload is average: there are some readings and a 2-4 page writing sample every two weeks or so, as well as a final project. A highlight of the course was time spent outside of the classroom. We got to meet with two of the German writers whose works we read in class--we went to NY to meet one of them on a trip paid for by Yale. We also went to the art gallery to look at German art for class one day, and had a World Fellow come in to speak to us. I really appreciated the amount of contact we had with guest speakers."
