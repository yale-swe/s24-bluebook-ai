   "comments": [
    "Yes, recognize there is a level of physics and QR that's a pre-requisite, but if you're genuinely interested in this stuff, there's no opportunity like this to learn about it! Especially if your major is completely not STEM",
    "I'd recommend it to someone looking for a reasonably challenging Astronomy course. I certainly learned a lot, and it was about things I had never considered as a humanities person",
    "A terribly hard intro course I would stay away.",
    "I would definitely recommend ASTR 170 to another student. It's definitely not a gut, but it's not impossible and it's incredibly fascinating and helps you understand the world we live in.",
    "If you have a strong QR background, then it would be a pretty easy science credit. If you don't, maybe look for something else.",
    "Amazing class, wonderful professor. Definitely take it for a QR or SC if you want to actually learn and do some thinking but not work too hard.",
    "A great overview of interesting concepts in Cosmology, without too much work.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. It is a relatively easy course with super interesting material, and an engaging professor.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 170, but be prepared for more work than you may anticipate.",
    "Class was a pretty easy science gut. The midterms were fair, but the course was not well tied together. Easy to get an A- kinda hard to get an A. Very boring tho.",
    "I have already pitched ASTR 170 to several of my fellow classmates who are non-astronomy majors in need of science or QR credits. I can't imagine any reason why someone would be uninterested in the night sky and extraterrestrial phenomena and cosmological mysteries and otherworldly beauty and nothing less than the fate of the universe. While the math and physics were not the easiest (admittedly, I had no background in physics whatsoever), the way we derived what we knew about the universe through empirical calculations was highly rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are looking for a Science credit. The course material is interesting, and Professor Edwards is enthusiastic and engaging. I looked forward to going to class every day.",
    "Yes, but I'd recommend it with caution. I didn't know it was going to be as difficult to grasp as it was for me, so I'd make sure that the person who wants to take it is willing to put the studying and effort into the class to fully understand the concepts.",
    "Definitely recommend for a QR\/SC!",
    "A pretty broad course on cosmology, moderate level of physics, might be a bit daunting for those who haven't done well in high-school physics. Still mind-blowing discoveries.",
    "This is not what one might consider a \"gut\" science course. The problem sets, while not overly difficult, can prove tricky at times, and tests, while fair, do require some advanced study. Yet, if you are a quantitatively-oriented non-science major looking for a slightly challenging yet not overly burdensome Sc credit, ASTR 170 is a great choice. The course material is fascinating, and you get the chance to become a bit more fluent on some of the cutting-edge scientific frontiers in astrophysics and cosmology. Prof. Edwards is very lively and engaging in lecture, always eager to answer questions and go more in depth on course material. One advantage to this course is that it is composed of only three midterms, with no final, so it doesn't interfere with other courses during finals season. My only real complaints were the infrequent section times and having to submit assignments my scanning and uploading them on Canvas. However, as a quantitatively-oriented social science major, I'm glad I took this course. A visit to the Leitner Observatory is mandatory for course participation credit, yet a very enjoyable aspect of the course.",
    "For the most part, ASTR 170 was a great course. If you've already taken high school physics, then the course takes a while to get goingthe first few units cover basic physics, relativity, and the history of astronomybut everything comes together amazingly at the end of the term to give you a deep understanding of the origins, history, and structure of the universe. I often left class bewildered, not because the material or instructor were difficult to understand (again, basic physics, and Professor Edwards is great at answering any questions), but because space is just so cool. Take this class if you want to learn more about space without being overwhelmed by the math\/science part of astronomy.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 170 to any student interested in introductory cosmology, even if the student has no experience with sciences.",
    "This is an intro class to cosmology. It definitely helps to have a basic understanding of physics and geometry to help with the psets. This class is definitely not a gut, but it you put in the work, your grades will reflect that. Also, Professor Edwards is one of the nicest, most helpful professors I've had at Yale so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. I would recommend this class to anyone who's interested in learning more about the universe.",
    "This class lives up to its promise of introducing you to the complex field of cosmology, and there is no shortage of the fascinating and mindblowing concepts you'll learn over the course of it. However, be warned that the class can be genuinely difficult and very challenging. The psets steadily become harder as the weeks progress, and attending section could be instrumental to successfully completing the pset questions. If you love astronomy or are interested in getting a taste of it, this is without a doubt an excellent course. However, it is a QR credit for a reason. The psets, which largely consist of math problems, can be pretty tough at times, though the exams are a bit easier. Just be aware that math does indeed play a big role in the course.",
    "ASTR 170 is a good introduction to general topics in astronomy for people who aren't looking to pursue it past that point (and for those who don't want to use calculus). I would definitely recommend the class, although it's not a QR gut. Work does need to be put into it, but the topics covered in class are super interesting. Dr. Edwards is a pretty engaging lecturer, which adds to the overall quality of the class. Also, there's no final (just three midterms), so you don't have to worry about it during finals period, which is super nice.",
    "I would summarize this course as a physics intensive exploration of the universe. There is quite a bit of work with bi weekly to weekly p-sets and three midterms and is a class I would definitely say is not a gut but should be taken if you're truly interested in it. For anyone who finds the concept of space and time and our universe interesting I would definitely recommend taking this class, even if they have a strong distaste for physics like I do. Even for those who don't know anything about the topic should shop it as it's surprisingly engaging.",
    "If you are looking for a gut science class, this class will cause you more stress than you think. Overall not too hard to get an A-, but a little tough to get an A.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student, because I felt that the course material was taught in a chaotic manner, and might cause some serious stress to the student attempting to complete assignments or take tests.",
    "A great course if you're looking for a Science credit! It's a really good introduction to some of the main concepts in astronomy without going too much into depth with the equations. Not a gut, but not hard either if you can do basic math.",
    "This is a great course to take if you are considering majoring in astronomy or astrophysics. The class covers not only general concepts within astronomy, but also touches on basic math and physics that are used in the field. This course had a lot more math than I was expecting, but it was manageable.",
    "Fairly easy if you have any physics background, but also a realistic course for those who have little to no background in physics",
    "Introduction to Cosmology was a phenomenal course; one of the best I have taken at Yale. It briefly touches on the history of our conception of the universe, from the views of the ancient Greeks up to our current model, as well as the history of the universe itself, from the big bang up until today and what the universe of the future will look like. It incorporates key astronomical discoveries and how those have led to the current model of the universe. It also describes how to calculate a variety of astronomical phenomena such as the age of a star or whether a star is moving towards or a away from Earth. Problem sets develop concepts learned in class and are not excessively difficult. Professor Edwards is an incredible instructor and I would take the class just for her. She made the material fascinating for me and I came to class each day excited to learn something new and determined to pay attention and prepare for class because Professor Edwards has done so herself. Her enthusiasm and excitement are infectious. Each day that I learned more about the universe I left feeling like I understood it less and less.",
    "A fascinating class for people who need the QR. There's honestly not much other reason to take it: either you think cosmology is rad, or you need a QR. The class is super interesting, and the professor is really nice!",
    "I would summarize ASTR 170 as a class in the physics of the universe (so non-Newtonian) that is challenging but still doable even for a non-science major. I would recommend this class to a student if they were looking for something difficult but interesting and because I think everyone should take a class with Prof. Edwards.",
    "Strong science course for non-science majors. If you're interested in astronomy or cool subjects such as blackholes or space-time, you should take this class. Even though the science is fairly accessible, you will have to put some work into the p-sets and studying for the midterms. Be sure to attend discussion sections and office hours for help with the p-sets and certain concepts. However, Professor Edwards is a lot of fun and an engaging lecturer, and you will learn a lot if you put the work into the class!"
