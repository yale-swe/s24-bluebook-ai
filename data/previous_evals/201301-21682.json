   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course unless you wish to learn how to compose in the Galant style. MUSI 205 is fantastic for learning analysis, while this course really only taught the theory of Gjerdingen on how to compose in a very specific time period.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great introduction to music and composing, even if you have never composed before",
    "An excellent and fast-paced introduction to four-part writing and sonata theory. I would absolutely recommend this course, especially with Andrew. He is highly knowledgeable and quite passionate about the subject, and will go to great lengths to help you out.In terms of workload, do not expect it to be light--the analogy of 210 being \"like a language course\" is, in hindsight, fairly accurate. Is it worth it? Absolutely.",
    "It's necessary as a prerequisite, but it's not a drag! I would recommend it to anyone looking to get a grasp on the specific period of composition. You'll learn about \"schema,\" musical conventions of the galant era, that you'll later use to guide your composing, At the end, you'll write a sonata exposition, and surprise yourself with the progress you've made.",
    "Yes. Great course. Should be easy if you have piano or orchestra experience. A bit harder if you don't. either way, great intro to music composition."
