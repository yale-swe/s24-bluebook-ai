   "comments": [
    "A nice intro to this skill. It helps if you play a band\/orchestra instrument and have already seen a good bit of conducting. The class could get big and constrict your podium time, but Toshi does a good job of getting to everyone and making helpful pointers.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in conducting! Toshi is a fabulous teacher and he does a really great job of showing the class the essence of conducting.",
    "Very light workload and fun assignments, but note that podium time will be divided between approximately 20 undergrad\/grad students.Toshi was great. His lighthearted yet intelligent approach to teaching the art of conducting was much appreciated. If you seek an introduction to purposeful, musical conducting, look no further.",
    "Intro Conducting is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. Teaches you the fundamentals of conducting by having you conduct various pieces of the standard repertoire. (Starts with Beethoven and ends with Stravinsky). There can sometimes be a bit of an Old Boy Network feeling to the class, both in terms of people in it who already know the professor and in terms of people who are already super-familiar with the rep, but if that doesn't bother you, it's a very light class that teaches a very useful skill.",
    "If you're interested in symphonic conducting, go for it. There's a huge range of conducting experience and musical perspectives (conductors, orchestral musicians, pianists, musical school students) and, with a 20-person class, very little time to actually get feedback from Toshi. As someone with very little orchestral experience, I found it to be pretty stressful and a steep learning curve, but it's a class where you definitely improve the more work you put into it. If you're willing to commit to practicing a lot on your own, you can probably get a lot out of it -- if not, you'll presumably not really get better and do fine in the class anyway. Some really fun repertoire though! Worth it for Toshi's casual anecdotes about working with \"Lenny\" (Bernstein) and Copland and occasional Gangnam Style dance breaks.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in conducting",
    "Fun and informative introduction to conducting. You will be in class with music majors, school of music people, and otherwise really musically talented classmates. Also, although prior conducting experience is not necessary some people will undoubtedly bring some. Lack of fear in going in front of a group of really talented people and ability to play an instrument are incredibly incredibly helpful for this class, if not downright necessary."
