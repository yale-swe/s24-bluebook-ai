    "Overall, this class teaches you so much. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE IT.",
    "This class is amazing. The readings are really well selected and just incredible, but what really makes this are theprofessors. Just wonderful--as teachers, mentors and people. They are both really at the top of their fields, but still manage to somehow dedicate hours and hours to writing feedback for weekly response papers or helping students explore something they're interested in outside of class. The class is a lot of reading, but the workload is consistent and balanced. And I appreciate that it tapers off quickly at the end of the semester--the final paper, which itself isn't terribly long, is due before reading week begins.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in traditional world literature. Be aware that there is a heavy religious component to the literature since the class deals with Buddhist, Hindu (more accurately, brahmanical), and Jain literature. Also, be mindful that this is a literature class. We don't really discuss politics or philosophy too much. It's mainly about close reading of the texts.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. I learned very much and enjoyed almost all of the readings, writing reading responses, and our class discussions. The professors and other students were wonderful. This course gave me a foundation for understanding Asian traditions I would not have had otherwise.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course. This is an incredibly well-taught and well-structured introduction to three important non-Western cultures and such a foundation I think is invaluable."
