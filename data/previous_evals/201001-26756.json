   "comments": [
    "Perfect timing.",
    "This course could be part of the summer course, or occurs at the beginning of our first semester, in a one time seminar format with a couple of non-mandatory evening lectures. If this is a real lecture, it must relate better to our design problems, present more case studies, rather than feeding the students with raw charts and data.",
    "this course seemed very cursory. there were too few classes to really get into any material in any depth, despite the fact that we tried. if the course continues it should focus on dealing with these issues on a much larger conceptual scale, introducing the issues. It should not be nearly so technical.",
    "The real one happens next semester so why is this course added to the 6 others we are taking this semester?",
    "It was in the proper sequence",
    "This was a weird half-semester class that apparently was designed to make next fall\u0092s environmental design course easier, because it won\u0092t be the first time that we\u0092re encountering some of the material, but whether that is the case remains to be seen. Meanwhile, it was an added hardship to have a sixth course on top of an already full workload this semester.",
    "This course definitely occurred within sequence. It introduced us to concepts of climate and landscape grading which helped us make more informed desicions during the design phase of BP.",
    "Yes.",
    "I don't think we should have taken this course this semester. I understand why it was offered but I don't believe it was necessary to fit it into our syllabus during first year and we really didn't have time for it. This course got shuffled to the end of the list every week and,as a result of having NO time to dedicate to it, I really didn't take much away from it.",
    "Many of the issues discussed in this course were also touched upon in the Building Project course.",
    "This course is unnecessary. We have too many courses spring semester and cannot be sitting in class for this much time. We are not absorbing any needed information and we are not fruitfully producing good work due to time issues."

   "comments": [
    "Good stuff to know and done in a good sequence.",
    "Please refer to question 3.",
    "Good sequence of materials; assignments reinforced key issues discussed in lectures.",
    "everything was way too technical. technical assignments should wait till next semester when we can apply these ideas to our design projects, as opposed to randomly generated situations.",
    "This was yet another time filler of a course. Too short to explore anything substantially. We essentially take Michelle's real course next year, so what is this?",
    "The assignments ended up taking up much more time than they should have. There was value in the course, but it ended up being a lot of busy work.",
    "The two halves of the course were disjointed, even though both parts were interesting. I felt like I had just scratched the surface of environmental science, and the homework was assigned such that each of us had to analyze a different location, so there was not one right answer and I never knew whether I was doing it correctly, because we didn\u0092t review it in class. The assignments for both sections felt like busywork, which was painful at the end of the week. But there is no way that I could have managed more homework than what was assigned, since the semester was so busy.",
    "The assignments were an important part of this brief course, because they required us to engage the material and make sense of the information that had been presented in class.",
    "I think the information was well organized and pretty easy to follow and the assignments followed the information and topics that were presented in class.",
    "The material was treated very topically but, frustratingly enough, the assignments were sometimes fairly in depth and required calculations that we were not taught in class. This was extraordinarily annoying because we had so little time to dedicate to this class and the homework always took ages without feeling as though it was productively conveying information that fit into a larger conception of the course's subject matter.",
    "The first half of the course, dealing with climate, was excellent. The lectures were engaging and the content was new and very useful. The second half of the course was also good, although the lectures were a little too dry and technical. The assignments were good correlations to the lectures.",
    "this class should be taught in a way that is relevant to architecture students. Architects don't understand graphs. Show us sections and case studies."

    "Had no expectations.",
    "I expected more cases study based presentations and discussion of why certain projects are more sustainable and other projects failedto live to their potential.",
    "I expected to learn basic concepts regarding site\/climate, and this was met for the most part, although the extremely compressed time frame allowed for only a cursory pass at issues that require more investigation to understand at a level that would be useful for studio, etc.",
    "I had no real expectations for this course.",
    "I had no expectations since the class was brand new.",
    "I was not quite sure what to expect from the class, but I was hoping the topics \u0096 site and climate \u0096 as presented by Michelle and Kate were more integrated. Generally speaking though, the class did meet my expectations."

   "comments": [
    "I had learned a lot of it during my undergrad so it was a good review for me. I had forgotten some of the value lessons so this class reminded me to think about those again.",
    "i was often overloaded with information that didn't take the large scale issues into question. therefore the material often ended up feeling dry and uninteresting even though it shouldn't be.",
    "I think the value was generally low. Again, there was some very helpful information, but it was mixed in with a fair amount of busy work.",
    "There is no way to learn the principles of environmental design and landscape architecture in three (Friday) classes apiece\u0097it is simply not enough time. I appreciated learning a little bit about each subject, but I doubt that this course will have helped me long term, because the information did not really sink in.",
    "The material presented was interesting, new, and extremely valuable.I feel that it was a wise decision not to wait until second year to introduce us to climactic analysis and landscape.",
    "I did find most of the information very valuable, however, I was having trouble with transferring the information I learned in class to my studio class, for example, and apply it to my projects.",
    "fairly low. It's obviously important subject matter but I don't think it was presented in a productive manner or in the correct sequence."

    "They were very knowledgeable.",

    "I thought that the lectures were informative, but that was all it needed to be.",
    "Michelle Addington was very good\u0097it\u0092s clear that she knows her stuff. If anything, she sometimes got ahead of the class because the complex subject matter didn\u0092t sink into our tired brains very quickly. Kate John-Alder is clear in her presentations, but sometimes I didn\u0092t understand the logic behind the subject matter. There was a lot of focus on 1960s and 70s landscape theorists and practitioners, and it felt dated.",
    "I learned more from Michele in one lecture than I learned from all of my other instructors in the course of one week. Her lectured were densely packed with information, but easy enough to follow along because of the graphic representation and her willingness to stop for questions.During Kate's session, there were times when I felt confused or rushed along, especially when the concept of grading was first introduced. It would benefit the class if less knowledge was taken for granted, and all of the information was presented as if for the very first time. It would also help to be able to revisit more of the slides from the lecture on our own time.",
    "Both, Michelle and Kate, are extremely knowledgeable regarding the topics they were teaching, however, I wonder whether the information that was presented in class could be graphically more compelling.",
    "Both Michelle and Kate are extremely knowledgeable and are engaging lecturers. They were both trying to cram way too much information into too-brief class meetings though, with confusing and frustrating results.",
    "Both Michelle and Kate were extremely knowledgeable on their subject matter, and were great lecturers overall."

    "None. It seemed to work.",
    "I generally appreciated the discussions in this class. The course work load was more than anticipated, considering the work load for otherclasses. This sometimes feels like busy work. I retained more from the lectures, in-class discussions than the out-of -class assignments.",
    "Please refer to question 3.",
    "If the course stays, cut back on the work out of class.",
    "It was strange to combine environmental science and landscape architecture into one half semester course. It would make more sense to combine Kate\u0092s landscape lectures from this class and last semester into one landscape course, and keep environmental design separate. But I don\u0092t know that there is really room in the second semester schedule to cover both subjects well.",
    "As I mentioned previously, making the information visually more attractive could be one way of improving the course. Also, it would be great if there is any way to make a connection with the studio projects that the students are concurrently working on.",
    "The landscape portion of the course was a little too technical and not quite as useful or engaging as the climate portion.",
    "more case studies."
