   "comments": [
    "We learned how to develop a strategic environmental communications campaign from start to finish. I now feel equipped with the skills and resources to go through a similar process for the organizations I work for. The class is relevant to ALL ENVIRONMENTAL WORK, and I am constantly thinking about how an organization's work, goals, or intentions are communicated to their audience.",
    "I learned the theories and strategies behind strategic communications. I learned how to develop a communications plan, and I learned how difficult it is to do communications well!",
    "The insights where many and my notebook from this class is among the ones I'll treasure the most because of all the notes and quotes both from the professor's experience and feedback in class, and from the guest speakers' accounts and thoughts. Really, really, really useful and valuable being able to sit through those and I am really grateful to the professor for having invited all those wonderful guests to the class.",
    "The ability to have a develop a conservation strategy and plan.",
    "I was able to directly apply strategic communication theory to a real-world project, which was incredibly rewarding and raised the stakes for providing high-quality output during the class.",
    "How to effectively navigate the world of environmental communications for a specific institution in the current media landscape.",
    "This course certainly helped me think about environmental communications in a structured and rigorous way, from initial planning steps and bigger picture ideas to the nitty gritty details of how to actually implement a communications campaign. Working through the textbook and its sequential checklists and applying these to a specific organization or group gave us direct practice in applying these concepts every week. And the in-class lectures and chances to speak with guests helped in this learning as well."

   "comments": [
    "Exceeded them!",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class aligned with my expectations very well.",
    "I did not expect to have such insightful guests speakers in the class and that completely exceed my expectations. I feel the main textbook used does provide clear and usable skills for the real world (been there before, and this will make a difference if I'm there again in the future). This aspect met my expectations and that is remarkable, since it's more common to have them not being met in classes. The seminar is also very well structured and runs smoothly, which is something that does not necessarily happen too often.",
    "Very well.",
    "The skills I gained exceeded my expectations.",
    "I wasn't really sure what to expect, but was pleased with the content and breadth of the course.",
    "Overall, the class did align with my expectations in giving insight and skills around environmental communication. However, I did find the textbook that we followed - which guided all of the assignments - to be a bit limiting\/narrow in the type of communication strategy it addressed, and I had hoped for the class to be a bit more broad in discussing environmental communications in a variety of situations - though of course only so much can be covered in a half semester course. One other critique was that I had hoped for active conversation and discussion in the class and more opportunities to think through different communications strategies as a class. We did have a couple good discussions - one that comes to mind is when we viewed different organizations' ads and talked about the tactics they were using - but overall the class was a bit more lecture based than I think I had expected."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this class - I only wish it was a semester-long class. There was so much to unpack here.. Also, more detailed feedback on briefs would have been helpful. (It has been more than a month and a half since we submitted our final papers and I do not believe we have received a grade.)",
    "Strengths: -Fantastic teaching -Very relevant, applicable homework and class work -Developing a personal project and final relevant deliverable -Great class discussion -Great relevant guest speakers Weaknesses: Too short! Not enough of these classes offered.",
    "The strength of the course was the peer and instructor feedback during our workshops sessions. The weakness of the course was that there were a lot of readings that we weren't able to discuss in-depth in class.",
    "I wish the course was a full semester. These topics are too complex for a half semester.",
    "I was impressed by the structure of the class and how easily the instructor was able to tie in relevant examples during the lecture to highlight effective messaging strategies. I wish this class had lasted the entire semester - it felt a bit rushed to pull together an entire campaign book in 6 weeks while providing time to dive into the details of our projects during the class discussions. I would also have appreciated a bit more direct guidance on the project.",
    "While I liked the idea of having a specific project to work on throughout the term , it was a little difficult having a project scoped and defined before even starting the class. Even after the first week's worth of material, I would have been asking different questions and looking different places as I thought about a project.",
    "A strength of the course was having such a clear course trajectory and structure with the use sequential checklists from the textbook to write our weekly briefs. This definitely helped sum up the course in a concise way and provided a clear toolkit to use in the future. On the other hand, this adherence to the textbook structure - which was written for public relations campaigns geared more towards the business sector, it seemed - I think might have also prevented us from talking more about communications within an environment-specific context. I would also have appreciated more overview of the history of environmental communications and how this strategic approach learns from - and deviates from - that past. And as mentioned above, having more opportunities for discussion, in-class analysis, and critical thinking through concepts I think could make the course stronger. I felt that the class didn't really challenge me to think differently in the way that I had hoped. And some discussion of cognitive studies and how we can address these different concepts such as cognitive bias and social norms I think would have also been great. Of course, one of the main strengths of the course is the instructor and his incredible experience in communications and it was great to be able to learn from him and the guests that he brought in to video chat with the class."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Take it! Put effort into your application! This course is relevant for pretty much anyone in the environmental field.",
    "Do the readings because it will reinforce what you are learning in class and make your class sessions more enjoyable.",
    "This seminar is intense but ideal for people wanting to structure their semesters so as to have more credits worth of work towards the first half and then have less coursework and more time for other classes or whatever they are up to on the second half of their semester. The insights from the guest speakers are worth this course in GOLD. If for some reason you are not accepted into the class, find a way to audit it. The guest speakers were amazing and well beyond worth it. Tony's insights are too, of course, and for those of us who don't have the benefit of working closely with him, this course allows you to peek into processes you'd otherwise get no access to. The only case in which I would not recommend this seminar to a student is if he\/she comes from a strong marketing or strategic communications background. In that case it's only the speakers and the professor's insights that will be worth it and I'd recommend an audit instead of the committal to all the weekly work and readingswhich ARE intense for such a short seminar.",
    "Work on a project with a client that you have an existing relationship with. Meet with Tony one on one!",
    "This class will require quite a bit of time to compile weekly briefs, but the weekly assignments keep you on track to create a comprehensive communications plan for a real-world organization. Definitely worth taking!",
    "Helpful when thinking about how your organization fits into the larger media landscape around environmental issues.",
    "This class is definitely a good introduction to creating a communications strategy, and you benefit both from Dr. Leiserowitz's immense experience as well as practical application of ideas through making your own strategic plan throughout the course of the class. The assignments are fairly straightforward and well structured. However, at least in the 2017 course, the class focused on a very specific type of communications campaign, and was not as broad an overview of environmental communications as I personally had hoped, and is also more lecture-based than the discussion-oriented class I had anticipated. And while the creation of our own individual cohesive strategic communications campaigns was a helpful exercise, I did not feel like it necessarily challenged me to apply new concepts or think differently. Overall, though, the class was definitely a positive experience and I would recommend it to anyone interested in communication tactics."
