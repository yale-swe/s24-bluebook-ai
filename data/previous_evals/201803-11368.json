    "This course was exceptional. Professor Echeverri is a great discussion leader, and she incorporated all of our responses into the class material each session. I enjoyed the student presentations, each of which consistently added something to class discussions, and the short Tannenbaum paper, which pushed our analysis of class material in a new direction. Discussion was always lively, in part due to the diversity in expertise among the students.",

    "Absolutely, yes --- this field is historiographically rich and constantly growing, and Professor Echeverri knows both the literature and the issues inside and out. Readings and discussions were intensely interesting, and the papers\/presentations each added something to the class.",
    "Yes, but primarily for those with a grounding in the history of the Spanish Empire and\/or Central and South America."
