    "I learned how to master derivation learned in the fall, different forms of derivation, namely logarithmic and trigonometric, integration, and applications of these concepts.",

    "Basic Calculus",
    "John hall is awesome. He helps students individually and is great",
    "Trigonometry, integration, differential equations (basic)",
    "Coming from a background with absolutely no calculus experience, I learned many new concepts this semester taking this class. It was extremely hard for me, but eventually I was able to grasp concepts like differentiation, trigonometry, limits, related rates, integrals, and antiderivatives.",
    "I learned more about calculus and how to take derivatives and use trigonometry",
    "A lot about solving complex problems.",
    "Intro to calc and a little further than 112",
    "I developed a much better basic understanding of calculus by taking this course.",
    "I developed how to analyze calculus in a more in depth way, from the perspective of a beginner."

   "comments": [
    "strength: clear and in depth explanation weakness: difficult problem sets that were very different than what we learned",
    "weaknesses include not enough review of concepts",
    "One strength is the amount of office hours made available to students. They were truly essential in solidifying my understanding of the course material. One weakness is the workshops. Although the length of the workshops was shortened this semester, they were not that helpful in trying to obtain a better understanding of the material covered that week. In addition, a small weakness to the organization of the course was that midterm 1 covered 2 chapters, while midterm 2 covered about 5, so it would be great if that could be equally divided somehow next year.",
    "Good math class.",
    "This course is great, and it is taught in a good way. It might have been taught too quickly for someone who never took calculus before, but it was still very informative.",
    "There are plenty of office hours for help, its not too much material but it goes deep into it, and there are challenging problems in class\/workshop but the tests are easy! Perfect course",
    "The classroom was horrible other than that overall very good",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Hall. He's a clear lecturer who makes you feel comfortable asking questions in class. He always strives to not leave students behind, which is great since many of us taking the course do not have strong math backgrounds. Another strength is the sheer number of opportunities you have to engage with the material. We have two weekly problem sets, a longer one and a short one, which means you're consistently applying and practicing what you learn in class. A weakness of this course would have to be the workshops, however. I think they would be better if the TAs and the fellow students took them more seriously, but as they are right now, many students see them as a chore and are actively on their phones throughout. David is really the only TA that I ever saw make a strong effort to keep the structure of the workshops. He always made sure we got something out of it. I think part of this student antagonism towards the workshops is their frequency. Since they can be rather long, it would be great if they were every other week as opposed to every week. Also, maybe they can be scheduled for the harder topics we cover as a supplemental tutoring session of sorts.",
    "The only thing that I think could improve the course would be to assign problem sets that better reflected what was taught in class. Many times I would have no idea how to do the homework and the problems didn't look similar to what I took notes on in class. I would have to go to office hours to get step-by-step help from the learning assistants.",
    "It is very organized but hard to follow because we do not do many problems in class like the ones on the exams",
    "The office hours were good because there were so many but some TAs did not know the information.",
    "More homework like questions in class",
    "I really enjoyed the workshop aspect as well as the continuity from Math 110 with Professor Hall."

    "If mathematics is not your strong suit I would highly recommend this course. It is essentially Math 112 broken up into two semesters, which is a good thing. I thought the pacing of Math 110\/111 was perfect for me as a learner. You are getting the Math 112 credit in a year opposed to one semester. Teaches calculus which is a skill most need in their respective majors.",
    "yes, professor hall is a great math teacher who is passionate about what he teaches and wants to help everyone succeed. the course is fair. content is not exciting but it is a necessary skill to learn.",
    "yes for those who want a paced course of math",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend taking the 1 year math sequence over Math 112 if it does not conflict with any distributional or major requirements for the academic year. The work was overall manageable, and the exams were pretty fair throughout the year. Take the sequence with Professor Hall!",
    "A good math class if you truly want to learn math. Dr. Hall is a fantastic instructor and the learning assistants are great.",
    "I would. As a continuation of MATH 110, this is a great course.",
    "Absolutely. Much better course than 112. You really learn the material well and its chill",
    "Yes yes it is great for people not superstring in math. Slow but learning a lot",
    "I would only recommend this if you're truly unconfident with your math skills and want to build a strong base. I think I underestimated my own math abilities in choosing this course and didn't always feel like I was being challenged as much as I could have. However, Professor Hall is not at fault for that; he is an excellent instructor that makes math understandable and would be a great intro to math for those who came from disadvantaged backgrounds. The exams are fair, the problem sets are not particularly grueling or lengthy, and the TAs are very helpful during office hours. This is as smooth of a math experience as you are likely to get within the math intro courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who hasn't taken calculus in high school, or has very little understanding of it. It is possible to learn all of the different concepts.",
    "Yes it is a good QR credit",
    "Yes. I learned a lot.",
    "Yes if they cant keep up with pace of 112",
    "Yes i most definitely would! Especially to students who are interested in pursuing a degree in a STEM related field",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this to any student that has never taken a calculus course before, as the professors allow a great introduction to the material."
