   "comments": [
    "The class offers a survey of some of the most influential cultural currents of Renaissance Italy with a strong emphasis upon Florence and Rome. I would recommend the course to any student interested in the early modern period, especially one interested in courtly culture, political thought, and the early Humanist tradition.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone already interested in the period.",
    "HIST 563 is a whirlwind tour of the society and culture of Renaissance Italy. You will be asked to engage critically with both the secondary literature and primary sources on\/about the period. I highly recommend the course.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "I would recommend the course simply by virtue of having Quint as an instructor.",
    "The course is a broad overview of Renaissance Italy, particularly 15th Century Florence. The course is useful for understanding that place and time as well as the future movements inspired by them.",
    "I definitely would, although it is a challenging course (but in a good way)."

   "comments": [
    "I came away with a clear and specific understanding of some large-scale cultural movements in Italy of which I previously had only a vague knowledge. It was good to get this foundation, even though I don't anticipate that the topics that came up in the class will play a very important role in my dissertation. The class's interdisciplinary focus and integrated approach to the Renaissance enriched my understanding of the period.",
    "It was good to focus on a different geographical region than the one I usually study.",
    "It provided insight into a period I was unfamiliar with. I see little impact on my dissertation\/research.",
    "The focus on art history and social history, besides the literary materials, is extremely helpful for me to better understand Italian Renaissance as a whole.",
    "The course material deepened my knowledge of the Renaissance by familiarizing me with works by Lorenzo de Medici and Angelo Poliziano that I had never read despite studying the period for quite a while. Professor Quint also raised fascinating questions about the relationship between humanism and the temporal alienation of modernity.",
    "The course is invaluable background for research in southern and northern renaissance culture. A valuable experience in philosophy, literature, and art."
