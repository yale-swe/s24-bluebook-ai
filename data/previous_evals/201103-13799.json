    "Yes.",
    "The resources at Yale are amazing. My only complaint is about the Arts' Library book check-out policy, in addition to its hours. Architecture students work around the clock and 11 pm is a pretty early closing time. And one-day check-out is a bit stingy too, if it weren't for the student-shelf system it would be almost impossible to write a well-researched paper.",
