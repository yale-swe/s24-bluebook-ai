    "This is quite a demanding class, both in class and outside. Large, large amounts of homework. Classwork is pretty much all discussion, which is good on some days but horrible when you're not feeling it. I had Schneider, who is an excellent professor and who also forces you to keep on your toes, often more than you'd like to. I'd definitely recommend the course as a way to improve your French, but anyone wanting to take it \"just because\" should seriously consider the amount of work it entails.",
    "Honestly only take it if you're super interested in French.",
    "Perfect if you want to improve your french!",
    "French 150 is a natural step after French 140 but it mostly focuses on speaking. I would recommend this class because even though it is 3x a week it is great practice for oral skills. The pieces that we read were complex in an interesting way and the small class size is enjoyable.",
    "This class is absolutely incredible and is definitely worth taking if you want to improve your writing skills and fluency in french. The approach is geared towards engaging class discussions centered on very interesting films and texts. By the end of the class my french skills had dramatically improved in a seemingly effortless way because the classes were just so enjoyable. Take it with Professor Schneider if you can, she is amazing!",
    "Quite demanding class in terms of workload but worth the effort, really improves your French, especially with Professor Schneider.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who would like to improve their understanding and use of French. I felt very grateful I took it and solidified the grammar I had learned in previous French courses. I would summarize it as starting from reviewing the basics of grammar and quickly delving to a deep level of complexity of understanding and also covering many new grammar topics. An extensive list of new vocabulary is learned and spoken conversation is vasty improved upon.",
    "French 150 is a work heavy course that pushes students to improve their French through reading, acting, poetry and observing art (and much more). Students expanded their vocabulary and learned very specific grammar. I would recommend this class to anyone wishing to improve their French who is willing to put in a lot of work."
