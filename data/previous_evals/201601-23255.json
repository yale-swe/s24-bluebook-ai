    "definitelyyyyyy, we should all take more time to learn about the city that takes us in over the four years of our career",
    "Excellent course with engaging discussions. If you're looking to talk about public policy and its effects on various aspects of city living and life as a US citizen, definitely take this course. Also, Mr. DeStefano is wonderful.",
    "Definitely take it if you have any interest in urban planning\/policy\/New Haven politics. You aren't going to get a better resource than Mayor DeStefano, even if you disagree with him on things.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to most political science majors and other social scientists who want to delve deeper into some of the most important historical and contemporary challenges for the city of New Haven. You'll also learn about case studies from other cities that illuminate what works and what doesn't. As a teacher, DeStefano is unique and entertaining in his personality and his approach. He does well to get to know his students."
