   "comments": [
    "Interesting look at CBW and nuclear weapons over the course of the 20th century. Kevles is good but very nitpicky- he wants you to know exact details from readings and be able to recite them in class. workload was not too overbearing but definitely more than your standard history class.",
    "Take it. Cool stuff, solid professor, not too much work so if youre interested in that kinda thing then its great",
    "I definitely recommend this course. If you like science and history, this is an especially good class for you, since it looks at the role of science in history, which is essential to understanding some of the most important events of the last century.",
    "This class has a ton of reading, and since it was difficult to do it all, the discussions were lacking, even though Professor Kevles tried to get us to talk as much as possible.",
    "It's a history of military technology and policy over the last hundred years, all of which is awesome. There's a lot of reading, but no more than for any other junior seminar, and it makes for a fascinating level of detail. You don't know yet just how interesting these stories are - take my word, five stars."
