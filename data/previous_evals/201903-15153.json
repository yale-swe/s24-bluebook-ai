    "I developed a lot of knowledge about the Black Diaspora in different parts of the world. Also, I've learned a lot the experiences of people and their gender formation in various parts around the globe.",
    "I learned about qualitative research and the proper ways to conduct research based on people's accounts (ethnographies).",
    "This course has provided me with a plethora of knowledge. My critical thinking and close reading reading skills have improved tremendously, as has my ability to eloquently express my thoughts in an academic setting.",
    "I gained extensive knowledge about the Black Diaspora, not only from the American perspective but from the perspective of black people in other countries throughout the world. I gained new forms of dialogue about black history and the black experience. I feel like my writing improved by taking this course. It became more sophisticated and academic.",
    "Was able to gain an understanding of the Black diaspora from a global perspective and how to critically analyze ethnographic work. Also learned how to conduct an ethnography research and how to do it in a responsible manner to the human subjects in question",
    "I learned about the Africa Diaspora as a concept and study. I learned about the study of anthropology through ethnographies about black women of the diaspora across the world which studied how they positioned themselves in their society."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: a lot of open discussion allowed for everyone to contribute different ideas and help each other learn a new perspective Weaknesses: sometimes the course does derail from the syllabus, but Professor Barnes is able to adapt according to that",
    "Some of the strengths of the course can't be (legally) replicated. I feel that the class is better when 10 or fewer students and our class, in particular, was able to have some very interesting and in-depth conversations about the Black diaspora because all of the students were Black and the environment wasn't one of fear and caution. The course would do well to have a more structured timeline, because often in class we would spend a large amount of time on one topic and have to skim or completely skip another topic necessary for the course.",
    "The discussions we had in this class were really eye-opening and all the work we did was not only important and helpful to our learning process, it was also enjoyable. I only wish we had more time to discuss some of the really interesting works we read.",
    "There were multiple discussions about different readings that we weren't able to have because there simply wasn't enough time during class, and we lost our TA so there was no section. We had to skip over parts of the course because the syllabus schedule would get switched around a lot. Having a TA and section for the course would be very helpful.",
    "Strengths were the lectures, the class discussions, and the selection of the works we studied. The only weakness was that we had so much to talk about and so many of the works to dissect that it felt like there wasnt enough time to cover everything",
    "Strengths: EVERYTHING! -The Syllabus and Structure of the Course: The course begins with some big questions about African Diaspora that are answered through the works of numerous scholars. While the readings can feel dense and confusing at the beginning, Prof. Barnes has structured the course so that by the end students are able to break down all of these scholarly ideas in any context, it is a truly rewarding experience. Every single part of the class is essential in getting you there-- the papers, the midterm, the class lectures, the ethnography report - Professor Barnes: She is the mastermind behind this amazing course, it is clear that over her years of teaching the course and through her insight as an anthropologist herself that she has fine-tuned this syllabus to perfection. Unfortunately, she will not be teaching the course so I will not spend to long raving about her in this section - Ethnographies: Reading about the experiences of these black women across the world and drawing themes and comparisons between them was truly fascinating. Doing these readings did not even feel like work. Weaknesses: The only weakness I can think of is this course did not have a separate section, because the University got rid of it. The section would have been helpful in allowing for more discussion which would have helped us keep to the syllabus more closely timing wise. But even without the discussion section Professor Barnes made SURE that we had time to have discussion and work through these things in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think that this course widens your worldview and allows you to gain experience with racial, gender, nationality and class formation within the Black Diaspora. This is something that everyone should learn since the Black experience is very nuanced in different parts of the world.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The discussions we had in this class were really eye-opening and all the work we did was not only important and helpful to our learning process, it was also enjoyable.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course. Everything that we learned was interesting and incited deep conversations. I am extremely happy that I took this course.",
    "Yes I would, you gain such a heightened world view of diaspora and black studies",
    "Absolutely. This is my favorite course I have taken at Yale and has made me decide to pursue a double major in anthropology and perhaps even consider graduate school. The syllabus has been crafted so that this is a learning experience from the beginning to the end. Every single assignment, reading, and lecture builds up to the final project of the class in which students complete their own ethnographies. It was INCREDIBLY rewarding to see how much I had grown as a student in the final project, I was able to reference and think in terms of the very scholars who confused me at the beginning of the course. With that said, this course will require you to put in some work. There are a good number of papers due and you must keep up with the readings to stay engaged in class but it is all SO WORTH IT. The readings are incredibly engaging and relevant. If you are even slightly interested in African-American history, I this course is an absolute MUST TAKE for you, you will not regret it. If you are interested in anthropology, this course is a MUST TAKE. If you find that your knowledge of history and the world is very eurocentric and you are looking to expand your knowledge about people, you MUST TAKE this course. In short, everyone could take this course with Professor Barnes. You will not regret it."
