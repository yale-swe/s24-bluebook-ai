   "comments": [
    "An excellent introduction to astronomy which balances breadth and depth. Gives a solid grounding in the scientific method as well. Prof Edwards is a clear and engaging lecturer.",
    "Straightforward Sc credit: very clear expectations and interesting material.",
    "ASTR 160 provides a basic overview of several interesting developments related to space. It provides a good introduction for anyone unfamiliar with this topic. I recommend it as a science credit.",
    "It's a fun, interesting introduction to what's new in astronomy. It's pretty basic, although some of the p-sets are pretty tricky.",
    "Frontiers is a decent survey of some interesting issues in Astronomy. The course involves a bit of math but only at the very elementary level.",
    "Take it as a science credit! I thought I would find astrophysics really dry, but Prof Edwards makes it interesting and fun. Material is not too difficult. Find practice exams online by look for past years' materials.",
    "Good class, take it for Qr or Sc credit.",
    "Definitely recommend, grades are easy to get if you put in the work which makes the class more enjoyable; you can just focus on the material.",
    "Definitely would recommend the class, as long as you are interested in the material.",
    "Very interesting class. I would definitely recommend it, but to someone who is interested in our theories of how our universe functions and enjoys to do simple math. If you don't like math at all\/passionately hate math there are other science credits out there. That said, I thought it was wonderful.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who is interested in learning about the universe, did not want a particularly math intensive QR and is comfortable with a course without a written reference.",
    "A pretty easy science course. 9:00am is tough at times (and you actually have to go, because you get credit for in-class assignments), but Professor Edwards is engaging and the material can be really interesting.",
    "For those who tell you it's not a gut - they're lying. I came into this class as a global affairs major wanting to actually learn a lot regarding astrophysics, and while I certainly accomplished that goal, overall I wish I would've learned more. It's a solid science credit for someone looking to not really put in that much effort - psets every few weeks that take a couple hours to do, and tests are pretty easy. I would definitely recommend it if you have some sort of physics background, it's not bad at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend ASTR 160 for non astronomy majors. I left with a pretty good understanding of some cool topics like black holes, dark matter, and general relativity and the class was really easy overall.",
    "Definitely recommend. It is an easy science credit. The tests are pretty easy although it is painful to wake up at 9am.",
    "This course isn't difficult, but it is a real amount of workthat is, you can't skip every lecture and not study. The material is really interesting. However, because it is such a non-major course, even though I'm a total humanities student I found myself trudging through what felt like busy work.",
    "DO not take it unless you truly and genuinely find astrophysics interesting.",
    "Highly recommended if you want to take a course in astronomy but don't want to go hard about it. It's a very chill class, easy to get good grade, but still quite enjoyable.",
    "I would reccomend this course. Somewhat challenging, interesting and well taught.",
    "This is a pretty good way to get a science credit. It's not that mathy, and the material isn't very difficult. It's also pretty interesting. Professor Edwards is a solid teacher and does a nice job of covering the material.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you are a humanities major looking for a low-stress, high-reward science credit. Professor Edwards is fantastic at teaching and everything in the class is presented in order that it remains memorable and so that the students can actively work to synthesize and understand the material.",
    "If you not tryna put any work in, don't do it. If you just need the qr\/sc, don't do it. It's a trap. It's a god damn trap.",
    "The course is an interesting overview of some of the foremost topics in astrophysics. Some of the material was very conceptual (i.e. dark energy\/matter), and some of it was very practical (learning newtonian physics). For anyone looking for a physics-type science who doesn't want to take PHYS 160\/180 or lab, this would probably be a good fit. PSets are about every other week and doable. My biggest complaint is the incompetence of a couple of the TAs -- it was clear that they sometimes hadn't looked over the homework or couldn't explain questions from graded exams, which was extremely frustrating.",
    "10\/10 would recommend. Fun, easy, and interesting",
    "Definitely take this course if you're a humanities person looking for a clear, simple, and interesting QR\/SC. It's not that much work and it's graded nicely, and Professor Edwards is awesome.",
    "i liked telling people i was in an astrohpysics class",
    "Yes",
    "ASTR 160 is a great science gut. The material is very easy and actually very interesting. Having to wake up for the 9:00 am lectures that happened to be extremely dull and quite annoying is obviously a catch you have to take for an easy A. But overall, these nuisances were worth it. I can now watch interstellar and appreciate it much more.",
    "Gut Science Credit that uses a lot of math to learn about how stuff works in the universe. Very interesting material, not incredibly well-taught. PSets won't take too long and studying for tests shouldn't take more than about 2 nights. Take if you need a Science Credit.",
    "Overall a solid course. It struck a good balance between being engaging and not being unaccessible to people who aren't strongest in science. Problem sets and tests were structured fairly, and the class was pretty well organized.",
    "This course broadly covers three subjects of astronomy. Exoplanets, Black holes, and Dark Matter. Overall I would not recommend this course to someone who is interested in astronomy or wants an easy science credit. This course isn't very difficult but some may take the class with the assumption that is a very easy class, which to be fair it is not.",
    "An okay class for a science credit. It's pretty clearly pitched to the non-science major who doesn't really like to do math, so you get buzzwords, some rudimentary concepts, and some very basic formulas to apply. It's not too challenging, though probably a bit more challenging than one would first expect. No textbook, so all questions on problem sets and exams are based on lectures. Moreover, there were only 6 psets this semester. Be warned: attendance at lecture, and participation in the mini-activities, counts for a participation grade.",
    "9 am is brutal and attendance is mandatory. But if you need a science credit and you're not tryna take a bio course--take it. The slides are not very helpful, and the psets will often feel irrelevant to what you learned in class, but with a group of homies and a few google searches you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 160 to students interested in astronomy or physics; it's very interesting and you definitely learn new things and by the end of the course, you'll look at the universe in a different way.",
    "This is a gut course, plain and simple. Go to the classes and turn in the problem sets on time and you will get an A. Louise Edwards is not an excellent lecturer, but the material is sufficiently interesting such that paying attention won't be a painful exercise.",
    "Silly gut class. So easy that she felt she had to make the tests difficult by asking irrelevant questions and using ambiguous wording. it was still pretty easy, though, take it if you need a QR\/Sc. Otherwise stay as far away from it as possible.",
    "Pretty basic qr",
    "Would definitely recommend as a science credit; touches on a lot of the most mysterious\/coolest topics in astrophysics in a very manageable way for non-science majors.",
    "ASTR 160 provides a fascinating look at three of the topics currently at the \"frontiers\" of astronomical research: planets around stars other than our Sun, black holes, and the Dark Universe. With this focus, the course is more detailed and interesting than a general survey coursewhich also makes it a bit more difficult. All of the material is accessible, but do expect to spend some time on the problem sets. All that said, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The syllabus is fascinating, and Prof. Edwards's enthusiasm makes every lecture enjoyable.",
    "If you want a gut course for a science credit, this class is not too much work, but (as someone who went it feeling pretty interested in the topics) the content isn't terribly engaging.",
    "This course is a great science class that isn't too rigorous. You learn about topics that are being discussed and investigated currently. You also get to take a trip to the observatory, one of my favorite parts of the class.",
    "Easy science credit with little work.",
    "Great class for people interested in the subject, but not too into math.",
    "This is a really fun and interesting QR and SC course for students who aren't QR or SC majors but nevertheless don't want a completely gut course. The class is split into 3 parts -- exoplanets, black holes, and the dark universe (dark matter and dark energy) -- with two non-cumulative midterms and a final. In-class participation is a big part of this class, though, so do not take this class if you don't plan on showing up. Still, the topics are super interesting and worth learning about.",
    "Overall this is a fine science course for non-science majors. A little slow if you have some background in the topics, but the topics are interesting.",
    "Very interesting and manageable science credit for non-science majors.",
    "Great course. I loved my time in this class, and it is incredibly interesting. I'd definitely recommend it to all non-science majors who are looking for a fulfilling science\/QR credit.",
    "Astro 160 is a great course to take as a science\/QR credit. The material was really cool to think about (i mean, bending the space\/time continuum?? AWESOME) and was definitely within reach for a humanities major such as myself. That's not to say this course is easy by any means. You really have to go to class to understand the material (the slides by themselves aren't helpful) and the problem sets can be tricky, but both Prof. Edwards and the TAs are readily available to talk to so most problems are solved pretty quickly. Professor Edwards is incredible; her undeniable enthusiasm for the subjects being taught is really refreshing and keeps lecture interesting. She's also very FAIR, which is great. In some science classes, the professors make tests unfairly hard so that you leave feeling crappy about yourself, but Prof. Edwards does the opposite--the tests cover EXACTLY what was covered in class and on Psets. Also, she WANTS everyone to do well--the class is graded on a curve where an 85 is an A-. Basically, if you go to class you'll do well and learn cool things.",
    "Subject matter divided into three sections: exoplanets, black holes and dark matter. Lectures with participation activities (multiple choice questions that you hold up your answer to, group discussion, short answer questions that you write down and turn in). Problem sets every week or so, not too difficult but it helps to do them with another person\/people. \"Recommended\" section every week where you can ask questions about things you didn't understand during class and work through the problem set together. Two midterms about exoplanets and black holes and a cumulative final with a heavy focus on dark matter.",
    "Astronomy is a great class for someone who has interest in the questions of science while not having interest in the rigors necessary for in-depth scientific learning. The topics are pretty interesting in and of themselves and make you think more than most introductory math and science classes. I would recommend ASTR 160 for someone trying to get a QR or SC credit without too much strain or to someone interested in some of where science is in debate to this day.",
    "A lot of consistent work for a class with not much reward. Felt like we were being spoon-fed much of the time. It was kind of an annoying thorn in my side this semester.",
    "It covers interesting material about astronomy but the lectures are definitely a gut. Take it if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I would not recommend Frontiers and Controversies in Astrophysics to another student. If you are looking for a science credit, this is not the one. The problem sets are difficult as are exams, and lectures give little to help prepare for assessments. I ultimately did not feel like I learned much from the class, and I think it was largely a waste of a credit.",
    "This class covered many topics that were interesting and new, if you have not taken an astronomy course before. The workload is manageable and help is always readily available so you should be at not disadvantage if you have not taken many math courses.",
    "A great way to be able to converse intelligently about some topics outside your area of interest over dinner, but you don't come out knowing anything substantive about any of them. The math is pretty easy if you have any background at all. You can never skip lecture as there is attendance checking activities, so get pumped for that Thursday at 9am every week.",
    "It's interesting, take it for a QR or SC, it's kind of hard.",
    "This is a mind-blowing course that, for me, really broke down some barriers between philosophy and physics, especially in the sections about black holes, relativity, and dark matter\/energy! You learn the bare minimum basics about these topics, and about exoplanets as well. It is a little frustrating that you can't go into more depth with each topic, but it is an intro class. I actually felt that this was NOT as introductory as it's made out to be. I had an extremely difficult time, even though I am super interested in the subject matter. This was the first QR I've ever taken at Yale, and I had an extremely poor high school math and science education. This was clearly not the case for the majority of the class; I went to endless office hours and section times to get up to speed with the math, which I was told wouldn't be difficult. Talk to Prof. Edwards early; she is an amazing person and really helped me get up to speed. I wish I had talked to her before I bombed the first midterm!"
