    "The course covers a lot of really interesting subjects (Uncertainty in Action: abortion, nuclear warfare, anthropology, criminal trials, etc. etc.) and really challenges students to broaden their scopes of thinking. Andy is always willing to work with students to work on their essays. He structures class discussion well around the articles we read each week, and responds quickly to the drafts students turn in with constructive comments. This is an amazing class and Andy is an amazing teacher; take it!",
    "This class and this section was one of my favorite courses this semester. The topics were interesting when you realize just how little you can be certain of anything in the world - it's definitely gotten me to view things in a new light and think differently. The workload isn't too bad- there were only two extremely long\/difficult pieces to read but if you get through them, you're fine. The class touched on many sensitive topics but that's what made class discussion so interesting. If you keep up with the readings (and they're not that bad) then this class is great and I would definitely recommend it to anyonewho wants to improve their writing skills! Andy was great as well and would give out a lot of help to anyone who needed it - as long as they asked for it.",
    "English 114 is great for students who want to improve their writing skills. I would recommend English 114 to another student because it is a good way to establish basic writing skills that will be useful for future classes.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course. The subject matter was interesting, the readings were, on the whole, engaging and the class discussions were lively. This course is great for anyone trying to improve their level of writing from a high school level to one acceptable in college.",
    "My section won't be offered anymore, but if you're not really into English I would take it over 120. It's easier.",
    "A class that should be taken at an early stage (freshman year) in order to get familiar with academic style of writing. It involves however a significant time commitment.",
    "All but a few readings are short and straightforward, essays are nothing to worry about, especially if you take advantage of the fact that he will give you his comments at any point along the way.",
    "This class is great for anyone who wants to improve their writing. Andy is a very good English teacher.",
    "I recommend the class. It's interesting field, and although the readings are strange and abstract in the beginning, things start to come together towards the end of the course.",
    "Take ENG 114! It is a great introduction to writing at Yale.",
    "Yes I would. It introduces the student to the writing expected at Yale."
