    "I love this class. It is a lot of work but it is very informative and if you like the subject, just take it honestly, it is so worth it. Dufresne is a fantastic teacher, your fellow students will be extremely smart and engaging and all-in-all you'll walk away from this class feeling like you have actually learned something! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this course! The workload is intense but totally manageable. It's also consistent and never going to be overbearing in a particular week. Professor Dufresne is the best, and the material is super interesting. Don't be scared away by rumors of how hard it is--it's not that bad, and it's worth it anyway.",
    "Take it if you can! It is a heavy workload with a lot of reading and weekly assignments, so keep that in mind, but if you are interested in immigration or law (preferably both) this is a really good class. Professor Dufresne is awesome!",
    "This intensive immigration law class is perfect for someone with an interest in either immigration or law. Though Dufresne expects a lot from her students, the class is the most rewarding I have ever taken.",
    "Definitely recommended! The key to this class is time management, if you don't have the time don't force yourself through it (unless you're a senior, then you HAVE to take it!)",
    "If you are interested in immigration at all, take this class. Be prepared, because it requires a lot of work, but I found it extremely satisfying. I had some background on immigration, and this gave me an excellent foundation on how the legal system actually works. The class mostly alternates between mock trials\/debates over foundational cases for immigration law, which is an excellent way to learn these concepts. Professor Dufresne's style will force you to consider both sides of the debate, which will give you a deeper understanding of the material. It is important to know that if you are looking for an opportunity to discuss immigration from a historical or sociological perspective, you might want to look for a different class. This class really focuses on the nitty gritty of the legal side of immigration. There is some space to discuss your ideas, but this class is more about understanding what the law can actually do.",
    "]This class is incredible and probably the best class I've taken at Yale. I knew almost nothing about immigration law coming into the class, so don't worry if you feel like you don't know as much - you will basically learn everything from scratch. I don't know how it was possible to cram so much material in just 12-13 weeks but Professor Dufresne managed to do it, and I enjoyed the class so much. A lot of the class is weekly oral debates\/arguments based on cases, which really helps you learn the material and is also just really fun. There is definitely a significant amount of reading each week - usually around 100 pages or so, but it's dense reading. To be honest though, I thought almost every page of the reading was super interesting and so I didn't mind at all, and I never regretted taking the class due to the amount of work - I think it's one of the few classes at Yale where every single page\/assignment is pretty much worth it. Professor Dufresne is also amazing - she has a talent for leading class and getting people interested in the material. She's never overbearing as a discussion leader and I think she's found the perfect balance of choosing the right people to talk, structuring class discussions, etc. The class is clearly well crafted because every assignment she made us do really helped me internalize what we were working on - nothing felt superfluous or like a waste of my time. I can't praise this class enough - I was generally interested in the law before class, but I think honestly anyone would take away a lot from this class (the ability to think critically, read dense stuff, write well, etc.) I wish I'd taken it earlier while here at Yale. Also, Professor Dufresne is amazingly helpful at just talking about life\/career things in addition to just being an awesome professor, so if you're at all interested in doing public interest law\/law school\/etc. she can be really helpful. Finally, this was one of the only classes that actually changed my mind materially about certain things, and I think that's really the mark of a great class. Try to only take 4 classes or have a reasonable schedule otherwise - I found myself wanting to spend a ton of time on this class and I think to get the most out of it, you should really put in the work.",
    "Absolutely recommend - the reviews proved true. Probably the best seminar I have taken at Yale. Taught in a socratic style with a heavy reliance on case reading and debate, the class is a great introduction to legal thought and argument. I probably had one of the weakest backgrounds in immigration itself in the class (was mostly there for the law element) and still loved it. Because you are split into teams early in the class, also very easy to make friends with your classmates.",
    ". Take this course if you can, it's absolutely fantastic. A great survey of all aspects of US immigration, it is completely grounded in the reality of American law. While some aspects of policy and philosophy are discussed, the course focuses you to take into account actual precedent and existing systems. Oral arguments are great and the reading isn't that bad if you keep up with it.",
    "Great class but lots of group work. Was really frustrating at times. Other than that, loved the class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. OMG TAKE THIS CLASS. IT'S WORTH THE HYPE (MORE THAN THE HYPE). This class is amazing. Hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. This class will push you harder intellectually than any other class you've taken\/will take at Yale. It's a ton of work, but it doesn't even feel like it's a ton of work because you want to do all the work because Prof. Dufresne makes everything worth it. Seriously, take this class if you want to go to law school or if you want to be challenged and pushed intellectually or if you want to be surrounded by intelligent classmates and a brilliant professor, or better yet, all of the above!!! You will feel so proud of yourself every week as you see yourself grow and collaborate with\/be challenged by your intelligent classmates who care about the class as much as you do. Prof. Dufresne pours her heart and soul into this class and makes you think really hard about important questions about law\/policy\/justice system\/etc., and challenge your own assumptions\/deeply-rooted political beliefs, and just grow so so much intellectually. She also cares so much about her students and is willing to help them outside of class in so many ways. Take this class if you get in. It is absolutely amazing.",
    "Yes! Worth the work. You learn a lot about argumentative writing and immigration policy."
