By the way he has interacted with these characters throughout his career, you can really get to see what it is like to do diplomacy in a challenging part of the world.",

    "I dont think this class should be repeated in this form at all. It could be kind of a capstone, but without a syllabus and consistent readings, it would simply be a waste of precious resources to offer this class again in its form.",
    "Strengths -- I enjoyed the focus on historical issues and how Amb. Crocker weaves in current events. He's an expert and deeply knowledgable. Weakness -- the course is very unstructured -- which I don't mind -- but I do think you can achieve more in a course if you have a roadmap of where you're heading."
