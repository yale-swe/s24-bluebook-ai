    "I gained a greater understanding of the research in Yale's physics department.",
    "How to write fellowship applications, active areas of research in the department etc.",
    "It helped me in affirming what specialty I wanted to pursue for my PhD and helped my self esteem somewhat."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course was stronger when the instructor was there, when it was just a visiting professor it seemed like the engagement was much lower. Maybe it should have been a shorter length of time since we usually finished early, especially if we had just one professor talking to us.",
    "This course provided a good forum through which students were able to discuss ideas about graduate school and receive helpful guidance. The main weakness of the course was that it felt like it overly emphasized the research discussions from the faculty on a weekly basis which the vast majority of students were not interested in on a weekly basis because of the lack of overlap in research interests. I'm not sure how that could be improved however other than by making attendance non-mandatory for research talks.",
    "This course offered a good balance of exposure to research, understanding of what different types of research look like day to day, and some special topics lectures. Two of my favorite classes of this semester were on growth mindset and applying for fellowships. I think a few other special topics added to the course would be excellent and helpful in the first semester of graduate school. I would have benefited from discussing issues such as time management in graduate school and scientific writing. I think it would be extremely helpful if we had a separate course or lecture series on writing papers and dissertations in graduate school.",
    "Make sure the bonus lectures (fellowship writing etc) are important to international students as well.",
    "Getting to see multiple research areas was helpful in seeing what is out there in physics. It also was helpful for fellowship information. It would be nice to know who was presenting further in advance."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe, it was interesting to hear from professors about their research, but there are also other ways to do that.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students that are interested in finding a research advisor and a subfield of physics that they are interested in. For students who already know who they are working with, I think this course is less useful, but it is still good for the days that things such as fellowships and graduate school curricula were discussed.",
    "I'd recommend it as it is a good class for getting one's bearings in grad school."
