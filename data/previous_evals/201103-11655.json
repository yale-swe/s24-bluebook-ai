   "comments": [
    "This class focuses on the way in which the American Indian narrative has been told from the time of William Apess to the present, looking at the effects of intended audience, time period, gender, etc. In this way the class is both a history and a lit class. Though an interesting topic matter the course became one I dreaded attending for the sheer lack of enthusiasm exhibited by fellow classmates. Most of the readings were relevant and interesting and could've lent themselves to extensive dialogue but that never really came into play. As a freshman the resources I was introduced to were invaluable--from the beinecke to microfiche, etc.--and made up for the other failings of the class. Projects involving the beinecke were especially enthralling. The final research paper was enjoyable to write and not horribly stressful--the professor spaced things out quite well. Professor Mt. Pleasant is an extremely open and helpful teacher and her grading is lenient (she really wants you to do well) though she isn't so great at leading discussions. Overall I'd say I learned something valuable from this class through the readings and paper writing process but in the class itself I came away with little.Take this class if the students seem dedicated otherwise find something more worth your two and half hours each week.",
    "I may or may not recommend this course to another student. I think it would depend on the specific person. Probably if they already sounded interested, I would tell them to give it a shot, but it's not one I would bring up on my own.",
    "I would call it a study of native american cultures and history through the lens of literature, and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A great introduction to research at Yale- you'll get taken through Beinecke, the stacks, and online databases which is great considering the amount of resources through Yale libraries can be overwhelming. The amount of reading is managable and texts are always interesting, most classes are discussion-based. Professor Mt. Pleasant gives you a lot of flexibility on papers so you end up writing about whatever you find interesting in the text, and is generally exceptionally helpful\/accessible\/encouraging.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially since it is one of the few Native American studies courses offered at Yale. Professor Mt. Pleasant does an excellent job choosing interesting readings. In summary, this class allowed students to explore both non-fiction and fiction historical accounts (narrations) of Native American life in North America.",
    "It was interesting but a lot of reading."
