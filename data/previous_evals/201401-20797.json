    "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in reading, writing, and discussing poetry in the context of the built environment.",
    "I would certainly recommend the class. I think it worked well for me, though, because I am casually interested in poetry. It might be frustrating for someone who was more serious.",
    "Poets' Landscapes is an unusual class. It stands at the midpoints of two axes: between the writing workshop and the scholarly seminar, and between the study of poetry and the study of the American built environment. Conceptual experiments like this are high-risk, high-reward. I felt it was a warm, inviting, and constructive workshop environment: welcoming to people without much experience writing poetry; aided considerably by our reading of a diverse, consistently compelling range of poetry, from Robert Frost to contemporary poets like Susan Howe and Natasha Trethewey; and aided also, I thought, by Prof. Hayden's formal constraints on our poetry \"exercises\"--several of them require iambic pentameter--through which she tried to get us to think about poetry, too, as a kind of built environment. Still, the workshop segments often felt abbreviated and secondary--because they were. The primary focus of the course--the study of the American built environment through the lens of poetry by writers preoccupied with a sense of place--was, I felt, somewhat haphazardly managed. At the end of the semester we suggested a more thorough coverage of some of the scholarly ground she covers in American Cultural Landscapes and has covered in her books (independent of the course's study of poetry); hopefully that'll help in future versions of the class. I'd say shop it if you have an interest in all of the aspects of the subject matter, come back the second week if you're accepted, and see what the group feels like--that matters as much as anything in a class like this.",
    "Really good. A very creative, innovative way of looking at the history of how poets' have used landscapes in their work, from a professor who is both a poet and architect. A great class to deal with meter, and spend time writing your own poetry. A strong recommend."
