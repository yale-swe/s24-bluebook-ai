    "This was a great seminar! My favorite speakers of the semester were Jeffrey Powell and Ran Balicer. There were many good presentations, but theirs were memorable for being so excellent.The seminars held at CIRA were consistently poorer quality than the others, although Stefan Baral was an exception.",
    "Half the lectures were very interesting. The other half were pretty awful. Some lecturers had high positions in interesting places, but ended up being very bad at speaking and giving novel information. Difficult from a coordinator's perspective, but I appreciate the work done to get good lecturers.",
    "A great bunch of speakers. Things worked smoothly, and students were exposed to a wide variety of research topics.",
    "Great speakers",
    "Some speakers were better than others. Wished that some speakers would try to engage the audience more and be more concise about their research rather than try to rush through all aspects of their research in the short span of time. However, enjoyed the variety of speakers and topics covered.",
    "I enjoyed these talks at varying levels, depending on the subject and the lecturer. Overall it was very informative and an enjoyable experience.",
    "Great survey of contemporary research in the field!",
    "Overall it was good. Most presentations were just average, some were great, and some were bad. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with every single presentation at CIRA. The presenters were absolutely terrible and the topics were not interesting.",
    "Mix things up. The same pizza every week makes things boring. Also, the yellow fever talk and EIP talks were awful, do not ask them to come speak again.",
    "Awesome speakers!!",
    "Insightful to hear what research and career opportunities are available for EMD",
    "Great seminars. Very interesting.",
    "I wasn't incredibly impressed with the speakers selected for this seminar. There were some that I thoroughly enjoyed such as the MSF speaker from Uganda and the doctor from Israel but everyone else was less memorable to me.",
    "This is a great thing for the department to have--it's nice to see these interesting people every week. It would be nice to have time to meet with them though, instead of hearing the seminar and not having any other benefit of their visit to Yale.",
    "Useful information, lots of different speakers",
    "This course had some very interesting guest speakers. It was a bit hectic when it came to students signing in, and it was difficult to reach the instructors regarding attendance discrepancies.",
    "Interesting for a seminar course.",
    "some lectures are interesting, others are not."

   "comments": [
    "This seminar brings in a weekly speaker on a topic of interest in infectious disease epidemiology. I would recommend it -- the presentations are usually engaging and very interesting!",
    "Great stuff half the time. Wish I could see the first 10 minutes and decide whether to stay or not.",
    "Really great opportunity to hear from people in the field and at Yale",
    "Good seminar with exposure to wide range of topics in microbial disease research across the nation and around the world",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a wide variety of EMD topics, and to get a sense what the EMD department at Yale is all about.",
    "Yes! Good pizza and salad, and I liked the talks. Only suggestion is to maybe get a better room? Sometimes there were not enough seats for the students in the course! Because a lot of other YSPH staff and faculty would come to listen too, which I understand and appreciate, but there should not be a lack of food\/seats for students. Twice I sat on the floor. I know this may sound entitled, but just my $0.02.",
    "Food was a must!Good speakers",
    "1 hr seminars. Free food. Interesting talks. I would recommend it to those who aren't even in the EMD program. They were very interesting and helped me to understand diseases that I would have never thought to be interested in. Plus you can make some great connections!",
    "Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases weekly seminar. I would recommend it. Interesting talks and free pizza, what's not to love?",
    "Really interesting seminar.",
    "This course is a good way to see what kinds of research are being conducted around the world. Make sure you sign in each week to avoid problems!",
    "Required so yes."
