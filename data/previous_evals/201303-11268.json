   "comments": [
    "EENG 200 is a very good intro circuits class. The curriculum is broad, but you walk away from the class with a much better insight into DC and AC systems as well as a variety of other topics. The workload isvery manageable and TP Ma is a great professor as well as very entertaining.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is fun, interesting, and inspiring. T.P. Ma (who is a figure skater) is well practiced teacher and leader in his field.",
    "It's just a normal intro class, and pretty fun if you enjoy circuits. I would recommend it, but you'll probably be better off studying from the textbook, which is a bit clearer than lecture.",
    "If it is required, take it. If not, don't take it.",
    "It's not an easy class, but you will learn a LOT. Coming from a background with virtually zero prior knowledge of circuits, it was tough to keep up with the super fast pace of the class, but it's defintely doable if you put in the work, show up to class and do the psests. Also, the format of the class with many tests and quizzes scattered throughout the course makes it really easy to learn and continually re-learn little bits of the course throughout the semester so by the time the final comes you're not (necessarily) left learning all the material from the whole semester. If you have to take this class, it's not that bad. If you are just interested in the material, be warned, it won't be easy, but between the labs and psets, it is rewarding.",
    "This course is what it claims to be: an introduction to Electronics. It's a good overview of many topics. However, the work (psets, labs, and tests) were unpredictable in difficulty and length, sometimes super long and hard and sometimes surprisingly easy and short. T.P. Ma is sometimes hilarious but also teaches pretty much straight from his notes, presenting the material formally.",
    "EE 200 is not impossible, but it's not great. If you're able to keep up and do enough work on your own, you can learn everything you need to from it, but otherwise you may be in trouble. You have to like the subject material to enjoy this class; if electrical engineering is not something you find interesting, don't take it.",
    "Take the course only if it's part of your major requirement. You learn a lot of useful material, but it can be a stressful class because you have to be able to self-teach. Plus we have lab, even though it's only a 1 credit course. Workload isn't incredibly heavy, but can be challenging especially for students who don't have prior experience with circuits (especially for lab).",
    "I would recommend this only if you are really interested in electrical circuits or you have to take it. It is a great opportunity to learn really useful material, but it isn't the most exciting class and the workload is substantial with weekly psets and an additional lab session.",
    "This class is very time intensive, but you will learn a lot. Don't take it unless you have to or have a lot of time to devote to something and really want to learn about circuits. The lab is useful in becoming comfortable with circuitry stuff.",
    "This is a very hard class. Some interesting material, but overall rushed and not very well taught.",
    "EE 200 is not as bad as everyone says it is. TP MA is not a particularly effective lecturer but he is not terrible either and he is pretty funny. The labs are no fun, but you have to do them. I actually found some of the material of the class was kind of fun. Fair amount of homework, but not bad at all. All three exams are fair, but the final is hard. Take it if you have to, but don't dread it (except the labs). If you don't have to take it, don't take it.",
    "I would recommend the class for anyone considering majoring in EE or ME as it is a core fundamental for either field but due to the difficulty, students outside the engineering sphere may wish to steer clear of it.",
    "It's tough so I think I'd recommend having some physics e under your belt first. The class dives right into the circuits after a couple days and it would really help to have some intuition about electricity first.",
    "Don't take it if you can avoid it! If you need to take it then be ready to put in a lot of work. The class itself is not hard at all but requires a lot of work consistently. There are weekly problem sets, 6 labs (each about 3 hours long), in-class pop quizzes, THREE midterms AND a final. The only difficult part of the class was the final which was much harder than any of the midterms or the problem sets. TP Ma is not the best at teaching but is hilarious at times.",
    "The class is very traditional: chalkboard lectures, weekly homework sets, three exams, and occasional pop quizzes. It's predictable and not too difficult given some previous exposure to basic circuit analysis.My only complaint would be the lab. There are 7 (or 8) 3-hour lab sessions required for the class. There are no formal lab reports; just turn in a worksheet by the end of the session. Nevertheless, it's additional work that should be taken into consideration when scheduling.",
    "don't take this unless you have to. its doable, but its a bad class. on the first day of class he'll tell you that by the end of the semester you will be able to build a circuit that reads your heartbeat. sounds cool right? its a lie. by the end of the class most of you will in fact not be able to build this circuit (its really complicated), butyou will be asked to do it anyway. bad class",
    "It's a good intro to electronics, as the title suggests. You don't need any prior knowledge but I imagine it would be difficult to go into the course cold.",
    "The beginning of the course all of a sudden gets extremely difficult, especially if you've never taken physics e&m or seen circuits before. It gets a bit better by the 2nd and 3rd midterms. Final exam is impossible. The textbook is terrible and so are office hours, your best bet is to form a study group with peers.",
    "I would recommend this course, not just because it's mandatory for all electrical and mechanical engineering majors, but it provides a good understanding of the fundamentals of electronics. It is important to know how the world works. It also adds many tools to one's problem solving tool kit. It helped me in my physics and math courses.",
    "Electrical Engineering 200 is an introductory class that teaches you how to analyze circuits and their different elements.",
    "Do not take this if you don't have to. One of the most frustrating classes I have ever taken",
    "I would not recommend this class to non EE majors.",
    "Basic circuits course. You'll like it if you like building electronic circuits. You will find it boring otherwise."
