   "comments": [
    "I went from only having the most basic understanding of a screenplay to being able to write one by the end of the year. I learned not only the technical requirements for what comprises a screenplay, but also the thought process one should have going into it. My writing very much improved. I learned how to be critical of what I wrote without being harsh on myself. I learned how to creatively come up with solutions for issues in my writing rather than stressing out.",
    "I learned how to write script coverage, how to format a screenplay, how to write a screenplay, and general information about the screenwriting\/film-making industry.",
    "I learned the basic structure of how to write a screenplay as well as helpful tips in doing so. We studied other famous screenplays and went through script workshops in order to do so.",
    "I learned a lot about both film and writing in this class. Lapadula does an excellent job explaining the differences between screenwriting and other artistic mediums, focusing his efforts on developing you as a better visual storyteller; he places a lot of emphasis on imagery. By the end of this class, I not only understood how to outline, draft, and revise a short screenplay, but also how to produce coverages of other screenplays (which is important if you're looking to go into the industry). He supplemented his lectures and workshop sessions with several guest filmmakers and screenwriters. All of them were absolutely fantastic and were incredibly knowledgeable about both the industry and the craft itself.",
    "1. Learnt how to use Final Draft 2. Learnt how to write a script and all the technical aspects of it. 3. Learnt how to critique film",
    "I learned how to write a screenplay. I learned a lot about myself and my writing and how to reflect my inner thoughts and life experiences. New insights on life and what kind of profession I would like after graduating from Yale.",
    "I gained a great understanding of screenplay form and what makes a good screenplay. I feel like I have a deeper knowledge about how films work from the very beginning stages of writing. I also learned a great deal about what happens on the ground in Hollywood as you're trying to become a screenwriter.",
    "I learned how screenplays should be structured and what makes a story interesting and engaging.",
    "I am interested in going into film\/tv development and production and was hoping that this class would help me to understand better the creative processes behind writers' work and how a story comes together."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Just about everything Weaknesses: If anything, the midterm folder requires a lot of work",
    "I liked the general structure of the course. I wish some of the assignments in the midterm folder were more spread out. I also wish that the workshops in class were more structured and pointed instead of aimless conversations that did not always provide much clarity.",
    "I think there could be a more defined structure. A good portion of the class included Prof. Lapadula talking for a very long time about things that didn't pertain to screenwriting. I wish we would've had the opportunity to do more in-class writing and not just the one screenplay and dialogue exercise. However, Lapadula is a knowledgeable and fun teacher, and I did enjoy his insights.",
    "Strengths: 1. Mr. Lapadula tells inspirational stories and provides constructive critique 2. Guest speakers are good Weaknesses: 1. More script-writing practice needed 2. More in-class analysis of scripts needed",
    "strengths - Lapadula is so interesting, engaging, and really cares about his students. He is a large part of what makes this class so great. His students want to write well. The small class workshop size is also a strength because your writing gets lots of attention and critique. Lapadula often brought in guest speakers \/ or held extra classes which were both really cool and added to the Yale experience. weaknesses - it only meets once a week. We could have definitely used more class time!",
    "I loved the workshop style and structure. I feel that it was very helpful to get peer and professor feedback. I thought the midterm project was a great way to gain knowledge about the screenwriting process. Perhaps it would be helpful to read a whole screenplay in the first couple of weeks, and talk about the structure of coverage then. Mostly, I really would have liked to receive coaching and teaching on story structure, because I felt that is what many of my classmates and I struggled with the most, and we felt we didn't really receive any instruction there.",
    "The class is great as it is!",
    "Strength - writers workshops the whole second half of the semester Weakness - unofficial class meetings on Sunday were hard for me to make and I felt like I was missing out if I couldn't go to them"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. The material is interesting and the professor is extremely passionate about the subject matter and very personable.",
    "If a student wants an introduction to screenwriting and to learn the concrete basics of the medium, this course will give you that. It was very frustrating to take, and Professor Lapadula is definitely not for everyone.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in being a screenwriter or trying it out, this is a good way to start. Beware that Lapadula will always run 20-30 minutes over class end time though.",
    "Anyone interested in screenwriting or film should take this course. Lapadula is an absolute delight. Be sure to attend his optional Sunday evening sessions if given the opportunity. A word of warning: the midterm packet is a LOT of work. It will sneak up on you and can't really be put off to the last minute.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, absolutely. It was interesting and my writing improved and I looked forward to this class every week. It's catered to people who love film but I think it could also be good for people who just like writing.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. I felt I improved greatly as a writer, both as a result of my professor and my peers. Also, it was fun.",
    "Yes! It's a really interesting course!",
    "If you're interested in learning how to write a short (10-12 pg) screenplay then this is the class for you! Marc Lapadula is a fun, engaging professor and clearly knows a lot about film."
