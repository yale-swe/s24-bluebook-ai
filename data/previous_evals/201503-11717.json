    "Highly recommend this class. Wang Laoshi is a great professor. She is very enthusiastic and has a lot of energy. The workload is reasonable for 1.5 credits.",
    "Lots of work, and don't think you can ever choose to slack off! That said, I learned a lot, and Wang Laoshi is fun. I took the class Cr\/D\/Fail, which works, but you'll also feel like you're letting down the teacher. If you want to learn Chinese, take this class and you won't regret it. Also, I took this class having forgotten most characters I'd learned in the past, but I did fine. Even though this is second level, the textbook is a beginner's textbook. I was placed into 132, but found this class manageable.",
    "This is a fantastic class, especially with Professor Wang Haiwen. I came into this class knowing only the tiny vocabulary that I'd learned from my parents, and barely able to read, and this class completely exceeded my expectations for how quickly and effectively my language skills have been improving. Like any effective language class, it sets a demanding pace, with daily \"ting xie\" quizzes, daily homework, weekly essays, a presentation, and unit tests. Professor Wang also varies the pace of the class to keep things fun, with a couple of movies, debates, and an art museum trips. Ultimately, you're going to come out of the class feeling so much more fluent than you were coming in, and a lot more confident about engaging with people in Mandarin. Because of that, this is one of the most worthwhile classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Wang is a great person to take Chinese with. She really cares about your progress and would be glad to meet with you to discuss assignments or any troubles you may be having with the class. Don't slack off - there are daily assignments and while each one is not worth a huge amount of points, getting a 0 on the because you forgot to study vocab is not a great plan.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. The teacher is very charismatic, and I loved learning from her. Also, the course load was great, but I think because it was, I learned a lot.",
    "Chinese 152 is a great course to brush up on your Chinese and learn how to talk and write about more complex topics. The workload is heavy but the class is really well taught and the material cry engaging. The tests and assessments are well spread out and as long as you keep on top of things it is manageable.",
    "Wang Laoshi's CHNS 152 class is a lot of work, but that's because she truly cares about the subject and has high expectations for her students. Homework usually took me 2-3 hours every night, but thanks to this class, my Chinese has improved substantially, allowing me to converse with my family back in China in a much more sophisticated manner than before. The variety of activities, ranging from dictation to watching movies to presenting in an art gallery, helped me get an idea of how to use Chinese in many different contexts. Overall, I'd say CHNS 152 was a difficult, but worthwhile course.",
    "I would recommend Chinese to any native speaker who may not have the strongest speaking\/reading\/writing skills as daily Chinese lessons ensured that I had enough practice.",
    "This is a very intensive language learning course. You will get a lot of vocab and grammar out of it (not that much dialogue practice if you're in a large class, though). Worth the work! Don't wait until senior year to take this like I did."
