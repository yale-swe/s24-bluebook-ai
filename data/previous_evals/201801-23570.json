If the objective is to learn Sima Pro, learning a software is not a big deal unless you know the concepts and theories. If the focus is to learn LCA, the class doesn't seem to be focused on that. I did learn few things here and there about LCA."

   "comments": [
    "I expected a more in depth conceptual knowledge and teaching around LCAs, how they're used, how they're not used and how they could be used. The class was SimaPro and SimaPro related assignments centric without much in depth discussion or knowledge gathering.",
    "Somewhat well.",
    "I thought I would gain a bit more fluency with the software and life cycle thinking than I did.",
    "The course met my expectation. However, I would have appreciated a bit more insight of cases where LCA studies had been relevant for a product improvement. Also it would have been great to gain a bit of insight of LCA for managers.",
    "Pretty well",
    "Very well. This biggest plan is to learn LCA and Simapro from this class, and I think this class helps me with them.",
    "I expected to learn more than I did in the class",
    "I don't know if I fully grasped how to do an LCA by the end of the class. I believe that the software got in the way from time to time. I would have preferred a more excel based LCA focus, where we created the system and process flow charts.",
    "Relatively well.",
    "Not as good as I was expecting.",
    "I had a lot of expectation from this course. LCA is an important tool used nowadays by companies to evaluate the environmental impact of their products and where they can improve. As I said the course mostly focussed on Sima Pro, a software tool to carry out LCA which is only acceptable in the US due to the limitation of the ecoinvent data. I wanted to learn LCA concepts and modeling which is applicable around to globe. I did not learn that."

   "comments": [
    "I learned what SimaPro was and how to technically use it, though it was more like learning a computer program at a community college class or something than it was a graduate, thoughtful course. I expected a more in depth conceptual knowledge and teaching around LCAs, how they're used, how they're not used and how they could be used. The class was SimaPro and SimaPro related assignments centric without much in depth discussion or knowledge gathering. The teacher is obviously knowledgeable, though doesn't know how to take things down to explain them better. The construction noise and room layout was distracting.",
    "I think the main weakness of the course was the classroom environment and way in which assignments were given. It was very confusing to be reviewing assignments weeks in advance while we were still working on current assignments.",
    "Strengths: -Tom and the TAs were very available to provide help -The final project was a nice opportunity to set up and frame our own LCA project -good guest speakers Weaknesses: -During class, lectures often revolved around homeworks that weren't due for many weeks and that none of us had read the guidelines were yet, so we felt like we were playing catch up the whole time. -We often jumped into the computer work before reflecting on how the system operates. I think it would be GREAT to force students to stop and reflect on the problem at hand, and to map out the system by hand with pen and paper OFTEN. I also think it would be great to have more assignments or in class projects that focus on excel work, since it is much more visual. -The room was really awkward for lectures. -The amount of work was very lopsided. The homeworks at the end were much harder and stacked up on top of each other, while we had barely any outside of class homework for the first half of the semester.",
    "It would be great not to have the homeworks explained three weeks in advance. I think we would also have some days outside from the lab.",
    "Could be improved by doing more in class exercises, rather than spending class time just talking about the homework. I feel like I still only have a general grasp of SimaPro and would like to have had more examples to better teach me the technology",
    "Its weird to be lectured at in a computer lab, homework assignments shouldnt overlap with each other",
    "A lot of Simapro which is good to practice software. More theory would be better.",
    "This course spent a lot of time focused on the homework assignments. I think it could be improved by providing in class exercises that were related to the homeworks so that the homeworks would allow us to better understand and grapple with the material. Instead, I often felt like I concentrated on solving the homework problem in class with the help of the TAs rather than really learning why we were doing something a certain way. Also, it would be helpful to have more context for SimaPro. For example, at the end of the course I was still a bit confused on why we used certain processes.",
    "The teaching is too monotone, does not use real world examples",
    "It is very software heavy, and did not focus enough on the fundamentals. I would prefer to separate the class into lab sessions and classroom sessions to discuss system flow analysis.",
    "Strengths - teaches a practical skill and software. Weaknesses - might be trying to do too much? Perhaps have a 3-credit class focused on LCA approaches (not necessarily tied to SimaPro), and simultaneously offer a 1-credit SimaPro lab that builds off the LCA class.",
    "Strengths: learning software, some lectures on LCA theory. Weaknesses are organization of course - it jumps from software, to theory, to practical uses, to specific terms\/case studies - without a good organization or flow to them. We also don't have much collaboration and classroom setting is dry.",
    "The course has a lot of weaknesses because of the way it is structured, I should commend Thomas here for doing his best to make the course productive. The problem with the course is with its objective, what the course is actually trying to achieve. In an institute like Yale, I would assume that at least this should be clear but I guess in the case LCA, it is not. This is a confused course, I am not sure what the course is actually trying to teach students. If the objective is to learn Sima Pro, learning a software is not a big deal unless you know the concepts and theories. If the focus is to learn LCA, the class doesn't seem to be focused on that. One of the greatest challenges in LCA is the data collection, no time was spent on it as the data was available on ecoinvent dataset in Sima Pro. But, not everyone has access to the dataset and the dataset itself has significant limitations. More time should be spent on LCA THEORIES."

   "comments": [
    "To not take it unless they are 100% sure they will be doing LCA stuff in their careers.",
    "You get as much as you put in. It's not a particularly difficult course, but the assignments still require critical thinking and time. The professor is very understanding, receptive, and kind. However, the class content and structure requires a lot more refining to truly reach its potential.",
    "I do not recommend this class to anyone who wants to do LCA in their future career. the software we learn is not used by any company and the whole class is about learning the software and there is no time to reflect on what is LCA",
    "Be clear about whether this is really a necessary skill for your professional path.",
    "Though the course isn't perfectly structured, it is an opportunity to build language and insights around how life cycle thinking can inform supply chain work and how LCA software is used and analyzed in the workplace.",
    "It's a valuable skill, but the structure of the class is a bit difficult to follow.",
    "Very useful class if want to know deeper knowledge about the LCA and software.",
    "I'm not sure how helpful it is since the software we learned is not used in industry",
    "I think the course will change substantially in the future, but take the time to focus less on the software and more on the system flows. Professor Swarr was very willing to work closely with the students.",
    "Shop it and see what you think. Talk to the professor to make sure it aligns with what you want to get out of such a class. It sounds like it gets revised a bit every year.",
    "The course doesn't provide the student a clear understanding of LCA, it touches the surface and dives into modeling exercise in Sima Pro."
