    "Music 110 is an introduction to music class-you start off learning how to read music and are able to end with analyzing a piece of music-identifying chord progressions and cadences. I would definitely recommend this to all students who want to get an introduction into music, or even those with musical experience that want to further their understanding of music.",
    "There is a LOT of information upfront for someone who has little or none background in music. Because of this, the beginning of the semester can be overwhelming. I would recommend pushing through that part because once you've covered the nitty-gritty, there's a moment when everything comes together in a beautiful way, and you realize what a perfect web has been constructed among all these concepts. Definitely increased my appreciation for music and musicians.",
    "Music 110 is a basic overview of music theory. The material isn't too difficult, and the quizzes\/final were SUPER easy. The book work is just very tedious.",
    "This is the course you want to take if you have never read music before. When it calls itself an introduction, it means it--you start from the difference between quarter and whole notes, and work up to chords and cadences. This is what I wanted, but would probably be boring if you were more experienced. There is a not insignificant amount of homework that can seem boring at the time, but it really is useful in ensuring you become comfortable with identifying notes, chords, etc.--it is not wasted time.",
    "Take this class! It is fun and fascinating"
