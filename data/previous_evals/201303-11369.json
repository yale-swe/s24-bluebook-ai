    "Definitely recommend. Really cool information regardless of your career path.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who is not actually interested in physiology or anatomy. If they are however, I think this is a wonderful class to take.",
    "Awesome class. Learn about the human body! Team-taught, most professors are awesome, great lecture slides (due to its being taught for years), and will really give you a holistic view of how the body works. A+ for a premed bio class. Two midterms, online quizzes, and final. Standard stuff. Saltzman is a legend, but I have still yet to find out if he plays in a rock band!! ughhhhhhh",
    "TAKE IT. SO INTERESTING. SO GOOD. TAKE IT AS A JUNIOR. NEEDS LOTS OF TIME BUT A- IS TOTALLY MANAGEABLE AND MAYBE EVEN AN A!",
    "Fantastic. It's like that scene in The Matrix where Neo gets all the martial arts downloaded into his brain--except with physiology. Professors are awesome and actually care about the course. Saltzman rides a motorcycle, elevating him to near-godlike status. Exams are straightforward and very fair. Do it.",
    "BME 350 is an incredible course. You really can make the workload work for you-except for the weekly quizzes, you're free to catch up on reading at your convenience. Lectures are interesting, engaging and informative and each of the instructors is phenomenal. Take it if you're a premed or could use it for an elective, or even if you're someone who is just interested in learning all about the human body in a class that will challenge you but not overwhelm you.",
    "Yes. Fantastic overview of fascinating systems.",
    "Very informative.",
    "You learn a lot but it's difficult",
    "Take it! It's a lot of work, but then again, all biology courses at Yale are a lot of work. Not sure how the curve\/grading is going to turn out. I wish professors were more open about the grading policy.",
    "A fine class. Really interesting stuff. Could be a bit more cohesive, but it's a ton of material to cover. Be ready!",
    "This is an amazing class. Every single lecture has a clear goal and you will learn a lot. Even though this class doesn't have the time to cover every system deeply my overall knowledge of the body has increased enormously. I can spew out random facts that will help me in a future cocktail party. Win. This class teaches you the reason why your body does the things it does. But, take this with a grain of salt. You will only get out what you put in. I didn't do the massive amounts of reading except from what was absolutely necessary for the weekly quizzes. But if you miss lectures watch out. Some of the material is hard to grasp without graphs and a prof explanation. Most people who take this class have some sort of biology background so it ends up being pretty competitive. In short, lots of memorization but lots of learning.",
    "Really challenging class simply due to the amount of material. Start studying early and frequently.",
    "A great introduction to physiology. The teaching line-up for this class is also pretty incredible -- with the exception of one or two lecturers, all of the professors were passionate and very clear. You do have to put in a fair amount of work (its an insane amount of material), but its broken down into two midterms and a (cumulative) final. Its also worth it -- if you want to do anything with medicine or biomedical engineering, I would definitely take this class.",
    "I took this class as a fun class outside of my major and it was totally worth it. The teaching team is amazing, they are all very knowledgeable and engaging lecturers. I have learned so much about the human body. One of my favorite classes at Yale, highly recommended to everyone.",
    "Physiological Systems can be one of the most rewarding science\/biology classes at Yale, but at the same time, it requires a lot of work studying and learning the material, as the material covered spans a huge amount of information. Lectures are well organized and the two midterm exams were very fair.",
    "This class was hard but taught so much information. You will learn more about your body in this class than you can imagine. It is not an easy class due to the fast pace, but if you try and keep up with the material you will do fine. There is no \"homework,\" just weekly quizzes. The tests are hard and are very specific.",
    "A great class. The topics are applicable to our everyday life, and it's satisfying to see logical patterns and systems emerge in the seemingly random details of our body. The professors are excellent.",
    "depends on if you're ready for it. interesting material, but a lot of it, and the grading isn't curved",
    "Not that hard if you keep up with the material. Definitely make sure to read the book-- try to get the Costanza as it does a good job of summarizing all the material. I definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This is the best class I have taken at Yale. It is a fair amount of work studying for the tests, but it is worth it. You learn quite a bit in this class. Most of the professors are great, in particular Aronson and Saltzman are incredible. Take this class whether you are BME, MB&B, MCDB etc. Hell, take it if you're a history major and you want to take a great science class as long as you're willing to put in some work. Weekly quizzes are not too much work, just studying for the tests.",
    "Physio was a great course. I think one of the strengths were the lecturers-- they all clearly knew the material and presented it in the way that made reading the book unnecessary, which was good because the book was ridiculously dense. I think the main weakness was the scope of the course. There was just so much information to cover which really limits students from delving in higher level applications of the material and focused on students really just memorizing facts.",
    "BENG 350 is a very good course and you learn a lot. It's a lot of work, but it's rewarding. Many many premeds in the class. Don't take it if you have a very heavycourse load in a given semester.",
    "If you are very interested in physiology, this should be a great course. However, those that don't like memorization may not really enjoy it as much.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes. It's hard, there is a lot of work and memorization, but if you are interested in the human body, then definitely take it. It is so cool to learn about all the different organ systems and how they work, and you get a series of great lecturers that are all experts in their fields.",
    "The good news: This course offers an in-depth analysis of the function and homeostasis of a wide array of systems of the body. The material is absolutely fascinating! It will really help you to appreciate how cool the human body is. All of the TAs have taken this exact class at Yale previously, so they really know their stuff. Also, attention pre-meds! This class is super-helpful for the MCAT! And all this material will be crucial for your med school classes!The bad news: I'm a junior pre-med MCDB major, so trust me when I say that this class is typical of what to expect when it comes to biology classes: memorization of overwhelming amounts of material taught at a wicked-fast pace. If you want to do well, be prepared to dedicate the majority of your time studying for this class. It is not advisable to take this course as part of a 5-course semester. Some students claim to have done well without reading the book, I'm not sure if\/how that is possible.",
    "Tough course where your entire grade is dependent on your exam performance. Quizzes are essentially ungraded (provided you go to section) but the reading is long...I don't know of anyone who really read through everything. Mideterms are T\/F and multipe choice. final had short answer. Don't fall too far behind because this really isn't a class you can cram for...you will fail if you start studying the night before a midterm.",
    "What a tough, high-impact class. Like drinking water from a fire hydrant. Physiology should really be a year-long course. Think the breadth of knowledge equivalent to the workload of organic chemistry, but all crammed into one semester. Though I left the course with a great amount of relief (from the stressful wealth of information crammed into my brain) and satisfaction (that I managed to at least have some information to include in my short answer), there were some changes that did not make my\/the student workload any easier (namely the changes to weekly quizzes and the final). The textbook was the largest, most expensive paperweight I have ever bought. I read every single assigned page and the wealth of information was just too much to process.Pros:- Majority of lectures were clear, understandable, and taught by experienced professors who paused for student questions (Aronson, Campbell and Saltzman). The other lectures seemed like they had not been updated as per student feedback (Holt, Boulpep) while one lecture seemed completely slapped together last minute (Zenisek).- Course followed the syllabus like clockwork. No curveballs in the lecture material.- The TAs are invested in their sections and extremely helpful in reviewing the course material.- Prof. Saltzman was a great professor. He actively listened to student feedback, kept everyone informed and on-point, and memorized almost every student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.Cons:- There was too much tweaking this year. Answering quiz questions on material I haven't learned yet did not help me prepare for the class, rather, it dragged me behind when I was still synthesizing lecture material from the previous week.- The midterms did not prepare me for the final. This year, there was another tweak that instead of an all multiple choice\/ true or false structure, half of the final was short answer questions (25 pts each) that covered all the old material prior to the second midterm. This meant that for the final, you needed to know 28\/36 lectures back and forth for total recall and application to scenario questions posed in the short answer portion of the test (50% of the final). The other half was on the last lectures since the midterm, but since we were so busy trying to remember (and explain) all concepts prior, this information really slipped through the cracks.- There were too many respiratory, endocrinology, and renal lectures. Limiting the course to four lectures per organ system would have been easier to process.",
    "Physio is such a great class! The lectures are really interesting and the tests are all MC\/TF and are quite fair. There's just a lot of work in terms of studying all the material to remember everything, but that's every bio course...There's not too much work every week if you don't want to do the really dense reading in the textbook. You don't even have to because only material covered in lecture is on the tests. The final is rather hard, though, so study a lot!",
    "Take it, but be warned, there's a ton of material to memorize, so pace yourself and start studying early. But I would definitely recommend it, the class is fascinating.",
    "Just take the class. Especially if you want to do anything at all related to the human body. If you're worried about the grade, Cr\/D it. But it was a great experience, and I feel like I really learned a great deal.Also, don't be fooled when they say the midterms are all multiple choice and true\/false. Some of those questions are the trickiest multiple choice questions I've ever seen, and they pull out all the nasty tricks (combinations of answers, etc.).One of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning something more macroscopic about cells and the human body. Often, I feel like many of the classes we take tend to be very microscopic in their point of view. Here, though we are still dealing with plenty of ions and pathways within a cell, we also move beyond just a single cell and connect them to a comprehensive and complex system that can be affected by multiple other systems. I enjoyed this class (despite how anxious I feel about the final), and the lecturers for the most part are excellent and really know their stuff.",
    "Requires a lot of work, but it's impossible not to learn a lot. However, this will not necessarily be reflected in your grade. This class gave me grey hairs.",
    "Physio tried to cover a ton of material in the course of one semester, which made this class take up a disproportional amount of time. The class itself is interesting and really provides you with a lot of knowledge, but requires a lot of memorization so I don't know how helpful it is in the long run. I would recommend it with inhibitions.",
    "Take it if you're a premed. That said, there's a lot of overlap with other courses. It's still helpful, and you do learn a lot if only through memorization.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in physiology and\/or medical science. It really gives you the background necessary to understand a lot pathophysiology (which is so cool), and you really learn an unbelievable amount. To make the most out of this class you really should do all of the readings. Doing all of the readings and really internalizing all of the material is what will separate you from the masses and will really help the material stick. Don't wait until the last night to do the quizzes- you will just skim the reading for the answers and not do it. The text is very rich and good. Make sure you read.",
    "The best biology class I've taken. The subject matter is fascinating for those interested in medicine and biomedical studies. The class covers all the major body systems, with six different professors taking turns to teach their specialties. All of them are good lecturers, and as long as you're actually interested in physiology you'll find each lecture engaging and interesting. Emile Boulpaep in particular is an adorable old man with an equally adorable accent, although his textbook is the absolute opposite. B&B is extremely dense and would require centuries to completely comprehend, although there is tons of good information. Fortunately, you don't actually need to read the book, except to complete the online quizzes. I repeat, do not do the readings. The quizzes are great because they preview the next week's material and show you which bits to read from the textbook. These weekly quizzes are also about the only work you need to do each week, so the workload is actually rather light. Until you get to exams. Be prepared to study at least an entire day for those, because people tend to get pretty high scores.Would I recommend this class to another student? Absolutely, and I wish Yale had more classes like this.tl;dr: Take this if you love bio, and definitely take it if you are premed. Don't read the textbook.",
    "A good overview of the workings of many of the main organ systems of the body. There is a lot of material, but that is to be expected so you should come in prepared to cram a lot of details. The professors overall do a good job of emphasizing the physiology part, in that there is a lot of applications from physics and chemistry. This makes the course difficult at times, but you come away with a solid understanding and appreciation of how complex and amazing the body is.",
    "Yes. If you're interested in physiology and are a morning person, this will be a fantastic class for you. It's not a class to be taken lightly, and with the mountains of rote memorization you will be doing, expect this class not to live up to some of the glowing recommendations it receives. The main text (Boron) is near useless with how much detail it incorporates. Use Costanzo. (NOTE: BOTH TEXTS ARE AVAILABLE FREE ONLINE AT YALE ORBIS) Try your best to go to EVERY lecture, because this is where the information you need to know is most efficiently presented. Though mostof the class will be memorizing seemingly disparate and sometimes contradictory pathways, in the end things DO connect together, but expect to do a lot of work before then.",
    "BENG 350 is a tough course that requires a lot of work - but You learn a lot of information throughout. Different lectures have different styles and some are better than others, but I felt that they really wanted You to do well. My TA was great and I felt he really cared about how well we did and he was really good at explaining\/clearing up the material we were learning about.",
    "One of the best MCDB classes that I've ever taken. While definitely difficult, the material is absolutely fascinating and almost makes me want to be a pre-med (which is really saying something). Highly recommended if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "MCDB 310 is a good class that goes in depth into most of the body's systems. Be prepared to work a lot, but learn a lot as well. This class has two midterms (multiple choice + true-false) and a final (same format as midterms, as well as short answer, which was added this year).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone interested in the material, but I would caution them that it is a lot of work. You have to stay on top of the material if you don't want to be swamped when the midterms come around, and the class is mostly pre-meds who are going to work extremely hard (aka the curve is tough). However, it's definitely worth the work. You go in depth about how different systems in your body function and work together to create a living organism, which is fascinating material. If you're interested in physiology, definitely take the class.",
    "It was an okay course. There were weekly quizzes on classesv2, which for us were graded but then converted to 100 percents as long as we turned them in and went to section. The two midterms did not cover the material to the sometimes confusing extent presented in lecture, but it was a TON of memorization, which sucked especially at the end. On the final, they added some short answer, which were pretty straightforward.Since most of the students in the class are juniors and seniors anyways, I would recommend a seminar instead. Much better way to learn at this point!",
    "Great class. Lots of work. Memorize the slides and you'll be fine on the tests (if the tests are still MC). Don't read the textbook, focus on slides and constanzo (this is coming from someone who almost always reads the textbook for classes).",
    "Physio is a whirlwind of knowledge. So many details to learn, but really fascinating material. The textbook really isn't that helpful. Definitely look into Costanzo. Hope you get a good TA. Keep up or studying for midterms will be kind of miserable.",
    "Cr\/D... I stopped going to lectures halfway through and just read the Costanzo book. This class is a ton of work. Fascinating, but tough. Can't speak much about the lectures since I didn't go most of the time. Dunham 220 is really warm and cozy at 9am... zzz. Good intro to stuff I'll have to learn in med school next year.",
    "A great course, but a TON of work, so make you sure take this with a light courseload. I learned the hard way -- there is too much material to get behind on the readings\/lectures, so DO NOT put off any of the work for the class. Otherwise, a fantastic group of professors and incredibly interesting material. If you're a premed take this for sure.",
    "This course teaches tons of information, but the material is quite well integrated. The notes that were posted after lecture were extremely useful.",
    "Wouldrecommend, great introduction to physio and a good indicator for prospective premeds considering medical school. Be prepared to study the lecture notes in depth if you want a good grade though,",
    "Good class to take to learn about the systems. Only real systems class at Yale so do it if your workload isn't already to intense, otherwise it'll be a lot to keep up with.",
    "Physio is wonderful, probably my favorite bio class at Yale. Do the reading and prepare well in advance for each test and you will do well! But definitely take it--it's so interesting. You won't mind waking up for it, because the professors are so good.",
    "This was a great class. You will learn A LOT and it is all interesting. The material is also super helpful for the MCAT. The only thing is, while this is one of the best classes in MCDB and BME, it is also one of the hardest, if not THE hardest. There is a lot of material and you need to be on top of it. Don't worry about reading the assigned text. Just be on top of each class because there is a lot to memorize for the exams. The final is even crazier.",
    "Lots of memorizing, lots of material, but if you put in the time it is a rewarding experience.",
    "Physio is a great course to learn about organ systems and physiology. It covers a system in about 2 weeks, so the lectures can be rather dense and overwhelming at times. However, i would recommend it to any student interested in learning about these systems and how they work.",
    "Excellent course, extremely useful information. I just wish the class was a yearlong instead of semester. Too much to pack in one semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in medicine. It is incredibly taught, and you learn so much interesting and useful information. Definitely my favorite science class I've taken at Yale.",
    "One of the best courses you can take at Yale. You'll learn an incredible amount about the human body. It's a lot of work, BUT SO WORTH IT. TAKE IT!",
    "Very good! The rapid pace\/amount of material covered forces you to learn a lot. Mostly a memorization-based course. Heavy workload prior to exams.",
    "A LOT of information, useful, but a lot - make sure to stay on top of it.",
    "This is a very comprehensive class on physiology. The lectures are great, the material is fascinating, and the midterms are fair. Take it!",
    "This is a really interesting and information dense course where professors present about the body systems they specialize in. I recommend this course because you obtain such a thorough understanding of anatomy and physiology. The lectures are fascinating and sections are incredibly useful. However, this class is a lot of work and the textbook is dense and a slow read.",
    "Great course. Lots of memorization and the tests require a lot of studying but all the material is presented in a very understandable way. All the powerpoints and notes are uploaded to classesv2 so you have all the resources you need. I recommend getting an additional textbook from the one they recommend as the boron and boulepaep textbook is really more dense than the class requires.",
    "Well, you know it's a good course, with information that will be interesting. You know it won't be easy also. But it'll be rewarding, even if the curve is difficult. It's definitely well taught compared to other courses in the sciences, and the professors do genuinely care about your learning. There really isn't much stopping you from taking this course. Do eet.",
    "Great class for premeds, bio majors. You come out with a comprehensive understanding of human physiology. It is not an easy class.",
    "Overall great course",
    "I would recommend it for those interested in the subject. I would warn them about the amount of material.",
    "Loved this class all around. Literally all around. Go to lectures, because they're amazing. Listen to the professors, because they're all wonderful. Get in the habit of sitting in front to make sure you become part of the class as opposed to getting lost behind rows of peeps and in all your thoughts. Get engaged early- totally worth it.",
    "Unfortunately, this class was way too early for me and I only made it to like a quarter of the lectures. Still, I was able to get by by learning the material myself with the slides and the textbook. This class is one of the most well-run out of the courses I've taken for MCDB. The tests are super fair and seem to test for breadth rather than depth. If you're premed, try to take this before your MCAT because it'll make studying for the biological sciences section a lot easier.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend. This is a straightforward physiology course, but you learn a ton and the professors are great!",
    "I would say that this is a great intro course to how the human body (through organ systems) works and how disease can arise. Not a necessary class for premed students, but definitely a good preview of what's to come and to help decide if medicine is the definite path. I would recommend this course if you have the time and the interest! Well worth the effort for what you get out of it. Two midterms and a final, mostly multiple choice, some short answer on the final (first time this year). A lot to memorize but overall interesting and manageable though daunting.",
    "So much information, but fairly well taught.",
    "Very difficult, but highly recommended.",
    "Physiological Systems is a very interesting but memory-intensive course -- there's a ton of material, which the professors cover extremely quickly, and the reading is so dense that it's tempting to depend almost solely on the lectures to break everything down. Make sure you go to class and take good notes, and I'd recommend reading \"Physiology\" by Linda Costanzo instead of the textbook, since it gives you the concepts you need to know without all the extra fluff and simplifies things pretty well. The class is full of pre-meds, so the curves aren't as generous as they could be, but if you keep up with the material or give yourself enough time to get caught up (i.e. memorize) all the material before each exam, you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend it for people who are interested in how the human body works and also for people who are on the fence about being pre-med. This class is one that is much more representative of the material you will be dealing with as a medical student and as a doctor...it definitely gave me more clarity about my pre-med interests. There is A LOT OF MATERIAL. My advice is to always integrate and draw connections between lectures as you go through the semester. The class doesn't do this for you but it will be very helpful at the end of the semester when you're trying to remember every detail of all the systems. There are a lot of parallels between the systems so making sure you grasp overarching concepts. They added integrative questions for the final this year so more of an incentive to do this. Really put effort into the quizzes. Not just for your grade, but because the topics covered are usually the things the instructors think are most important and will appear on the final. If you've blindly completed the quiz by just copying the book, it will be harder to remember the materiallater on for the final. Also I found the textbook wordy and hard to sift through, plus it is so heavy....Costanzo is nice, but what I found the most useful was to record lectures and then just listen back and look at the powerpoints when studying. Section is also really helpful because the TA's will ingrain the material into your head again in a more condensed manner. Overall, great course. Learned a lot. Maybe too much.....",
    "Take it. It's the most comprehensive physio course most of you will ever take in your time here, and it really opens your eyes to the beauty of our systems. Be ready to invest a good chunk of your week if you really want returns from this class, but the returns are well worth it. I leave this class without any regrets for having taken it or having done all the work.",
    "BENG 350 teaches information that is very detailed but that is ultimately, in my opinion, interesting and applicable to not just science majors but to everyone. The quantity of information can be overwhelming and the accumulated readings may become unmanageable (READ COSTANZO INSTEAD) but the quality of information is fantastic, and all of the lecturers are wonderful and extremely willing to help. I would overall recommend the course.",
    "Yes. It is a good overview of physiology. Don't take it whileapplying for medical school. You will miss too many classes for interviews.",
    "It's a great class but equally hard to keep up with all the work. After a point, it becomes quite a struggle with the quizzes and the exams and all the material that one must keep in mind. I really wish there wasn't so much covered in such less time, most of the course felt very rushed whereas with the great professors this class had, we could have really had an engaging class. The timing is a pain too. However, if you have to take it,I must say this is the most organized and well-taught class I have taken at Yale. Wonderful professers! I would always look forward to the classes, even though it wwas kind of impossible to keep up with the readings. If you have to take the class, then well, try your best.",
    "Competitive. Would've been interesting but there was too much pressure. You really need to teach yourself.",
    "A very informative class. If you're premed, you should take this, I mean, you'll learn it all over again as a first year, but if you walk out hating the material, then you might want to think about if you actually want to be a doctor, right? Some of the lecturers are more engaging than others. It's two midterms and a cumulative final. Just great info to learn. I wouldn't waste my money too much on the HUGE text book. I read the Costanzo Physiology book, and it did me pretty well--plus, I thinkYale orbis has the electronic version for free.",
    "This is a great course that teaches a lot of practical material (as opposed to chemistry or normal bio). The tests can be tricky and the all multiple choice\/true false structure is strange, but you get used to it. The homework is good because its once a week and you get 100% on it if you go to section. I'd recommend this class."
