   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless this is your first class about the history of medicine. This course is way too broad for you to learn anything meaningful about any of the topics. Prof. Romano is great but not a very engaging lecturer. Also, even though this is a European history credit we spent more than half of the time on 19th- and 20th-century U.S. medicine, which meant that we nearly ran out of things to talk about by the end. Kate was a really good TA and she ran our section well.",
    "If you're looking for a HSHM lecture, there are better ones: look for Snowden or Rogers, who are simply better lecturers than Romano, with more vetted syllabi. This is really a survey course, covering almost too much material for its own good. That being said, it covers interesting topics and readings, so if you're interested in the development of medicine and medical philosophy, I'd recommend it.",
    "Disorganized, too broad.",
    "Yes! Take it if you just want an overview of the history of Western medicine! I learned a lot about how the definition of what is and is not medicine has changed over time, which really puts modern medicine in a different perspective. Also, there's less than 50pages of reading per week, which is rare for a history class, I feel. Recommend in particular to science people who need a humanities credit.",
    "It's a pretty interesting class, the workload is almost ideal...there's enough so that it covers the topic at hand, yet not so much that you become bored or disinterested with the reading. Lectures are informative and Sally has a very consistent, digestible lecture format that makes class go by quickly.",
    "HSHM 201 is a general overview of scientific and medical history and how the two relate to each other. Most of the topics are interesting and you can definitely see how they relate to our lives. Lectures get a little dry sometimes, but it's a short class period. I would recommend this if you need a low-workload (but also interesting and applicable) class in your schedule.",
    "I would recommend it because it isn't much work, only if you like the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend the course. The workload is not too bad and you learn more about the processes of medicine that we all take for granted.",
    "Yes. If you are willing to put in a reasonable amount of work into this class and you have even the slightest interest in medical history, this class is well worth your time.",
    "Decent course. If you want to learn some very general overarching principles about the history medicine while memorizing 120+ names and dates for the final, great! TAs are very nice and the midterm and final are 40% IDs and 60% essays, so memorization counts.Can't say I loved the course, but it was interesting.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in the history of medicine. It is a very good overview of medicine in the west. Additionally, there isn't much work, and Professor Romano allows you to drop your midterm grade if you don't do well!",
    "Interesting survey course of the history of western medicine. Overall a comprehensive course, although it can feel a little disorientated at times when we were going topically and not in chronological order, but it all comes together at the end. Assignments include a midterm (which you are allowed to drop), an 8-10 page paper, and a final. Hopefully they will modify the reading list next year to make it more manageable.",
    "It's a gut, basically. I regret taking it so lightly and Cr\/D, but looking back now, it's easy. Very easy. The material is taught in the most boring way possible (lectures are dry and uninteresting) and that just couldn't get enthusiasm up enough.",
    "A really good intro history course. Put the efforts into the readings because you'll get more out of the course. Not a gut.",
    "Great class. ALOT of material and ALOT of dates to memorise, but overall it really is an interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course for students interested in how medicine has changed over time.",
    "Great overview of Western and modern American medicine.",
    "Take it!! Not stressful at all, and really interesting if you like medicine.",
    "This course is fine. The material is interesting if you're fascinated by the history of medicine, but it could be taught better. The work load is not intimidating at all.",
    "This class was a great survey course in the history of western medicine. The exams were graded pretty harshly, but I learned a lot in the course.",
    "I would not recommend HSHM201 to another student unless the material and readings seem interesting to you. The class is extremely poorly taught (Professor Romano mainly reads right off of a transcript for lectures) and is not very organized. Initially, it was hard to understand what overall point she was trying to make, although lectures improved throughout the course.It has low workload (mainly paper and final) with very little readings, which were loosely related to the themes of the lectures.Overall, OK class, but not recommended.",
    "Yes, not too much work and its interesting.",
    "The course has fascinating material, and the workload isn't bad (8-10pg paper, 1 midterm, final). Watch out for section though - some of the TAs are better than others, so try to shop around a bit.",
    "This course gives a broad introduction to the history of medicine in the Western world, focusing on Europe from ancient times through the 19th century for about the first third of the course, then on the U.S. from colonial times through the present for the remainder. The material is not so detailed that those who have never taken history courses will struggle, but on the other hand people who have taken HSHM courses before will probably find some of the material repetitive. The midterm and final are not very difficult, but there is a large amount of material to know.",
    "A necessary and very interesting overview of how Western medicine has progressed over the years from Hippocrates until now. Highlights major issues and personalities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about why the field of medicine is the way it is today. I thought the content was really interesting and I have a much better understanding of how the concept of physician and patient has changed throughout history. The lectures could've been a little better and were boring at times but the section was really fun and informative.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class, but I would hope that more graded assignments be added to the syllabus. I didn't like that the final and paper were the bulk of the grade, because I felt that I learned a lot more and put in more work than in just preparing for those two elements.",
    "This is a basic intro history course that examines the evolution of medicine. Readings are very easy to follow along with and the professor truly cares about the students.",
    "HIST 233 is a solid history course. I took it C\/D\/F but probably should have taken it for a grade. The midterm was, in my opinion, graded sort of harshly (make sure to put dates with everything!), and depending on the grading of the final exam the course could be tougher than it appears. If you take this course, make sure to go to all the lectures- they are far more important than the readings.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in history, medicine, or both. It is a very fascinating course covering a wide-range of material that provides unique perspective and allows for enhanced understanding of medical system infrastructures and medical cultures observed today. It requires no prerequisites and is truly an excellent course."
