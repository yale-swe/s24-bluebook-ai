   "comments": [
    "Nice overall. Not the most fun class. Lectures are long.",
    "Yes, a very interesting class with very interesting lecturer and insights.",
    "LIT 120 teaches students to think about narratives in interesting ways, but having four different professors who gave lectures of varying quality made some days good and others truly uninspiring. You read Ovid's Metamorphoses one week and Sherlock Holmes the next, just to give you a sense of how scattered the course can feel. Overall, I thought the course fell short because it was not steered enough and there was not a clear sense of where we were headed in the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course. The readings are incredible, the lectures are interesting, and you have a discussion section every weak. However, be prepared to discuss structure and major themes more than the intricacies\/details of the text itself.",
    "Overall, I think this was a good course that introduced students to a wide variety of novels that built upon each other in both in content and in the overall arc of the class. . It was also nice to have rotating professors for the lectures. It made things interesting and unpredictable. The reading was manageable for the most part, however, the end of the term was much heavier in terms of reading than was the beginning. (You average a book per week essentially). We had three papers for the semester which also pretty manageable. I think this is a great class for both lit majors and non lit majors."
