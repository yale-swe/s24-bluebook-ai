    "An engaging introduction to ethnomusicology ranging over a variety of areas of study and approaches to ethnomusicology as a concept rather than a field. Recommended for students who are interested in issues of music and culture, perhaps especially those without a strong theoretical background in the literature, theory and discourse of the field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in music.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I'd say that it's a good means of exposure.",
    "This course provided an opportunity for students to acquaint themselves with the field of ethnomusicology, to understand its strengths, weaknesses, and characteristics, and to gain some personal experience with it. I would certainly recommend it to other students."

   "comments": [
    "Broadened awareness of issues to do with the study of music outside the western classical canon. Particularly useful as a means of getting one's feet wet in fieldwork without the pressures of a professional situation on top of the overwhelming awkwardness and continual mistakes. May be useful for comps and in future research but unlikely to have a direct impact on dissertation work.",
    "This class was fun, inspiring and interesting. It gave me many ideas about directions for future research, and ways in which I could develop as an academic.",
    "Taking this course helped me to better understand the larger picture of the music-academic world as it encompasses not only ethnomusicology but music theory and (Western) music history as well."
