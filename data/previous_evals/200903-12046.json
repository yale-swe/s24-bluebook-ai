   "comments": [
    "It's \"all about sex.\" I would highly recommend this course because it ties classroom biology and society together so well.",
    "Yes. Just don't be expected too much very serious science. Although there certainly is some. It's a little awkward because the class is very much about thinking well and putting concepts together, and Harvey is a vague and opinionated.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to incoming freshmen.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It's so much fun, very interesting, not too much work and is a great opportunity to meet people as a freshmen and begin some fabulous discussions. Every week after class I end up telling all of my friends everything about what we learned in this class and from what I hear from the others in the class, that's pretty much the norm.",
    "Yes, take this class. The workload thus far has not been very high, except for a few short essays and a presentation or two, but its a very thought provoking class that leads to an alteration in the way you see the world. Since reproduction is a driving force in all life, and the class focuses predominantly on conceptual issues built off of scientific fact, every day is full of little reminders of reproductive signals, motives, and results, giving the class relavance in life immediately after class.However, for this class to work well, you have to be fairly willing to speak up, share random stories, and ask questions when you're confused. This class is mostly discussion based, and group discussion not even teacher-student question-answers necessarily, so if you aren't willing to speak up, you'll miss out on the most fun element of the class.",
    "I would recommend it in a second. If you are even remotely interested in biology or reproduction, I would not hesitate to tell someone to TAKE THIS CLASS. I am so happy that I did- the close proximity with the professor and our engaging discussions leave me satisfied after leaving every class.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is very interesting and well taught. Our projects, assignments, and class discussions are a lot of fun and also make you think.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, you do not have to be a science major to take this course, and if you are looking for a course that involves a lot of discussion and interaction in class, this is a good course to take.",
    "Day-to-day: discussions led by Harvey but carried out primarily by students. Each student does one short presentation in the first semester.Assignments: Virtually nothing! a couple miniscule writing assignments, one reading assignment, one presentation about an interesting topic, coming prepared to engage the day's topics and be fascinated.Covet this class!"
