    "I developed Quantitative Reasoning (QR) skills. I developed the ability to apply concepts from MATH 112, as well.",
    "calc II",
    "I learned a lot about single variable calculus and series.",
    "Great class. One of the best-taught classes I've had so far. Pros: High level of organization Passionate teacher Lots of visualization of the concepts Receptive to student questions and concerns Cons: The pace of the class wasn't always very consistent (sometimes it moved faster than other times)",
    "I think this course, and Brett Smith in particular allowed me to gain an in depth understanding and comprehension of single variable calculus topics.",
    "This was a good follow up course to Math 112. We learnt a bunch of integration techniques as well as series & sequences and a bit of differential equations.",
    "My ability to solve math problems improved, obviously, but my ability to think critically and apply my knowledge to different situations improved as well.",
    "This class helped me understand the demands of a reverse classroom.",
    "I actually learned a lot about math, and that I can do better than I thought I was able to.",
    "This class tought me the calculus of integrals and was a great continuation from Math 112. I have a pretty good grasp on the applications of Calc II as well.",
    "Basic calculus lessons.",
    "I learned a lot about Calculus 2 and it was applied to a lot of different real life scanerios.",
    "I actually understand calculus more than I ever did in AB or BC! I learned to connect the information instead of memorizing tactics and forgetting after the test.",
    "From Math 115, I learned skills expected from one variable calculus.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of calculus."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The preclass videos are very helpful to establish a basis of the topic discusses in class, enabling it to move quickly and not dwell on more basic information. The psets generally reflected well what was done in class and what would be on the exams.",
    "I do not like the flipped classroom format. I found it useless going to class because the concepts would not be explained in full -- instead, applications and examples would just be looked at.",
    "Brett is so helpful, but the flip classroom setting feels ineffective at times.",
    "Having videos, online quizzes, homework, and class ended up being a ton of work. It is not flipped classroom, and I did not find the videos to be that helpful.",
    "Strengths: very straightforward if you took Calc BC\/had a bit of calc II background Weaknesses: poorly taught--the prep videos were good but the lectures often didn't overlap with the content of the videos, it was hard to predict what would be on the exams (but if you truly understood calc II then you were fine on the exams since they gave out practice exams)",
    "This is an amazing course if your TF was Brett! He made the course so accessible and understandable with his class presentations, office hours and review materials. Yet the videos we were asked to watch before class were not the best way of learning the material. Maybe those videos can be bettered, or an alternate method can be devised.",
    "It's a great class, taught by a very passionate and intelligent teacher. Not sure how it could be improved.",
    "I think most of the strengths of this course were in the professor specifically, namely attention to student comprehension, availability to assist, and desire to communicate calculus topics in an understandable and accessible way. I think the course as a whole, however, does not benefit from the flipped classroom model. I think that it allowed for too much disconnect between what the teacher that we learned versus what we thought was taught by the videos. I think to improve the videos, there should be less emphasis on theory, and more on problem solving examples, much like khan academy.",
    "I think the reverse classroom is much less effective than the traditional classroom.",
    "This class is set up for me to succeed, but it is so hard! With any instructor other than Dr. Smith, I would have had a terrible experience.",
    "I never enjoyed learning math through the flipped classroom, so I would consider that a weakness. However, a strength of this class were definitely the videos that we had to watch before each class.",
    "Sequences and series.",
    "I think the strength of the course is the prelecture videos and the n the in class more detailed lectures. The weakness of the class is the daily questions because we don't really get feedback on them if we don't know how to do them.",
    "It's a good course, but sometimes goes too fast.",
    "Having a flipped classroom with the videos was sometimes difficult to keep up with and to understand. It left me with a lot of questions.",
    "I think the way this course is laid out with pre-class video lectures, quizzes, and then more focused in class discussion was very thoughtful and helpful to my learning.",
    "The teaching was good, but the flipped classroom made it difficult to ensure a basic understanding of all course material."

   "comments": [
    "As a prereq for many STEM majors it is really not a bad class to take. If it is not needed, I would still recommend taking it, for the topics in class apply to other subjects and it is not too hard to grasp contextually.",
    "I would not recommend this course to students who did well in AP Calculus BC. All of it is review and I found myself consulting my high school notes more so than the notes from this course.",
    "This course is a prerequisite, so there isn't much recommending to do.",
    "If you have a calc II background, this course is great for revisiting material that you didn't fully understand the first time you learned calc II. It was easy for me since I had a background from AP Calc BC. But if you have never learned calc II before, be prepared to read the textbook\/do lots of self studying because the class doesn't teach calc II in an effective way",
    "Yes, if you need to learn single variable calculus, this is a great way to do so. Try to get Brett if possible, he is an amazing lecturer!",
    "I would recommend taking the class with Brett if you can. He's a great teacher and he'll make sure you understand the concepts. He also makes himself extremely available and accessible with tons of office hours and review sessions throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course, but more particularly, the professor, Brett Smith",
    "This is a hard course if you aren't very naturally gifted in mathematics. If you don't need to take it for your major, I would avoid it. The way the course is taught is very good, but the concepts themselves are fairly difficult to grasp.",
    "You'll take this if you have to. I wish I knew about 116, but with Brett it was okay, just extremely hard.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in continuing calculus and to anyone that needs to fill the prerequisite.",
    "Yes, as it is important for learning the fundamentals of calculus.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to someone if they don't need to take it. If they do need to take it, I would tell them it is not that bad of a class and manageable.",
    "It's a good course, but you have to keep up when things get faster (esp with sequences + series).",
    "Yes! Wlh Brett smith! He cares about the understanding his students have.",
    "Yes, this course is very good at increasing understanding of calculus.",
    "Yes, It is needed for many majors."
