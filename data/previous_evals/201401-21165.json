   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it - it was a great second half to my introduction to philosophy!",
    "YES!",
    "DS rocks, especially the philosophy! Take it!",
    "There are (to oversimplify) two really important questions that go through the semester. One is about morality, the other is about epistemology. The moral question is fairly interesting, although I already had strong opinions about it before the class and my opinions weren't really addressed in the course except possibly by Nietzsche, who is absolutely wonderful. The epistemological question is really interesting though; it replaces the metaphysics of Plato\/Aristotle with the far more interesting question of why we as individuals think what we do. There are ideas here that actually changed the way I think. Definitely take the class.",
    "I would say that this course is definitely a quick survey of many important philosophers in the western canon. I would recommend it to another student (mainly because I would strongly recommend Directed Studies), but not one who is looking for very deep discussion on any one philosopher or branch of thought.",
    "I would recommend this class because it provides a great foundation for any other philosophy course.",
    "Yes. DS is amazing. TAKE IT!!!",
    "A survey of the western philosophical tradition in one semester. The papers are a lot of fun to write. Enjoy!",
    "I would absolutely recommend DS Phil to another student, especially if taken with Brenzel. It is an amazing overview of philosophic works from Descartes on, and teaches students to effectively write philosophic critiques- and to really think like a philosopher. It is certainly a significant amount of work, but if you have taken the first half of DS Phil, the second half will be manageable. The works can seem absurdly difficult to understand, but when read in class and discussed in depth they can become the ideological groundwork for future work, or provide a different way of looking at the world around you. You read some of the true highlights of western phil, and come out with an amazing baseline of knowledge for future work. I'd definitely recommend this challenging but rewarding class."
