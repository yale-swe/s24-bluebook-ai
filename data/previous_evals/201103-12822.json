    "It's absolutely wonderful - exceptionally well organized and a predictable, but fairly time consuming workload. You will leave this course being able to talk to people about transportation, buying items, eating and drinking, hobbies, and much classroom\/school-related topics, not just your usual ni hao. The quizzes and tests are fair and you will get an A in this class if you do the work.",
    "A solid introduction to oral and written Chinese with an easy-to-follow curriculum. I would recommend it, especially because it offers a gateway to the light fellowship.",
    "If you do not have a very strong reason for learning Chinese you will often find yourself demoralized by the strenuous amount of effort you have to put in for this class.",
    "Yes, definitely. The instruction is stellar and the way the course is run you are forced to constantly re-inforce your skills in character writing and expand your vocabulary. It is an extremely formulaic class with clear guidelines set out and fair tests, so if you work hard it is very possible to succeed. Overall, the level of oral instruction and engagement in the classroom is also good and encourages you to do well in the course."
