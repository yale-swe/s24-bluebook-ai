   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class without hesitation. You write 5 essays - Personal Essay, Profile, Place, Cultural Critique, and Satire. For each essay, you're also required to turn in a polished draft. You'll end up writing about 2 essays every 3 weeks, but the work is worth it. Most of the readings are short (they're mostly essays) and enjoyable, and class discussions are interesting.",
    "English 120 is a must-take class. Your writing will be greatly improved because of it.",
    "Take it. Prof. Kinder is a fabulous teacher who will do as much necessary to get your essay where it needs to be. If it's already almost there, she won't suggest huge revisions just for the sake of suggesting them, but if you do need big revisions, she's a gold mine for suggestions. Also it was just a lot of fun.",
    "Take it!!! Even if you've never had experience with essay writing before, take it. I have yet to meet someone who didn't like this class. From what I hear, all of the professors are great, so definitely shop a few and see which one is a good fit for you.",
    "Creative non-fiction essay writing course. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. The work is fun and interesting, and it will make you a better writer",
    "Yes. Everybody should be required to take this class. With Prof. Kinder. They will become better people.",
    "Would definitely recommend! Such a nice introduction to college writing expectation and I definitely feel like my writing has improved. The course description and posted syllabi give a good sense of what the class structure will be, however the 120 classes can differ from professor to professor. Definitely try to get Professor Kinder!",
    "You will become a better writer if you take this class. The pace is pretty rapid-fire, with an essay or set of revisions due every week, but if you put in the work, you will find your essays becoming much, much better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. I believe that even though the workload is pretty high, the liberating feeling you get when writing a free form non fiction essay is very satisfying, and fun. It definitely gives you a break from the regimental nature of some of the other courses that one might take.",
    "An engaging class that challenges you as a writer and hones your skills to put your mind on paper. I would highly, highly recommend this class to another student. I loved it.",
    "Ok, here's the thing with 120: All the professors are great: they care deeply about their work and will help you become a better writer. What makes a good English 120 class into great English 120 class is the culture of the classroom. Is it fun? Do the students actually like each other? Are people willing to help each other and engage in useful discussion? The answers to these questions matter! I recommend going to class and feeling it out. It sometimes takes more than one visit, but trust your gut.Fortunately, Prof Kinder does a fantastic job of creating a positive classroom culture. This class was a blast! Even though it was late in the afternoon, I always left this class feeling energized! On top of that, she is a great teacher and editor: your writing will improve. A lot. Take this course with Prof. Kinder!"
