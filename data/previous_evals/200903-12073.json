    "If you are looking for a very organized study of Civil War poetry, then this is not the class for you. If you are looking for an interesting and enlightening class with a brilliant professor, then you should definately consider it. Professor Estrella is an incredible intellect, and reading and discussing poetry with him will change how you think about poems and language. Be prepared to be very confused at times, and to be unsure as to whether you understood anything that happened in class. These moments are worth it, though, when every so often you come to an incredible new understanding of what the class has been reading. Workload is minimal: weekly readings, mostly poetry, and a few ungraded written responses or 5-minute oral presentations. If you come to class, engage with the texts, and aren't afraid to put yourself out there during discussion, you'll do very well.",
    "The class won't do much to improve your Spanish but will improve your knowledge of poetry and spanish literature.",
    "If you're interested in a clear, general history of Spanish literature\/poetry, I would recommend going to one of the intro survey classes. This class will be disorganized, but I found it more to my taste--Prof Estrella will take you slowly through poetry worth your attention, encouraging you to take your time to engage with and really read the poetry. A fun, mind-opening experience.",
    "Definitely a fun class to take. The workload is light, but you're really asked to think deeply about what you read, so it's a good combination of being challenging mentally without a lot of busy work."
