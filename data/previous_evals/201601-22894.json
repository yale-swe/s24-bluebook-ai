    "PLSC 576 traces the political development of Ancient Greece chronologically through the use of historical texts, including primary source documents, plays, and speeches. Though it does focus primarily on Athens and Sparta, it attempts to provide a comprehensive understanding of the variety and evolution of political systems in Ancient Greece. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Ancient Greece. political thought, or political theory.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, regardless of your major. You get exposure to how the building blocks of western political thought came about, and read a broad range of material, texts, plays, poems. I thought the syllabus was well constructed and gave us the opportunity to see a wide range of material from this period and study political thought through various lenses.",
    "If you want a course about the big questions of society, this is it. I have spent time thinking about what democracy, freedom, and justice is and why it is important. Don't be fooled by the historical backdrop; though important, it is most of all a canvas onto which we can project eternal or at least exceedingly durable questions of persistent relevance. And I could not have thought of a better guide to do this, than Dr Cammack."

    "This course gave me an appreciation for the foundations of modern political development and thought. Though not immediately relevant to my course of study in International Relations, I found it useful to get a sense of the beginnings of political development, democracy, and the like and enjoyed trying to draw parallels between Ancient Greece and today."
