    "Differential equations, linear algebra, integral transforms",
    "Learned a great deal about the intuition behind mathematical modeling through our discussion of different techniques of solving differential equations. It's a beautiful course!",
    "I learned how to solve differential equations of many forms, and how to model real world situations using differential equations.",
    "Learned diff eq",
    "Learned a lot about differential equations so will be very helpful in the future.",
    "a basic introduction to differential equations; take this class only if needed for your major.",
    "Exactly what the course name says.",
    "Various methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations.",
    "A LOT of math. Much less application than I expected, but learned how to solve many different types of equations with many different methods.",
    "I learned how to solve different types of ordinary differential equations. I didn't really develop many critical thinking skills, considering that a lot of the problems were mostly \"plug-and-chug\" type problems that were very easy to follow. I know in past semesters that this course was deemed very difficult, but the challenge level this semester dropped off dramatically from what I've heard before.",
    "I learned how to solve various types of differential equations.",
    "Advanced differential equatiins and hoe to solve them.",
    "I learned tools to solve differential equations.",
    "learned pretty thoroughly how to solve diff eq's and how to apply them to a lot of engineering concepts",
    "I learned a lot about differential equations and how to solve them. Also learned about some practical, real life examples in physics. Learned how to think civically to solve problems.",
    "ENAS 194 builds upon the foundational skills of differential, integral, and multivariable calculus to establish a base upon which students can apply differential equations to the analysis of physical systems. As someone who has always enjoyed applied calculus but has never been the greatest math student, this course was both challenging but rewarding.",
    "In this class, I learned how to recognize and solve several types of differential equations by a few key methods. I also gained a rudimentary understanding of how the differential equations are used in physics and engineering applications.",
    "Good course, covers exactly what's in the syllabus and follows the textbook.",
    "I learned how to solve common, simple types of differential equations, and why these equations were common and useful.",
    "As the title of the course implies, I learned a great deal concerning differential equations - primary concern of the course was teaching how to recognize and solve different ordinary and partial differential equations.",
    "the class covered basic topics in solving ODEs and PDEs.",
    "I learned about the applications of math (calc, linear, diff eq...) to more physical systems and problems as well as basic differential equations skills",
    "I learned how to solve ordinary and partial differential equations.",
    "This class can best be described as building a tool box. Every week or so, we learn about a new type of problem, then learn the method for solving it. It ranged from basic first order separable equations to partial differential equations by the end of the year.",
    "analytical thinking",
    "A mathematical understanding of how physical systems work.",
    "I really liked this class! We learned exactly what you would expect: a whole bunch of differential equations and a little bit about partial diff eqs. Frankly, this was a lot like MATH 120, very formulaic. If you like that, great. If not, take something else.",
    "In this course, I learned how to solve ordinary linear differential equations with constant coefficients, solve systems of differential equations, find series solutions to differential equations, and use Laplace transforms.",
    "It's a good introduction to differential equations. The material was pretty well covered, especially for ODE's.",
    "How to do a variety of different differential equations. Also, this class indirectly taught me the value, and how to succeed with, a study group.",
    "By the end of this class I was able to solve first and second order differential equations and some partial differential equations. I also learned some linear algebra as we used matrices to help us solve systems of differential equations. This class helped improve my calculus skills because this class uses a lot of integration."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof, Schoelkopf was a fantastic lecturer. The material was interesting. The guest lectures and sections were not helpful.",
    "There should be more opportunities for study groups and interactions with the TAs and more outside material to complement what we've learned in class. Practice midterms would be great.",
    "I think this course teaches the wrong points of importance for many topics in differential equations, and although it is meant to be a crash course, I feel that many students will leave the course without understanding what they actually learned or how to apply it to more general problems.",
    "I felt like this class was mainly a memorization class. In other words, \"If you see an equation of this form, do this procedure\". As a result, my fundamental understanding of the material wasn't as good as it could have been. Having guest lectures on a regular basis was quite annoying, as there was decreased continuity over the course of the semester.",
    "More problem solving in section and in class.",
    "Pros: Good Professor, reasonable Problem sets work-load and exam difficulty. Cons: sometimes difficult to understand conceptually, or to apply the mathematical equations in daily life.",
    "Pacing was a little off. Moved fast to start, slowed in the middle, then picked up at the end. Otherwise fine.",
    "The class teaches the practical aspects of the material very well but sometimes it is hard to understand the physical interpretation and the theory behind the methods.",
    "Lectures were almost always extremely difficult to follow for me, and most of it we did not need to know (ex. proofs). However, section was EXTREMELY helpful as the material was re-presented in a much clearer and succinct way. I did feel like we learned a lot about solving equations, which is nice, but I still don't know how to apply 80% of what we learned.",
    "I think the course could be improved by making harder homework problems available. I feel like i've come away from this course being able to solve only the most basic differential equations and Fourier series, without much application to the real world or engineering. The instruction probably spent too much time on the simplest of subjects. For example, the amount of lecture time we spent on matrix review was a bit excessive. I appreciate professor Schoelkopf being thorough, however, I think it should be safe to assume that for people in an applied engineering class, we should have some basic knowledge of matrix operations. That way we could get more into the problem-solving aspect of matrices, and solidify those concepts more",
    "I feel like I learned a lot in the class and it was a very interesting math course.",
    "Difficult topic. Great professor.",
    "I really liked the format of the class! Lectures and psets really helped with the exams and the exams were super fair",
    "Lectures were sometimes hard to follow since it was unclear what parts of the lecture were essential formulas\/techniques to know for solving differential equations and which parts were solely useful for the derivations. Would be excellent lectures if there were more explicit, clear demarcations when starting\/ending a topic\/idea. Otherwise, lectures were very well-planned and thoroughly covered the needed material.",
    "Professor S is amazing. Absolutely fantastic and very engaging. Really enjoyed taking the clasd with him. Early material is fairly easy but then gets very challenging. Could have spent more time on later material.",
    "My main comment is that Prof. Schoelkopf was absent from several lectures, during which we covered the most challenging material in the course. The replacement instructor was not nearly as effective a lecturer as Prof. Schoelkopf, which meant I had to teach myself Partial Differential Equations entirely from the textbook.",
    "Strengths: This class was very organized and predictable. The professor's course syllabus was very specific, and his suggestion that I read the textbook before his in-class lectures really helped me in my preparation for class and my subsequent understanding of the material. During lecture, the material was presented at a reasonable pace and in a systematic way that made it easy and intuitive to understand. The content of exams was closely related and on-par, difficulty-wise, with our problem sets. I found the problem sets very useful--upon finishing them, even if I didn't begin with a solid grasp of what the professor had gone over in lecture, I had a much better understanding of the material. I appreciated that lecture notes, as well as answer keys to all the problem sets, were posted online in a timely way--those resources were a great boon to me while I was studying. This class caused me to fall in love with the rhythm of solving differential equations, and solidified my decision to become an engineer. Weaknesses: I thought the physics and engineering applications of differential equations, while interesting, were poorly connected to the rest of the material. Perhaps it was a function of the lighting\/design of our lecture room (Mason 202) but I also sometimes found it hard to see the board. And that was a shame, because the lecture was so well-organized and everything the professor wrote on the board was useful.",
    "The lecture notes are very sloppy, it's very hard to read Prof. Schoelkopf's handwriting on the board. The grading takes a little while, but it's fair and clear.",
    "Strengths: TA notes were so thorough, organized, and reader-friendly that I'm convinced a student could skip reading the textbook and still understand how differential equations essentially worked. Homework problems were fair. Weaknesses: I could never read any of our professor's lecture notes posted online, and his chalkboard handwriting during lecture was rarely legible, even from the first few rows. This was a huge problem, especially in a class where you wanted to follow equations as they were being written.",
    "Honestly, this was a great course - although it is likely that much of this can be attributed to Professor Schoelkopf, I think that the class was overall not really lacking terribly in any one area.",
    "It was an interesting class, and involved quite a bit of memorization. I think it would be great to allow for more time with the difficult topics right before the final, and to really solidify that learning.",
    "This was a good course in terms of not merely teaching the theoretical math but also showing real-world applications that are often helpful for people's learning. However, this course was very poorly taught, incredibly inconsistent and confusing at best.",
    "Strengths are that the course is very well structured for learning. Weakness is that lecture can be boring sometimes.",
    "This class is a lot of work and nothing can be done to change that. There's just a lot of content to get through in only one semester. I learned a lot and found it to be a very interesting class, it was just very difficult. I think the current method is probably as good as it can be to best facilitate learning.",
    "I think this course gives a good overview of partial and ordinary differential equations, but it doesn't do a thorough job of explaining how solving them works and it feels like it is trying to cover too much material.",
    "Lecture wasn't incredibly helpful",
    "This class is well laid out and the textbook was really good. Everything was explained quite well, psets were fair, and there were really no tricks. If you understand the material, you will do really well.",
    "Strength: Excellent instructor. The final was fun\/interesting but I hope there is a good curve since... Weakness: the final had some questions I felt we were unprepared to answer. Also, the lecture notes were great but hard to read.",
    "I learned everything directly from the book, the lectures were kind of a waste of time and the tests had questions that were nothing like anything I had ever seen so that made the lectures even more pointless. I wish I had just not gone to lecture and then spent that time doing literally anything else.",
    "A lot of topics are covered in this course, which is good but also difficult to do. The course was well-organized but we inevitably had to cut some topics from the syllabus because we ran out of time.",
    "This is a great course. I loved how it used real-world applications to teach about differential equations. Professor Schoelkopf really did a great job reviewing key points at the beginning of every class, and his teaching style was easily understandible. My only (minor) regret is that we did not finish everything on the syllabus...",
    "The teacher was very difficult to understand.",
    "The pace of the course could have been a bit more even. Additionally, there could have been a bit more consistency between the difficulty of in class examples vs psets vs exams. The biggest weakness of this class was that our work was never returned to us in a timely manner; we only received graded psets back a day or two before the final which made it harder to study."

   "comments": [
    "I took this for the skills, not as a requirement, and am so glad that I did. I highly recommend the course to non-engineering majors.",
    "I would recommend this class if required by your major. The lectures are not the most engaging, but it is always good to interact with the material in class, in section and while doing the problem sets.",
    "If you have to take this I suppose take it, but I would take MATH 246 over this course if you can avoid it, it may involve slightly more math but you will come out of it with a better understanding of what you have learned.",
    "Not particularly exciting. If you have to take a Differential Equations course, this one is definitely easier than the Math version. However, if you're actually interested in Diff EQ and the theory behind their solutions, this probably isn't the one for you.",
    "Take the course only if necessary",
    "Good class and helpful for learning about differential equations. If you think you might need diff eq in the future I would definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Do not take unless required to (you are probably an engineering major.) Just get through it and move on.",
    "Good intro to diff eq without the BS that is proofs.",
    "Good for learning the basics of differential equations. If you want more in depth coverage, the actual math courses would probably be better.",
    "Only if you really like math. It is difficult and time consuming.",
    "I would only recommend this course if it applies to your major, otherwise I don't really see the use in it. If you are interested in mathematics and applying certain equations to physical models, then this class is for you, otherwise, I think it's something you can steer clear of",
    "Yes, if they are a STEM major.",
    "Its a good class, but i wouldnt take it unless you had to.",
    "It's hard but important. Go to lecture",
    "yes! I took it for my major but it is definitely a great math course",
    "Definitely not an easy class but definitely also a worthwhile class to take if you need diff eqs for higher level courses. The Math department version only covers ODEs and progresses a lot slower than this Engineering version. Take this class if you really want to learn a lot of techniques to solve more types of diff eqs. If you want an easier chilled class, however, this class is not for you. Having only taken up to Multicalc (MATH 120) and not linear algebra, some of the techniques for solving diff eqs were hard to grasp at first but definitely do-able after a lot of studying. Make sure to have a study group or friends in the class. The p-sets can be rough doing them alone and can be very challenging, especially towards the end of the course. Also go to section because the TA's will usually provide really helpful summaries of the important key points to understand from the lecture. Schoelkopf's lectures can sometimes be a little cluttered with unnecessary info\/derivations but are very informative if you can keep up with the course's fast pace.",
    "If you have to take this class it's reall my not that bad compared to other math classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in higher-level calculus, but desires to build problem-solving skills and not necessarily conduct proofs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if Professor Schoelkopf is teaching. If you are diligent about coming to lecture and reading the textbook (the textbook is excellent and I would definitely recommend going through the examples on your own after lecture, if not before), it is very easy to do well on problem sets and exams. The class definitely gives you a solid grasp of how to solve different types of differential equations. While the problems are sometimes challenging, they are never annoying or really tedious, and when you successfully solve a problem you get the distinct feeling that the solution is \"cool.\"",
    "A very good and clear course. It should be a standard to which all other courses are compared. It , however, was very mechanical and process-based.",
    "Yes, the course is recommended for anyone looking for preparation before more advanced engineering, physics, or chemistry courses.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the practical skills to solve ODEs and PDEs, this is the class for you. If you're interested in the math and fun stuff behind it, I'd recommend taking the math version (split into two semesters)",
    "It is a class that has to be taken and is probably better for an engineering student than the theoretical math based alternative. However, this is not a class that would earn any other recommendation from me. If you're considering taking the class for fun, you're probably doing something wrong.",
    "Yes because you learn approaches to modeling physical systems.",
    "There were a lot of nights I stayed up working on problem sets. This class is required for a lot of majors, and it's just something that has to be done. I wouldn't recommend it to a non STEM student, but it's a very good class for people interested in equations and their scientific applications.",
    "I took it for my major, but it is probably not as good as the math courses.",
    "I actually did enjoy this class, especially compared to ENAS 151\/Math 120. It is nice feeling like the problems are manageable.",
    "The course really just covers ODEs and a few specific PDEs. Don't take it expecting to learn PDEs.",
    "Yes! I liked the class and feel like I learned a lot. It was a good continuation of calculus concepts, and Prof. Schoelkopf was a very clear, fair, and welcoming lecturer.",
    "Yes! I didn't even need this class before, but I loved it so much during shopping period that I ended up taking it (and changed my major to an engineering major throughout the semester and now I need it, so I'm glad I took it!).",
    "Nobody takes this class for fun. You're taking it because you have to. Pony up, asshole. You're in for a treat. Don't go to class, that's a waste of your time. Read the book and do the problem sets and use the extra spare time to pick up a hobby, maybe slacklining or disc golf or something.",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student. In my opinion, it was not as difficult as Math 120. The topics covered are definitely applicable to engineering (if you're an engineering major, this class is most likely already required for the major). This class covers a lot of material but it is doable; however, it will require a decent amount of work on your end.",
    "Take this course with Professor Schoelkopf!! While I had heard bad things about ENAS 194 from students who had taken the course in the past, Prof Schoelkopf makes the class really accessible to everyone. At the beginning of each class, he reviews the most important points from last lecture so that you don't get lost. He is also really good at explaining complex topics. If you are at all interested in learning about differential equations and their applications, I can only recommnnt this course.",
    "ME students must take this class. I realize the material is difficult, but I learned more from watching Khan Academy videos than I did in class.",
    "If you want to become more comfortable with ODE's, sure. If you're looking for an intellectual challenge\/super interesting course, look elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The skills you learn from this class are invaluable because as an engineer it will be very important to know how to solve different kinds of differential equations. The class has weekly problem sets that go through many different examples that give you a full understanding of the chapters. The class has two midterms and final, which you can surely do well in if you go to class and take good notes, do the homework, and go to weekly section."
