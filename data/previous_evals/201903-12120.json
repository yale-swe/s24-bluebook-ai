   "comments": [
    "I learned who to write quickly and efficiently and learned to not fear it for once (since I was doing it so often). I was also exposed to so much incredible work that has helped me not only reassess my experience as a Latina in the U.S differently but has also inspired my thesis and coming work",
    "I gained new knowledge on how to conduct ethnographic research.",
    "I gained a methodological understanding of \"Latinx Ethnography\"specifically, the theoretical\/practical intervention that Latinx Studies makes into the field of Ethnography, a traditionally white and colonial field of study. Throughout the course I feel like I learned, through reading the ethnographic\/theoretical texts assigned and discussing them in class, how to broaden my own understanding of what work good academic\/ethnographic writing can do. Latinx Ethnography resituates the power relationship between \"white, privileged anthropologist\" and \"Brown\/Black, disadvantaged research subject\"this is something I will spend my entire academic career working through.",
    "A good course to read academic texts about Latinx communities, which are not usually given in anthropology courses",
    "I learned ethnographic methods and critiques, with a particular focus on Latinx Studies scholarship. This is definitely a methods-based class, which I really appreciated given there are not many offered.",
    "I learned how to do more critical reading and responses. I also gained an interest in pursuing latinx studies.",
    "This course provides a hefty toolkit for anyone wanting a methodological base for ethnography or race-related work more generally. As one of the only offerings focused on Latinx studies, I would encourage anyone thinking about it to at least shop it. This course's main purpose is to provide students with a framework for undertaking any ethnographic-based project."

   "comments": [
    "Be prepared to commit to writing reading responses, which are graded fairly but pretty harshly. A lot of reading, but very interesting, and you will learn so much about different forms of ethnography through the course.",
    "I think sometimes we did have a lot of readings and it was hard to manage that on some weeks, but otherwise, I think the instruction was good. If anything, maybe just making the seminar smaller--that may have made it better\/I feel like I would have had a chance to really engage with my classmates",
    "Great class, I like the size of the seminar as it really allowed people to get to know the professor.",
    "I think this course was very well organizedall the assignments were thoughtfully assigned and I enjoyed completing them, and classroom discussion was always eye-opening and thought-provoking. I thought some weeks were perhaps too reading-heavya lot of the time the material was so wide-ranging and dense that I struggled to complete it. I always wished I had been able to because it always led to exciting classroom discussions, even if I hadn't completed all of it.",
    "Ramos-Zayas' grading is pretty harsh. Doing weekly reading responses is not really helpful when they are just overly criticized and hurt your grade. However Professor Ramos-Zayas gives great background information and summarization of the week's themes before every class.",
    "The readings are all very interesting and each week's topic flows well with each other, however I wish we ourselves could've practiced more skills of ethnography like we read about. Maybe this could have been incorporated into the final paper somehow.",
    "I thought this course very carefully assembled readings about ethnography in way that provides students with serious interest in ethnography a means to understand the study. Additionally, the autoethnographic assignment have space for much-needed introspection and personal writing that we rarely make room for in academic settings. I think some weeks' readings could be pared down significantly and still result in the same overall thematic messages. The weekly synthesis papers were somewhat confusing in that they act mostly as a means to summarize main points of the readings. Perhaps, a canvas based response would allow greater interaction between students."

    "Yes! Prof. Ramos-Zayas is an incredibly intelligent, critical thinker and learning from her was a great opportunity. If you are at all interested in latinx studies, sociology, ethnography, or expanding your understanding of transnational understandings of race, ethnicity, power, and class, you should take this.",
    "Yes! Especially if you identify as Latinx this course is extremely insightful as to not only work being done and within our communities by our own community members, but also as the way we should go about it if we want to engage in that work ourselves.",
    "Yes! Professor Ramos-Zayaz is amazing! She has conducted her own work and really applies her perspective to the class. You learn a lot and it makes you want to do your own research!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Latinx Ethnography resituates the power relationship between \"white, privileged anthropologist\" and \"Brown\/Black, disadvantaged research subject\"either by challenging the typical mode of \"representation\" of Black\/Brown people or by turning the lens of analysis to the privileged, white anthropologist. This way of thinking totally reshaped my relationship with the idea of doing \"good work\" in the academy. Professor Ramos-Zayas models this excellently, I thinkanyone considering a career in academia, or simply curious about learning more about good and responsible ways of writing for\/about people who exist beyond this institution should take this course.",
    "Yes, the readings are very valuable and the discussion is good, but just know if you do all of the work on time you will not get an A.",
    "Yes! Awesome methods course with an awesome professor. Seminar discussions were always interesting, respectful, and critical. Great readings too!",
    "Yes! Prof.Ramos-Zayas is a great professor and if you're interested in Latinx studies at all you will want to read all the material we go through!",
    "Yes, I would recommend if you're serious about Latinx studies or\/and ethnography. Speaking honestly, I discovered through this course that ethnography is not a genre of particular interest to me, which could make some of the readings cumbersome. That being said, if you want to take a class with Professor Ramos-Zayas and have the opportunity to do a prolonged ethnographic project, this is an excellent opportunity to do so."
