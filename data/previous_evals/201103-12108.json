    "This is a wonderful course that does wonders to both your french and english. It makes you analyze your writing more critically than ever before. If you are strong in French, it is definitely a course I would recommend.",
    "Take it! Fun!",
    "Overall, a good course. Professor Waters is a passionate instructor and has designed the syllabus with care. She is generally receptive to translations that differ from her own, though she could be gentler with her students. The course would benefit from discussion of the theory of translation, which would give students a framework in which to make and justify their creative decisions. Relatively low workload.",
    "We translated contemporary French texts from French to English and then workshopped them in class. Definitely take it!! It was a great class! It will challenge you, but in a way that very few classes here at Yale do. It can be as easy or as hard as you'd like it to be, depending on how much effort you want to put into your translations. Make sure to go the first day because it's a super popular class!!"
