    "Even if you're not a polysci major or generally interested in the topic, this issue is the most important problem governments have to confront today and it affects all of us in a very big way. Keeping yourself informed about the issue is therefore extremely important. It's also not an incredibly tough class despite the loads of reading. The lectures are good too. The final is daunting however.",
    "Awesome class. Gottlieb is a great professor, the material is relevant and worth knowing, the workload is very manageable, and the assignments are interesting. Definitely recommended.",
    "Good class. Prof has a different outlook than most.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in terrorism.",
    "Yeah take it. Split the readings up and you'll do fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I think it was an amazing course. Probably my favorite taken at Yale. My general experience has been that almost all humanities courses I've taken at Yale have been very theoretical, and not very practical, in nature. This course, however, was designed to teach us practical information about real-world solutions and actions to a problem. This course more than any other at Yale has helped me in my daily life as I watch the news, debate with people in dining halls, etc.The workload is pretty light other than a tremendous amount of reading (but the reading is interesting). There is a midterm which is take-home, and then a writing assignment which is interesting and easy. Overall, it is a very interesting class which does not overwhelm you with work. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Look, it's a good class. You don't learn a TON but you do learn some things. There are a lot of jocks in it so the grading isn't that hard. Don't let him scare you about the reading -- like most classes here, you don't really have to do it.He's an engaging speaker - but be wary, he's a Neo con. He also LOVES talking shit about President Obama. It can get annoying, but I guess new perspectives are good.",
    "Would definitely recommend to any student interested in international affairs",
    "I'd recommend it highly, especially if you're willing to do at least half the reading. It's interesting stuff.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Terrorism. It is a great class, and as a senior, I am very happy I took it. There are many readings, etc- but in the end I believe it is worth the hard work. Terrorism is a increasing concern in today's world so it was rewarding to learn about terrorism's origins and how it has evolved over the years.",
    "BEST CLASS AT YALE. Professor Gottlieb is the man, and the material is really sweet. I legitimately enjoyed every lecture, and most of the readings that I did too. Definitely take this class. Pretty easy grading system - they are lenient and the mid-term and other assignments are pretty cool to do.",
    "A great class with an interesting and important topic. Take it.",
    "Yes- good course.",
    "Fairly interesting polisci class.",
    "Not a bad course to take. You finish it with a good understanding of whats going on in regards to terrorism today. Its a current issue in the world that is relevant so that makes the class more interesting.",
    "Yes, it is the most interesting class I have taken at Yale",
    "yeah take it, its pretty self explanatory so take it if youre interested in the topic",
    "In-depth look at the issues of terrorism and counterterrorism, including the major debates in the field today. Take this class - it's not too difficult if you keep up with the reading, and it's interesting and relevant.",
    "THIS CLASS IS GREAT. Except for two things: a bit too much reading (I never say that, and didn't for Gottlieb's other Foreign Policy course, but this time I was a little overwhelmed even when actively trying to keep up) and the exams were slightly too difficult in the IDs. (The essays were fine, and the grading was fair). But the lectures were wonderful, the TAs were great, and the information is vital - everything was fascinating (you write interesting memos and you watch movies in class!) and I'm really happy with what I learned. It's really useful and interesting information to have for everyday life.",
    "Take this class. If you like military or intelligence it will be one of your favourite classes.",
    "The lectures in this class are extremely interesting, which makes the class worth taking. Gottlieb is extremely passionate, but he shares his own opinion freely, which you have to view as just that, an opinion, and be sure not to be offended if it disagrees with your views. There is a ton of reading for this class, so taking it credit\/D isn't a bad idea.",
    "Definitely take this class.",
    "An overall view of terrorism and counterterrorism used in the US and foreign policy.",
    "Take it. Important subject matter. Good readings. You don't need to do a ton of reading in order to do well. Professor and TAs are great.",
    "yes.",
    "A good overview of a lot of relevant history and theories related to terrorism. A ton of reading, but none of it is tested until the final. Professor Gottlieb is funny and engaging.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Very interesting with relevant readings.",
    "A great way to learn all the relevant issues behind today's terrorism and counterterrorism policies. The reading list is a bit excessive, but it does a good job of presenting both sides of some extremely divisive issues. The written assignments - midterm, memo, paper - are not too overwhelming.",
    "Good, interesting, topical class. Do not be scared away if you plan to take it Cr\/D\/F by gottlieb's speech; you can fairly easily get a Cr in the class without doing the extensive readings.",
    "This class guides you through the debates surrounding terrorism and counterterrorism (e.g. What is terrorism? What causes terrorism? Is diplomacy or military strength the best way to counter terrorism?) There is a lot of reading, but it is usually very interesting. You get out of this class what you put into it. It was definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Also great if you're not a political science major. I'm a chem major and I got a lot out of this class.",
    "Great class, very informative. Professor Gottlieb is very engaging and the readings are quite interesting.",
    "This is a great class! I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in terrorism at all. It gives a great background to terrorism and counterterrorism that everyone in this day and age should have. Don't let the long reading list scare you away - as long as you do the major readings, you'll be fine. Definitely take this class.",
    "The course title sums it up pretty well, but you probably do more terrorism than counterterrorism. Gottlieb is a laugh if nothing else, and if you go to lecture and section, you'll get something meaningful out of the class. I'd recommend it as part of an early study of terrorism, because it's not very in-depth, but it does cover a lot.",
    "Overview of terrorism and how its evolved. Learns lots and has lots of reading.",
    "Great course if you want to know the nuts and bolts of historical and contemporary issues surrounding terrorism.",
    "A great course for anyone interested in what is considered a very political topic and is often politicized by politicians and media when it's a larger question about our nation's and other nations' security. It's a small lecture, so it's easily accessible, not boring, and the reading, while a lot, is flexible.",
    "Interesting class. Grade scale isn't so bad until the finals. There aren't that much to learn in class so readings are important so if you are one of those people who never do the readings, then take this credit\/d. The course is VERY interesting and very relevant to our lives today. It helps you understand many of the terrorist related newspaper articles today to a further depth and you will know more about Al-Qaeda than any of your friends.",
    "Extremely interesting course on America's greatest security concern! Gottlieb combines pre-9\/11 and post-9\/11 work to help determine how severe the threat of terrorism is for America and the rest of the world. The counterterrorism is perhaps the most enlightening subject, as there is so much debate over how to end the threat, ranging from the spread of democracy to homeland security to isolationism.Lastly, Gottlieb is an amazing lecturer and keeps the course current and fun. He likes Seinfeld and the Godfather but disdains laptops used for browsing during class (and he has the eyes of a hawk) - note to the wise.",
    "yes..its important",
    "This class goes into the origins, methods, and characteristics of terrorism and the methods and characteristics of counterterrorism.I would definitely recommend this class. Facing the realities of terrorists organizations is a bit scary, but worth it.",
    "The teacher and the TA's don't really know what they are doing, and should probably be fired. Someone else who knows something about the subject should take gottliebs place. ALSO, don't buy his book, it's useless.What particularly upset me was an incident in which one of the TA's gave out my midterm to a student who said he was my friend, he was not, and violated my right to privacy. Unless I personally give permission to one of the teaching assistants to hand out my midterm to somebody, they have no right to do so.",
    "A good primer to international terrorism. I would recommend for anyone planning on going into the public sector. Lectures were enjoyable and the reading, though heavy, was usually enjoyable."
