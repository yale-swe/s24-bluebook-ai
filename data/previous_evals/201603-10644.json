   "comments": [
    "The seminar version of macro will really help you gain the intuition behind the material while allowing you to remain actively engaged and interested as well. Prof Hawkins is also incredible at explaining concepts and made class interesting.",
    "This class was great for engaging in detailed analysis of real-world economic issues such as the US trade deficit, unemployment statistics, the great recesssion, etc. I feel much better equipped to make informed economic analysis of macroeconomic questions, and the class provided exposure to a number of great resources (for data and analysis) to help inform future opinions.",
    "I learned a lot about how to think about economics and understand it deeply. I particularly appreciate how much I learned about macroeconomic policy, fiscal and monetary, and about production across countries.",
    "Prior to enrolling in this class, I had taken a macroeconomics course in high school so I thought I would know a fair amount. However, this course went much more in depth into all of the concepts that we had touched upon in high school. Of course I learned a lot of specifics regarding a number of topics but I think I learned the most regarding how to deduct information from graphs and extrapolate arguments from data. Every day we were exposed to real-life data and told to make inferences from them which was something I found extremely valuable.",
    "We learned about a diverse array of topics in macroeconomics - overall, I learned that macroeconomic models and trends are often more complex than they are made out to be.",
    "The course went beyond basic macroeconomics and covered things in more depth, which I thought was great. Talking to people in the lecture has really made me appreciate the course.",
    "Econ 111 provided me with insights that supplemented my understanding of many of my other classes, as the information was closely tied to history lectures I have taken. Our discussions of currencies, exchange rates, international inequality, and banking systems proved very relevant to events which one reads about in the paper. Professor Hawkins emphasized an analytic approach which I appreciated. He would outline an economic theory, then ask us what empirical data we would need in order to prove it true or false. Then, we would look at graphs and tables to see whether the theory held up. This mode of thinking and testing theories with data is a valuable skill."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked the structure of the course, with readings and quizzes at home and more discussion based learning in class. I wasn't a huge fan of the book because it wasn't as advanced or as quantitative as I would have liked it. I think learning from a book that is slightly more advanced than the material is always better than a book that is on par or less advanced. Having clear explanations for the math and graphs that go beyond the slides through this medium would have been helpful.",
    "The seminar format is wonderful for the opportunity it provides to engage with Professor Hawkins in direct discussions as well as talk about issues with classmates and work out answers together. The collaborative potential of the seminar environment was used well, with most (if not all) class periods including a lot of collaborative discussion on worksheets. The problem sets were interesting and good on both difficulty and length. The exams are hard. I think the main difficulty with the exams was the fact that practice questions given were, due to the newness of the course, not all exactly relevant to the exam we would receive; presumably this will be less of a problem the more years the course is taught.",
    "I think the course was very well structured, and Professor Hawkins is a great teacher. My only critique is that the last unit (international trade) was rushed and it was hard to grasp the difficult concepts.",
    "I personally felt that the seminar nature of this course was not the best as there really wasn't that much that could be discussed in our little sections when we broke off. It was either a calculation or something that I could not feasibly answer with my prior knowledge. There were other students that were better able to answer these hard questions with outside knowledge but I felt most of the discussions were fairly mundane and occurred prior to learning something rather than after when we could really discuss the information.",
    "This course is strong in that it covers many different topics in a short time, yet doesn't allow any one topic to feel rushed. There were a lot of connections from the beginning to end of the course, and the course would have been better if the instructor made these connections more clear.",
    "Strengths were the semi-flipped classroom. Weaknesses were minor and mainly involved organization and test preparation.",
    "Strengths: Prof Hawkins puts a lot of effort into making the class more engaging and making sure everyone understands everything. Weaknesses: Because of this someties one feels like the course is moving too slowly or material or psets are not going into as much depth, which can be a little de-motivating.",
    "Strengths: the opportunity to discuss, analyze, ask questions, and fully understand the course materials. Not an excessive amount of work, which in other courses overwhelms students and diminishes their engagement. A good balance of textbook preparation, class discussions, in class problems\/activities, and problem sets. Prof Hawkins is clear, thoughtful, and likable. Important and relevant information was taught. Weaknesses: Prep problems for the midterm and final were not very representative of what was found on the exams. Review sessions were rather unhelpful. I imagine after the course runs for another semester or two there will be better archives of exams to use as practice problems."

    "I would definitely recommend the seminar version of macro if you want to really gain the intuition behind the material while being in an environment where you are actively engaged and interested. The curve is harsh however so do the lecture if you don't care about these things. Prof Hawkins also incredible at explaining concepts and made class interesting, so he's definitely someone worth having.",
    "ECON 111 with Professor Hawkins is an incredible course. I would highly recommend it to any student who is interested in engaging on with macroeconomic issues on a deeper and more engaged level than they would in a lecture-style course. The seminar format forces you to discuss worksheets and problems with classmates, and along with Professor Hawkins' help, there is a great atmosphere of collaboration and support. The class is extremely well organized and I never felt lost in terms of what was expected or what the material was. The problem sets are not especially hard, but the exams are fairly tricky. Definitely dedicate a solid chunk of time to study for both the midterm and final. Professor Hawkins is a gem of Yale, and without a doubt one of my favorite professors. He is extremely smart but also very good at communicating complex ideas and breaking them down to be understood piece-by-piece. The course material was wonderful and it was hard not to be engaged. Grading was fair, although it's not lenient. Be prepared to put in a good amount of effort, but also be very rewarded.",
    "I recommend this course to other students, and I would certainly take it over the lecture option.",
    "Yes, I think that the seminar is a much better format than the lecture. Take it with Professor Hawkins if at all possible! Macro is very important to understand policy and much more engaging than microeconomics, in my opinion.",
    "It would depend on the person. I think for someone who likes a little more structure in classes and the ability to carefully review slides and what was discussed in class, I think the lecture version of this class would be best. However, for someone who is willing to be engaged and really take charge of the conversation, this class would ultimately be best.",
    "Definitely! Everyone would benefit from a better sense of how the economy operates.",
    "Definitely over the lecture if you're looking to learn. Tests become more detailed but that's compensated for by better learning in the class. The curve can feel a little rough since you're competing with so few students.",
    "Much better than the lecture if you want more attention from a very good professor. Might feel slow in times.",
    "Highly recommend this course with Prof Hawkins. He is clear, thoughtful, interesting, and enthusiastic. The class is a nice balance of reading the textbook to prep for class, in-class discussions, problems\/activities in class, and psets. You have a chance to thoroughly understand the material, which is made accessible and relevant. It's not too hard if you keep up, but still contains important and engaging material. I found Econ 111 it very helpful to understand not only what I read about in the news, but also other courses at Yale. Learning econ in a seminar setting really allows you to question the material, and Prof Hawkins is great at explaining concepts."
