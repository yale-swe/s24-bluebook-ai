    "This class is lots of work, but ultimately rewarding. As someone who'd never taken Spanish before Yale, I found that 120 had more work than 110 but was easier to do well in if you were willing to try. There was always a clear, structured path to improvement. Take it with Lourdes Sabe if you can: she's a wonderful teacher, and always a delight in class.",
    "You're taking it because you have to, but it's great fun and one of the best learning experiences you get at Yale. It's a lot of work, but you'll pick up an amazing amount of the language, and Prfa. Sabe is wonderful, so friendly, helpful, fair, and approachable. So I'd really recommend it, and I'd encourage you to take it with Prfa. Sabe, as you'll get a lot out of it in exchange for what you put in."
