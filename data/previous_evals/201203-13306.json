   "comments": [
    "Take if you're kind of interested. I'm not a poli sci major, but I took it just to get a taste of it. It was just enough information for me. BUt really, it's not that great of a class.",
    "If you are interested in law or global affairs take it. Even if the lectures are not really interesting, you will learn a lot with the book. Its a good introduction for international public law.",
    "Take it! Great class!",
    "A good survey of International Law. Take it!",
    "You should take this class if you are interested in knowing more about UN, how nations deliberate international matters and etc. It is a solid introduction to the field.",
    "This was an interesting class, and very little work on a weekly basis. The information was a bit broad but you get into the details of some treaties and many cases.",
    "This is a very good class. The material is ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING, and the readings are all quite good and very much relate to the course. Prof. Sanchez is not the best lecturer in the world, but you'll appreciate how knowledgable and straightforward and informative she is.[Assuming nothing has changed:]This class has a medium amount of readings per week. It has a midterm, a final, two quizzes; participation counts for 20% of your grade. The quizzes are absolutely simple--literally matching ten words with their definitions. You can get 100 in participation if you talk once per class (it's done in the Socratic method, like a law class, which is cool). You have to write about a lot for the midterm and final, but they're fairly straightforward and the practice midterm\/practice final are quite similar to the question as are on the actual midterm\/final. [Again, assuming nothing has changed]A solid, straightforward, absolutely fascinating class!",
    "Good class with an overview of different aspects of International Law. Class participation is important, so be prepared for on call weeks. The textbook is horrid--very difficult to digest and incredibly long. Overall, if you're interested take the class but be prepared for some frustration at Professor Sanchez's teaching.",
    "In this course, you can either do all of the reading, or basically none of it. We are assigned this enormous, dense, textbook that I realized about halfway through that nobody was reading. After the midterm, we also all realized that we would \"learn\" a mammoth amount of information and then be tested on a sliver of it. That was incredibly frustrating as we had gone over so many cases and principles. At the end of the course, you won't really feel like you've gained any expertise in any area, and you will probably be worried about your grade. I was excited to take this course because I (like many students in the class) plan to go to law school and a lot of the topics on the syllabus matched up with topics from other courses I was taking (like the Iraq War, Human Rights, the UN) and I thought it would be cool to get a legal take on those issues. It was, for like the three days we talked about them. Other than that, I felt like the level of expertise we got on any one issue was just past that I would have gotten from reading a Wikipedia article. The course is ambitious and tries to cover a lot of material, but it's not done very cleanly and the participation requirement means that people say a lot of things just for the sake of talking, which slowed us down immensely. I would say that if you don't plan to go to law school, it might be interesting to take the course just to get a sense\/foundation of legal theory. But if you do, you should know that you're basically going to have to take this course again in 3 years, you won't remember anything you learned in the past, and it will almost certainly be taught better in law school.",
    "Loved this class! One of my favorites at Yale. I feel that I really learned so much, and much of what we covered was conceptual rather than factual, making the class more memorable and applicable to real life, the news etc. Also not a lot of work, and Professor Sanchez is hilarious. I really recommend it.",
    "Don't take the class if you're looking for an interesting polisci course -- there are so many other out there to take.",
    "Interesting material, but think twice before you take it. You might find classes that better suit your needs\/interests.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. While I found the subject very interesting, professor Sanchez's lectures added almost nothing to the textbook. I also did not think that the format of having a lecture class be participation based was fair or rewarding and encouraged people to speak about anything, whether or not it was beneficial to the rest of the class. I found that the \"discussions\" that happened were merely people trying to show that they had done the reading in order to get participation points, which in turn is a waste of everyone's time in lecture. In my personal experience, professor Sanchez was not very helpful one on one, and she was openly discouraging to the whole class before exams during lecture.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the field of international law. It provides a great overview of the key concepts and their applications. The course itself is not too difficult: the midterm and final are straightforward provided you've kept up with readings. The weekly readings and case studies can be dense, but they don't take more than around 3 hours per week. The format of lecture with the participation component is rather disorganized as class a**holes sometimes hijack the discussion by asking stupid hypothetical questions just for the sake of getting a participation credit. This participation component makes class mandatory, but you don't get much from the lecture itself because most of what you're learning is from fellow students rather than the professor. Overall though, it isn't too much work and an interesting subject for anyone interested in international relations or going to law school. I took this class as a non-political science or global affairs major and still got a lot out of it. Take it if you want to add a relatively chill 5th class to your schedule.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to my peers. But I would also recommend you go to section because a lot of the concepts become much clearer after.",
    "Take this class if you have an interest in international law, because despite its faults, it still has something to offer. Professor Sanchez has low reviews for a reason: she's not the most eloquent lecturer. Actually though, I sometimes wonder how she passed the qualifications for being a lecturer. She knows this stuff, but she's terrible at presenting it. I remember jotting in my notes a ridiculous quote of hers, something like defining world war I as a \"terrible war with lots of horrible stuff.\"The biggest fault of the class, however, is that like 20% of the grade is participation, but a LECTURE does NOT at all lend itself to participation grades. We were given 2 specified weeks to be \"on call,\" which means if we didn't talk in class during those weeks, our grade wouldn't be so hot. We were supposed to raise our hands and she would call on us. See the flaw in this system yet? She can't possibly see everyone who has their hand up at once or decipher who, of the people with their hand up, is actually on call or needs the credit the most, because there are INEVITABLY those jerks who try to gather as much participation credit as possible by talking all the freaking time even when they're not on call, essentially robbing the on-call people of their chances to contribute. You just can't get around it. Participation in that class was a vicious game (unless you took it credit\/d).Aside from that, however, the class can be enjoyable because the content is interesting if you're even remotely interested in international law, and because Sanchez, despite being technically bad at lecturing, is still interesting in a different manner: she is one of the few professors who never puts me to sleep, probably because she sounds more like a real person or even like a student rather than an intellectual professor who is too highfalutin for me to relate to or pay attention to. She can even be funny at times, and she presents stuff to us in a really simple manner. I actually looked forward to this class (but only because I kept it credit\/d and was able to relax without worrying about my stupid participation grade).Also, this could be a pro or a con, depending on your learning style, but I found this class to be incredibly straightforward. I wouldn't say that means \"easy\" or \"gutty\" per se, because grading was somewhat harsh and there's no curve, but it's very cut and dry. Reminded me of a high school course: taught straight out of the textbook, absolutely nothing on the tests that wasn't touched on in lecture (i.e. do the readings she tells you multiple times to do, but no need for more), and simplistic. Quizzes were matching and therefore easy if you skim your notes for vocab-ish words, especially the Latin terms, she likes those. Midterm ended up being like the exact same as the practice midterm, so just memorize that. Honestly, I could have learned most of this class through Wikipedia if I had an outline of it (which I didn't, because her lecture slides tell absolutely nothing), so there's a hint: wikipedia the stuff she can't elaborate well in lecture and you'll be fine. Also on the test for the sample cases, address every single possible point on the checklist of things to address for whatever topic the case covers (ex: qualifications for crimes against humanity, all parts of definition of genocide, all principles of jurisdiction, etc) EVEN if they cannot be invoked, because grading takes off for stuff not explicitly asked about but that she expects you to give anyway.Shop it. Get a feel for it. It could be your thing. Especially credit\/d. (also if Jennifer is a TA again take her section because she's super cool. The other one is also really knowledgeable)",
    "Pretty good overview of international law. Pretty interesting and engaging. But not the best class, or the most inspiring.",
    "I would recommend it if you have no idea what the Geneva convention, the UN or any other major treaties\/ international bodies are because it's exactly what it is: an introduction to international law.",
    "This makes a very good fifth class. It's not a ton of work, and what work there is doesn't take a rocket scientist to do. Take it if you want a bit of an introduction to legal thinking, but mostly some good background information for reading the newspaper or discussing international affairs.",
    "In a nutshell, PLSC 129 will require you to read a lot to keep up with the class, but it's rewarding when you do read, since it can be fun to argue about different principles and to see their applications. I would recommend it to a student that would be able to handle the readings.",
    "This is an excellent first class to take in law. It was well taught and the readings\/cases were picked from a broad array of topics.",
    "If you are at all interested in law and are at all thinking about law school, I would recommend taking it. It is interesting and covers quite a bit of material.",
    "I would recommend it only to people who have an interest in law, although it goes a long way toward explaining the complexity and seeming absurdity of international relations. It's a lot of dry reading and a lot of legal history.",
    "It is a pretty good course. The syllabus of the course is a definite strength. The cases are really interesting and very relevant. The reading from the book is sometimes too much. Quizzes are easy and dont need much studying. The exams are really interesting (in a good way).",
    "This class is a quick look through international law. It covers many different areas of ILaw, but none too deeply. Even though it is a class about law, it is actually really easyto understand, even if you don't have a background in law or legal terms. There is a lot of reading, though, and if you don't like speaking in class, this may not be right for you, as there is a major in class participation requirement."
