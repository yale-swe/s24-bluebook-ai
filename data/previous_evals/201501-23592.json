    "Question about the readings: I did the readings the first few classes but realized pretty quickly that the professor largely covered the material during lecture and it didn't add any additional depth to my learning. While the pace of the course was very slow, I saw it as a meditation and perhaps for the type of material discussed this might have been the best approach. However, it was challenging to sit for 3 hour lectures. But I know that I learned things and the pace may have been beneficial to retain imagery--to better imagine some of the land practices that were being described. The professor did seem to struggle some when students would bring up counter-arguments to the material he was presenting, like he took it personally rather than being able to see it as an idea.",
    "This is a great class! Keep it coming!",
    "Great class! A very important perspective for anyone thinking of working in the tropics on forestry issues, or even for those considering forestry in the temperate areas. Really gets at the root of why and how some folks are able to live sustainably from a resource base, as opposed to the dominant industrial society. Thanks!"

    "Identifying and analyzing different indigenous silvicultural systems with an instructor who has on-the-ground experience.",
    "Chuck is so knowledgeable and happy to be talking about these questions. I really enjoyed his lectures and the richness of experience he brought to the class. It felt very practical but still had a conceptual framework to it.",
    "Great examples were provided. The material was really interesting, a different perspective than we normally hear at FES--especially to have an entire class on the topic. The professor had a lot of passion for the subject that came through clearly.",
    "Chuck's wealth of personal and specialized knowledge on the subject matter.",
    "Great lectures, instructor has a wealth of information about the subject",
    "The perspective of this course changes the way you look at silviculture. It really advances students understanding of social forestry and captures the complexity of indigenous silviculture.",
    "This was a good overview of indigenous silviculture - the practices, management goals, and techniques - which is a very rare and needed area of study at FES.",
    "Dr. Peters' wealth of experience and the perspective he's gained from his travels. Course readings are well-selected and interesting."

   "comments": [
    "There is a strong emphasis on Southeast Asia as opposed to other regions.",
    "My only complaint would be that a few questions on the midterm were a little to focused on memorizing all the specific examples we learned in class, but most of the questions and the final were more focused on analysis and synthesis, which I appreciated.",
    "Would be nice to have readings that add something different from the lectures...also there wasn't incentive to do the readings because we didn't discuss them. It seems like the course could have covered a lot more material...the readings were thin",
    "Needs to be a more participatory class; less lecture-heavy.",
    "Field trip will improve understanding on techniques of indigenous silviculture",
    "The format of the course (3 hours of lecture) is rather taxing.",
    "I would have liked the class to go into more depth with the case studies. The facts about the breadth of cases were very interesting, but I would have liked to dive into more (e.g., 20 minutes).",
    "Could be more connection between the readings and discussion. The one time we had a discussion was great - Dr. Peters asks tough questions and could facilitate more discussion about the ideas presented in class. A field component would be a useful addition. It felt a little like Dr. Peters was trying to sell us on the fact that indigenous systems are excellent adaptations to their circumstances, which is something that I already bought into and understood. I would have liked more of the class to get into the literature and go deeper into the subject."

Chuck is an expert on the subject and provides useful information. The pace of the course is a little slower and the workload is not very steep.",
    "Definitely take it! Chuck is great and the course was wonderful. I wasn't even planning on taking another course, but I added this on because I could not miss it.",
    "Sign up for a meditation. The material is interesting and the topic is great, but it is slow. Additionally, take caution in bringing in ideas that might be perceived as critical. The professor will likely not receive them well and he may choose to penalize you personally for it.",
    "The course is very interesting, and one of a kind as far as I know (both at FES and in the country, potentially.) It is lecture-heavy, but you'll learn a lot.",
    "This course is accessible to those from different disciplines - not only forestry or ecology backgrounds.",
    "Do it! Even if you don't work in the tropics you'll gain an important perspective onto how many people across the globe carry on in a sustainable manner. This is something we can learn from and use in our own lives."
