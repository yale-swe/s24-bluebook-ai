    "Look carefully at the syllabus if Garsten is teaching it again. When he taught it in Spring 13, it was half the stuff you'd expect and half things from American history that didn't really relate. I would have preferred he focused solely on Aristotle, Rousseau, Hobbes, Plato, etc. rather than bringing in the Federalist\/Antifederalist debate, whether America should go into manufacturing or stay in agriculture, etc. The work isn't that bad though. It's just 3 five-page papers and (for us) an ungraded 2 page reading response, plus a final.",
    "Political Science 114 teaches about political theories of prominent philosophers and connects them with significant political events in American history. I would recommend the course because it makes you think not only about how a country can best work under a certain predetermined form of government, but about which form of government and representation might best serve a country and defines all those ideas in depth.",
    "A look back not necessarily at political thinkers but at political thought, how it's changed over time. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy their Social Science credit.",
    "It's a good voerview of philosophy and overall a good class to take.",
    "Intro to Political Philosophy covers some really interesting readings. You read Plato, Rousseau, de Tocqueville, Hobbes, Aristotle, Madison, and Hamilton, to name a few, so it really exposes you to important, formative readings. The lecture at times was rather boring, but I highly suggest you do the readings (which are fairly long) to keep up in the class.",
    "Could have a little more structure, but it was an interesting course. Very focused on American politics, but this makes the class a bit more relevant and less abstract",
    "This was a disappointing course, to be honest. It started out good, but by the end, I was frustrated with the amount of reading, the difficulty of the grading (completely TA dependent..), and the fact that lectures became repetitive and boring towards the end. Still, a good intro to many philosophers, but I am not quite sure I'm emerging from the class with any feasible or relevant knowledge, unless I were planning on going into Philosophy.",
    "Decent if you like this shit",
    "Will give you a basic overview about crucial philosophers that informed our Western political system",
    "Do you want to take political philosophy? If so, great! take this class. It has a fine reading list and Prof. Garsten is a fine lecturer. If you do not want to take political philosophy intrinsically, however, this class will not overwhelmingly motivate that. Do the readings. They are not long, and really all this class is about.",
    "It's a decent introduction to Western political philosophy, but it's very America-centric and the professor assumes that everyone has a good knowledge of American history (which by and large cannot be assumed especially as a large portion of the class were international students). If you know a lot of American history (especially pre 1900), and like ancient Western philosophers, then go for it. If you don't have that knowledge, then I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "A basic survey course in political philosophy. Rather dull, better for freshmen who have yet to consider many of these thoughts. Easy writing credit.",
    "If you're just taking this to get a distributional or skills requirement out of the way, don't take it, because it will definitely require a lot of work for one to be successful in the course. But it's a worthwhile challenge.",
    "Take this class if you need a writing credit or enjoy reading ancient philosophy. Otherwise, don't do this... Also, try to do the readings because the ID's on the final are a bit rough without them.",
    "Fantastic course. Take it if you want an introduction to political philosophy with American historic political examples for extra perspective. Do your readings - at least skim them. Go to LECTURE. Leave your computer at home and bring a notebook. Sit next to a cute boy - there's a lot of them - but watch out for section assholes.",
    "would highly recommend- learn a lot about really important philosophers",
    "It's a good introduction class and fairly interesting. Essays aren't bad.",
    "An insightful and involved approach to the political classics. Definitely should be high on the list for the humanities\/ poli-sci type, but anyone would come away having learned something; one pre-med bio major in the class said it was among her favorites.",
    "If you do not want to leave Yale without studying some of the great works of the world (and you didn't take DS or are a science major) definitely take this class! Such a good complement to anyone's course of study and a topic that every person should think about it.",
    "I would not recommend it unless the student is really into philosophy",
    "It's an interesting class and the connections Garsten makes between the older philosophers' work and American history are really interesting. It can be a bit boring, though, if you don't do the readings especially. He's a really good lecturer but sometimes it's a little repetitive. It's a good intro course that's good if you've never really read Western political philosophy. If you have, this would probably be mostly very basic stuff.",
    "I would recommend taking this course in the philosophy department for a better introduction. Our professor gave the course an American-centric perspective, and we skipped Plato's republic to do the federalist papers. I would recommend taking this in the philosophy department for a better introduction.",
    "Great class. Great books. Take it writing intensive because it really isn't that much more work and you'll get more out of the class and the readings that way. Bryan Garsten is a brilliant professor. One of my favorites at Yale.",
    "If you haven't taken (or aren't currently taking) DS, you should definitely take this course. Having a basic knowledge and understanding of philosophers like Aristotle, Hobbes, and most others on the syllabus is crucial to any liberal arts education. If you're looking for a writing credit, this is the perfect course for you since the course-load is incredibly reasonable. Definitely take this course.",
    "I think it's one of those things people should just know in life - political philosophy, I feel, is central to a lot of aspects in life. I guess it depends on the professor, too, but overall, I took this course for the readings and the knowledge, and I got out of it with a much stronger grasp of some pretty major works of politics, so I'm personally satisfied.",
    "If you are not a political science major and just like political philosophy take this course. If you dont have a background in political philosophy and are just trying to take the course for a writing credit, beware. You do have to do several rewrites and you still have to take the final exam. Non writing credit, it is much less work. You just write the papers, accept your grade and take the final. Overall it was a pretty boring course, but that is because I dont like political philosophy",
    "Good class to take credit d as it is interesting material and Garsten is a good lecturer, but you don't have to worry too much about the assignments then.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone needing a sample of political philosophy. Professor Garsten will definitely improve it for future semesters.",
    "I would, if he or she were only interested in taking the class for the reading. I took the class to do the readings, I did them, but I didn't get that much more from the class.",
    "I took this class because I felt guilty. I was a Yale freshman, surrounded by DS-ers and geniuses, and I felt like I had snuck my way in. How was it I'd gotten into the Ivy League without reading Plato and Aristotle? I resolved to fix this, and to catch up on all the great political works of the western tradition. Many of them were covered in this class-- and the class did an excellent job of teaching them. Some people are scared away by the essays and the difficult essay-final, but honestly, the work is worth the things you learn. I loved the class, and feel like I gained a lot from it. Take it and you too can come off as a jerk by quoting Machiavelli in bio section!",
    "AAThis is the best class I have taken at Yale so far. This class gives you a chance to explore some of the great philosophical texts in history without the grind of DS. You will really get to dive into the texts and explore them. Professor Garsten is an excellent excellent professor. His voice is so soothing. He really helps you relate to the material and pull out the crucial points from the text. This is a class you should definitely take for a WR credit. You will only write 15-17 pages, and all you have to do is rewrite at least two papers (and also improve your grade on those papers in the process!!!). Try and keep up with the reading; it's not too much, but it's a fair amount. What's really cool about this class, is how Garsten relates the material to American history (hence why it is POLITICAL philosophy and not just philosophy). This helps make the class an excellent introduction to philosophy as it makes it more relatable and more interesting.",
    "PLSC 114 is a great first exposure to political philosophy. You read segments from a lot of the most famous texts, and I definitely feel like I have a better sense of what the great theorists of the past were actually talking about. I personally really loved Professor Garsten's lectures and found each one to be very interesting, but I know some of my peers found his slower, occasionally lethargic lecture style to be boring. Your grade is essentially composed of 3 papers and the final. I would recommend really reaching out to your TF and going to office hours as you write your papers, because your TF is going to be the one grading it, so it's a good idea to make sure beforehand that they don't hate your idea. Also, be sure to take one of the writing intensive sections. You get a WR credit and the only \"extra work\" you have to do is rewrite 2 of your papers for a higher grade. There's really no disadvantage to doing it. Although I struggled with the papers, I quite enjoyed the content of the class, so yes, I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes. I think it's better than the course with the same name but provided by Prof. Pogge.",
    "Interesting class, but kind of slow at times. Performance depends on what section leader you get.",
    "Great intro to political philosophy and Garsten is great! Take it writing-intensive so you can rewrite 2 papers. Keep up with the reading and take advantage of office hours",
    "This is a good intro course to some of the fundamental questions underlying politics--questions that are essential to understanding government and the citizen's role in society. It is difficult to form serious political opinions without considering ends before means, and political philosophy is what allows us to examine these ends. The course covers the basic canonical works--Aristotle's Politics, Machiavelli's Prince, Hobbes' Leviathan, Rousseau's Social Contract, Tocqueville's Democracy in America--while integrating important texts from American history (Federalist Papers, Lincoln's speeches, etc.). While the lectures can seem redundant at times, overall Garsten delivers a lot of good information. The (three) essays are the bulk of the workload for the class--but if you take it for a writing credit, you can rewrite two of them.",
    "Good intro class. Interesting and connects modern and older texts.",
    "I thought this was an interesting class, even for someone with only a limited background in philosophy\/political thought. I'd recommend it.",
    "Political Science was very interesting--perhaps the one class that's affected the way I think the most. I would recommend it, certainly, but be prepared to do a lot of reading. I would suggest making sure you can do the readings, and analyze them thoroughly, before you decide to take the class; I would certainly have gotten more out of it had I spent more time understanding the different texts!",
    "I would recommend it instead of the alternative philosophy course, as the readings are much more interesting and the professor more willing to help his students. The sections (at least mine and a friend's) are very good.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, though not as a top choice. It was an interesting and accessible introduction for someone with little background in the subject, though.",
    "I fun, easy SO credit. You'll learn a lot, but can get by simply by attending lectures and going to section.",
    "A good introduction to classic political philosophy texts (Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, etc.) Professor Garsten is engaging (but really quiet!) and always willing to talk outside of class. The workload is light and the TFs are helpful."
