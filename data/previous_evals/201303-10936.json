   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it! You'll like the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Be prepared to do weekly homework assignments, but it is worth it because the lectures are interesting and the topics are probing.",
    "This is a great intro course, and I recommend it.",
    "A great class if you're looking for an easy A with minimal effort. The professor is a real sweetheart, but class itself could be learned entirely from posted powerpoints. Easy 1 hour question\/answer case to do every week, and all exams are take home. A great intro to ethical reasoning and how it applies to the business world. If you're looking to be extremely mentally stimulated or to have your mind blown, don't take this class.",
    "An absolutely wonderful class. Mercedes is an angel and is the nicest, most accessible, and most caring professor I've had at Yale. The class is taught in English which proves a small hurdle at times due to Mercedes' first language being Spanish, but all in all, a worthwhile undertaking where I learned a lot, had fun, and watched a lot of movies!",
    "Professional Ethics is a really good class. Prof. Carreras is very kind and personable, and somehow remembered my name for the whole semester after I told it to her just once when I answered a question. It is not too much work at all, but the amount you learn is a lot. It might be very tempting to not go to lecture, but I always found it worth it to go and I think that the people who went to lecture did far better on the midterm and final. A lot of lecture was learning interesting things and incorporated a lot of media (like sections of movies and YouTube videos) to teach. Homework is a reading response every week that really doesn't take very long, an essay at the end of the semester, and a take-home midterm and final. Really a great class - I would take it especially if you have a lot of hard classes.",
    "Yes- it's a pretty interesting course and the grading is fair. And although it may seem like you don't need to go to class to make the grade, you should! Prof Carreras is engaging and the lectures are usually fun.",
    "Very easy class, but the lecturers are boring. The professor is nice and an easy grader but very tough to understand in lecture",
    "Professional Ethics is an interesting and useful class that I can't recommend highly enough. Mercedes cares deeply about her students and is honestly the sweetest professor I have had. Unfortunately, many students take advantage of her easygoing nature and skipped class and it was apparent that most people were in the class because they wanted a gut. Don't be one of those students. Take this class because you have a genuine interest in it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Interesting material and manageable amount of work.",
    "I loved this class - the moral theories and issues were explained clearly in class, and then our homework was applying them to specific cases where we had to analyze them using the theories. I appreciated how we weren't expected to read through a lot of books written by the theorist, and everything would be explained with You went to class. The readings weren't super long and You got to use the book and Your notes on the essays and exams too.",
    "I wrote a long list of my problems with this class, but I can honestly sum it up by saying it was awful. Poorly taught, boring material, and unchallenging in the extreme. 150 minutes a week I will never get back. Do not take this unless you are very stupid.",
    "good class to take before graduation. helps you think about how you will act in your approaching professional career. not too much work, and interesting subject matter. I would recommend this class.",
    "The class is based on your responses to questions (extremely easy) from readings, which are mostly interesting. There is a take home final and take home midterm, which are basically longer versions of weekly assignments. One final essay on a business ethics topic of your choice.",
    "Super low workload, Senora Carreras is very nice. The readings are actually really interesting, though class can be sort of dry and unproductive at times.",
    "The case studies are the most interesting part, but they are what you make of them.",
    "This course is a survey of ethical models. Take it if you would like to learn, but are not necessarily ready for an in depth course. It may also be helpful for people entering the corporate world.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. The teacher was passionate and the topics were fascinating",
    "Definitely take this class. Don't ask questions. Just take it.",
    "Absolutely. Manageable workload, interesting subject material.",
    "It required weekly homework with a midterm, final and final paper. You can learn a lot and be successful if you do the work.",
    "Phenomenal class, take it. You'll only get in if you're a senior.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Professional Ethics is a cool, relatively easy EPE class that discusses a lot of real-world practical examples of ethical conflicts in the business world. The homework assignments take longer than you'd think, but it's not too much work each week and the midterm\/final exam both model themselves after the homework. Little bit of philosophy involved, so if you come in with some intro philosophy it helps. Prof. Carreras makes this class; she's a wonderful professor, and definitely cares a lot about making sure you do well. If you're looking for a relatively easy EPE\/ethics class, or are interested about ethics in the business world, I would recommend the class.",
    "Awesommmmeeee class!!!!' Take it!",
    "take it for Professor Carerras. material is sometimes a little dull, but Professor Carerras is the awesome and you will enjoy the class",
    "335 is a phenomenal course. If you have the opportunity, take it!",
    "Philosophy meets the corporate world. Good and manageable class",
    "I would recommend for an interesting and not too work intensive class.",
    "This is a great course if you want to learn some basic ethics and how to apply it to real world situations. It is not a difficult course, with a take home midterm and final plus one final paper. There are weekly assignments as well. If you do those, you will be fine for the midterm, final, and paper.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! A great fifth class or lighter fourth class. The material is really interesting (applying theory to real cases make it so practical), the readings are very interesting and worth reading, the assignments can be annoying but just make sure that you do the reading, and Professor Carreras is just wonderful! It's useful, interesting, and not too much work. The lecture also has some discussion (even though it's a lecture, Professor Carreras makes an effort to get to know everyone) and multimedia. Take it!",
    "A good introduction to Ethics in Politics and Economics.Small but present philosophical stakes.Excellent course material (newspapers, articles, videos, ETC.)Homework is sometimes unstimulating because we are only asked to reiterate the opinions of authors we read - as oppose to confront or nuance their opinion.The final paper however allows for more freedom and can be a very interesting assignment.Not all lectures are interesting, but overall most classes leave you with something to think about.",
    "It is a great fifth credit, not very demanding at all and extremely straightforward. If you don't have a background in ethics, it will serve as a good way to learn the very basics of many moral theories. Be prepared to be a little bored in lecture from time to time, but try to engage and participate (it spices up the class).",
    "A great class with relatively straight-forward work and easy readings. Professor Carreras makes the class interesting with youtube videos and interactive ethical scenarios and the class is super relaxed. I definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Definitely a course that will be useful in making practical decisions in life after college.",
    "Definitely recommend, take this class as a solid 5th. I don't know about credit\/d because you do have to do weekly reading assignments, which aren't all that hard, but she's a pretty good grader overall so u might as well go for the grade",
    "yes take for easy credit"
