    "Take this class if you have any interest in architecture\/engineering\/design or just want to learn how to think critically and intelligently about \"green\" design. The workload is extremely reasonable - almost no reading, just a few low-stress homework assignments that really do teach - and the material is interesting and presented well.",
    "ARCH 163 provides students with critical knowledge regarding the pitfalls of the \"green\" trends of today, and the manner in which to address energy usage in buildings on a case by case basis.",
    "Half climate science and half architecture and most of the class is EVST and ARCH students, so everyone already knows about half the material.",
    "reccomend",
    "Take it if you're interested in any issues involving green design or city planning. It is a realistic look at what can be done about the environmental impact of buildings. Though repetitive at times, you really learn a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "An awesome class. Take it Take it Take it.There are only a few big homework projects that you can put as much effort into as you want. The final is the coolest thing ever and I actually WANTED to work on it. It gave me a structure and support (from Addington and Eero) to do something that I would have been doing anyways.",
    "I think it is a great course and anybody with an interest in sustainability should try to take it.",
    "A course about climate change and the hierarchies of design choices that best reduce energy use in buildings. I would recommend this course given it is the sole course devoted to this topic of study. Professor Addington will respond to your enthusiasm and your questions; you have the ability to make your experience of the course as positive as you would like it to be.",
    "Yes to Architecture majors. You might not learn how to design a green building in a technical sense but at least you gain awareness of environmental issues.",
    "If you want to get on track with thinking about sustainable design in terms of architecture and science, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, particularly to architecture students but also to anyone interested in sustainability issues. The overall value of the experience outweighs some minor organizational problems with the class.",
    "Recommend.",
    "assessment mechanisms unclear",
    "This course is very interesting. It made me want to study architecture for the main reason that we spend so much time indoors!",
    "Yes! Very chilled, great class. Changes the way you think. Take it!"
