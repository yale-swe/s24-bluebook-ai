    "Question 6: Instructor needs to be more careful about not being redundant, not telling the same stories over and over, etc.Question 3: Homework provided very little insight into the latest river research and did not engage students in meaningful discussions.Not sure where to put this comment but time and time again the instructors cut students off by speaking over them before they had finished asking their questions or providing a comment. What happened many times is that students specific questions were not answered and sometimes the students got frustrated and gave up trying to ask. I think the instructors need to listen more intently and not anticipate based on their years of experience. Besides not answering student questions cutting someone off or speaking over them is rude. I don't think that is the nature or intent of the professors but I do think listening is something they need to focus on next year.",
    "jim is a much better teacher in the field than in the classroom. more field trips.Classes should follow basic vocabulary type lectures, field should flesh in the details and case studies.",
    "See Question 13 below. This class should no longer be offered at Yale FES, or taught by a different professor.",
    "Question 6 - I didn't answer this question because my issue with the class wasn't about the pace, it was about the content. I thought the material discussed in class was focused too much emphasis on the historical development of river classification systems and hydrological modeling methods. It wasn't too fast- or slow-paced, it was just repetitive.",
    "The field trips were very valuable. The essays were pretty useful, but I wished that Jim would have given us a syllabus with a more clear set of assignments. It made the essays out of class seem last minute and not applicable. As if we were just being made to do extra work for the sake of doing extra work.",
    "I'm glad I took the class. The instructor really shined when he took us out in the field. I learned a lot by his anecdotes. The course reader was a helpful supplement to the class. The text books, however, I cannot say, because they had sold out, so I never go to read them. I think going into the field and seeing the channels and classifying the channels then was the greatest help.I think the instructor assumes that we students have a working knowledge of the material. It would be helpful to explain the concepts for beginners and more in depth than cursory.",

    "Homework papers are essentially a regurgitation of lecture and readings. I would much prefer synthesis and constructive problem solving than rehashing what has already been said. Very little new material (i.e. the latest in river thinking) was presented. The second instructor (Laura) although very knowledgeable did not add significantly to the class and took time away from possible student discussion. Also, I'm sorry but if you don't have a good speaking voice, you shouldn't be a lecturer at yale - at one point I saw a student with ear plugs in while she was lecturing.",
    "keeping lectures basic and on topic",
    "The in class lectures are disjointed. They overlap with one another and are unclear. There is no clear understanding of what we are supposed to learn from the class. It is not a linear trajectory of learning.",
    "The required length of the out-of-class assignments is usually too long, which make them look like busy work.",
    "This class was AWFUL. It failed to meet almost all of my expectations. The only thing I vaguely learned was how to classify rivers, but I learned more from the classification guide than I did the professor, so I wish I could get my money back for the class and just read the guide instead. **It should not be offered in the future.** I didn't learn anything I didn't know coming into the course, and it is the first rivers\/hydrology class I've taken. So, I didn't learn anything in the class I didn't (a) think to generally be the case about how rivers function and how restoration should\/shouldn't be done based on personal observation or (b) learn in a middle school science class. The professor basically gave us his opinion on the field for a semester, and the ridiculous final exam made me realize how very little we had learned. There were only a few assigned readings (historical journal articles) and then he told us that we had the option of reading basically a collection of notes that he had been putting together for 20 years. He left it at Audubon copy service, and those who were interested could go and copy this. Since I was taking other classes and figured he would have assigned reading if he thought it would be useful to our understanding, I didn't copy the notes\/read them. Maybe I should have, but given how unedited his lectures were, I didn't look forward to trying to piece together 20 years of his notes. He thought it was funny\/cute that all he had was notes rather than a book to assign, but felt that all the book were inadequate to what he wanted to teach. So, he chose to assign no textbook or other peer-reviewed readings (aside from those three or four journal articles at the start of the semester). I think this decision underscores the fact that he was basically teaching his opinion the entire time, rather than the established opinion of the field, which we could then evaluate after we had that basic understanding. Later, when we were doing our final project, he TOLD US what conclusions we should reach before we even went into the field, and then told us to put them in our paper and build up the body of the paper to support those (unfounded) conclusions. Pretty shocking instructions from a professor, given that this was supposedly a field science course.Speaking of the final project, our group turned in a draft of our final project on the Thursday of reading week, as the prof had asked us to do. On Monday of the following week I sent him an email on behalf of the group saying that we are looking forward to hearing his comments so that we could finish the project by the end of the week, and he just NEVER GOT BACK TO US. He never gave us comments on the project, or even responded to my email. So, our final project ended up being a rough draft. This is VERY disappointing considering how much work (papers, etc.) was involved in this class and how much time I put in.Also, the little act between Jim MacBroom and Laura (Lauren?) the woman who periodically sat in on the class from his firm was incredibly annoying and detracted from learning. She would constantly interrupt him for no reason at all just to tell him an inside joke or make fun of him. Again, it was unclear why she was in the class.",
    "The content of the lectures, especially in the first half of the semester. Jim emphasized the history of river classification systems and hydrological modeling methods, wasting precious time on teaching us about old models which are no longer in use.",
    "some orgainzation or big picture guidance about where we are going and what we should be learning...",
    "Flow and relevance of the lectures. Slide printouts were not always helpful, often unreadable.",
    "The workload was pretty heavy compared to other classes, which i didn't expect. Plus, the assignments just felt like busy work - there wasn't much feedback from the TA, and I don't think the prof looked at anything. Also, it was a bit much to require a final exam, group paper, AND group presentation.",
    "-the feedback on the written assignments was not very clear.-also for some of the written assignments, it seemed that the purpose of the assignment was to provide a chance for creative problem solving, but I felt inadequately prepared to provide genuinely creative solutions. Talking with other students about this assignment, we felt that the assignments were set up in a way that they really only had one answer. I'm sure there are more answers, but it would have been useful to have more options presented before the assignments, or perhaps a presentation on how to research these options.-the software for the equations was not available on the FES computers and it was not compatible with students' mac computers. Also, the equation section was never clearly explained. It was just thrown out there, most of the students didn't really seem to get it, and then the equations were just forgotten about. I would have liked to come away from the class with a better understanding of how to use and apply these equations."
