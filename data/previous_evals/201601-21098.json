    "It is especially enlightening because it is one of the few CS electives where the project is so open-ended that you can use the experience to learn any framework or technology of your choice and the engineering principles associated with it. Super useful if you want to get really good at a particular framework!",
    "I would only recommend Software Engineering to another student if they come in with a team and a project planned out ahead of time. Keep in mind that the course lacks structure, and it will really be up to you to be disciplined (and in all likelihood, your team will not be as disciplined as you hope). It gets difficult to keep up the same motivation through the entire term, and it is also surprisingly difficult to schedule group meetings that involve 3+ people. Skip this class if you don't have an idea of a portfolio project.... you won't be getting much else out of it.",
    "ruzica cares, but seriously this class needs to be completely project based. class time should be used for groups to work on their projects, homework should be about the projects, tests should be replaced with project presentations. make this a project based class. so much time wasted on lectures, studying, and tests. every week should be a check up on groups, to present their latest work"
