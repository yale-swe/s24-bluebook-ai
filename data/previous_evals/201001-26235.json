    "Really valuable to have, but also kind of scattered. It gives you a baseline but isn't a venue for deeper learning or conversation. Great for networking and exposure to issues you didn't already know lots about.",
    "I enjoyed this lecture series. I felt that it was a great way to bring together nursing, public health, and medical students in a common forum to hear about global health issues. I think it should be continued in the future!",
    "I enjoyed hearing from most of the presenters - most of them were very informative and interesting to hear from. It's very nice to have a meeting place for students from all med campus departments who are interested in GH each week. And, of course, dinner is great for socializing.However, please start on time! People would show up later and later as the semester went on because they knew we would end up starting the presentation later and later. It is annoying to those who show up on time.",
    "strengths: there were some great speakers, the module was a fun way to learn a specific criteria.weaknesses: they always started late and they typically ran late.",
    "This is a very interesting seminar, and it brings together students from other professional schools. I think that it is important for students to interact with one another, and the exposure to international work and the high caliber speakers that visit make this an excellent course.",
    "The global health lecturer series was well thought out and covered a wide variety of topics. I enjoyed it.",
    "great variety of speakers\/topics, all pertinent and interesting. but i felt that few were really interested in having students approach them, as questions or present themselves as possible outlets for jobs\/internships.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. It is varied and interesting, though I feel as if it went slightly overkill on malaria this semester.",
    "Good seminar. lots of interesting speakers this semester."

    "I would recommend this seminar to all public health students interested in global health!",
    "Each week there is a presenter (usually from campus) that speaks on a GH issue. I would definitely take this class if you are interested in GH because you get a wide perspective on relevant issues and will learn a lot.",
    "This is a great way to learn about how public health\/ medical practices are being implemented abroad.",
    "This seminar is an introduction to medical\/public health work that is taking place internationally. Speakers come from Yale or from other institutions and present their work to students. I would definitely recommend this seminar to anyone interested in global health.",
    "This is a speaker-series covering a wide range of topics in current global health issues. It is an engaging way of spending the evening, and gives the opportunity for further discussion during dinner after the lecture.",
    "sit in a lecture, maybe get a chance to ask an interesting question over med students. great food",
    "A survey course about what global health has to offer straight from the mouths of global health experts.",
    "Good seminar series.recommended."
