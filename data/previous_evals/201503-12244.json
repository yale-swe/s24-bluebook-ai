    "Lecture-style class in seminar setting, but works because the professor is highly knowledgeable and insightful. Capped by three weeks of student presentations on their own topics of choice, and really great way to tie together everything done in the class and expand the scope of the topics covered. Final paper worth 100% grade apparently, so that's a consideration.",
    "Don't take this class if you're a premed. The biggest flaw about this class is we have no form of grading or feedback throughout the entirety of the semester. We have no way of knowing how well we're doing in class. I don't really understand this, because isn't feedback and criticism necessary for learning? When I turned in my final paper and as I'm writing this evaluation right now, I am very scared and nervous because I really could get anything from an A-C. It doesn't really make sense that for the final paper that basically defines our grade, we don't even have a chance to send in a draft. Other than that, the class is pretty chill. There are bursts of work that needs to be done - when you're leading the class discussion, and when you're giving your presentation on the final paper. I also appreciated it when prof Summers would bring us objects and books to show. He obviously knows a LOT about the field. If this class is interesting to you, you want a chill writing credit, and you're not too worried about grades, take it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you are interested in Chinese science at all, Professor Summers is great. The course itself is not difficult, but involves quite a bit of interesting reading and a final presentation\/essay.",
    "This is a good class to learn about Chinese medical science. If you are interested in the subject, I would recommend taking it. That being said, it is very selfdriven in both reading and participation.",
    "If you're looking for a class on Chinese medicine, this isn't it. It's mostly other topics."
