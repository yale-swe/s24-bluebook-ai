    "I would recommend Spanish 850 to another student because it provided the opportunity for an in-depth familiarity with el Inca Garcilaso's works.",
    "highly recommended",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to widen his or her knowledge regarding not only the literature of the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, but also about Latin American colonial literature and history.",
    "The close reading of el Inca Garcilaso de la Vega's works. I would recommend Spanish 850 to another student.",
    "I would certainly recommend Spanish 850 to another student. The course -- on the works of el Inca Garcilaso and on the literary and historical context in which these works were written -- is certainly challenging. The rewards are great, however, as one will gain an understanding of el Inca Garcilaso's work and, at the same, learn from Professor Adorno what is required to conduct scholarly research.",
    "Extraordinary opportunity for gaining a deep insight in the work and the life of a very important author. For those who were studying colonial literature, it is definitely a milestone course, but it is also highly recommendable for any literature student."

   "comments": [
    "I think that this course will be helpful for specialists and non-specialists alike. It introduced us to many important ideas surrounding el Inca Garcilaso, Renaissance humanism, the history of the book, literary analysis, etc., such that its pertinence extends beyond the works of a single writer.",
    "This course deepened by knowledge of colonial Latin American literature, specifically the works of el Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. This may or may not relate to my dissertation topic.",
    "This course helped me realize how important it is to read closely. Through my conversations with Professor Adorno, and in carrying out the final project, I believe I learned something important about how one goes about reading, developing a paper topic, and supporting one's opinions. I also feel I learned a lot about what it means to give clear presentations, as well as what is required if one wants to have the opportunity to have a successful career in this field. I expect that all of this will aid me in my dissertation and future research."
