    "The course is an overview of the trends in central banking around the world since 1900. Can't say I enjoyed being in class very much (Rakesh had a tendency both to put us to sleep and to sleep during student presentations, which was frustrating) but the readings and content of the lectures were excellent.",
    "yes",
    "Interesting overview of central banking and its changing contours. Technical and informative. Sometimes challenging, as banking tends to be. Definitely worth the effort.",
    "A great class. Take it if Mohan comes back to Yale in the future.",
    "Highly recommend for anyone interested in practical applications of economics and policymaking. Less economic theory than I expected and better for people more interested in political aspects as well."
