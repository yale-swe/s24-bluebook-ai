   "comments": [
    "Great to learn about practical research skills.",
    "Yes- I needed a half credit and it was a cool way to see what research is really like first-hand.",
    "Great course. Fun material. Fun professor. Fun class.",
    "Definitely. It's a great seminar, especially for people who are shy to participate at times.",
    "If you're looking for research experience, this is a great place to start. Get valuable experience, have fun, AND get class credit for it!",
    "Take this course. It's a great way to vary your schedule and gain some hands-on experience.",
    "course credit, light work load, great psychology and research experience, get to know professors\/grad students...if you're a psych major there is no excuse not to take research for credit!!",
    "In the overall scope of things, this seminar is actually really really reasonable. You're held accountable for showing up on time, understanding the lecture, taking the quiz, reading the articles, writing reaction papers, participating in discussions, and writing the final paper (give yourself more rather than less time in advance; you'll thank yourself later, trust me). But it's literally a seminar that goes at half the pace of her actual seminar. You learn about interesting things can are applicable to your everyday life. The Thursday 9 AM meeting time definitely wasn't ideal but 9:15 actually made it a good deal better. So all in all I don't really think I'd change a thing.",
    "Yes! This is a great chance to do some independent research or study. I accomplished a lot and am well positioned for my work next semester. Just make sure you have a clear understanding of the expectations and deadlines at the beginning of the semester. Overall, a great experience!",
    "I took Psyc 711: Child Development and Social Policy. I cannot speak highly enough of this lecture series. It is an incredible opportunity to hear experts from several disciplines (medicine, education, sociology, psychology, law, etc.) speak about various issues affecting children today. I set my own requirements: writing weekly response papers (mini research papers) instead of a massive final paper was the best decision I made. I learned a lot via the way I learn best.",
    "Great.",
    "This course was a great opportunity to see how research is actually conducted and become acquainted with the scientific process. I recommend it, if you are considering research as a career.",
    "I definitely would. It's a great way to gain research experience and it's fun too.",
    "It's a good class to take if you want to get some research experience in psych before your senior year. I'd recommend it to a psych major.",
    "Definitely take research topics if you're a junior hoping to get a head start on the senior requirement. This is especially important if you're planning on conducting a research experiment because there's a lot of paperwork and training that has to be done. It's also nice to become acquainted with everyone in the lab and your mentor.",
    "Not sure how reviews would show up for this class, but this is the half credit alternative to the Thinking class offered by Professor Ahn. Great overview of the topic and super chill. Weekly quiz that is done immediately in class after the lectures and weekly response questions. Final paper even involved a book review, which was a very interesting experience. Overall, great class and totally recommended.",
    "Definitely if you want a research experience and you can study independently."
