    "I enjoyed this class more than I expected to, to be honest. Lectures were a little dry but the labs themselves were fun! They often had us standing around waiting for automated procedures to finish but we got to use all sorts of cool equipment within Jan's labs. Plus the TAs were great. The lab reports, written with your lab partner, had a 15 page requirement which was a little unnecessary (definitely start those at least a week before they're due!) but there was always enough to write about, and there were only three to write. However, be warned that Jan, who is a very chill professor, is also very vague about deadlines and grading - it's usually worth asking explicitly about whether and when something is due, and good luck getting any idea how you're doing in the class grade-wise.",
    "The workload can be high for a half credit class, but it will definitely teach you how to write scientific papers. Most of the labs are not too hands-on as the equipment will be operated by the lab mentors, but the mentors are very helpful and resourceful. Professor Schroers is also very supportive throughout the report writing process.",
    "This is a really interesting course. Learning basic concepts in materials science and then applying them to explain experimental results. It's a very hands on course, and Prof. Schroers really emphasizes individual\/group attention. Be aware that you will be in the same group for the entire course, so be sure to choose wisely on the first lab.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course, but if you're reading this you probably have to take it for engineering anyway. It is not a lot of work overall, but there are three hefty lab reports. There is little new material you learn in this course. The labs build on top of each other and the theory is a bit repetitive. Some actual things you do are interesting, but a lot has to be done through the TAs. I felt like I was jumping through hoops a lot of the time.",
    "A good course to get a feeling for what it's like to do research in Mechanical Engineering. The lab sections are lead by graduate students and personally I didn't like these sections very much, but I know that others did. Prof. Jan Schroers did a good job teaching the material of the course and how to write scientific papers. Most of the work goes into writing 3-4 longer papers during the semester.",
    "You do 5 labs and 15-page lab reports in groups of 2 or 3 throughout the semester and then a final presentation with your group at the end. The labs are pretty straightforward and the TAs are extremely helpful. The one kind of frustrating part is that you don't get a single grade in the whole class, so it's kind of hard to tell where you stand.",
    "You're only reading this because it's a required class. You're going to take it anyways. It's a fine course (probably top 40% percentile for courses required for the major). Just pick good lab partners because you write reports in groups. Meaning that if one of your partners is functionally illiterate, you're all kind of screwed. Also, DO YOUR LAB REPORTS EARLY. Nothing sucks more than pulling an all-nighter to BS your way through one of these suckers.",
    "I found the course interesting and informative, and would recommend it to people who think they are interested in materials science. It is a little disorganized and there is basically no feedback on your grade, so if that stresses you be aware of that going in.",
    "This class is definitely infinitely more interesting than MENG 285. Even if you found 285 interesting, this class is better still, because you are actually implementing the stuff you learned, down to hands-on synthesis of brass. This class is really the best representative of work in the field of materials science. There are four lab reports of 15 pages and a final presentation. While 15 pages is long, the reports proved fairly easy to write once all the information was assembled on the page. The TAs and Jan are also very helpful, and generally really pleasant people. The only headache is the lax structure. Labs are generally due a number of weeks from when the lab was done, on the same day it was done. So groups who worked on their labs earlier in the week had them due earlier, but were still reliant on later groups for their data. As a Monday lab group member, I can say this was extremely frustrating, and forced me and my group to wait until the last minute to complete our report. Little things like that come up time and again because of the lack of overarching structure in this course.",
    "For my mechanical engineering majors out there: take this class. Very few required classes you have will ever be as chill or as hands-on as this class was. You meet once a week and overview a topic, with no homework. Then you have five labs, of which you write three total lab reports (the first one being an intro lab) and have a final presentation for one of them. The labs themselves are straightforward and reasonable to complete, and you actually get to work with the equipment in Schroers lab. I don't know who the TAs were this year, but Jittisa and Tent were absolutely great, telling us stories as we were waiting for data to process.",
    "MENG 286L was a really great lab course that taught students about writing scientific papers and giving presentations in the context of materials science. The course was helpful for presentation\/writing skills it helped develop. Awesome class to look forward to as a MechE major!",
    "A course where you learn to write 15 pg lab reports and about dislocation theory. There is a lecture component too. Should be 1 credit really",
    "MatSci Lab was an interesting class that got just enough things right to not be a bad class but too many things wrong to be truly excellent. The course material was interesting, and Jan was reasonable with the balance between lectures and labs given that the course was a half credit. That being said, the labs were anything but hands on - we were unable to use most of the equipment needed for the labs as the SEM's etc. required specialized training. The work for MatSci Lab consisted of three lab reports and an oral presentation. We received verbal feedback on the first lab report but received NO ACTUAL GRADES DURING THE DURATION OF THE SEMESTER. Prof. Schroers was too disorganized or busy to keep to his original schedule, and due dates were pushed back and often unclear. All in all, I would give this class a B-\/B"
