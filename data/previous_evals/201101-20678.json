    "By learning how to question the archaeological material for understanding consumptions variations in time, this course and the final paper has brought me awareness on small factors which I did not know of before taking this class.On my own site in Uzbekistan and Dunhuang, I hope to have a chance of using the starch grain analysis which would bring new knowledge to already well studied material. This class was for me a door to a new path and innovation in the field."
