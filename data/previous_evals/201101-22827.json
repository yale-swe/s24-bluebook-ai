    "TAKE IT!",
    "It is a dense course, and definitely would not recommend taking it without background in Archaeology, but so beneficial if you have.",
    "I would recommend Archaeological Theory if you are really interested in Archaeology (or a major in which case it is a requirement). It is pretty heavily focused on theory and philosophy, so I would not recommend the course if that does not appeal to you.",
    "Would not recommend!",
    "Don't take it if you're not a major...but if you are it's one of those classes where you look back and realized you learned a lot more than you thought at the time. No exams or papers but a lot of reading summaries and class presentations.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone else at all interested in archaeology, both for the theoretical foundations it provides (a great deal of which I didn't even realized existed as issues prior to this class) and even just to get a feel for the department (there's a lot of graduate students and it's taught by archaeology's awesome DUS Professor McIntosh). Other than that the general grounding in theory and philosophy of social science that it provides is still very valuable, but I imagine other students might want to find another class also giving them such a background but more tailored to their own interests."
