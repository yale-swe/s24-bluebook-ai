   "comments": [
    "Professor Faragher is wonderful. I would take this class again in a heartbeat - you get to work in the Beinecke and learn how to research for a history paper. You learn a lot about western history through the readings, which, although they can be a lot some weeks are generally interesting. I would suggest skimming for the main concepts. Don't be overwhelmed by them because you won't spend a ton of time on them in class. Take this class.",
    "Yes, it's really really hard but you learn how to write a long paper and do original research. Also you learn how to read long books efficiently. I feel like at the start when you are expected to both be reading 500 pg books every week AND progress in your research it is ridiculous but you end up figuring out a balance (and eventually stop reading the books and just work on your papers).",
    "This is a rewarding class, but be prepared to work. After this experience, I'm not intimidated by the prospect of writing the senior thesis. Our time in the Beinecke was awesome. We'd get to pass around valuable diaries, maps, printed advertisements, photographs, works of art--once even seeing a paper diorama of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. We got to know the collections at the Beinecke (and Manuscripts and Archives if your research took you there) well. George Miller came in and talked to us for multiple classes about the different materials we got to look at. He even gave us a look inside the Beinecke's collecting process. Prof. Faragher expects a lot, but gives structured expectations for your work. He believes in rewriting, so your final product will never just be word vomit, but a revised and coherent argument. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in history, American history, or the American West. Best class I've had at Yale thus far.",
    "You start the semester reading various histories of the American West to see how different historians tackle different problems, then by mid-October focus entirely on your own research and the process of writing a quality historical research paper of about 25 pages. By the end of the semester you should have a very strong paper under your belt that serves as great preparation for the senior essay. Incredible class. Absolutely recommended. Faragher provides terrific insights and leads the course effectively. Take it.",
    "Put in a lot of work throughout the semester, and hopefully in the end you have a paper that can either become a senior thesis or part of a larger project. It is good if you love doing your own research on top of having a regular class with readings and discussion.",
    "Take it if you are disciplined and are willing to work on the project early on even if you know that you will only have to turn it in the very last day of the semester. If you are interested at all in American history and like doing research, this is the perfect course to take.",
    "YES. TAKE IT. Faragher is brilliant and encouraging and helpful. Doing original research was fun, difficult and time consuming, but the most rewarding academic experience of my life. It's great preparation for the senior essay. The first seven weeks are reading about the American West and are held in Beinecke where you get to see related historic and rare documents at the start of each class. George Miles who presents those is brilliant. Then you focus on doing research for your paper for the next few weeks. You ultimately end up workshopping your rough drafts with a group of classmates which is tremendously helpful. Faragher comments on rough drafts too. Anyways, take it. It's a lot of work, but totally worth it and Faragher is a great professor.",
    "Yes, I would!",
    "One of Yale's best classes. Wonderful professor."
