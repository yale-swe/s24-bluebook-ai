   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially with Professor Yu-Wen. You have to take it for most majors anyways, and if you have a good professor it is a really good class.",
    "The subject matter of this class is pretty self-explanatory-- calculus with multiple variables\/ in multiple dimensions. The homework load is average for a math class, and some of the concepts are difficult. The class doesn't really get tough until the last three weeks. Definitely take the course with Yu-Wen Hsu, she is wonderful. She is extremely thoughtful and is always available at office hours or to answer qustions over email.",
    "take it.",
    "It's a Multivariable Calculus class...there's really not much more to say. I don't think it's particularly valuable in and of itself - take MATH 230, perhaps, if you really like Math and a rigorous, more than computational approach to Multi - but it's necessary to do a lot of higher math and math-related majors. Yu-Wen, Miki, and Igor are probably the professors you want to aim to have.",
    "Math 120, specifically that section taught by Yu-Wen Hsu, is a fairly basic coverage in topics of multivariable calculus, beginning with an introduction to vectors all the way through to the Divergence Theorem. This is definitely a class you'll need to take either if you plan to go into math, engineering, physics, and any other calculations-based science with some physical dimension. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "A grand overview of Multivariable Calculus. Quite challenging.",
    "MATH 120 is a very solid course and can (surprise) be pretty enjoyable. Take advantage of the problem sessions and do your psets not the night before, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be fine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a ton of work if you spend some time on it, and the concepts can be pretty cool, if not mindblowing. If you enjoyed single-variable calc, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like it.",
    "TAKE MATH 120. You will love calc and your teacher. It is a great course",
    "Math 120 is a difficult class but one I would definitely take if you like math. If you take this class, definitely take it with Professor Hsu.",
    "Math 120 can be a really rewarding class depending on how much effort you put into it. Several students seemed to have already taken an equivalent course before, so it was easy to fall behind and end up at the bottom half of the class. Because of this, several students would score perfect or close to perfect scores on exams and the curve would normally not be so generous. If you need this course in order to satisfy requirements for your major, there's no way out of it, but just be prepared to work hard to maintain a good grade.",
    "Math 120 is a great, natural next step following high school calculus. There is a lot to learn, but the great teaching and abundant resources (office hours especially) make the course doable. I definitely recommend this course to students interested in STEM.",
    "Math 120 is a pretty standard multivariable course. We basically learned everything that was in the book. I would recommend the class to those considering ENAS 151. My friends in 151 complained that the course moved too slowly and they were forced to learn a bunch of stuff at the very end, and that lectures were boring and pretty much useless. I found math 120 to have a consistent pace and I attended nearly every lecture because they were vital to understanding the problems.",
    "It's a standard lecture math class. It gets boring after a while, and you'll get drowsy in class because you'll be sleep-deprived and won't be able to follow what's going on sometimes. I recommend taking it as late in the morning as possible so you have enough time to wake up.",
    "If you have to take this class, take it with Yu-Wen Hsu. She is great at helping you understand what is going on in the class conceptually."
