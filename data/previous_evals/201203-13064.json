   "comments": [
    "If you are at all interested in pursuing global health research, this class is extremely helpful. Over the course of the you simply go through all the steps of the research process and writing a research proposal, so by the end you have a strong research project proposal.",
    "I would recommend any student interested in global health to take this course, even if they don't want to do a summer project, because I think it is important to think about the questions the course raises over ethics and real-world issues that any other academic class can't provide. Plus, you get to know the professor and TF well who are great resources and really care about your project being successful!",
    "Take this course if you are looking to develop your research skills. It's low-key, but you still come out in the end feeling like you got a lot accomplished.",
    "I would say that Global Affairs 323 is a fantastic course for anyone interested in actually doing public health research in the future. If you aren't interested in that this class will teach you a lot about how to design your own research project but it will most likely be a waste of you time. With that said, I absolutely LOVED this class. The professor is great, the textbooks are definitely ones you will want to keep and use again and again. Take this class if you have an interest.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's only once-a-week, but at the end you come out with a large research proposal and a better understanding of how research is carried out.",
    "I would recommend the class because not only do you learn usable research skills, but you come out with a very well developed research proposal that could be easily refined for funding.",
    "This class is great for anyone with limited global health research experience who is looking to delve into research proposal development and applying for IRB approval. The professor and TA genuinely care about helping students with their research proposals throughout the semester. However, grading expectations were not always made clear so assigned grades may have seemed arbitrary. The lectures were well organized and the guest speakers were awesome. Also you get as much from this class as you put in- it's easy to get away with not putting in lots of effort into your proposal but that will just hurt you later on if you plan to submit the proposal for fellowship applications and actually put it into action.",
    "This course will teach you the basic skills necessary for conducting your own research in global health, how to put together a research proposal, and the many ways one can conduct an experiment in order to study specific topics of interest. It is a very practical course and I highly recommend it for anyone who does not have a good working knowledge of these concepts. It will prepare you with good, solid, \"hard skills\" that will definitely help you in the future as you continue forward in your education and career. Professor Khoshnood has a lot of genuine field experience that he shares and that kind of learning is invaluable."
