    "ANTH 205 is an interesting course! As an anthropology major who focuses on medical anthropology, I wasn't totally sure if linguistic anthro would be for me. However, the class is really engaging--Professor Errington uses many case studies to illustrate his points. The beginning of the semester gives you a basis in linguistics. This can be a bit dry, but don't be turned off by it. In terms of workload, the weekly reading is very manageable and ties well to the lectures. There are 3 short (3-5 pages) papers. Prof Errington provides prompts, but I would recommend opting to come up with your own paper topic. His tend to be very moored to the readings and you're bound to be interested in something more peripheral. There is one final paper of 8-10 pages, for which you have to come up with your own topic. Overall a great course! Would recommend.",
    "If you're a non-anthro major looking for a good class that's not too much work at all, take this one! You learn a lot about how societal dynamics and all that good stuff impacts how we talk.",
    "This class is amazing. It's interesting, and the workload is very light. Readings that are engaging and help with understanding the material, but also are not critical to read every week religiously in order to succeed. Quick feedback on papers, Errington is a great lecturer, and the stuff is fascinating. Highly recommend.",
    "There's some interesting material, and there isn't a horrendous amount of writing, but the syllabus is very disorganized, and it's all out of date reading, and lectures consist of summarizing the reading, and there's way more reading assigned than one can feasibly do in a week given other classes and commitments (which I don't think is very skillful teaching).",
    "I definitely recommend this class! I took it for a So credit and I really enjoyed it. You'll learn a lot about language and come to look at it differently in your day to day life. Great course!",
    "ANTH 205 is an introduction to linguistics from an anthropological approach. If you are interested in linguistics, but find the idea of taking a class daunting, this class is intended for beginners. While section includes a good amount of discussion, the lectures themselves mostly consist of the professor clicking through slides of text while he explains specific studies and big concepts. If you are really interested in the material, this shouldn't bother you. However if you are not interested in the material, enjoy dynamic styles of teaching, or prefer lots of discussion, I recommend taking another class. The professor and the TA were very knowledgeable and interesting individuals, but it is important to understand the teaching style that fits you best when choosing classes here at Yale. Your grade in the class mostly depends on three short papers and one final paper, and you are encouraged to form your own prompts, which really does push you to think further as a student.",
    "This class covers really interesting material that applies to pretty much everyone's lives, because it'll probably explain why you talk the way that you do, or at least why you might think a certain way about how other people talk. I found myself bringing the material up frequently with my friends. That being said the lectures and readings often dive pretty deep into some drier linguistic topics, so be prepared to hear\/read a lot about tedious studies of things like glottal stops and tag questions. Most of the essays are pretty open to write what you want, but it was also kind of unclear how big the scope of the essays should be or what they were looking for from them. The grading is fair but definitely not generous. Overall this class would be worth it if you were interested in the subject but you'd need to actually care about the material to get something out of it.",
    "The course material is fascinating (how language works to index identity categories in different ways) but the execution of the course less so. The lectures can get very boring. The paper topics were enjoyable to think and write about, and they really make you engage with the readings.",
    "A class with not very much work, but relatively hard grading on the essays, it's a good 5th class if you're looking for something interesting but not super challenging. Three 3-5 page papers and one 8 page final paper is the entire workload. Fair amount of reading, but not necessary to do absolutely all of it. Interesting material, although at the end of the day, I felt like I didn't get a very deep understanding of linguistics or anthropology as the class bridges both fields and thereby gives a somewhat shallow understanding of each.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It is one of the best taught courses I have taken at Yale thus far. Not only that, but the subject matter is directly related to subjects very applicable to every day life. It is a course that genuinely made me change my thinking, and the kind of learning I was hoping to do when I came to Yale.",
    "I would recommend ANT 205 to other students -- the course readings are fascinating, and the material we cover on language should be relevant to almost everyone."
