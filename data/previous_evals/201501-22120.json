    "Taking a year-long independent study senior essay course is like running a Ponzi scheme you delude yourself and everyone around you into thinking everything is wonderful for most of the year and then it all comes crashing down around you in March when everybody realizes you have produced nothing of value. Then for March and April you have to hustle. Hustle like Jordan Belfast. Like Scarlett trying to keep her plantation home. Like whatever they were doing in American Hustle. This essay is all that stands between you and that god damn $%#! diploma. So you beat on, turning out words, sentences, even paragraphs until you realize your boat is going against the current of your own incompetency, borne ceaselessly back into the past. You are Gatsby and this paper is your green light. You gaze at it longingly in the cold dark New Haven nights, realizing too late that you will never reach it, success is only an illusion... So you go in for your weekly therapy sessions with Professor Connor - he thinks you're meeting with him to ask for help with your research but really you're just hoping for someone to tell you everything will be okay. It's kind of like that scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey where the cave-people find themselves face to face with a giant obscure monolith. You are the cave-people. He is the monolith. You have no idea what he is trying to communicate to you most of the time because it is just over your head. Still, he tries to convey his infinite wisdom to your lowly un-evolved undergraduate self. The meeting ends and you retreat back to your primitive cave in Bass Library trying to understand what it all meant. It's really less of an essay writing course and more a journey of self discovery. As for the process itself, it is very easy to go insane when writing a year-long thesis. You spend a lot of time by yourself walking in circles around the Escherian stairwell of film theory. What is the image? What is meaning? What is life? Etc. Sometimes it makes you just want to be like \"Burn it! Burn it all!\" Good thing there is a website called film school thesis generator dot com which will put random words like phenomenology, aesthetic and subversion into a coherent sentence for you - highly recommended. By the week that the paper is due, you no longer have the energy to spell-check. You take your accumulated store of bull**** to Tyco's in one last effort for redemption. They bind up the pages of your failure and call, \"Next, next in line!\" You are nothing but a cog in the academic machine of higher education. Judgement day comes. The film department offers you champagne and cupcakes but all you can taste is the difference between the essay you wish you had written and the final product you turned in. The war is over. But you are only a shell of the person you once were. You now measure your self worth in terms of word count. And every night you toss and turn - trapped in a dream where your life-sized thesis is chasing after you with a steak knife.",
    "Talk to your fellow thesis-writers! Commiseration helps."
