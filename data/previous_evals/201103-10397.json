   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend it to others. It was a good course. I learned a lot, and there wasn't a ton of work to do outside of class.",
    "It is a fast-moving, but comprehensive course. I would recommend it because I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "A lot of readings and practice problem sets to do like the other classes, but I would recommend this class to another student with this professor.",
    "You will learn some basics on bonding and coordination chemistry, then learn a lot about catalytic cycles with specific metal complexes, but not study specific mechanisms very often.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Chemistry 552 takes you from a basic understanding of inorganic chemistry to being able to predict and interpret the experiments of modern literature.",
    "The course is a tremendous foundation in organometallic chemistry. It starts out with a beautifully thorough coverage of the basics in electron counting for metals, ligand types, metal types, field splitting, etc. and moves on to apply these concepts to the many facets of the field. I felt that it was very comprehensive and yet not impossible to understand, which - given the breadth of the topic - was veryimpressive. So yes, I would certainly recommend the course.",
    "Great introduction to organometallic chemistry, Covers a wide range of content, but moves at a really fast pace. I would recommend the course for those interested in different applications of organometallic synthesis.",
    "Introduction of organometallic chemistry.Take the course if it is relavant to your research.",
    "It was a great course, useful not only to inorganic students but also to organic chemists interested in catalysis. I would definitely recommend it to another student."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me to better understand organometallic chemistry, which I had previously had no experience with. The way he phrased certain explanations made the topic much easier for me to understand. I had not had an excellent inorganic professor in college, so I was pleasantly surprised when I took this course.",
    "It definitely has encourage organometallic work, in my case. I enjoyed the course.",
    "Knowledge in organometallics is very relevant to synthetic organic chemistry where more and more reactions are based on transition metal complex. To be introduced to common organometallic reaction steps and mechanism provides me with a good background knowledge when reading current synthetic organic chemistry literatures.",
    "It is a bit too early to answer this question appropriately. It did, however, spark a great interest in the field. It has made me consider working on Organometallics as part of research.",
    "This course was especially helpful for understanding mechanisms and pathways in which organometallic reactions take place--will be very very useful for future research.",
    "My research will be in synthesis methodology and the knowledge about transition metal catalysts is crucial. This course provided the appropriate background and pointed me in the right directions for further reading."
