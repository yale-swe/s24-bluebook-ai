    "Absolutely. For students without prior knowledge, it will be a difficult but enjoyable course, while for those more versed in philosophy, and course material appeared to be equally challenging, although obviously on another knowledge of inquiry."

    "As it was my introductory course in philosophy, it helped me frame in my mind the nature and reason of philosophical discourse. Although the material covered, for the most part, authors that had written centuries ago, the course succeeded in framing such discourse within a contemporary context. Moreover, the structure of the course was such that it was both light-hearted at times, but also demanded critical thinking."
