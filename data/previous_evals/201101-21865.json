    "Take it if you want to learn techniques you will not have the chance to explore in almost any other lab at Yale, but know that you will have to invest a tremendous amount of time, diligence, and perseverance to reap anything worthwhile",
    "This is a very self-driven course- Barry and the TAs are supportive but no one will take the responsibility to check up on you throughout and make sure you're keeping up with the rest of the class. So make sure you're comfortable and ready to work independently if you want to do well. Keep in mind that this course is a lot of work too! There may not be weekly assignments, but the 30 page paper requires significant time and effort. You really get to know your organ's physiology and histology in great depth, which is a neat experience, but once again, requires lots of time and energy. The hours you put in outside of class are really necessary!",
    "Good, interesting course. Final project does take alot of time, so make sure you put in a couple extra hours a week starting at the beginning, and then it shouldn't be too bad.",
    "This course is fantastic, a really unique experience at Yale. It's a ton of work though and should most definitely be worth at least a full credit. Barry is very accessible and supportive throughout the process and sets reasonable deadlines so it's not a mad scramble at the end. If you take it, consider checking the majority of resources out of the library so you don't always have to do your work up Science Hill.",
    "A lab course that allows you to look at microscopic structures of key organs through electron microscopy. I would highly recommend this course to other students because it was a lot of fun. While the course can be frustrating due to its emphasis on technique, it teaches you how to identify different components of tissues and cells, which is something unique that you can't learn in other lab courses. The final paper is a pain, but otherwise the course does not involve too much work.",
    "One of the most valuable lab couses you can take. But it does require a lot of extra work.",
    "You are assigned an organ at the beginning of the semester and you work at your own speed to get the end result - 10 micrographs of the cells to turn into a 30 page paper and presentation. You go in a few hours extra each week to work. It's a great lab, but make sure not to wait until the last 2 weeks to get your pictures or you will have trouble getting them done on time.",
    "If you can't create 1-2 hours of extra time a week to go into lab for this class, dont bother. You won't finish the final project in time and you'll be stressed beyond belief."
