   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to improve my writing skills. I learned to structure my writing in a more efficient and effective way, and was able to become a more concise writer.",
    "I learned how to properly formulate an argument, how to perform excellent research, and how to find sources from the Yale Libraries.",
    "I never realized that the concept of the \"grotesque\" is much more complicated to define than first thought. The class succeeded in exploring the grotesque from a multitude of angles in order to get different interpretations of the concept that build off of each other. I learned a lot about human nature as well, as part of the grotesque is all about how we deal with the things that we don't understand. Good course to take if you need a writing credit.",
    "I learned how to conduct research, write efficiently, and revise a paper effectively.",
    "This class is much like a high school literature class, but it challenges us to a much greater degree. It helps you break free from your high school formulaic writing and forces you to structure your paper in the way that fits the topic.",
    "I gained better writing skills especially writing argumentative essays. I also learned how to read academic texts and understand a complex, abstract idea.",
    "I learned a lot about literary analysis, research, and how to write a well-structured and clear essay.",
    "I learned a lot about writing papers longer and more complicated than a 3 page, paragraph essay thats typical for high school. My organization improved a lot.",
    "I learned a lot about the subject (the Grotesque) in this English 114 class, and it not only defined and explored the topic, but also opened up a lot of avenues of future inquiry that I can pursue, which I appreciate. Skills: how to write well, how to do research and write a research paper, how to improve your writing. Professor Tazudeen showed us a lot of examples of good writing, demonstrated the skills and aspects of good writing, critiqued a student's paper in class and analyzed his own research paper, and left a lot of comments and good commentary on our submitted papers. Insights: how to think about a topic, how to go about researching and beginning a paper, how to write concisely and clearly.",
    "This course helped improve my strategies for writing, particularly over a text. I also feel I have both and better and worse understanding of the concept of the grotesque; better in that the class looked at the grotesque from many different angles, but worse because I now better understand how large and opaque of a concept the grotesque can be."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength of this course was that it allowed everyone to become engaged in discussion. One weakness was sometimes the material wasn't very interesting.",
    "The content in this course was very interesting (even though I had little background knowledge about the grotesque). I thoroughly enjoyed the readings, films, and musical pieces that we studied over the semester and was able to find a love for writing. It was hard to keep up with all the readings for homework on top of the four assignments (one 4-5 page essay, two 5-6 page essays, and one 8-10 page essay). There were rough draft versions of the essays that we turned in for feedback, but it took awhile for our professor to grade them because there were 13 of us and he was teaching another section of the same course as well.",
    "The course content is extremely interesting, and the instructor is very knowledgeable and is very good at explaining complicated concepts that are very hard to understand. However, some people in class obviously do not pay attention (i.e. actually having a side conversation at full volume, listening to music, visibly texting, etc), and it is distracting since it is a small seminar. Having the instructor actually do something about this would have been nice, since it happened every single day without repercussion.",
    "I loved this course so much. I thought the discussions were very valuable and insightful. To be frank, I wouldnt want to change anything about this class.",
    "The course is incredibly interesting, and the conversations are really enjoyable. We got to appreciate grotesque works through a different lens. The class is sometimes not what I expected as it's less focused on rhetoric, so adding that may be helpful.",
    "The strengths of the course are readings and the professor. Professor Tazudeen is clearly passionate about the subject and is excited to see what ideas his students bring to the table. He helps untangle sometimes complex concepts and provide clear feedback on returned work. The only weakness is that the beginning of the class can be a bit dry.",
    "This course had lots of strengths: great feedback, small class size, great teaching, interesting subject matter. Not a lot to criticize.",
    "Strengths: definitely the professor. Really good at what he teaches, and knows how to teach an intro English class mixed with the topic of discussion (the Grotesque). Another strength is the organization of the material. I enjoyed how we first explored the definitions of Grotesque and how the definitions have adapted over time, the history behind it, and it's influences on art. I liked how we read critical essays on it first in order for us to understand what the theory is, then read fiction, so we could relate the critical essays to the stories. The reading selections were well picked out and at a good level where we were able to understand it, but also challenge us. Another strength is the amount of workload. It's just right. Not too much, not too little. Weaknesses: aside from the fact that some people don't participate as much (i.e. didn't do the reading, but that'll always happen for any class) actually none. like seriously. Improvement: Professor Tazudeen, keep doing what you're doing!!"

   "comments": [
    "I would reccomend this course to other students because now I feel prepared to write essays in other classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to improve their writing and enjoys oddities and unusual things.",
    "Especially for a writing credit class, the workload wasn't bad. Prof Tazudeen is extremely kind and gives great feedback on essays. I would definitely recommend this course if you like spooky stuff and\/or need a writing credit.",
    "Yes I definitely would. I got to read and discuss pieces I never would have encountered otherwise.",
    "Take the course for a great and stress-free environment to discuss grotesque works that are funny, weird, and just really interesting. This class might not be for those who really want to intensely write, but it's great for the rest of us.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if they have an interest in the grotesque. It was one of my favorite courses this semester. The material is interesting and diverse, the professor is incredible, and I feel like my skills as a writer has improved since the beginning of the semester.",
    "Yes! In addition to readings, we also had music pieces, operas, and visual art pieces to analyze, and that made the class much more fun and engaging than a class that's based solely on readings.",
    "I would. Take 114 to become a better writer and take 114 from Tazudern bc hes the best.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course if you are both interested in this topic (even if you're not, try it out! It's truly a fascinating subject) and would like to take an English\/writing credit that is slightly easier and gives good feedback on essays and has a good learning process for writing."
