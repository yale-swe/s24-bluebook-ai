    "Prof. Leibbrandt was one of the best professors I've had at Yale. He is one of the most genuinely nice people I've ever met. He also did a great job blending the philosophical and the practical components of the class. Discussion was great, and I learned a lot. Too bad he isn't staying. Yale should bring him back in the future.",
    "Excellent class. Take it if you possibly can -- covers both some of the most important theoretical considerations of equity and the specific tools needed to assess and compare wellbeing.",
    "This class was great. An empirical and theoretical approach to poverty. Too bad you won't actually be able to take this class since Prof. Leibbrandt is only here for the term.",
    "This review is sort of moot, given that Prof. Leibbrandt is returning to the University of Cape Town after this semester, but here goes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This course, in its conception was cool. It was both applied and philosophical (maybe sort of EPE-ish, though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never taken one of those courses, so who knows; I bet that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an appropriate qualifier, yeah). Leibbrandt helps run the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) in South Africa, a longitudinal household survey in the vein of the PSID in the US. Panel data is awesome, because it allows you to track individuals and households across time, charting their income and welfare in absolute and relative terms across time. Most panel datasets are ugly, confusing, really utter messes. This became especially clear as I wrote my term paper. But NIDS is really a work of beauty. Anyway, back to my point. Leibbrandt conducted a number of sessions in the CSSSI StatLab using the NIDS data and this very useful set of STATA commands called DASP to show us how one actually goes about calculating all sorts of metrics employed by the poverty\/inequality literature and how to understand these metrics. These were bolstered by readings in Angus Deaton (1) and, my favorite, Gary Fields\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (2) books (Fields is, as Leibbrandt would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpretty nifty\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you should check it out if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at all interested). Beyond this very applied section, much ofthe course was structured as a discussion of Amartya Sen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cInequality Re-Examined\u00e2\u0080\u009d monograph. In this day and age Sen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capability approach and his consideration for the fundamental diversity of human beings is not so startling, but they are quite difficult to operationalize in any sort of analysis. Wrestling with that issue (or, more often, just being frustrated by it) along with my classmates was worthwhile, I think.Anyhow, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t babble further since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not likely you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to take a class with Leibbrandt (why are you even reading this review??). But do check out DASP and Fields. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worth it.(1) Angus Deaton (1997) The Analysis of Household Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy. The John Hopkins University Press.(2) Gary S. Fields (2001) Distribution and Development: A New Look at the Developing World. Boston: MIT Press.",
    "A good blend of applied economics and philosophy. Worth taking for a student interested in development economics.",
    "Wonderful course. Not much work, just do the readings and knowing how to use stata in advance will help big time. The term paper is not bad, you just need a good data set and then manipulate it the way you've been doing in class. Overall, great course and pretty interesting.",
    "I absolutely would recommend Measuring Well Being to any student interested in issues of poverty and development, especially if he\/she is interested in learning both the theory\/philosophy and practical data analysis skills.",
    "It is for anyone interested in the field of poverty and inequalities. Provides a sound foundation but required basic stata skills. You look at other research as well as produce a term paper which is highly fulfilling.I would strongly recommend it but with a warning of lots of course work"
