   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who is very interested in the subject. It is a lot of reading and leg work, but if you find the subject interesting, it is a very good class. I greatly enjoyed it, but I am a history buff.",
    "I would recommend it because it was fairly intersting and not a terrible amount of work",
    "It was a study of the exploration methods of various societies. But more specifically it was a study of the definitions of words and how different people define things differently.I would not recommend it to another student because there are better writing and history classes and it was just not that interesting.",
    "Lots of fun discussion if you have intrest in the subject. This is also not even close to a typical history course... There are no tests and if you really want you don't have to do the complete readings (though that makes class talks more interesting if you do)",
    "I think this course is very helpful to an incoming Freshman in their first semester at Yale. Professor Hansen really cares about improving her students writing and analytical skills an was always eager to help. Sometimes the course material was not that interesting, but I think the class was worth it for the other opportunities it offered.",
    "Only take this class if you're really interested in history. This isn't your typical \"high school course\" that only requires you to memorize facts. In this class, you draw your own facts based on readings, mostly primary resources. This class however did fulfill a writing credit, so if that's what you're aiming at, take this class. The writings are few and are actually pretty interesting.",
    "This class is of an interesting format. People who don't like structure and are ready for a break from traditional history class will really like this class. It's a lot of reading and the debates are kind of fun, and the material is interesting.",
    "I would recommend Valerie Hansen's freshman seminar to a fellow student. I don't think that she will repeat this exact topic again, which is probably good thing beause the topic ran out of steam toward the end. But overall, it was a worthwhile class--different from high school history classes. Hansen encourages you to think critically and be specific with your sources, taking nothing for granted. Also, this class was a good introduction to history writing at Yale.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. The grading is generous and there is not too much work required. At the same time you learn about history that is very interesting and you probably would not have known about before this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. We read a variety of interesting books and received tough, but very useful guidance on our writing. My view of history changed. I recommend this with the caveat to not take it if you're not interested in history; I know two people in this class who don't really care about questions of historical fact and how history is written, and they did not have a great time in the class. Finally, though this should be obvious, you'll get little out of this class unless you do the readings. There's a variety and they can be tough, but it's good preparation for your Yale career."
