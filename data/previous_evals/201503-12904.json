   "comments": [
    "Learning and Memory is a fantastic course in the psych department, especially for those who are interested in the intersection between psychology and neurobiology. The course has a lot of material, but it is made manageable by being split up into three non-cumulative midterms without a final exam. Each chapter in the textbook (and corresponding lecture) is split up into sections about behavioral processes, underlying neurobiological substrates of those processes, and perspectives from neurology and psychiatry that have to do with deficits to those processes. Professor Brown is a great guy who is extremely knowledgeable about the material, having spent his career understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of memory systems. He's able to provide his own perspectives on many of the topics, which is enlightening and also allows students to understand the controversies behind many psychological theories. I highly recommend this course to people in the neuroscience track of the psych major especially, as there really aren't too many other courses that do as good of a job integrating behavioral and brain information together. I also took the class alongside Neurobiology (MCDB 320) and found a surprisingly nice amount of overlap in some of the material covered. One last thing to note, however, is that the class is capped at around 20 students. This is nice, as it allows for lectures to be broken up by a few lab sessions. However, there is an application at the beginning of the year, so if you are shopping the class, make sure to fill out your \"student interest form\" on classes v2 before the first day of class. If you don't get in on that first day but still really want to take the course, stick around a few classes and there's a good chance you can get in.",
    "Beware, this is a class to take after Human Brain or working substantively in a neuro lab, or the first 2\/3 of the class will swallow you whole and you will struggle to keep up with the whiz kids who already know neuro well. Professor Brown is the sweetest professor at Yale (his wife brings cookies every week and he walks you through sample questions to make sure you're ready). Sometimes it was hard to stay awake post-lunch and Prof. Brown talks quietly, but the sheer pace of the course will probably keep you alert as you take notes. Overall recommend, but don't fuck around, or you'll get burned on the 3 midterms.",
    "Psychology and neuroscience approach to the various memory systems. Not so much work from the week to week, but the three midterms were all fairly challenging and had some tricky questions. Professor Brown goes pretty quickly in class sometimes, but is always willing to clarify questions or review with you. He also always brings cookies that his wife makes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is challenging and a lot of memorization, but I would say it is definitely worth it.",
    "The course was a nice overview of the different features of learning and memory, although a lot of it overlaps with the information that you get in The Human Brain. You do go into more depth about neural theories and bases of memory, and more specific details about learning theories, but some of the more fascinating case examples might have their thunder taken by your earlier coursework if you've taken neuro classes before. Overall, Professor Brown creates a great environment for learning, and you look at a lot of interesting and fun material that's more peripheral to the coursework, like discussions of free will, memory as portrayed in movies, and some behavioral economics. The biology prereq definitely isnt necessary.",
    "Overall, the course content was pretty interesting. Sometimes the class could feel a bit disorganized, but if you go through the slides on your own a bit and try to synthesize information there really is a well defined structure to the class. The workload is very manageable (3 exams and only a few PSETs that can be completed easily by paying attention in class and\/or reading through lecture material) if you are able to learn material from PowerPoint slides and then retain it. There are also review sessions that TA hosts to help you with anything you find confusing and you can always email any questions you have. The professor is also very helpful throughout the course so don't hesitate to reach out! I would recommend this class to someone who is looking to take a fairly manageable class and PowerPoint learning is something you are comfortable with.",
    "An overview of the psychology and some neuroscience of learning and memory, including kinds of conditioning (i.e. classical, operant), types of memory, and functional anatomy.",
    "This course is a wonderfully straightforward survey of memory & learning. It follows the structure of Gluck quite faithfully, although the lecture notes are king. It is somewhat heavy on memorization, but make Anki flashcards after every lecture and you'll be fine. Prof. Brown is wonderful; you should take this class just to stay behind and talk to him.",
    "Yes, Psyc 376 is a wonderful course to take here. That being said, any student taking it should expect a lot of rote memorization. The material memorized is pretty interesting and the tests given were all fair.",
    "Absolutely take if you have any interest in neuroscience\/learning\/memory at all. So good.",
    "Unsurprisingly I guess, this class involves a TON of learning and memorizing come test-time. It's kind of fun to try to use the things you learn about memory in the class to help study all of the information...but sometimes it's just a LOT of information. None of it is too conceptually difficult thoughespecially if you've taken a class like the Human Brain before. And Professor Brown is also really kind and helpful during tests, which he regards as \"learning trials\".",
    "My expectations were much higher for this course. Thomas Brown is an absolutely wonderful person, who does not make this course all about the grades. I do not think it is hard to get a good grade in this class. However, I wanted this course to excite me about learning and memory, which it did not. Brown followed the textbook with his powerpoint slides and the exams were heavily based on how much you could remember someone or something's name. If you want a course where the exams are not super hard and you get very little homework, this is the class. But take it at your own risk, because the course material can be a lot and is not always explained clearly.",
    "It's a good course. You learn a lot, in nice detail, and Professor Tom Brown is awesome as a teacher and as a person and really knows what he's talking about. He also cares a lot and likes to see everybody succeed in his class, regardless of background. He's the type of Professor that you try to do well for and make proud. Something of interest is that it's actually easier than The Human Brain, even though it has a higher number. You learn from the lecture slides and the textbook.",
    "Great class about an interesting topic; course requires a good bit of studying to capture some of the details included on the exams; certainly an ideal opportunity to Credit\/D\/Fail (you'll find yourself reading just as much on this subject either way given how engaging it can be); Professor Brown is keenly knowledgeable on the subject matter given that this is very much one of his areas of research expertise (and as a result, is willing to call out some of the limitations or inaccuracies that may be found in the textbook, which is always fun and informative to hear)",
    "I'd recommend it - it can often be memorization heavy though, but you learn a lot about the brain substrates behind memory and learning systems."
