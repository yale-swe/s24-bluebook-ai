   "comments": [
    "This module in the BIOL sequence was more broad than the others, and I was able to step back from molecular details and see a bigger picture.",
    "I learned about phylogenetic trees and hardy-weinberg equilibrium as well as much about ecology and evolutionary biology.",
    "I learned to look at biodiversity around me differently.",
    "A previously untouched side of a generally well-covered subject",
    "Learned about evolution, ecology, and plants.",
    "I learned a lot about ecology and evolution, and I gained a lot of confidence in my ability to do science.",
    "More than i would have liked to know about ecology.",
    "You learn a lot about evolution and ecology and the biological history of the world (as the title of the course says), but you also get really comfortable consuming and understanding academic papers.",
    "Learned a lot about evolution!",
    "The basic concepts of evolutionary biology and how that has led our world to the state that it is in today.",
    "Knowledge about natural selection and theories of evolution",
    "I learned a lot about evolution and ecology. What I really enjoyed about this class was that Professor Donoghue didn't only focus on topics that I learned in other biology courses I took in high school, but instead talked about other interesting topics like secondary chemistry, which I'd never learned about before. I learned a lot about different topics in evolutionary biology and ecology that were new, which I wasn't expecting from an intro class on this topic.",
    "Learned a lot about evolutionary history and phylogenies.",
    "I learned a lot about phylogenetic relationships, particularly that of plants, animals, and mammals.",
    "Good intro to ecology and evolutionary bio. Nothing's too difficult to understand, and the exams are fairly memorization heavy.",
    "Some ecology, I guess",
    "I learned a much deeper understanding of the mechanisms of evolution.",
    "I learned about ecological principles and the basic idea of how life has evolved.",
    "I started to develop a basis of understanding in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. My understanding of the evolutionary\/phylogenetic relationships among animals and plants, and how they interact in today's environments, improved - as well as my understanding of how these fields relate. It's less problem-based and more fact-based than the other bio modules, so returning to the system of memorization was a good learning exercise. I also appreciated that this was the last module in the course, because it did shed light onto how all the other content was related.",
    "I learned that the intro Biology sequence doesn't have to be terrible (this module was by far the best of the four).",
    "This course made me appreciate evolutionary biology and ecology more so than I had before, and Dr. Donoghue was very engaging when explaining concepts. I gained a good amount of knowledge expected from an introductory half-term course, perhaps more than I had expected.",
    "I learned some key overarching topics and concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. I now know a bare-bones history of the Earth (from the viewpoint of the development and evolution of life) and a few current representative topics in ecology and evolutionary biology (i.e. species interactions, tropical rainforests, etc.). I also developed some skills in reconstructing phylogenies.",
    "This course definitely gave me a new appreciation for the links between evolution and ecology. I also found that the papers that we read in this module fit very well with the material that we covered in lecture, and the final research paper was good practice for researching scientific literature.",
    "Bio 104 was a great introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology, touching briefly on topics such as (but not limited to) plant evolution, major periods of biological disaster or change in Earth's history, movement of organisms onto land and the accompanying necessary adaptations, mammal and bird evolution, species-specific interactions, predator\/prey adaptations, and sexual selection. This course is by far the best of the intro bio sequence, in my opinion - the material was interesting, presented in a manner that wasn't unnecessarily difficult to comprehend, and taught by a professor who genuinely cared about students' understanding and learning.",
    "I learnt a lot about the tree of life and it was very interesting.",
    "I learnt to engage with scientific concepts and apply them to modern day situations.",
    "How to write a research paper",
    "I learnt concepts about evolution and ecology that I believe serve as great foundations for my EEB major.",
    "I learned a lot of really valuable and interesting things regarding ecology and evolutionary biology. I found this class to be incredibly interesting and engaging!",
    "I learned more about ecology and evolution, and the study of them.",
    "A knowledge of key evolutionary processes and examples in nature that support them.",
    "This was a new area of biology for me, and almost all of it was new. I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot of new content regarding evolution that occurred both in the past, and is still occurring now.",
    "I learned a lot about overarching concepts in biology such as evolution. I also learned about the history of the Earth over the last billion years with regards to life.",
    "I learned about many different organisms and the history of the earth. Essentially, it was ecology, evolution, and biodiversity.",
    "The course offers a consideration of many principles of ecology and evolution while simultaneously enabling students to discuss literature as scientists.",
    "I learned a lot about how many things in our world came about!",
    "Basic understanding of topics in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, especially of phylogeny.",
    "I learned a lot about early organisms on Earth and about ecology. Donaghue is super passionate about his field and always spice things up with examples and personal anecdotes.",
    "I learned a whole lot about ecology and evolutionary biology, and lots about phylogenetic trees.",
    "I learned how to understand biology from an evolutionary perspective and relate it to interesting issues such as health and disease. I also gained a deeper appreciation for nature and the world we live in.",
    "I learned a lot about evolution and ecology through attending lectures, reading scientific journals, and doing independent research that culminated in a paper. Approaching biology from a very different angle than I did in the previous three modules, I think I now better appreciate the ways that the same ways scientists think are applicable across a much broader variety of disciplines.",
    "I learned a lot about general evolution trends supplemented with specific examples.",
    "I learned about evolution and a lot of ecology and history about phylogenies. I think this is the best taught of all the 3 modules, and I felt that Prof. Donoghue is a great lecturer who knows what he's talking about. I never fell asleep in his class.",
    "Through writing the review and research paper toward the end of the course, this was a skill that I gained because in this module, we were not just learning from problem sets. It was refreshing because the insight of being able to gather our own primary resources and create a paper from these was different than any other homework we had done in the other biology modules.",
    "Lot of specific knowledge about ecology, evolution, and the history of life on Earth. Difficult to remember but I found it fascinating to learn. Beyond this, broader skills about interpreting scientific data and analyzing papers, as with all of the introductory biology modules.",
    "I learned a lot about phylogeny and Harvey-Weinstein equilibrium. Also about evolution and how different organisms are related to each other and when they developed certain traits. and also plants",
    "Greater understanding of evolution and ecological forces at play in our world.",
    "Became better scientific thinker"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was a lovely class that was very interesting, but like all the other biology modules, it could have been shorter.",
    "Strong, straightforward course. Donoghue makes clear what you need to know and the material is relatively interesting.",
    "I think the strength of this weakness comes in that it comes after 102 and 103 which are widely disliked. I personally don't like ecology and evolutionary biology, but after taking 102 and 103, anything could've been better. One of the weaknesses of the course is that tests rely on a lot of rote memorization. This could be a good or bad thing for your grade, but I think it's not as good for actual learning.",
    "BEST AnD ONLY GOOD COURSE IN THE BIO SEQUENCE",
    "The lectures were incredible -- always ended promptly and were very engaging and understandable. Wish there was more structure for the final paper because it feels as though we're on our own.",
    "I hope that there would be more texts in the lectures, but overall a great course.",
    "the psets, reading assignments, and essay prompts were fair and interesting. additionally, the tours of marsh\/peabody were very special and memorable!",
    "This is by far the best bio sequence- probably entirely due to Prof. Donaghue being so great.",
    "I enjoyed taking this course there was nothing that I thought needed improving.",
    "I thought lectures were pretty interesting, but I didn't really enjoy reading the papers for section. I didn't think they really contributed to my learning. The final paper and reading response also weren't very beneficial either because they took up a lot of time, and while reading about the topics were interesting, I don't think I gained any useful information.",
    "I found the lectures very engaging. I think Prof. Donoghue did a good job of making the information accessible and asking good questions. I think the course was very organized. Regarding the Review Paper Assignment, I think more direction was needed to guide the students more. Most of the students had no experience with writing a review paper and had a lot of difficulties with the assignment.",
    "Professor Donoghue is amazing. The class is well organized.",
    "This course was definitely the best module in the intro bio sequence! The material was interesting and both the professor and TAs made a big effort to incorporate the material into larger biological themes.",
    "The course is very well-taught. I learned a lot, and I enjoyed what I learned. Also, those stretch breaks are godsend. One weakness though is the papers. They are incredibly boring.",
    "More feedback from the TAs about writing assignments earlier in the semester would be helpful. Maybe having a draft of the paper due a week before reading period would help, because as it was I received essentially no feedback about the direction of the paper.",
    "The weaknesses of BIOL 104 are unfortunately similar to those of the intro bio sequence as a whole: these classes are consistently overly enrolled, poorly taught, and generally dissatisfying even for prospective biological sciences majors.",
    "Very interesting material and well-taught. I think the grading and exam system is a bit stale, but that's just how intro courses are.",
    "it was so so dry. lectures were not engaging and material on exam was specific and did not cover main ideas of course",
    "I really enjoyed the teaching style (clear, organized, and well-paced) and thought that the material was quite interesting. Some topics, however, I do feel were glossed over in class. It would be nice to spend 5-10 minutes in section going over these topics instead of the papers, which were not helpful to me anyways.",
    "Strengths: excellent teaching, fair psets and exams, engaging discussion sections Weaknesses: little guidance was given for a paper worth 15% of our grade, unclear expectations for that paper",
    "The material is very thorough without being tedious, which allowed for a great understanding. It could be improved by fewer but stronger examples of each concept.",
    "Professor Donahue is a fantastic lecturer.",
    "I like that the course. It was more memorization heavy than the other modules but the concepts were reasonable and the material was super interesting. Donoghue did a great job in lecture and in the review sessions. I didn't feel like a learned a ton from the paper but it also was not a huge amount of work.",
    "Professor Donoghue is excited and invested in helping students understand the material, which is great - that said, sometimes lectures could drag on a little without really engaging the students. I think more of the turn-and-discuss, problem-based activities that were featured more in other modules are a good way to maintain students' attention. Additionally, having problem sets that directly relate to course material\/reinforce concepts is great, but I would have appreciated it if they covered a broader range of class material, because it does force you to go back through the slides.",
    "This course was planned and executed very efficiently, from lectures to the botanical garden tour. One weakness--which perhaps is small--is that Dr. Donoghue did not get through an entire lecture within the timeframe, which pushed back the course material slightly (although we got through everything in the end). It may be better to cut down on the material per lecture to ensure all material is covered per class in order to prevent confusion on each class's material. However, this was only a slight problem and did not detract from overall learning.",
    "Strengths: very well taught (Prof. Donoghue is an engaging, clear lecturer), well organized, fair in testing, cool material Weaknesses: confusing in the instructions given for certain assignments, mostly pertaining to the 5 page paper Please give clearer instructions for the 5 page paper! The explanation on Piazza was much better.",
    "I like many of the decisions that this course makes over the other intro bio modules, such as the implementation of two exams rather than weekly quizzes. The lectures are always well taught and have very interesting material, and I must commend their clarity. I do sometimes wonder if this course could or should be a bit more difficult, but perhaps I am in the minority there.",
    "Bio 104 exams are very fair in that they only cover material talked about in class, but they're highly in-depth, so definitely study everything (including timelines, species-specific information, phylogenies) for the midterm and final. The final paper is also worth a good quarter of your grade, so don't let it sneak up on you. It takes some time to research and do the heavy reading necessary to put together your sources, so plan ahead!",
    "Strengths; no quizzes, the p sets, the professor, the material. weaknesses; the paper- very stressful.",
    "The weakness of this class is that the tests are memory based. I did not do well on exams because i have a bad memory for purely remembrance of figures and specific information.",
    "This course is extremely well organized, well taught, and graded very fairly. I wish that all of the biology modules were modeled after this course.",
    "Best taught bio course by far. Without a question this was the most comprehensible and thoughtful layout of teaching, from stretch breaks to field trips it was well done.",
    "This module is really the best by far of the intro sequence. Prof. Donoghue is an extremely interesting lecturer and kind professor. I especially enjoyed examples highlighting the diversity of life on Earth and the species with really cool evolutionary adaptations we talked about. I also enjoyed writing the paper and the Peabody tour. I didn't think the papers we read were that interesting though, and the tests were pretty tough and sometimes a little harshly graded by the TAs (I had to ask for a re-grade). I didn't think all the questions on the tests had been emphasized during lecture.",
    "Professor Donoghue is highly involved in his work, enjoys providing lectures, and speaks clearly\/effectively. There are really no weaknesses to BIOL104 other than maybe the fact that the lectures are long.",
    "The lectures are straightforward and the Piazza answers provide lots of clarity. The sections were interesting but the papers were sometimes difficult to understand.",
    "Best module..",
    "The course is well taught and very interesting. A lot of student consideration is put into the lecture.",
    "Great course, no weaknesses except maybe the amount students need to memorize can be overwhelming at times.",
    "Strengths: Great curruculum, very well laid out, very interesting lectures, well written tests Weakenesses: Often required more memorization than deep understanding, I would have gotten more out of the class had it been slightly harder. I would have preferred slightly more depth and a but less of a wide breath",
    "Sometimes the lectures seemed too broad",
    "The course is pure memorization to a ridiculous extent. Which is fine, but the problem sets had NOTHING to do with the exams and were incredibly misleading. Otherwise really interesting!",
    "The course was well taught and engaging and I enjoyed it.",
    "The lectures were, for the most part, very engaging and fun. Section was usually informative even if sometimes the papers assigned didn't seem to have enough to talk about for the full fifty minutes. The week we went on Peabody\/Marsh Garden tours was such a highlight. The exams were reasonable but tended towards more memorization than could be considered totally fair, and I didn't feel like there was a ton of direction for the final paper, so I know a lot of people who felt very lost. On the flip side, the grading was quite generous, so those concerns balanced out.",
    "The course as a whole was well done.",
    "I learned about evolution and a lot of ecology and history about phylogenies. I think this is the best taught of all the 3 modules, and I felt that Prof. Donoghue is a great lecturer who knows what he's talking about. I never fell asleep in his class.",
    "It's taught very well, the slides are easily followed and the professor's lecturing walked us through the material.",
    "Strengths: Various processes, like natural selection, were depicted with interesting examples which made the content engaging to the student. Also it was a great break out from class to do the tours which showed how the content was applicable to the ecological history of the world. Weakness: Would like to see more information on the slides than pictures.",
    "The biggest strength is that this course is interesting and engaging, which unfortunately cannot be said of the other introductory biology modules. I am unlikely to use most of this information in my later work but was rarely, if ever, bored in class. I thought the assignment to write a five-page paper on evolution and human affairs was valuable, as it allowed us to apply principles we had learned in class to a topic of our choice. The major downside is the amount of memorization required to do well on the tests in this very fact-heavy course.",
    "Personally, I just wasn't really that interested in this material. But I think the course is pretty strong. Donoghue is great and he makes the course not too stressful with extra assignments. The PSETs are definitely doable with the info we learn in class so that's good. Section was a definite weakness. I thought it was totally unecessary and did not learn anything. Please take out section for this course.",
    "Great instructor and TA's, great setup of course and lectures.",
    "The range of examples was strong in the course, not many weaknesses but maybe more time spent stressing the connections between the different branches of the phylogenetic tree would help."

    "Interesting class for those interested in the bigger picture of biology, but not extraordinarily challenging or rewarding.",
    "I would not only because you have to take 101-103 to get here - if you could just take 104 by itself, then I would say yes!",
    "I mean 104 is a prereq for some majors because its part of the intro bio sequence but the only people who seem to find it interesting are potential EEB majors. However, even though I want to major in MCDB, I thought the material was pretty interesting and that it gave a good degree of perspective on the scale of life.",
    "I would not recommend the bio intro sequence to anyone who doesn't require it for their major or for pre-med.",
    "BIOL 104 with Donoghue is literally one of the most enjoyable experiences you can have at Yale! The man is brilliant and knows how to teach and talk to students, and I looked forward to each and every lecture. The BIOL module is notorious for being unorganized and poorly taught, but Donoghue's class is anything but that. The workload is very manageable. There are no weekly assignments; homework consists of only a few writing assignments. Gone are the weekly quizzes, replaced by a single midterm and the final. Sections are graded only on attendance\/participation. Donoghue's specialty is plants, and I'm sure that he got many students interested in learning more about them!",
    "ONLY GOOD CLASS IN THE BIO SEQUENCE TBH",
    "Best part of the intro biology sequence. Would absolutely recommend.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, this is a great class! It just sucks that you have to go through Bio 101-103 to get to this class!",
    "Id recommend this class because you learn a lot of interesting material in a well-structured, well-thought-out format. Plus some of the pictures of species are just amazing!",
    "Only if incredibly interested in ecology or if you must take it as a prereq",
    "Good class, not too much work, Professor D is great, really enthusiastic, and keeps you interested during lecture.",
    "Yes if you're premed you have to but other than that it's like eh",
    "This is the best segment of the biology sequence. It is an incredible class and what I hope my other biology classes here at Yale are like.",
    "I would, it's a solid introductory class to concepts of evolution.",
    "I would definitely recommend Professor Donoghue's section to another student. I am not personally really interested in evolutionary biology, and I only took the introductory biology sequence because it is part of my major (and I'm pre-med). However, I think Professor Donoghue was really clear about what he expected from students and explained everything well (which is a big difference from most of the other professors in the intro bio sequence).",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Best bio course I've taken thus far.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. If you made it through the trials and tribulations of Biol 101-103, you deserve to take this course. It is great. There are no tricks. You will enjoy this.",
    "104 with Donoghue is definitely the way to go - guy's an engaging lecturer and the class is well structured. TAs don't actually help with the paper all that much, but it's also a very reasonable assignment in the first place. Final is worth more than the midterm, but is just as long.",
    "yes.",
    "Absolutely not. BIOL 101-104 was honestly a complete waste of time and energy for me -- and I came to Yale to do science. I was thoroughly disillusioned by the lack of effort and generally poor quality of these classes -- biology is fascinating stuff, and these classes managed to make it miserable. Thankfully the higher-level MCDB classes (I took MCDB 200 this semester as well) are much better taught and more interesting. Would wholeheartedly recommend upper-level bio classes. Not BIOL 104.",
    "Yes. Prof. Donaghue is a great lecturer. I learned a lot in this course.",
    "no. unless it is required",
    "Take it! Professor Donoghue is wonderful and will make you love evolution and ecology. This is the light at the end of the miserable tunnel that is the intro bio sequence.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as it was my favorite and most beneficial to my learning of the biology modules.",
    "Biol 104 is a great course because professor Donahue is so fantastic. A nice breath of fresh air after some of the other modules.",
    "Yes! It's definitely interesting material and of all the bio modules, it is the least stressful.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who need to gain an understanding of the ecology and evolutionary biology fields - Prof Donoghue gives a really good basis for the information that's needed for further study.",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory course to ecology and evolutionary biology. However, I would not expect anyone to take this class (BIOL 101-104) unless as a pre-requisite. If someone is interested in the topic, I think there are other courses designed as a true introductory course to the subject that is a full term.",
    "BIOL 104 is a great intro science class! It's well taught and Prof. Donoghue is fun to listen to. I personally liked the material (some may have found it boring), and it is much more digestible than the BIOL 103 material. It's a huge improvement from BIOL 103, which was a nightmare. If students could just take BIOL 104 without 103, I would 100% recommend it. Beware of the 5 page paper - it sneaks up on you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to course to another student, not that the student really has a choice in the matter. Definitely, this course is well-taught and clear, which are always desirable criteria in an introductory science course. I cannot recommend Professor Donoghue more highly for this class: he does an excellent job making the material interesting and engaging.",
    "Chances are you're taking this class because you need to finish the intro bio sequence for your major or premedical studies. With that being said, I thought Bio 104 was the best part of the sequence, and I actually really enjoyed Professor Donoghue's teaching. He keeps class engaging and often stops to make sure we understand what's going on. All in all, a solid and worthwhile class.",
    "Yes by far the best of the bio intro sequence.",
    "Yes it is mandatory for a alot of Stem majors.",
    "yes",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone if they were able to take it on its own. It was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides a really strong foundation in evolutionary biology and ecology, which is truly important for anyone wanting to study biology or go to medical school.",
    "It's a bio requirement. If you don't intend to major in anything requiring it probably not.",
    "This is the best module of the intro sequence!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. This was definitely the best of the into biology sequence at Yale.",
    "To me, the material taught in this course was the most interesting out of the four courses in the sequence, but I have heard that I am an outlier with regards to this opinion.",
    "Yes. It is taught well and the information is extremely interesting.",
    "Chances are, you have to take it.",
    "The course is fun and engaging.",
    "YES! Biol 104 was such a relief after taking 103. The professor is so kind and amazing and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "Definitely would recommend taking it with Donoghue. Not always the most challenging material, but a very interesting class. Such a blessing after 103.",
    "I would highly recommend this course; ecology is an important portion of any biology background yet often under appreciated.",
    "Best class in the sequence, 10\/10. Donoghue is great",
    "It is an interesting course that helps complete the bio sequence",
    "The course was very good and I would recommend it. The material was very interesting and well taught.",
    "This course is such a nice breath of fresh air at the end of the intro bio sequence. Professor Donoghue is such an adorable guy and really cares about the subject matter. For the most part, his lectures are fun (and he always has a stretch break which is cute), though sometimes it was hard to stay engaged. The exams are not too hard, but be ready to memorize a fair amount of rote information, which is quite different from the other three modules. The grading on the written assignments is quite lenient, and the two psets at the beginning of the module are very reasonable. Overall, this course was much needed after a rough experience in 103.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are generally very interested in evolution.",
    "It's the easiest module in the bio sequence, in my opinion. I didn't particularly enjoy it and would recommend testing out of it if you can, as it's mostly things I learned in high school bio.",
    "I learned about evolution and a lot of ecology and history about phylogenies. I think this is the best taught of all the 3 modules, and I felt that Prof. Donoghue is a great lecturer who knows what he's talking about. I never fell asleep in his class. Just make sure you start studying early for the final and you'll be fine!",
    "I think this is a great class for students to gain an insight into evolutionary biology without having to understand",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Many people, myself included, probably don't fully appreciate how fascinating ecology and evolution (and especially the history of life on Earth) can be. Also, I think you can and probably will find this course fun even if ecology\/evolution are not your primary academic interests.",
