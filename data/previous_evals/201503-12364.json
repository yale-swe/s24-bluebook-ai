    "It's a math class. If you don't like math or flipped classrooms, stay away. If you need it for your major or to get to the next level of math, you just have to power through it.",
    "Take it if you're interested in math or need it for your major.",
    "Challenging but very strongly recommended.",
    "Yes I would. I enjoyed the class",
    "Math 115 is a flipped classroom where you learn the basic material through video's. The material and more difficult applications are then reinforced in class and in problem sets.",
    "I would recommend it but say that self study is an important supplement to the flipped classroom",
    "Math 115 is very difficult but interesting. Flipped classroom can be difficult but it is nice to have the videos to go back and watch again. Exams are long and very difficult. Felt like they were meant to trip us up. Problem sets were fair. If you like math or reccomend but it takes a lot of time.",
    "Good Math Class",
    "It is an interesting and helpful course, but I do not recommend taking it when flipped.",
    "It's just like any other calc 2 course. I would recommend it if the student likes math. I think the class experience depends very much on the instructor. I happened to have a wonderful instructor. I have friends who had terrible ones.",
    "It's kinda hard, and the second midterm is worse than the first just because the material is harder. Just stay on top of the material as you see it and you'll be fine. Plus there's so many great teachers and review sessions that it's hard to not do well.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "I would say the it is not as easy as you would expect it to be. I took BC Calc in high school, and I still ended up learning a lot in this class.",
    "I would only recommend this course if they had already covered part of the content as it was assumed the first few classes had been covered in high school.",
    "A brief, condensed version of AP Calc BC with a HUGE emphasis on sequences and series. Take it! A manageable course, as long as you get a good TA.",
    "Math 115 is a standard Calc II class. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to take it or who likes math. It's a challenge, but it's not too bad.",
    "Boycott the entire math department until flipped classes are eradicated."
