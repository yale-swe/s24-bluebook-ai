    "The course strengthens your knowledge of both Mexican history and art, and makes sure to underscore their mutual informing of each other.",
    "This class is good even if you have not taken an art history class previously because the readings are well selected and Prof. Bravo is amazing.",
    "I learned how to write an art history paper and how to discuss art in a way I had never before.",
    "I learned a lot about Mexican history and art history, way beyond just Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, the artists that got me interested in the course. This course pushed me to think critically and really helped me expand my thinking in a way that I havent yet at Yale.",
    "Developed art history analysis and writing while learning about Modern Mexican Art and history.",
    "I learned more about Revolutionary Mexico, as well as the artistic movements that happened during this era.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned how to successfully analyze artwork through historical lenses and also expanded my historical knowledge of revolutionary Mexico. The course also does develop reading and writing as this course relies heavily on the readings assigned to guide the course. Furthermore, the writing is also improved as research papers are assigned twice.",
    "I developed an intimate knowledge of Mexican art and politics as they applied to the creation of a Mexican national identity in the 20th century. I also developed skills for writing and taking about art work.",
    "Wonderful analysis of both primary and secondary documents, measured discussion abilities, and of course, relevant information about the Mexican Cultural Renaissance"

   "comments": [
    "The course was great the way it was!",
    "I really loved the class discussions, and perhaps the value of this course is dependent on classmates then. But, Prof. Bravo always prepares a presentation that complements the readings super well and prompts really good class discussions.",
    "I really enjoyed the assignments this course offered because they let us pursue our specific interests. I liked the classes as well as they were incredibly interesting.",
    "Huge strength is the multimedia approach to this class. We looked at way more than just oil paintings and frescoes. It was cool to watch movies and read literature of the day. Not necessarily a weakness, but it definitely works to your favor if you speak Spanish. I personally dont and got a lot out of the class, but it might nuance your learning!",
    "Really specific and interesting period in Mexican history and art that most other classes would not cover. The class relies heavily on readings and discussion which can be great but tend to be lead by the most senior art history majors.",
    "Classes were always engaging and the course material was consistently interesting. However, the required readings were sometimes too long, and it was difficult to finish them before each class.",
    "The strengths of the course lie in the topic matter since Mexican art in incirediblt engaging and ripe for discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class!",
    "Take this course! Prof. Bravo is SOO knowledgable about seemingly everything that it's amazing to be able to just pick her brain. She is always willing to clarify points or tell us cool stories about the artists we studied. She also asks great questions that generated some of my favorite conversations at Yale. The artists and works studied in this class are just phenomenal, as well as the topic.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Monica is amazing. The readings were always interesting and relevant. Classes were well organized. She went out of her way to accommodate students and help them with assignments.",
    "YES! Bravo is absolutely amazing and really intelligent. She not only knows SO MUCH about Mexico and the US-Mexico relationship but also really understands how to facilitate a class. She is the best and so supportive so I was really happy as someone who has never taken art history before to have her as a teacher.",
    "YES! Monica Bravo is incredible and I hope everyone takes a class with her.",
    "I would absolutely recommend MCR. Mexico played such a vital role internationally and artistically in the 19th century and is often overlooked in classes discussing contemporaneous history. The class introduces the Revolution to provide the context for the Renaissance and it discusses the various artistic reactions to revolution and modernity. Monica incorporates so many incredible pieces and artists working in a wide variety of styles and media as well as readings to structure the lessons. Prof. Bravo is an incredible teacher who goes out of her way to help us develop our ideas and improve our writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is fun to participate in, and students learn a lot from the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as classes revolving around Mexican Art are very scarce at Yale and this course does a great job of looking into the \"golden age\" of Mexican Art in all its forms, not just murals.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it was an engaging course that covered a variety of topics: art, politics, race and ethnicity.",
    "Monica Bravo is a wonderful professor and I would highly recommend any course she teaches. This one was particularly interesting because we are in a period of reflection about the revolution, about 100 years after. The art and films and literary works are really exciting to read.",
    "It was a great class that allowed me to learn about Mexican History and people and the influence those aspects had on art, rather than just focusing on the art itself."
