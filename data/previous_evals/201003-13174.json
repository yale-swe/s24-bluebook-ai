   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in the Western intellectual tradition for its own sake, then take DS. It's a great survey of that. If you want any kind of in-depth analysis of any work in particular, you might want to choose a different class, because DS moves very quickly and covers a lot of material. Professor Rawson's section was great.",
    "I would say that it's fast-paced, but that Literature was my favorite section. It was well worth it, but if you seek to thoroughly understand every text you read and not just plow through, I wouldn't recommend D.S.",
    "It is certainly not easy, but I enjoyed it very much and I think that it has provided me with an effective base for going further in my studies, both in the field of literature and elsewhere.",
    "This course is heavy in reading, like all DS courses.",
    "Take directed studies if you like the humanities. It's challenging, but nowhere near as intense as it's reputed to be. It is what you make of it, and whatever you make of it, it will be fun and enlightening.",
    "Well, there is the obvious platitude about spending too little time on each book, but that's the point of Directed Studies. I didn't mind the broadness of our scope at all; indeed, I found it to my liking. DS Literature helps you build a goodfoundation in all things literary at all times in history, a foundation off of which you may build further and in special directions, on your own or within a literature course, but always only if you please. Moreover, I cannot stress the importance of having someone to guide you by the hand through the western canon. It is a once in a lifetime experience. TAKE THIS COURSE, and take itwith Prof. Rawson if you can.",
    "DS Literature is an excellent way to learn to understand classical literature, especially the fascinating intertextuality of classical literature. This class is also, according to my experience, the most accessible of the DS courses. I would highly recommend this class; it is for anyone who loves to read and seeks to know the origins of literature we read today.",
    "I love Directed Studies! Be aware that you really won't get to spend much time on a single work, which can be frustrating, and the workload is intense, but it's such a fulfilling experience. My philosophy teacher described it the best: it's like the tour at an art museum. You take the tour to look at everything with a well-rounded expert, but then you can go back to look at those one or two paintings that most drew your eye. The same is true for DS: you get to read so many of the great works of literature. Not all of them will be appealing, but trust me, you will fall in love with at least a few (for me it was The Iliad), and those sparks of inspiration will guide your future studies. (Note: this is the same response I had for Question 1)",
    "The course was great. A solid foundation for all subsequent English and humanities classes at Yale.",
    "I would summarize this course as having been the first semester of a crash course in the development of Western Literature, necessarily focused a good deal on the Greek and Roman classics. I would definitely recommend the course, and the Directed studies program in general, to those students who are interested in becoming well read and knowledgeable on the evolution of western thought and culture -- here from a study of its literary canon.",
    "I really enjoyed DS Lit. The books are interesting (and especially captivating compared to the other classes), and the lectures are interesting as well. Professor Rawson was a good section leader as well -- although our section was dominated by a few strong voices, he's a really kind professor, and really knows his stuff.",
    "Absolutely-- it's a great way to get acquainted with the classics and to explore literature in an intimate setting.",
    "Like all Directed Studies classes, this is not a class to take if you are someone who will be bothered by covering a lot of material in a short period of time. But if you go into the course understanding its nature, you can still get quite a lot out of it. Especially with Professor Rawson!",
    "Just as with any of the other elements of DS, Literature is a daunting task. The reading is a lot, and it is never easy to bring the entire semester's material into your command for the end-of-semester exam. That said, this is a great class, which will survey large amounts of important literature in very little time. Prof. Rawson goes through the material efficiently, and is always helpful in planning papers. DS is a labor-intensivedecision, and if you decide to do it, Prof. Rawson is a very good teacher for first semester literature."
