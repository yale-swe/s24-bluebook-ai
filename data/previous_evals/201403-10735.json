   "comments": [
    "There's no choice, although I think students with advanced experience in theory should have the option of being excused.",
    "I would recommend it, though in the hands of a lesser discussion leaderor someone who was not that interestedthe class could suffer. It's not too stressful, since there is no final paper, which is a godsend at the end of the semester. This also allows people to concentrate more & spend more time on the weekly readings.",
    "A thorough introduction to the research methodologies and major questions of Comparative Literature.",
    "Comprehensive and intensive seminar that is theory oriented; I needed such course and very glad that I took it.",
    "The course is very fundamental. It provides you with the necessary knowledge for having a big picture about the field of comparative literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student that is looking for an overview of the field (that is, what it means to be studying comparative literature), or any student seeking to further their understanding of theoretical movements in the 20th century (including critical and literary theory).",
    "Yes I would recommend it, it's a great survey of literary theory and was an enjoyable class to attend."

   "comments": [
    "It was very helpful! It's a history of the discipline through a reading of its founding and texts. It helped enormously even with the writing of final papers for other classes I was enrolled in concurrently.",
    "See above",
    "It certainly deepens my knowledge of the discourses on comparative literature but I am not sure how it directly contributes to my dissertation yet.",
    "This course was highly useful for deepening my knowledge of the study of comparative literature, and the critical questions and debates within the field. I am incredibly glad I had the opportunity to take it, as the material we read and discussions we had will prove incredibly relevant for my future work.",
    "It was a class that featured texts I had always hoped to read but hadn't had the chance\/inspiration to do so. In that sense, it was invaluable."
