    "I would recommend this course, especially if you enjoy having a flexible schedule in terms of when you complete the assignments. The speakers change year to year, so you might look at the syllabus and consider whether the speakers match your interests. There is the opportunity to have lunch with each of the speakers after every class. The final paper (8000-10000 words) is incredibly long, start working on it early on and pick a topic that you are really interested in.",
