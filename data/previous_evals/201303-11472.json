    "Do not take this class. Even if you are an EVST major and think it'll be an easy class.The class is dull. If you get excited about the material in the first class, be prepared for an entire semester dedicated to tribes in Indonesia that you've never heard of and will never read about again. I took this class expecting it to be about the ways that Americans today interact with their environment, and it's more about hunter-gatherer societies in Borneo. The class was a waste, and I wish I could have taken something else.The biggest problem is not just the course material. You think you're signing up for a seminar, but instead it's a 90 minute lecture in a 110 minute course. Professor Dove is really interesting, and he has a lot of cool things to say, but if you want to talk about the readings, don't bother taking the class. Because you will probably not say anything at all.",
    "Take it because you have to or because you're really interested in the reading list. Know in advance that lectures will be very very dry. Also, the final paper is really long--start early! 30-40 pages is no joke.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that has taken an introductory anthropology course before. I had not and honestly do not like the subject - it was a core class for my major so I was required to, but I wouldn't recommend it to any friends.",
    "Enviro Anthro has an amazing syllabus\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093the readings are classics in the field of environmental anthropology and they're divided well into relevant themes. I had two problems with this class: one was my own fault, START THE PAPER EARLY, the other, however, is a reflection on Professor Dove's teaching style. While the topics are fascinating the seminar is really a lecture\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093Dove talks pretty much the whole time and not in a particularly engaging manner. Despite being really interested in the topics, I found it hard to focus. I wish we could have opened it up more to discuss the texts.",
    "I would recommend it but START THE PAPER EARLY. 30 pages is no joke.",
    "Taking EVST 345 as a fall-semester freshman was probably ill-advised, but if taken with a couple of lower-work classes made it overall manageable. The readings are often time consuming but consistently fascinating, and the class discussion (more of a lecture by Professor Dove) was good at points, but Dove's presentation is very dry and I think few people made it through the lecture to the short discussion section at the end of class still following Dove's train of thought. The final paper is a doozy but, if you take a long amount of time to research, is doable and very satisfying, though keep in mind Dove has very limited office hours and will likely not advise closely on the paper.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student interested in environmental issues and the way we deal with them. It's useful to have a background knowledge of anthropology when discussing this issues. The readings are all very thought-provoking. It is best to start researching for the final paper early on."
