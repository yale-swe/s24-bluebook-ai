    "Beware, science majors -- there is a lot of memorization in this course that might not test your actual scientific knowledge\/abilities. A lot of the lectures also feel pretty silly, since it really is marketed toward non-science people. However, this kind of core knowledge of psychoactive drugs is something that everyone should have, and something that will help you in your personal life too: even if you don't take drugs yourself, which is unlikely, they affect everyone. Recommend, with reservations and a \"good luck, you'll need it\"",
    "Interesting, fun, and difficult topic. Worth taking if you are interested in pharmacology, drugs in general, or neurobiology. Expect to learn a lot of brain science in the first two weeks. The fun stuff comes later in the semester.",
    "Take this class. It is a lot of work, but you will learn so much cool and interesting information about drugs if you put the effort into learning about the material. One of the best classes that I have taken at Yale!",
    "By no means an easy science credit. Be prepared to work a ton for a good grade. Still, so worth it: you learn an amazing amount of interesting and useful material.",
    "A great course if you have any interest in drugs. Material was covered quickly, and Hedy speaks extraordinarily fast. It was essentially impossible to keep up with notes, but I nonetheless learned a great deal during each lecture. Assignments are not flexible, at all, but they also are not terribly hard. The tests, however, are extremely detailed and require a fair amount of study to do well. Average scores were in the 70-80 range. There is supposedly a curve for the total class grade at the end though, so don't worry too much. As somebody highly interested on how the physical effects of drugs alter our consciousness, I took a lot away from this course. This is after a fair amount of independent research too, so it won't be a simple summary or broad concepts.",
    "Really hard, only take it if you are good at science",
    "Good way to fulfill science credit and provided lots of general knowledge",
    "It's kind of a cool class. Just a ton of information and the exams are hard.",
    "I would def recommend this class, but be careful because it will make you want to do drugs",
    "Psyc 161 contained some of the most interesting information I've learned in a course at Yale. However, I very much regret taking the class for a science credit. I was overwhelmed with information from the very beginning of the course and was never able to catch up. I found myself cramming before tests and hardly sleeping, but still not able to memorize enough information to perform well on the exams. There are a decent number of psych and neuroscience kids in the class who drive up the test averages too. Only take this class if you're down for hours and hours of memorizing chemical structures and mechanisms. I, for one, could not bring myself to do that. Hedy's a great lecturer, but the class is just way too hard for a science credit. I'm sure it's great for neuroscience students though!",
    "AWESOME CLASS. Take it, but be forewarned that it is not a gut. Much more neuroscience than health class.",
    "Absolutely yes. Yes. YES! This is one of the best classes I've every taken at Yale. The information is useful and engaging, and the lectures are a pleasure to go to. The class is designed to help those who don't have a hard-science background engage with the material. You will learn an incredible amount about drugs and policy, and it will likely change your perspective on the topic. I think every college student should be required to take this class.",
    "I would take this if you need a 5th(i needed a 5th) or an SC. There is almost no work, and what little work there is spent actually learning, rather than paper writing or some other shit task. Not too sciencey, but the science was my favorite part.First half of this course was awesome, second half of this course was more boring. The science is by far the coolest topic, and should have gotten more wait. I still dont really understand how retrograde signalling\/second messengers actually work. And think I might have after the first midterm, and then simply forgotten as we went drug by drug, which was not that bad, and then even more generally to a basically history class format.",
    "Boring class. Kober speaks way too fast, and slides are posted...so why do people go to class? Because of the constant threat of single-question pop quizzes, that's why (welcome back to high school). Tests are nit-picky, though having the option to pick your questions helps a lot. The material is often at least kind of interesting and not that difficult (I'm a physical science major who'd never learned about the brain). Overall, I don't particularly recommend it, even though the material is cool. Taking it Cr\/D\/F made it a lot less stressful than it would've been otherwise.",
    "Everyone needs to take this class to get a better understanding of drugs and how they actually work. It's a really interesting class, even for non science majors, and it's really not that much work as long as you go to class. It's two midterms, a final, and a short paper. If you have any interest in drugs, or just need to fulfill a science credit, take it!",
    "No - there are better SC credits.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a fun interesting science course, you should take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you are taking the course from a non-science major point of view, I would be prepared for a lot of hard work. But, getting through that work is actually really rewarding; the information that you learn in the class is so interesting and is knowledge you will enjoy having in the future.",
    "Take it credit\/D. You will hate yourself when you do poorly on midterms and spend hours memorizing minute details you'll just forget the next day. But the more general information about drugs is something every college student should know.",
    "DBB is a great class on the neuroscience of drugs. Take it if you are interested in the subject and are willing to put in the work\u2014it's not easy, but it's a lot of fun!",
    "Do it. It's tough. Some nights, the weight of the material will all of us non-science majors...but no regrets. I'd say plan accordingly, but I know you won't do that so you might as well just take it because it'll be one of the best choices you'll make.",
    "Yes! Take it. Great course.",
    "Id recommend it with caution - maybe credit D. Its so interesting but it sucks to work hard and get a D",
    "Don't expect to actually learn much, but lectures are bearable and tests are fair and at least it's not planets and stars.",
    "Very interesting, but a lot of neuroscience and memorization so be prepared!",
    "This course is certainly challenging (perhaps deceptively so), but you'll emerge with an in-depth, useful knowledge of drugs \u2014 the neuro-scientific mechanisms of drugs (how drugs work in the brain), what exactly drug \"addiction\" is, side effects of drug use (physical, emotional, long vs. short term, withdrawal, etc.), and how drugs influence an individual and society. While some attention is paid to treatment and the social\/political history of drugs, the focus is on the science and pharmacodynamics of drugs. While the course is manageable for non-science majors and those without a background in neuroscience, it does require a lot of studying to do well, and the second exam (there are two in addition to the final) and the final exam are quite tough. That being said, if you put in the time and effort \u2014 and seek help from Professor Kober or the TFs \u2014 you can succeed, and the knowledge you will gain is well worth it.",
    "Absolutely, without question, I recommend this class. It's hard to get into because the lecture is capped, but you should definitely try, and if you get in, take it! You will learn more than you ever imagined about drugs and how they impact the human brain, which is really fascinating even if you're not particularly interested in neuroscience. The readings are easy, and lectures always go by quickly. It's not an easy class in the sense that there's a lot of material, and you'll spend a fair amount of time preparing for the exams and writing the final paper, but all of the work is valuable and worthwhile. It's rare that you have a professor as enthusiastic as Professor Kober or a lecture class as engaging and exciting as Drugs, Brain & Behavior.",
    "A pretty decent class. Not really a gut since there is quite a bit of memorization involved (and this is coming from an MCDB major). Hedy is quite helpful and obviously loves the material and is willing to meet or talk with anyone. The TAs try to be helpful, although I felt like they didn't quite know what was going on half the time. The guest lecturer, a woman who went through\/is in the maintenance stage of drug addiction herself, was amazing. I really appreciated that aspect of the course and am so glad it was included. If you're ok with memorizing a lot of details (although quite a bit of them are pretty interesting anyway), then I would say this class is worth it.",
    "Definitely recommend. This course teaches you so much about the drugs that you hear about every day -- adderall, cocaine, alcohol, etc. It goes into neurobiology a little bit, but I was definitely able to survive as a non-science major. It isn't that hard either if you study for the exams. Great class overall.",
    "Learn how drugs act on the brain. 2 midterms, one paper, one final.",
    "Take it if you're willing to put in the time to memorize a lot for the tests. It's super interesting if you stay on top of the work, and the reading isn't really that heavy -- the midterms, short paper and final are the only big assessments. NOT a gut, although you can do well if you put your mind to it.",
    "This is an excellent class that's extremely interesting if you're interested in pharmacology and the science behind illicit drugs. Be warned that it is a fair amount of science, so if you do not have a strong background in biology, you might be doing a bit more work than you anticipated. It's by no means a gut. I learned a lot and it was a really fun course! Take it!",
    "Be warned, there is a lot of memorization involved. But you leave the class with a strong understanding of how many drugs affect you and your body, both in the short and long term. That's valuable knowledge in and of itself. Hedy is a great lecturer (though goes really fast), and sometimes her slides felt lacking. All around good class for a \"real\" science credit.",
    "For those of you who like to consume drugs, this class is essential. Lets you know what you're actually doing to your body so that when you continue your same habits you at least know what's up. It's fun and interesting (but hard so watch out).",
    "YES - Take this class! You'll learn a lot of really interesting, scientific, unbiased information about drugs that isn't really available anywhere else except Hedy (Hedy is great and engaging and hilarious!). Her lectures are essential to the class (info won't be anywhere else)- you need to go to the lectures (which are fun - you'll enjoy them)! But she has slides from class that are really useful posted on v2 as well. The exams were a little trickier than expected sometimes - make sure you find a way to make sense of and conceptually \"chunk\" the units and the important information about various drugs as you study, or else you might feel like you know a lot and then get thrown off by the exam when you actually have to answer questions about your knowledge. In the end though, it's not a difficult class at all unless you are REALLY, really bad at grasping anything remotely scientific - if that's you, then you might have to work a little bit more... but the class will still be awesome and you won't regret taking it. The TAs are awesome too. I regret not getting to know the professor and TAs as much - you should do that!",
    "DBB is a great course. The first half covers basic neuro with a focus on neurotransmitters. The second half focuses on individual drugs or classes of drugs in relation to the material covered in the first half of the course. If you are interested in drugs (whether or not you take many drugs yourself) this course will be informative and worthwhile. If you are not, do not take this course.",
    "This class is the best class I've ever taken. It's an overview of how drugs affect the brain, delving first into a bit about how the brain works and then exploring individual types of drugs. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to another student, because it was fascinating and because Professor Kober is the best professor I've ever had. And after I'd recommended it to another student, I would feel really jealous of them, because I wish I could take this class again.",
    "PSYC 161 runs through the basics of neurobiology so that we can understand drugs in a neurological context and then goes through the various drugs that are most commonly used and abused today (caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, opioids, stimulants, hallucinogens, etc.). We then talk about behavioral addictions and social factors of addiction, which brings the class into a psychiatric light. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their background!",
    "Really great class, even if you're just looking for a SC credit. I'm not a science person AT ALL and I found the class to be incredibly interesting and the work to be manageable with a decent amount of studying. When I was studying for the (cumulative) final exam, I realized that I had learned a TON of information, and a lot of it is useful\/applicable to college life. be warned that Professor Kober talks really fast, although you will definitely get used to the speed by the end of the semester",
    "Yes, I would recommend taking this class. But beware if you think this will be a nice, easy SC credit. It is not, especially for non-science majors. There is a lot of material to learn before each test and it is complicated if you have never been exposed to it before. I am thankful that I took this class credit\/D because I had trouble mastering some of the concepts, especially with all the specific facts about the various drugs we studied for the second midterm. That said I am still glad I took the class because it provides you with knowledge in both psychology and neuroscience. As an econ major, I enjoyed the opportunity to get a basic understanding of the brain through the study of drugs, which is an extremely relevant and interesting topic for us college students.",
    "Yes, but i would tell them that the tests are very difficult.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "General introduction to the chemistry surrounding drugs of different natures.",
    "Great class for learning the basic mechanisms of psychoactive drugs. Definitely recommended if you are at all interested.",
    "Yes if you need to fulfill a science credit and\/or are interested in drugs and the brain. This class is NOT a gut and requires A LOT of memorization and preparation to do well. Go to the lectures because Professor Kober goes over the graphs and images that end up showing up on exams. You can get by without doing the reading as long as you do well preparing for the exams from class notes and lecture slides, but ultimately, the tests do include questions from readings or studies that were read for homework and discussed in class. Also we have about 4 reading quizzes that are 10 points each and an easy way to get 10% of your grade all checked if you do the readings!!! Very interesting class and information overall though!",
    "Take it if you want to learn information, but it is a lot of work, and will require a lot of memorization. Not an easy class by any means, but definitely informative.",
    "This is an awesome class! TAKE IT!!! Professor Kober is funny, energetic, and very knowledgeable on all things drugs. Having a baseline understanding (which is not all you'll get in this course) of common drugs is essential for navigating a world full of drugs.",
    "Looks like a gut, feels like a gut, NOT a gut. The tests are very detail-oriented, and you have to study a lot to do well on them. At least skim the readings: you'll be tested on them, too. At least she let you skip a few questions per section on the tests, or they would have been really brutal. Overall a good course, and a pretty solid introduction to neuroscience.",
    "PSYC 161 is a really interesting course, but there is a lot of material and it can be slightly difficult. The lectures move pretty fast and the tests aren't easily. But you learn a lot of really cool things about drugs.",
    "This is a great science credit for non-science majors, and you will learn a good bit of biology in addition to the intriguing societal aspects of drugs and drug use. Professor Kober is awesome, there is extra credit if you need it, and you will learn more than you anticipate. Inform yourself about drug use: it's probably one of the more important topics on which college students can be instructed. Take this class, no questions.",
    "Yes",
    "It's a great science credit and super interesting. I would definitely recommend taking it!",
    "Easiest science credit ever. But the trade off is that it's just straight memorization.",
    "I would recommend taking this class credit\/d\/fail. It was a lot of information to retain, so it ended up being a HUGE amount of work and memorization for those that chose to take the class for a grade. But, if you take it pass\/fail, you still learn a lot of information, and you won't have to put an overwhelming amount of time into it.",
    "Take it take it take it. Take it if you want to learn about the drugs that you very well may come in contact with during your time in college (or just life), taught by an incredible and engaging professor who genuinely looks after her students and makes herself accessible to them however she can.",
    "A great course if you're interested in specific drugs and how they literally work in your body. It's heavy on the details, which can be tricky, but also really interesting if you take the time to study. Having a lot of time for this class is a must, because it requires a bit of memorization.",
    "This was a great class and I would recommend it to everyone I know.",
    "great class to take if you want to learn a ton about drugs and their effect on the brain. neurobiology at the beginning can be dense and intimidating, but I took this class Credit\/D, so I wasn't concerned with mastering the details. take it credit\/d. you will learn a lot and find it interesting. prof. kober goes through a lot of information very quickly. the course is dense. unless you want to spend your time mastering the many details of the course, then do as i suggest and take it credit\/d.",
    "Cool, cool class. Great for credit d. Really interesting, I learned so much",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to someone-- an intensive survey of many important drugs and the effects on the mind, body, and psyche. This class is not a gut though-- requires your engagement and care.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE! If you aren't a science major, be aware that there will be pre med students taking the course that will kick your ass and ruin the curve. Definitely not a gut science course but totally worth it. The exams are fair but make sure you study for them. The final is based off the two course exams.",
    "Great class, you'll learn so much and the topic is fascinating. BUT if you're not willing to put in a lot of hard work you'll get easily tricked by the exam questions which are really precise and there is so much material. So if you're looking for a science credit that will not be too hard although will teach you something that's not the class for you. I would highly recommend just going to the lectures - they're really great.",
    "Yes! Fascinating material and a well-taught course. It will change how you think about certain drugs.",
    "I would recommend any student to take this class. It might just have an impact on how you think about drugs in our society, regardless of what your attitude was before.",
    "Very good class and I feel it was one of the most relevant classes I've taken in college. I really liked how Hedy peeled away the political factors and presented the material in the most unbiased manner possible. I would have liked the class to spend less time covering things like gambling and eating disorders that are not considered traditional drugs but I really enjoyed learning about what the drugs actually do to people. Not an easy class if you are taking it for a grade, but a pretty solid credit\/d class if you are interested in the material and don't mind studying pretty hard before tests.",
    "If you're interested in drugs and how they work, this is the course for you! However, be warned, as it is definitely not a gut. I am a science major and still found that I had to study a significant amount for the course. That being said, if you keep up with the material, you will find the course rewarding.",
    "It was a harder class than I was ready for, but honestly I'd trade the easy A for science that is actually interesting and useful for my life any day (or at least that's what I tell myself). If that's your approach to a science credit, absolutely take this. There are two midterms and a final. Study for them; when I didn't take enough time to, things got pretty bad pretty quickly. I was impressed that Professor Kober was willing to be so outspoken about ineffective drug policy and relate it all back to how drugs work in our bodies. She lectures quickly and slides were hard to study from because they were incomplete, so try to at least write down the things she says that aren't on the powerpoint. This is the most applicable science credit you can take, but don't expect it to be easy.",
    "CAUTION. Know what you're getting into. Professor Kober knows her stuff but expect a heavy workload and very tough material. I have NEVER been exposed to so much material per lecture (you will not stop typing all class). However, the class is interesting at the core. Unless you're willing to work extremely hard and need a SC credit, I would be very careful with this class.",
    "I would not really recommend this course to students just trying to get a science credit. The material is interesting, but not a good balance if you are trying to focus your efforts more in other classes for your major. There is a huge workload expected with readings, and the exams are very specific. Only take if you are interested in psych or neuroscience, otherwise stay away.",
    "Speaking for the non-Science majors, while this is a very interesting class, only take it if you are willing to put in the work! This is not an easy SC class; if you want to get a good grade it requires attending lecture and doing all the readings regularly. The latter is particularly important for the random quizzes over the course of the semester, and the references to specific readings in the midterms. However, Professor Kober is a great professor and the material is very interesting!",
    "A giant step up from what you were taught in middle\/high school. You'll learn--and unlearn--a lot in this course. Don't expect to breeze through it, though. It heavily covers the science and technical details of drugs, and the midterms and final can be pretty rough. Nonetheless, it is worth taking, perhaps as a Credit\/D\/F.",
    "Take this class! It will make you want to take drugs! Knowledgably! Safely!",
    "def reco this course! fun and interesting. exams are more challenging than you might expect",
    "Absolutely",
    "It is a comprehensive study of five major drugs and how they affect the human brain. If the student just needs a science credit I don't think this would be the right course for that, but if the student is genuinely interested in the course I think that it would be a fun experience."
