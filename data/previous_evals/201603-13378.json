    "Dove's readings were well chosen, with the exception of Jared Diamond. The format of the class was generally useful, though could be set up in a way to encourage additional leadership in group discussion. My suggestion is for Dove to pause in his lectures and deliberately call for discussion by asking questions and allowing students to ask questions of other students. I say this because often the juice of the discussion would come out at the end of the class period, and begin to heat up just in time for class to be over."

Such a luxury.",

I will take ownership of this critique; as a student looking at this in retrospect I could have been much more proactive in tackling the final paper. But on a course level, it would be good to have the proposal as the first bench mark assignment, a first outline (or lit review?) as the second bench mark assignment, along with a (strongly suggested) office hours check in at that point, before Thanksgiving break. From that point on, students should know to have a first draft written by two weeks out.",

    "We often get stuck in a single way of seeing the world, of organizing knowledge, and of evaluating truth\/reality. At FES, this way is primarily oriented toward Western science, economics, (post-colonial) sustainable resource management, expertise, and power. We are often unable to check our own assumptions about the world because we are surrounded by those who either don't encourage us to question the status-quo, or those who haven't taken the time to read anything outside (or even tangential to) their discipline in years. This course challenges the assumption that there is only one way of knowing climate change, the topic(s) that so many of us are interested in. This alone makes it worth your time -- as does taking a class with Susan Clark.",
