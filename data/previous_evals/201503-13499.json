   "comments": [
    "Very good speakers. Very engaging seminar.",
    "Excellent speakers!",
    "It's great, but think ahead. Please don't schedule one on the thursday before we take the last of our exams where we had three in a row. I get that its not possible to know the schedule for finals when making arrangements, so just don't make it during finals week.",
    "Improvement: It would be great to try to not schedule speakers before the holidays or during finals.",
    "I would prefer more variety in the speakers. Many seem geared toward the management side of things, when true leadership should not be conflated with 'successful' management of multimillion-dollar establishments. Some of the clinicians and policy purists in the room feel that the course does not adequately acknowledge the morality, ethics, and compassion of leadership. I certainly have learned important lessons from the speakers, but would appreciate the class further challenging our conceptions of leadership by inviting leaders in non-profits, government, and think tanks rather than private industry.",
    "Strengths: -Incredible opportunity to hear perspectives of leaders\/practitioners in the field and gain access to direct conversations with them. -Good survey of potential career paths in healthcare management. -Speakers from hospital administration and policy were well-represented. Weaknesses: -Could have had more speakers of color, more diverse representation. -Would have been nice to have a speaker with clear focus on social justice.",
    "Good diversity of speakers. Better when there are less students in the room.",
    "I loved learning from individuals who are at the heights of their fields, and getting different perspectives on what is being done and needs to be done to the healthcare system.",
    "I look forward to this colloquium every week. The speakers come from so many different backgrounds in healthcare and open our eyes to so many different aspects. This is by far one of the most rewarding experiences in the program. The exposure we get and the ideas we learn from these accomplished speakers are priceless.",
    "Thanks for letting us introduce ourselves.",
    "I wish there were more women speakers, especially considering how many women are in the cohort of students! I really appreciate the diversity of speakers, especially the fact that we had a republican! I think it's easy for the students to think that our bubble represents the country, but it certainly doesn't. There are a lot of republicans out there and it's important that the outspoken democrats learn to have productive, non judgmental conversations.",
    "Excellent listening to guest speakers.",
    "Course was good. Would like to see different types of professional backgrounds, and not only MDs. In addition, the course should feature speakers who work in different types of communities.",
    "Wonderful - I'm so glad we have this opportunity. I would go to every session even if it was not for credit.",
    "Great! We are given the opportunity to learn from a variety of speakers across the healthcare industry.",
    "It is a wonderful supplement to the traditional YSPH coursework and provides a clear opportunity to see first hands ways in which the skills we acquire at YSPH can be applied in a a diverse set of professional settings.",
    "Excellent. Very bipartisan and multifaceted representation of health management, policy, leadership and practice.",
    "A chance to meet some of the leaders in the industry? Why not!"
