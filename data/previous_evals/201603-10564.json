   "comments": [
    "My Chinese reading and writing abilities are better, though speaking still needs some work.",
    "This course is designed to give students a comprehensive introduction to writing and reading Chinese. After taking this course, I have a firm understanding of basic grammar and sentence structure techniques as well as hundreds of characters I would previously not be able to recognize or write. It provided me with daily drilling on the language that enabled me to develop a deeper comprehension of the language.",
    "I mainly learned how to write and read in Simplified Chinese. My literacy has improved drastically this semester. We also practiced speaking and listening."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Everyone is at a different level so you might find the pace too fast or too slow. But the class itself is well structured and tries to make learning a difficult language as fun as it can be.",
    "The strengths in this course lie in its ability to use each day to the fullest, by ensuring that students understood the vocabulary thoroughly. It also lies in the enthusiasm of the teachers, who are able to capture the students' attention every morning with their commitment to the course. Their passion and dedication to their students really shows. However, I felt that often times, we were short for time when it came to discussions because we never fully had a chance to articulate our thoughts or dedicate more time to round table discussions given the fast-paced nature of the course. I also understand that Chinese has a steep learning curve, but it felt as though the class didn't really account for that fully. I didn't really feel like I had an even footing with my other classmates until midway through the semester, and I had a friend drop the course in the first few weeks due to the lack of time. It took multiple hours each day in the first few weeks to really understand and memorize the material, which was definitely not the case for some of the kids in the class, so while we all had our different weaknesses, there were definitely students better prepared for the class going in than I was and it showed.",
    "I think that the strengths of this course is that its a small seminar so the professor can engage and ask all of us questions. Also, the daily quizzes really helped motivate me to study everyday. I wish we could have done more speaking everyday in class. A lot of the time we would just repeat sentences or answer in a certain grammatical format, which I felt like weren't as helpful as the discussion\/debate class days. It was only during the discussions that I felt like my speaking really needed improvement and practice."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Finally improve your Chinese like your parents are probably bothering you to. It'll be some level of consistent work, but rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are willing to put in the time and effort to actually understand the language. If you have no prior exposure to reading or writing, there will be an extremely steep learning curve for you, especially given some of your classmates will have previously attended Chinese school or had prior experience with reading and writing. If you are willing to put in the time, both Liu Laoshi and Chan Laoshi are wonderful and extremely dedicated to the course. It's worth taking the course for them alone, just because they will have you laughing and smiling in the early morning. However, know the time commitment going in and prioritize this class because with daily quizzes and biweekly exams, it will demand your time.",
    "Yes! I think that if you take this course, you will improve so much. Although the professors push you to learn a lot of words, it is really worthwhile. I myself, was really surprised at how many words I was able to memorize with the right guidance."
