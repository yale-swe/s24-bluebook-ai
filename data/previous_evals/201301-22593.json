    "Pick something you're into and run with it.",
    "You pick a project, do research, write cool stuff, run tests, and write up your results. A good way to explore something you're interested in. Don't procrastinate, and you'll get a lot out of it!",
    "You're probably looking at this because you have to take it so why read reviews? Just make sure to figure out exactly what your project is EARLY. I don't have the godlike powers required to convince computer science majors to not procrastinate on the actual project, but for your own good figure out what you're doing like immediately!",
    "This class really depends on the your own initiative and who you pick for your advisor. Other than that, it's research, which is great for grad school.",
    "The key to success is choosing the right project. Start thinking about your project early. You should wait until you have found an idea that keeps you up at night. Once you have a good project, rejoice! This may be one of the best experiences you'll have at Yale. I am thankful that I found a project that was incredibly exciting and deeply fulfilling. If you don't find a professor in computer science that you want to work with, that's ok! I recommend looking for advisors in other departments, and then having someone in computer science sign the paperwork.",
    "It's your senior project--do some fun research!",
    "Required class, entirely dependent on your advisor and project. Start early.",
    "If you have to take this class you have to take it, so I'll give you a piece of advice instead of recommending or discouraging the class:be less ambitious than you are in your proposal, set low expectations and make sure your advisor is ok with them.",
    "You've gotta take it if you're a senior! Start it EARLY and do it in the fall if you can. It's hard to be diligent senior spring so I think that more structure would be useful - build this structure for yourself as best you can.",
    "As a senior, I recommend taking 490 in the fall so you don't have to do it in the spring. The schedules are more hectic in the spring since you're close to graduating. Additionally, I'd also advise that you take it with professors who you like (and who like you) as opposed to taking it with a professor you might not work well with in a subject you're interested in."
