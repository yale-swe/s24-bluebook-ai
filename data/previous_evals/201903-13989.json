    "Strengths: you get a substantial overview of the topics explored in the academia of health and aging. There are guest speakers, who are the authors of the readings we are assigned in class we learn a lot from them, being the primary researcher on the specific topic we are focusing on for the week. Weakness:",
    "Strengths - interesting class material and interesting course format (each week a different group would lead discussion). Appropriate workload and evenly spaced out assignments. Professor Levy is also helpful and knowledgeable! Weaknesses - I would really like more input\/lectures from Professor Levy - though I enjoy learning from my classmates, I sometimes wish she would step in to teach us more directly at some points during the semester (rather than just lightly facilitate student-led and student-created discussions)",
    "This class honestly was one of the best, if not the best, course I have taken at Yale thus far. I felt included and engaged in the seminar style classroom, and the discussions were great. I really appreciated that there were some working professionals in the group - this diversified the discussion. One suggestion might be to include some readings about hospice and palliative care. Id have liked to learn a little bit more about that. Those readings could be included on the week about death and dying."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - you will get a great overview of the literature on health and aging. Also, you will get prompt feedback on your writing assignments, so youre able to improve as a writer. Class is generally small and the professor makes the environment very friendly that all students get to know each other and become friends outside of the class.",
    "If you are interested in this topic, this is a great course for you to take",
    "Yes! Definitely take this. There is definitely a good chunk of reading involved, but I was interested in the topic so it didnt seem like a chore."
