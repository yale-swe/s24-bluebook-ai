   "comments": [
    "It is a very thought-provoking course that is grounded mostly in philosophy and theory. It introduces some highly provocative ideas (e.g the idea that mass incarceration is a modern-day form of slavery, and an insidious, twisted form of affirmative action!!!). The professor even allows students to rap on inequality for bonus credit. The discussions are amazing: they are seriousness, interspersed with occasional moments of hilarity and joy! I also enjoy the fact that the professor allots the beginning of the class to break down funny events that have happened during the week. By leavening his classroom discussions with humor, the professor makes the class all the more rewarding... Take it, ESPECIALLY, if you have a strong philosophical bent!",
    "I have raved about this class to all of my friends. I absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in improving their writing and learning about political philosophy.",
    "Engl 114 is introduction to college level writing. It is a great way to transition to higher level writing if you feel unprepared.",
    "Would recommend. Overall a solid English course. I'm not sure if I am still completely proficient in writing a research paper without guidance, which was more or less the point of the course, but I do think I learned how to improve my writing overall. Prof. Kreiner is pretty straightforward and always willing to give helpful feedback. I would warn though that the subject of my course (Persistent Inequalities) ended up being more theoretical than I expected (ex. Sieyes' \"The Third Estate\") and didn't move on to contemporary issues of inequalities (ex. modern day racial and gender inequalities) until near the end of the course.",
    "The latter half of the class is more interesting, as the beginning focuses more older issues, but later on we discuss current racial and socioeconomic issues!",
    "I feel as though English 114 is sometimes marketed as \"writing for people who don't know how to write.\" As someone who felt fairly confident in her writing skills in high school, I therefore didn't think this class would be the best fit for me. I was wrong. ENGL114 is a great introduction to writing at Yale, and I think most students could benefit from taking it. I feel much, much more confident navigating library resources, participating in class discussion, and writing academic papers (which are quite different from the papers I wrote in high school). \"Persistent Inequalities\" with Professor Kreiner is a great course for anyone looking to improve their critical reading and writing skills who is also interested in racial\/ethnic, gender, nationality-based, and\/or socioeconomic inequality. The readings are sometimes pretty lengthy and dense, but the classes are largely discussion-based, laid-back, and compelling. Professor Kreiner provides thoughtful, extensive feedback on all of your work, and makes himself available to talk with you during office hours. And although he's not an especially energetic lecturer, it's clear that he's very knowledgeable about the topics we cover in class (and cares deeply about them).",
    "Engl 114 Persistent Inequalities is a fun class if you want to talk about the negative aspects of inequalities. It will help you improve your writing and allow you to do a variety of different writing styles. I would recommend this class to another student only if they are extremely interested in the negative aspects of inequalities.",
    "Mostly not. I think (although I'm not sure) that this was the first time this class was taught so there are several other tried-and-tested courses Strengths: -The course covers a very interesting and specific issue and I admire the effort that goes into teaching a class on such a great topic. -Although I was not looking forward to it initially, the focus on New Haven in the last weeks turned out to be far more interesting than expected. And even if some didn't enjoy it, I think the focus on New Haven issues is honourable and a necessary evil of sorts -The first few days of classes with the documentary and Sieyes were very interesting and well done -For people looking for very detailed annotated feedback on their essays and easing into college-level writing, ENGL 114 is absolutely the best classes (I've heard from my friends in other writing-heavy classes that annotated comments are just not a thing elsewhere and most professors just give a superficial comment in the end and a mark). However, I'm not an advocate of this particular Section; I attended several others that seemed excellent during shopping period but couldn't get into. SHOP ENGL 114 REALLY WELL. SHOP MANY OPTIONS. Weaknesses: -Class is generally not very challenging. I felt that novel arguments and very deep reading\/annotation didn't benefit me as much as I wish it would have. Learnt new citation rules and a bit about college-writing structure but felt my writing ability\/quality and reasoning were good enough and didn't need ENGL 114 -The course lost momentum quickly. The classes covering Sieyes and a few more subsequent philosophers were well-planned and enriched with the Egypt documentary for example but later on, discussions became dry -The structure and flow of the class could be improved. Classes were apparently arranged thematically (race, gender etc) but the shift from one theme to another felt abrupt and disconnected. The order of the readings in the later part of the classes too often felt random -I think the biggest issue I had was that the class basically discussed the various types of inequalities and how they developed and why they exist rather than why they PERSIST. It would be VERY worthwhile to have a final class or two just summarizing all that has been discussed up till then and sum up the answer to the question: Why do inequalities still persist? What are we doing wrong? Will they always persist (this question was briefly addressed but more all-arching works need to be assigned in class) -The course really needs more\/different interactive activities e.g. presentations, debates, art sessions etc. just different methods of communication to approach the topic not just by sitting at a round table and raising your hand to speak every time -I think it might be worthwhile to add some news articles\/real world issues every time we discuss an idea\/philosophy either in the form of reading or a slide on the screen. The class often felt like a philosophy class (and a basic one since it wasnt actually a philosophy class)"
