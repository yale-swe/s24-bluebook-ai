   "comments": [
    "A lot about calculus and math",
    "I honestly feel like I didn't learn any substantial knowledge. I did get to explore integration and series in depth, but I do not feel that the course material was taught in an efficient manner.",
    "In this course there is an emphasis on integration, understanding and applying different strategies to find solutions to various problems.",
    "This course taught me how to approach problems logically. A lot of the material of this course was looking at a problem and figuring out what test we should use on it, so we had to learn how to recognize distinct ways to solve a problem.",
    "Learned how to schedule my time for problem sets",
    "Lots of math",
    "The thing that I found most enjoyable about the class was seeing Brett Smith go through math equations and show how and why they work, rather than just give us formulas to memorize.",
    "He actually was great in helping us understand the theory behind every single thing we did in class, no series, integrals, parametric or polar curves were taught without extensive proof behind it. Because of that, he taught us to think of math itself in a different way.",
    "I became better at problem solving and properly integrating mathematical theory with practical applications.",
    "The knowledge I learned is standard calculus, but the insights I developed were valuable not just for math, but for all fields. I learned the proofs and the rationale behind it, and it helped me better understand math by developing these foundations. My math skills greatly improved in this class.",
    "I learned about Calculus and its implications using integrals.",
    "This helped me develop a deeper knowledge of integrals, polar equations, series, and sums.",
    "Solid knowledge of calculus and thorough understanding of the processes required for calculations.",
    "Throughout this course we explored integrals and series, and some applications with these. I honestly thought it was all interesting content and enjoyed learning these topics. The last few topics (polar coordinates and parametric equations) are not given as much time as they deserve.",
    "This course helped improve my basic understanding of calculus and its applications.",
    "I developed skills of integration building upon Calc I knowledge as well as applications of calculus to find areas, arc lengths, volumes of rotation, error bound, and parametric and polar equations.",
    "I gained a stronger foundation of calculus and problem solving skills to apply to further math and science courses.",
    "calc 2",
    "In this course, we learned about general integration techniques, sequences and series, Taylor series, and calculus with parametric and polar equations. I gained an understanding of how to apply the topics learned in class to various problems.",
    "Calculus!",
    "I learned that questions are a key way to learn something. A question clarifies what you know and dont know, not only for the teacher, but also for yourself.",
    "I learned calc II at a much deeper level than I did in high school, and understood how calculus can be applied to other fields (especially economics). It helped my problem solving skills and greatly helped me perform well in microeconomics.",
    "I bettered my understanding of integration, parametrics, series, and all the topics we covered in class. Brett Smith was a great teacher.",
    "I learned about integrals, sequences and series, convergence, volumes, and polar coordinates.",
    "I learned all of Calc 2 well, including methods of integration, series\/sequences, polar systems, and volumes made by rotating curves.",
    "I learned higher level math than I thought I could understand. This course also made me realize that it's very easy to slip up in your studies.",
    "A fundamental understanding of calculus.",
    "Being in my first year, this course helped me realize the dedication\/time management skills that I'm going to need in order to succeed throughout my college career. It also taught me some math skills that will hopefully be applicable in the future."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The flipped class format is simply NOT an efficient or productive teaching methods. The explorations did introduce topics, but the fact that the material had not been taught in class means that many don't take them seriously. Further, the exams tested knowledge and concepts that were not emphasized in class or on problem sets. Problem sets were very computational while exams tested for theory and knowledge of proofs or theorems and synthesizing concepts that were gone over maybe for 10 minutes in a class. LITERALLY the only thing that got me through this class is having Brett. If you take this take it with Brett",
    "A strength of this course is that it is structured very well, and if you pay attention in class and diligently do the problems sets you will be able to succeed on the exams. A weakness, for me at least, was that the class has 40-50 students, which made it difficult to engage during lecture.",
    "This course does a good job of explaining how and why certain tests or hypothesis work, but leaves it up to the student to learn how to solve actual problems. I found that during exams, there were problems I knew what I should do to solve them, but in practice, I didn't know where to start. It may improve the course to explain some topics, particularly error bounds, more practically.",
    "I really liked the flipped method where we read the book first and then came to class",
    "Brett is great, loved it.",
    "I think there should be less weighting on exams",
    "All teachers should be as good as Brett",
    "Strengths: clearly presented material, and enjoyable engagement of the material Weaknesses: I wish we would take time in class to go over homework problems that gave the class trouble",
    "This course is very thorough and broad but the topics also seem very connected. Weaknesses are that many students have already seen the material so if you haven't it's difficult.",
    "The class sizes make it difficult to learn when clueless because the pace of the class means you go through a minimum of a unit per class, and at times multiple units. It means that during class theres no REAL time to learn something. The questions on exams are based on theory or indepth knowledge which you essentially must learn on your own because there just isnt enough class time to learn. The other issue is that the class is so varied in math ability with students whove taken courses in their previous schools and are taking it for an easy A vs kids whore seeing this for the first time which makes it difficult for the instructor to both keep the pace fast enough and indepth enough to entertain the students whove seen it before and slow enough for kids to understand",
    "The course was great!",
    "Weaknesses: not everyone was engaged and willing to learn math (this really can't be improved on the behalf of the professor) Strengths: great professor, really enjoyed math.",
    "The problem sets in this course were great practice for the concepts we learning. The explores online were usually helpful, but sometimes they were confusing and hard to understand.",
    "There is a lot of self taught learning required. However, what we learn in class is very engaging.",
    "I think the course material is presented in a way that is unnecessarily difficult. I had experience in BC calculus in high school and the same topics I had seen then were taught in a very hard to understand and unclear way at times. Brett was amazing and certainly the best of the available professors for the course, but the material was oddly difficult at times when it didn't need to be.",
    "I dont see any significant weaknesses, one hiccup was that different professors use different notation \/ variables to refer to the same process, making review sessions or help from a friend somewhat confusing. Strengths include redemptive grading with multiple shots to improve ones grade, as well as a surplus of resources and practice problems via p-sets and practice exams.",
    "The course sometime feels like it is being taught for people who already know the material. So I would say that is a weakness. However, this also means that a good amount of content is covered, and covered well. A weakness would also be the organization of the course, or well, the order in which material is covered. Although in the end it all tied in very nicely, I do think that it gets a little messy as the course goes to and from the series part of the course.",
    "The class sizes are small, which encourages learning. I think the content after the second midterm was rushed and not fully developed.",
    "The \"flipped classroom\" style in which students watched a video then completed an exploration before the course felt like a waste of time, especially since the professor ended up going over all the content of the video in lecture anyways. Thankfully, Brett did go over the material comprehensively instead of just answering questions, which I assume was the purpose of learning the material beforehand, but doing that effectively rendered the explorations useless.",
    "Strengths: Brett is a great professor. The course material is truly interesting and he makes sure to use graphics and real world analogies to help relate it back to something we have dealt with before. Weaknesses: I didn't feel that the pre-class explorations\/videos were always adequate in preparing for class and sometimes felt like a waste of time. The course definitely could have better prepared the class for exam problems that would go beyond the scope of textbook and class questions. I also felt that the material was more rushed at the end of the course and didn't handle the last few topics as fully as it did the earlier ones.",
    "teacher was good",
    "I honestly didn't hate the flipped classroom setup as much as I thought. The online explorations weren't particularly helpful, but the in-class instruction was engaging and fruitful. The Problem Sets were not unduly long, but often reinforced principles learned in class. There truly is no better way to study math than by practicing, and the class offers plenty of opportunities to do so without being overly time-constricting. There are also plenty of opportunities to practice for the exams (practice tests, several review sessions, etc.) and the teachers are super friendly. Brett in particular is really chill and fun and it's great just getting to talk to him.",
    "Brett was an awesome teacher. I did feel like sometimes the explorations, videos, and lectures didn't work together so cohesively. Also not any time was spent on explaining things in the format of the textbook, so I only used the textbook for pset problems. Also, I felt that a lot of material wasn't taught on a very deep level. We would learn how to do things but only think about why they worked on the surface level.",
    "The explorations were a strength of the course and are a good preview to lecture material. Also, the peer tutoring system is well run and proved to be extremely helpful. Weaknesses of the course would have to be the exam reviews. While some were helpful, they were for the most part not great. It was really dependent on the prof. or TA running them. Also, I think the communication between profs. and students about specific expectations for exams and grading procedures could be improved.",
    "A great strength is definitely the fact that the course material is gone through at a pretty good pace. However, I think that the explorations should be due the after class so that the information we learn in class can marinate. A weakness is that how much a person learns from this course depends on the professors, because it is evident from many students that different professors are not the same .",
    "A strength of this course is that the curriculum is very clear, and there are explorations before classes to help students understand what they need to know before class. A weakness is that the textbook is not extremely clear. I had to at times use internet resources if I didn't understand the lecture.",
    "Strengths: Practice of topics through psets Weakness: Difference in level of problems between class and psets\/tests Deltas: Give more practice problems that match the difficulty of psets\/tests",
    "I thought the explorations were well thought out, and I really liked my professor Brett. In terms of weaknesses, the course was taught like everything we were studying, we'd seen before. To some extent this was true because I took the Calc AB class in high school and took the BC test, but for the topics I wasn't as familiar with, it was really difficult to catch up on my own. Also, the unit on sequences\/series\/convergence was frustrating because, and I apologize for the cliche, I could see very little practical application for the majority of what we learned.",
    "Strength: stress on learning concepts and critical thinking more than memorization. Weakness: Hard tests and minimal curving make a better curve?",
    "The material is well taught and y professor was really supportive and kind.",
    "I think at the beginning, for myself at least, I was admittedly intimidated by what appeared to me as my fellow classmates knew much more and were more well prepared than me for that class. Being FGLI and coming from a school that did not offer the most advanced courses, I think that led to me being kind of complacent in class, not answering questions and just kind of going \"yeah, it's just me who doesn't get it.\" Over time, I think I let that narrative play in my head for too long and it hurt my progress in that class. I don't know how this course could help out with this issue but this was I think the biggest issue I've had this year. Yes, the content was difficult, but the issue I stated above compounded on the class' difficulty and it just felt like I was sinking.",
    "The lectures sped through the material so I spent a lot of time outside of classes working on the course material.",
    "The 'flipped' structure of this course is not effective in teaching students Calculus 2 for the first time. It is difficult to gain knowledge from the pre-class explorations, and in class the main focus is on doing example problems rather than teaching concepts. This type of course is best suited for those who have taken Calculus BC but want to refine their skills in the subject.",

   "comments": [
    "Most people take this to fulfill a requirement, but if they have a choice no. The material isn't very interesting, and it's hard to see how it would be useful in life.",
    "No not at all unless you have to. Do not waste your time, and if you do take it, take it with Brett.",
    "If you have any interest in furthering your mathematics education, I would recommend it! The workload is very manageable (just a problem set and pre-class online explorations), and you are able to learn a lot of information relatively quickly without feeling overwhelmed. As a frame of reference, I spent about 6 hours a week on this course outside of lecture.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. While it isn't perfect, I think this course is important in developing critical thinking skills.",
    "yes",
    "Only take this with Brett Smith",
    "Yes, if they are comfortable with calc.",
    "Yes its hard but important to learn if its for a requirement",
    "Yes, get Brett as your teacher",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It offers a solid foundation to the material.",
    "I would recommend this course if you haven't taken calc bc and are interested in math.",
    "I mean you need this course for a lot of majors which is the problem with this course being inefficiently managed to catch kids who are struggling, its not a matter of recommending, you cant avoid it",
    "Yes! This was a math course that did an excellent job of combining in active class learning with solo practice and work to give an excellent synthesis of ideas.",
    "Yes, if you need to take a math, and you have already taken Calc AB, Math 115 is a good next step. However, your level of engagement and your enjoyment of the class as well as how much you will learn really depends on the professor you get. Hopefully, you get a good professor like I did!",
    "Yes, I thought the course was thorough and well taught.",
    "Yes, if they want to pursue something math related.",
    "Yes, I certainly would. If you can get Brett Smith as a teacher, absolutely take this. Calc 2 is a huge pre-req for a lot of majors so you really should take this if you can.",
    "Definitely. The second midterm is tougher than the first, but the professors are accessible and the review sessions and peer tutors help significantly.",
    "Yes! I think this course was great, and really enjoyed it, despite it being all new content for me. Brett was an amazing teacher, and it was nice how many resources were available to students taking this course and how attentive the teachers were.",
    "I would recommend this to students who would like to improve their understanding of single variable calculus, but already have a sound understanding of basic concepts.",
    "Yes, especially if this is a prerequisite. Although I had taken AP Calc BC in high school, this course, while covering the same content, was a good refresher on integration skills and helped me think about the content more in depth.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who has taken Calc BC or the equivalent prior, because having all of this material be completely new would definitely amplify the workload and difficulty. It's definitely doable if you are committed to math and to getting supplemental help, but without some Calc BC background, I would have struggled greatly and wish I had taken 112 first.",
    "yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It often gets a bad rap, and its course evaluations aren't always the greatest, but I think that's because it can be difficult for a lot of people and it doesn't always have the most interesting subject matter. That being said, the professors are great, the opportunities for improvement are consistent throughout the term, and the grading really tries to help you out. I would've enjoyed a bit more focus on real-world application (population growth, area problems, etc.) because sometimes the material feels kind of abstract and difficult to ground in intuitive principles.",
    "Yes, but you have to be very diligent about going to office hours or reading the textbook if you don't understand something. Lectures are helpful but not always enough to cover the gap of what you didn't understand from the exploration.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless it was a necessary requirement for a major.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but with specific teachers. I heard some professors were better than others. You cannot learn everything with the explorations and textbook if you have a bad professor",
    "If the student is interested in studying something related to calculus or STEM, I would recommend this class. Is helps build a strong foundation and understanding of calculus concepts. However, the knowledge form this class is quite specific, so if a student if just trying to fulfill a math credit I would not recommend this class. This class supplemented my econ class well.",
    "Yes, especially since it's a requirement for many different majors. Make sure you USE OFFICE HOURS, and collaborate with classmates whenever you can.",
    "If you need to take a math course, this is a fine one to take.",
    "Yes, it will solidify your knowledge of calculus, and show you how to look at the world in a more quantitative way.",
    "Only if it is required for your major.",
    "Yes, it is a well prepared and taught course.",
    "I don't know if I would or would not recommend it. I think it is a great introduction to a college-style math course and could help students become accustomed to the workload.",
    "If the student has a strong enough background in math\/extra time to work on the class if they don't have a strong background, then yes.",
    "I would recommend it if the student has already taken Calculus BC."
