    "I would recommend History 700 as a great class to take for a better understanding of the historiography of the United States. This class is also a great opportunity to engage with Yale faculty members from a variety of subjects. This class taught me how to write effective book reviews, and I now know about subjects like American economic history which I would otherwise not be as familiar with.",
    "A valuable course to take to introduce yourself to the US history department.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It provided an introduction to the historiography of the different subdisciplines of American history and so offered a platform for further study of particular areas of interest within these. It was also a good means to hear the faculty\u0092s views on theprofession and their particular inspirations and intentions for their work."

   "comments": [
    "This class offers homework and discussions on a variety of subjects, so while each week may not pertain specifically to my future dissertation or research, I believe it is important to take a historiography class to gain a better understanding of the different approaches to analyzing history. I'm really glad I was able to take a class like this my first semester of graduate school.",
    "The course immeasurably increased my knowledge of American history, and although this will not become an area of research, the course\u0092s focus on the historiographies of different subdisciplines provided me with many useful comparisons to my own research interests."
