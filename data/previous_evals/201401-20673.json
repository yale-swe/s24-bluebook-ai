   "comments": [
    "This is a class unlike any other at Yale. Being exposed to some of the biggest business leaders (and even smaller but equally interesting ones) was incredible, and getting to grill them on ethical decisions they and their companies have made was a rare opportunity that made for great discussions each week. Absolutely take this class.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Its hard yo get in but very worted. It is not the topical filosofical ethics class but a very dynamic and engaging class where each week we had a new super successful speaker explaining the hard ethical decisions in what he or she does",
    "Really interesting guests and minimal work until the final paper. I feel very neutral about the class as a whole though.",
    "Weekly guest lecturers on issues as broad as the 9\/11 compensation fund to Ashley Madison.",
    "This class was good but incorrectly named. It should not have been called business ethics. It should have been called: Listen to cool business people talk. Professor Mansharamani did his best to make it about ethics but most class just ended up being about business decisions with no ethical component. Still cool, but not a class about ethics.",
    "Obviously. Tremendously interesting class. Lots of incredible guest speakers. Vikram manages discussion well.",
    "There were a ton of really awesome guest speakers. While some of them obviously aren't used to teaching and were a little dry, Vikram put together a great list of people who have a lot of real world experience. In this way, the class is really unlike other classes - you get to hear from people who have actually done things in the real world (vs. academia). This can be both a plus or a minus, depending on what you're looking for - there isn't much theoretical or deep analysis about the work they're doing since we only spend one class on each dilemma (so for example, you'll only spend one class talking about investing in Africa, and while that could be a whole course, you only get 2 hours to talk about it). Obviously that's due to the nature of the course and I actually thought that was great - there was broad exposure to a lot of different topics. Vikram is also really helpful with stuff and really willing to meet during office hours\/outside of class. Definitely worth taking if you get into the class, but good luck - over 70 people showed up to the first class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! Business ethics is something that cannot be taught, but it can be learned through exposure and practice. Vikram is a great mentor and professor and he has built up a remarkable network. You get a lot of terrific exposure to different industries, ethical\/business reputation dilemmas, and industry leaders. I loved this class and would highly recommend it. Plus, it\u2019s not too much work and the material is very interesting!",
    "Business Ethics is a unique class in that the majority of the work deals with navigating real-life scenarios as opposed to remaining confined to the theoretical realm. I would describe the class as a series of Master's Teas where you do a moderate amount of background reading before class and directly engage with the speaker during class in an open discussion. In addition, the list of speakers is expansive and impressive in the number of industries and issues it covers with high-level decision makers. The workload is extremely reasonable- weekly reading responses, a mid-term assignment which outlines the final paper, and the final paper itself. Based on the turnout in Spring 2014, getting into the class will be the hardest part, but give it a shot and take it if you can get in.",
    "I would recommend it as an interesting seminar but I think the course would benefit from more than just Mr. Mansharamani teaching it. Having two people could be better."
