   "comments": [
    "Overview of ESG investing landscape, tools for analysis, ESG strategic thinking. Very rich discussions and nuanced insights, especially around value-first investing, measurement and engagement.",
    "Gained better understanding of finance in practice, as well as the principle elements of sustainable finance.",
    "Not many. On the plus side, the course provided a basic overview to an increasingly important topic, probably THE hot topic right now in private sector engagement on environmental issues. However, it was heavy on expectations and light on content. The course did not provide adequate preparation for the outputs required, making it necessary for students to learn complex topics on their own or rely on previous knowledge of their peers. The course left out the finance basics that should have been the basis for further learning, especially for a course with no pre-reqs. It would have been great to actually learn the tools of financial analysis. Jake's TA sessions tried to fill this gap (and they were great), but they weren't enough.",
    "This course gave me a pretty good understanding of the challenges related to investing in socially responsible businesses or alternative energy from the shareholders' and investors' perspective. I learned a lot from the speakers coming from various backgrounds and how they (or their companies\/organizations) approach the concept of sustainability in finance.",
    "I learned more about ESG integration into investment strategy, as well as issues with ESG data and how to interpret it. We also learned about interesting, emerging areas of the sustainable finance realm, like shareholder activism.",
    "Overview of what the sustainable finance history and landscape look like, from green banks and green bonds to ESG investing and conservation finance. Most importantly, I learned to look at how considerations of sustainability can and should play into the modern financial system, and how sustainability can actually add business value.",
    "I developed a firm understanding of the landscape of Environmental, Social and Governance factors as they are considered and incorporated (or not) into financial decision-making. The knowledge I developed was mostly in relation to how to evaluate Exchange Traded Funds, and to some extent securities. I gained skills in assessing the ESG validity and considerations of a given fund or security.",
    "In general, I got a good general understanding of ESG considerations and the field. I also feel I improved my general understanding of financial products, markets, etc.--a valuable addition to my FES curriculum.",
    "Good insights into sustainable investing practices and modern financing mechanisms for green industries.",
    "An overview of the sustainable finance world.",
    "Having no background in finance, I learned how to make financial models, how to evaluate a stock and how to think about markets in general.",
    "I learned important concepts in sustainable finance such as the different approaches to sustainable investing, green bonds, ESG integration, impact investing, the pros and cons of divestment. The class gave us an up-to-date understanding of what's happening in the sustainable finance space.",
    "Financial skills and analysis were an important part of a couple assignments, but they were not taught or referenced at all in lectures or reading. Those useful components were essentially self-taught.",
    "If you don't have any finance experience, the lectures themselves won't teach you much about finance, but the TA sessions and having to go through the assignment was super helpful in learning how to use the Terminal, conducting DCFs, etc.",
    "I came to understand more the finance world, how a portfolio is created and managed. I learned what is ESG and how these criteria are considered by funds, and the difficulties in measuring and reporting the ESG performance. I learnt that ESG can play a significant role in how a fund outperforms.",
    "Full range of topics under the umbrella of \"green investing\" as seen from the investors-side of the equation. Learned a ton about the challenges and opportunities for the near future in this space, from conservation finance to green bonds, private equity to mutual funds. Learned that these are actually accessible topics and that there are real tangible ways to get hired into this type of careers.",
    "I learned more from this class than any other this semester. I learned about SRI, ESG analysis, finance, portfolio management, endowment management, and the challenges to sustainable finance.",
    "Finance terms, concepts as they apply to sustainability.",
    "Understanding of how environmental and social responsibility can be integrated into financial decision-making.",
    "Please see my responses to the Business school evaluation.",
    "A valuable overview of the current sustainability landscape in the investment field. Learned a lot of about management of funds and green bonds.",
    "I have a much more nuanced understanding of the interplay between finance and sustainability trends",
    "Overview of some sustainable investing, issues and context. Did not have any prior experience with it.",
    "How to measure and evaluate environment, social, and governance metrics. Different debt and equity forms of sustainable investing and finance. How to analyze the sustainability of a company or portfolio.",

   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "Even better than I'd hoped.",
    "Very well.",
    "This course was extremely disappointing. It had great potential but it did not deliver on the execution.",
    "Generally, my expectations were met.",
    "It aligned with my expectations, though it would have been great to dive more deeply into certain topics rather than trying to cover the whole universe of sustainable finance in one semester.",
    "I knew very little about the space beforehand, so had no expectations. I was more than pleasantly surprised!",
    "I think the knowledge, skills and insights that I gained were in line with the expectations that I had going in. It was a very well constructed overview of many different aspects of sustainable investing, and while I would've like to have developed more skills that were directly useful for investing, that was not the thrust of the course per se, and hence I didn't really expect to have that be a core component of the material covered. The insights have inspired me to dig deeper on finance and that was something that I didn't expect necissarily, but really appreciate.",
    "It aligned fairly closely--I wish more time had been spent on the other forms of innovative sustainable finance options, instead of such an emphasis on stocks and company approaches. The few days on green bonds, social impact bonds and conservation finance were very interesting and seem to present greater opportunity for innovative thought.",
    "well",
    "Seemed like a survey class, not much rigorous technical content.",
    "Very well",
    "Conceptually it met my expectation. I would want more financial and quantitative training. This is especially true for FES or other non-SOM students. Early on in the class there should be more TA sessions, and resources should be distributed so that students can learn on their own, rather than waiting until before the final presentations for these resources to be distributed. If there are free online courses like on Coursera that the instructor can recommend to students, that would be great. Until the end of the course I still don't feel like I understand how to really value a company or a fund. But to be fair there are other courses such as Accounting and Corporate Finance that students can take at SOM to learn traditional finance.",
    "This was much more of a general survey course than I anticipated. There was almost no applied quantitative methodology.",
    "I wish we had been taught harder skills",
    "Given that in the shopping period the professors said that it was not necessary to have any finance background to take the course I expected there would be a rapid introduction to finance, the terms and the language at the beginning of the term. Even though there was a TA session on the basics of finance, in my view this was not enough. The midterm exam and the final financial valuation required specific knowledge and skills that were never taught in class. In this sense the most important skills that were gained by the course had to be self taught with no guidance or instruction from the professors.",
    "I loved this class and really got everything I wanted out of it. The range of topics was amazing and I learned a ton. I had a cursory background in financial concepts and some experience as an individual investor, and this was enough background for me to really get a lot out of every single lecture. The course would be better called \"sustainable investing\" than Sustainable Finance, because it really didnt consider the topics from the corporate-side very often. For example, how or why would a company structure and present themselves one way or another in order to attract the interest of the ESG investor? Is it worth it for them? Overall though, absolutely loved the material from start to finish.",
    "It exceeded my expectation",
    "Highly.",
    "I thought there would be quantitative skills learned and work being done",
    "The knowledge and insights surpassed my expectations. I do not feel as though I developed an extensive amount of new technical skills as a result of this course.",
    "Please see my responses to the Business school evaluation.",
    "The knowledge I got from this class exceeded my expectations and opened my eyes to an exciting, emerging field.",
    "I expected that I would have acquired more hard-finance skills, but otherwise the course met my expectations",
    "No, I have no background in finance or investing, struggled with getting caught up to speed.",
    "Met my expectations.",
    "Met my expectations.",
    "Very well"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very thoughtful and comprehensive overview of the ESG investing landscape. Professors are very engaging and knowledgeable. Great use of in-class guests and student presentations. Weaknesses: Variable student participation\/attendance.",
    "The greatest strength of this class was having Jake Resnik as a TA. He helped pull together the course content, fill in students gaps and make sure that we were all able to get a lot out of the experience. Having two professors was nice, though Cary's presentation style could sometimes be less than engaging, and it seemed as though there could have been more preparation. I would have appreciated having class time to go over some of the more technical financial concepts. I believe some of the lectures could have been made shorter. The guest speakers were great! I liked the final project, I would recommend having shorter presentations, because 3 ful lclass days of presentations is excessive and not necessarily productive.",
    "Overall, a very weak course. A strength is that it is essential for students with an interest in the business-environment intersection to understand the role of investment in shaping change, so I'm glad the course exists. However, the course felt hastily slapped together and lacked any semblance of structure. I would recommend adding a clear, thoughtful structure, starting with the basics. Also, don't waste time with endless group presentations, unprepared guest speakers, and collective GoogleDoc editing sessions. I understand it was a new class and a bit experimental, but it felt like amateur hour.",
    "Strength: the content of the course was very thought-provoking. I also liked the fact that a lot of information covered throughout the course was up-do date, relevant and realistic. The course helped me understand not only the challenges but also the major trends and various perspectives within sustainability finance. The professors really cared about this topic too. Weaknesses: I wish the classes also covered DCF analysis, actual methodology on how to approach company valuation and do sensitivity analysis. It felt very challenging at times to learn on your own and therefore, come up with a good quality final product (assignment) that was expected from us.",
    "Strength: provided a pretty holistic overview of the sustainable finance field. We had interesting speakers come into class, which were some of my favorite lectures. Otherwise, some of the course material is delivered in a really dull way. Professors could both work on their organization and delivery of material to make it easier for students to understand and engage.",
    "Strengths are definitely the professors and TA - they all had a wealth of experience and knowledge in the field. Weakness were some slight disorganization at times but they picked up the slack with ease.",
    "The course as I mentioned was a very strong overview, or survey of the investment universe. Many of the lectures, particularly those by Todd Court were very strong. Also the reading list was very relevant and well selected. The main weaknesses stemmed from there being too many visiting speakers, and the slightly less directed nature of their lectures. But this too again reinforced the strength that the survey aspect of the class was powerful and useful. Excellent course overall.",
    "Lecture could be a bit more dynamic. Sometimes it got dry. Both professors were very understanding and had great insights on the subject.",
    "Very poorly organized. Poor quality graphics, figures, powerpoints, and chalkboard lectures. Often lots of repetition, slow pace, and misused time in class (i.e. 45 min in class writing assignments?!) Lack of rigorous technical content or analysis. No presentation of counter positive opinions. TA saved the class from a trainwreck of poor notes and lectures -- the best learning was pushed to the TA sessions.",
    "THere's a lot of outside learning that is needed, which isn't necessarily a weakness, but this should be stated upfront.",
    "Pros: Great speakers, good reading, in fact one of my favorite classes at FES ever. It's on a cutting edge topic as all public agencies and NGOs are realizing their financial constraints and look to leverage the private sector's resources. This class should be offered every year. Cons: Not enough quantitative\/traditional finance. It'll be hard for a student with just this class to get a job in sustainable finance. Todd's lectures were very well-organized and clear. Cary's lectures can be disorganized, it'll be better if Cary begins with an outline of what he's going to cover in that particular lecture, and then at the end summarize the key points that students should take home.",
    "Some disorganization due to the newness of the course. Assignments were mostly helpful. Cary was obsessed with forming a portfolio through the course that felt like a forced add on. The final presentation - a stock pitch, maybe should have been the midterm with a full portfolio as the final (if professors really want to stick with the portfolio scheme). Good guest lecturers. Get rid of the in-class writings, those were useless.",
    "Strengths: - the topic is incredibly interesting and complex. - The invited lecturers were generally very interesting Weaknesses: - there is a lack of a necessary introduction to financial terms and structures. In this sense it would have been beneficial to have an introductory class or recommended readings to gain an overview of what are the basic terms that are constantly used in class. - The midterm Bloomberg analysis and the final company financial valuation did not reflect what was taught in class. It would have been appropriate to teach these skills during the course. - We were shown the different ESG indicators but we did not look into how they were calculated, and which one is appropriate to use according to diverse context. - There were very interesting topics such as Green Bonds and Social Impact Bonds that could have had more time and more attention. - There was one particular class on systems thinking towards the end of the semester that would have been more appropriate to have at the beginning of the course, and if the idea is to prioritize a systems thinking approach to sustainable finance then it would have been interesting to organize the classes with this structure in mind. Just to mention systems thinking as an additional topic did not make much sense.",
    "Strengths-- not including Cort strengths\/weaknesses here, see below. Most of the guest lectures were good, although I would have preferred a couple more class periods of actual course content and a couple less guests. The guy who skyped in, for example, was a bore. Krosinzky lectures were a bit more uneven than Cort but in general also good, and I appreciated his real-world, non-ivory-tower slant on topics. He was a great guy to have in the room and had lots of specific examples and experience. Appreciated the fact that we could choose our own topics for assignments and make our own choices of companies to study. That was great and allowed me to pursue a couple topics I was really interested in. The TA was fantastic and very very helpful. Drawbacks were very few: The final project was not organized well-- too many class periods spent on the group presentations, and not enough explanation of why we should CARE whether this imaginary portfolio did well or not.",
    "The strength was the syllabus, the guest lecturers, the midterm exam and the stock pitch, and Jake Reznick. The weakness was I felt there wasn't enough finance background and therefore I felt I was learning about a topic without understanding the topic's foundation. The TA did an excellent job hosting review sessions about finance, but I wish there had been more, and that there were more assigned background readings for the non-MBA students.",
    "I didn't get much out of watching the final presentations and they took up so many class sessions. I would have loved to learn more from our great teaching team.",
    "it's a great overview of sustainable investing, but not necessarily sustainable finance",
    "Please see my responses to the Business school evaluation.",
    "Lectures were sometimes difficult to follow because there as a lot of financial jargon was used, that I was not yet familiar with. Eventually, I became familiar with the terms. The TA session that went over basic financial concepts were good. But could have used a little more finance basics before using the terms in class.",
    "Since this course was almost evenly split between SOM and FES students, it would have been nice to offer an option finance boot camp for the FES students. I believe I would have gotten more from the course with a deeper understanding of the finance topics",
    "More background material being provided, having a mix of SOM with actual work experience in investing and FES with none was difficult. The TF carried a lot of the background material, otherwise I would have struggled even more than I did.",
    "This course is accessible to people with little background in finance. The readings and course lectures, while interesting, did not really prepare students for the midterm and final assignments. I would have liked to have spent more time critically evaluating methodologies for ESG ratings. Overall the course lacked structure, and I have difficulty pinpointing exactly what I learned.",
    "Strengths: great guest speakers. Felt the class assignments were valuable. Weaknesses: the lectures felt disjointed at times. In retrospect, I would have preferred to have become more familiar with financial concepts prior to taking this course. Perhaps it would have been better as a second-year, rather than in my first semester at FES."

   "comments": [
    "Lean in, do extra research on areas where you find interest, reach out to the professors and build relationships with them and your peers.",
    "The homework assignments are designed for the more technical skills, but you receive little feed back on them. The information is topical and interesting, though one of the professors has mediocore presentation skills. It will not give you a strong quantitative finace skill set, but you will be able to identify and evaluate an organization's ESG.",
    "This is more like a roughly planned lecture series than a course. It's good exposure to important topics, but it has a long way to go. Only take it if you really care about the material and are willing to learn mostly on your own or through your peers.",
    "Bring coffee to class.",
    "Take it if you're at all interested in sustainability, the environment, or finance. You won't be disappointed!",
    "It is absolutely a worthwhile course to take, whether you come at it from a standpoint of financial literacy and are trying to learn more about ESG, or if you come at it from an environmentally literate perspective and are trying to learn more about finance, it is a good bridging class to marry the worlds. Check it out!",
    "Just that it is very oriented towards the stock market and the corporate environment, versus other wider applications of finance for sustainable initiatives.",
    "Don't expect to learn finance. Its more of a \"economist\" type overview then any real analysis. Expect most of the reading to be repetition with several hundred pages per week -- with no insight from the professors which part is actually insightful to the advancement of the field or why they recommended that reading.",
    "Take this course and anything Todd Cort offers as it will be one of the few courses at FES that challenges you intellectually.",
    "A must-take if you are interested in the role of finance in sustainability. Also a good class if you are interested in corporate sustainability because investors are a major driver for companies to do more sustainability these days.",
    "Decent introductory class, but very light survey. If you're interested in finance, definitely supplement with other coursework.",
    "The course is interesting, it has a survey approach and the level of knowledge and skills you can gain from the course are dependent on how much you want to dig into the different topics. If you are interested in diving deep into financial analysis skills you can do this, but it will be mostly self-taught.",
    "Take it!! Great instructors, excellent assignments, and very useful, forward-looking content. Would recommend for people interested in careers in business\/finance OR people interested in ESG investing.",
    "This is an awesome class! I learned a huge amount, and the class provided numerous opportunities to meet industry experts, and deepen our learning outside the classroom.",
    "Take it! It was fabulous! Got so much out of it.",
    "Please see my responses to the Business school evaluation.",
    "This course gives you a solid overview of the sustainability landscape in finance.",
    "Great introduction to sustainable finance",
    "Maybe it will be better next year after our guinea pig experience.",
    "The class is fairly interesting and has a light workload.",
    "I suggest taking this class after becoming familiar with finance concepts. May be better as a second-year course.",
    "Basic understanding of financial terms will greatly help"
