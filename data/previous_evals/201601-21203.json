   "comments": [
    "\"Intro to Modern Philosophy\" probably doesn't encapsulate any of the reasons students are attracted to philosophy. It doesn't revolutionize the way you think. It doesn't break out of any Eurocentric boxes. That said, it provides a grounding in certain traditions, and fosters basic skills in argumentation. It's one of your better options for an intro philosophy course, mostly because Professor Winkler's lecture style is so human, candid, and engaging. He doesn't pretend to be your best friend, yet he's self-deprecating and endearingly quirky. Metaphysics is sometimes too silly to handle, but what can you do?",
    "Don't take it. You'll walk out with a surface level understanding of philosophy that deserves a lot more thought and time.",
    "I recommend this course for people who are interested in philosophy or for people who are unsure of their interest in philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It improves your writing ability. Even if you aren't interested in this topic, it's very informative and helpful.",
    "Great lecture, great class to take C\/D\/F.",
    "This was a great first philosophy course. Accessible material, and excellent professor, and introductory expectations. It's really low risk and engaging.",
    "While this is a survey lecture course (and thus a pretty big one), Professor Winkler is very attentive towards and engaged with students, even making the effort to call on everyone by name when fielding questions during class. He makes the material very accessible and offers interesting ways to connect theories about metaphysics (which may seem hard to apply to daily life) to salient issues such as race.",
    "Good survey of modern philosophy, focusing mostly on metaphysics and epistemology, also from a historical standpoint in showing how these philosophers dialogue with each other. Taking it with Winkler is really nice, as he's a great lecturer and does a good job of understanding what we as students need in order to grasp the ideas, as well as delivering on those needs.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Phil 126 to any student regardless of major, because it is an eye opening course that can shape and challenge one's worldview.",
    "Would definitely recommend!",
    "A comprehensive overview of the broad aspects of western philosophy. Very thought provoking and will get logic \/ existentialist questions to stay with you in your sleep. You will be stimulated to think in a new way, and to write more effectively. Philosophy truly does wonders to the brain.",
    "Tbh I had an awful time in this class. Once you get behind on the reading, there's no going back. There seems to be a manageable amount of nightly reading but it's philosophy -- if you want to understand what you're reading, it requires a lot more time and effort than you'd think. In terms of the exams, it was nice that we only had essays but I did not like the 3 short essays format for the first and last exams. Too much content to cover and stress trying to figure our what the hell you want to say about some philosopher, especially if you're not particularly good at analysis. Throw in a harsh TF and there goes a good grade in the class. In terms of lecture, it was oftentimes dry. Admittedly, I'm not a philosophy person so I only took this class because I originally found the material interesting. But ultimately, it was hard to keep up so even the mildest interest I have turned into \"who cares\" and a deep regret for taking this class. If you think you might be in the same boat, I doubt I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is a very thorough introduction to philosophy that I would recommend, regardless of previous philosophy knowledge (I had none). Prof. Winkler is a great lecturer, with well organized classes. For each philosopher you read his\/her work and then analyze the strength of their arguments. The Beinecke visit to see the original books we were reading was also pretty cool! Readings are a good length, and the supplementary readings provide a more modern perspective on topics like God, race, and gender (kudos for including an anthology of women philosophers) and writing the three papers is pretty interesting. I did think the grades were a little harsh for an intro class, and section was pretty rambling. Overall a very thought-provoking class!",
    "Excellent introduction to metaphysics and epistemology. Light workload and extremely fascinating. The most intellectually stimulating class that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Highly recommend it if you are looking for a first philosophy class. It's also a good introduction to writing philosophy papers.",
    "Philosophy 126 provides an intriguing overview and introduction to early modern philosophy from Descartes to Kant. The professor's lectures and handouts are accessible and highly informative, and the reading list is excellent. Paper assignments are characterized by a rewarding and stimulating selection of essay topics and prompts. I would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "This course is a decent intro class to philosophy. However it is very easy to not keep up in work and fall behind given the structure. I would recommend.",
    "Take it for an intro to modern Phil",
    "I would recommend PHIL 126 to any student that wants to gain a broad exposure to early modern philosophy with more depth in some philosophers. Besides teaching me specific knowledge on philosophies, it also taught me how to break down and construct solid arguments with awareness of assumptions that have been made. Even if the assumptions seem innocent or trivial when not stated, I've seen that explicit statements of each step in the argument make it clear when a step cannot be supported. Although I had no formal experience of philosophy, I found this course to be very accessible. There is always help available, if asked ahead of time, to develop your ideas before writing an essay. Overall, it is a very enjoyable course that you should consider taking regardless of your major.",
    "I would recommend this class. Early modern philosophy is something everyone should learn about as it propelled the tradition of critical thinking.",
    "Great intro to philosophy. Very engaging and grading isn't as harsh as more advanced philosophy classes. definitely recommend to any student who want to embark on his or her first philosophy journey.",
    "Fantastic survey course of early modern philosophy. Professor Winkler is a vibrant and engaging lecturer and a pleasure to meet with at office hours. This was my first philosophy course, and the structure was perfect for me...not too much reading or writing, but plenty of deep exposure to the most important philosophical works of the modern western tradition. Winkler is himself a master and a pleasure to learn from, and the workload is quite reasonable. Also, great introduction to the art of philosophy writing for those less experienced in the genre. Professor Winkler's lectures are the sort you want to transcribe word for word so that you can have the pleasure of revisiting his fascinating arguments and examples years down the road. I was captivated from day 1, and could reliably count in lecture to give me a foundational understanding of the texts that went way beyond their respective surfaces on the very first time through them. Overall, would highly, highly recommend taking a class with Prof. Winkler!",
    "Great class for freshmen thinking about majoring in Philosophy. Take it as soon as possible, since it provides with a solid background for many other future philosophy courses.",
    "I would not recommend it as a first philosophy course though pitched as such because there are so few assignments and so little help in terms of learning to write a philosophy paper. Philosophy papers are not intuitive to write the first time, and the first paper is the midterm. Additionally, I found the structure of making 3 two page papers due at once was confining and difficult to satisfactorily develop any argument of interest. However, I found the material taught in lecture engaging.",
    "If you're a philosophy major like me you have to take it. It's a bit hard to get through because the material is dense and though parts of it are still very relevant to conversations we're having today, some of it feels just silly. I took another philosophy class alongside this that was more like a junior seminar and we covered some of the same material, and it was more interesting. Honestly, though, that's just a function of the class being a history of philosophy lecture rather than a metaphysics seminar.",
    "For anyone looking for a comprehensive survey course of early modern philosophy, I think this course was brilliant."
