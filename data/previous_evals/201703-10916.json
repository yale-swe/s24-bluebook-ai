    "The course should be better organized.",

    "The course not only provided basic framework of macroeconomic analyses (e.g. recursive equilibrium) but also reviewed a few specific issues macroeconomists have been tackling (e.g. equity premium puzzle), which may help students get some research questions.",
    "First quarter psets were too long. Didn't get the midterm back until December. No notes or slides in the second half.",
    "More motivation for the material in the first half.",
    "First half lecture difficult to follow, skips many steps and not very clear. Problem sets were pretty out of the blue--lecture did not prepare students well to do the problem sets, but exam was fair. Second half lecture great, engaging, relevant policy applications, and problem sets also challenging yet fair and manageable. Maybe a bit more \"big picture\" info on why each model is important would be nice."
