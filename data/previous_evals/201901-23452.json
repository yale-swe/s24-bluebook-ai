    "A critical analysis of feminisms through art. How orthodox women critic the faith through art and ritual!",
    "This course allowed me to further my engagement with intersectional feminist studies and contemporary artists. I gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of both what it means to be Jewish and the relationship of Judaism to various waves of feminism.",
    "I learned a lot about a field in art history which I was completely unaware of. Although it was challenging to prepare a reading response each week, I loved leading discussions and seeing how other students led them too. Due to very relaxed atmosphere in this course I became very comfortable with leading discussions, something I was terrified of. Thank you!"

    "great conversation!",

    "YES! Professor Olin and Professor Sperber are engage teachers and mentors. They let us guide the conversations and just gave amazing readings, art, and ideas to prepare with. They cultivated an encouraging and exciting class atmosphere where all voices were respected and appreciated. They also provided superb consultations for our final paper!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if the student was planning on studying feminist art history. By design, it familiarized the students with the feminist art movements both in the United States and in Israel from the 70s to the present day, and situated feminist art in the context of Jewish women artists. It was a thoughtfully designed and very engaging course, and challenged students to think about intersectionality in the art world.",
    "Definitely. The course provides a lot of knowledge in a very nice and relaxed atmosphere."
