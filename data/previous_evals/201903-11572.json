    "The small class size was good for discussion. The articles we read were challenging and interesting. The only thing that can be an improvement is letting the students know what exactly we're reading at least a week before the class.",
    "The course is taught like a graduate course, which means it is a seminar in which the teacher and students discuss a few papers each week. The papers that we read were almost all really interesting and insightful. Professor Aronow is good at explaining which parts of the papers are important and which can be ignored. He gets off topic at times, but trust me, that is one the best parts of the class. The only thing that can be improved is that the professor could upload the papers in a more timely manner."

    "Take it. Aronow is the best at what he does.",
    "Yes, this course is really chill and you learn a lot. Additionally, Professor Aronow is always available during office hours to discuss pretty much anything. The research project at the end is open-ended and you can choose to study pretty much anything."
