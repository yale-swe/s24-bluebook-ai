    "no. not worth it.",
    "9am classes are always difficult to do, but at least this class was interesting enough to keep us all awake. It's a very good introduction to American Indian History and Professor Mt. Pleasant is great. The workload is manageable, with an in-class midterm (which was a little difficult), a short (5pg) book review, a final research paper(7pg), and a final take-home exam. Definitely worth it if you're wanting to learn more about the material or even just looking for a humanities credit.",
    "Basic survey history of American Indians in the United States from prehistory to nearly the present.",
    "A mixture between a seminar and lecture. Professor Mt. Pleasant expects students to participate. But there are no sections.",
    "Very interesting material, not that thrilling of a classroom experience. The reading is very interesting and the research project allows you to explore an area of your own interest within the class. Final is a take home, and the questions were so generic as to allow a wide range of answers.",
    "I would not recommend this course. You are better off reading a textbook on the subject.",
    "Good course if you would like a pre-Industrial credit for History, or a basic American Indian history - but beyond that, the course was less intriguing than I had hoped. It also met at 9am and was very small, so this did not help in making the class more interesting",
    "I would recommend this course because it is not TOO demanding of a history course, and is actually very interesting.",
    "The lectures are hard to sit through, especially at 9 am. If you don't know anything about the true history of American Indians, though, you should take it. You'll learn a lot."
