   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I developed research and visual interpretation skills specific to the discipline of art history which was interesting for me coming from a different discipline.",
    "I learned about the qualities and conventions of the picturesque and the sublime, and about how they are and aren't applied in various British landscape contexts, both domestic and colonial, and I learned especially how to find resistance in colonial landscapes.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about the art of Britain and its colonies in the 18th and 19th centuries. The course really helped me to think more globally about the history of art and to consider the history of colonization and its influence on artistic traditions. I developed a useful knowledge of particular artists and their work, but more importantly learned to ask questions about power and genre convention.",
    "This course was an absolute joy. I knew very little about landscape as a genre prior to the course, but gained great appreciation for the genre and all of its political implications. I especially appreciated the breadth of the globe covered and felt like I learned not only content, but also various methods that will be applicable for the rest of my studies.",
    "Knowledge developed: geographical expansion of the British Empire, and how that influenced artistic programs. Also, how colonizing projects influenced the rhetoric of landscape, and how the visual output from British artists in colonies contributed to attitudes of British expansionism. Skills: visually deciphering landscape compositions, particularly in the formats of the sublime and\/or picturesque. Also handling artworks, folios, books, etc. in person for research. Dr. Barringer handled original materials for us at the end of each class (we migrated over to special collections in the YCBA) and encouraged us to come back and work with them directly. Insights: landscape wasn't a medium created and maintained by artists alone. The opinions and sketches of of mountaineers, militia, scientists, and plantation owners not only contributed to this visual dialogue, but they themselves were also influenced by visual representations of land.",
    "I vastly expanded my knowledge of landscape painting in the British empire and am now significantly more familiarized with contemporary scholarly approaches to landscape painting.",
    "I learned how to think about the movement of conceptual systems of picture-making, the validity of cross-cultural comparison, and began to think about the interconnectivity of colonial systems of power and representation.",
    "A fantastic introduction to the genre of landscape painting in Britain. Learned the theoretical framework for studying landscapes, including the picturesque and the sublime, and how these aesthetics morphed as the genre was transported across the globe under the British Empire. The class emphasized visual analysis and was heavily based on the YUAG collection.",
    "I think one of the most helpful texts I walked away with during the course was Tom Mitchell's anthology Landscape and Power, and specifically his essay \"Imperial Landscape\" and its prefacing \"theses on landscape.\" I appreciated Geoff Quilley's essays on the Tahitians as a maritime superpower all their own for the \"South Pacific,\" and texts that similarly revealed how British landscape discourses of the the 18th and early 19th centuries situated indigenous peoples inside of myths of antiquity, comparing them and their political institutions to Greeks and Romans. The notion also that Britain's elites felt threatened by a decline into the sensuous consumer capitalism enabled by its nouveaux riche merchant class, and injected this threat into the decaying ruins of the campagna that punctuate the picturesque image was particularly helpful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The greatest strength of the course is its instructor's in depth knowledge of the subject matter and the resources of the Yale Center for British Art where we had our classes.",
    "Tim has a great eye for secondary readings that will balance an understanding of canonical interpretations of landscape painting with more innovative strategies. The paintings he chose told a clear story without in any way stifling other interesting interpretations and narratives of this Global (and yet British) landscape tradition.",
    "The course was well organized and generally very well taught. Seminars were engaging, readings were generally interesting, and assignments were all useful. The material was presented in an incredibly approachable manner, which made it accessible to students from diverse fields of specialty. Our rapid fire presentations at the end of the semester of our in-progress papers was very helpful, but I wish we had had more time to discuss each student's project. That may, though, have been an inevitable result of the small class size.",
    "The only weakness I can comment on is possibly the lack of opportunity to fully engage with all of the readings. The course allowed us the incredible opportunity to see and discuss works of art in person at the YCBA, but at times it felt like we missed out on the opportunity to talk about the readings. I would not, however, want to lose the YCBA portion - I only wish the course could be three instead of two hours!",
    "Strengths: The format was fantastic. Tim would give a 20min lecture that provided and thematic and visual overview that connected the readings assigned for that day. This was wonderful because he didn't sum up the articles but commented on them with new images and relevant insights. The last portion of class was almost always in special collections where we could put in practice what we discussed in the classroom. Tim would get so excited in special collections, class almost always went over the allotted time. It may be better to make this class another 20min longer so students know what to expect. Weaknesses: daily student presentations. These are wonderful, insightful, and necessary--I learned much from these. However, even though Tim told us in person to limit these presentations to a certain timeframe, as the semester wore on they got longer and longer and took away from precious lecture time or time with the items in special collections. Perhaps a more defined rubric (that includes time constraints) could be helpful in this regard. Tim did a great job timing us all on the final day of class when we made student presentations. Perhaps something similar throughout the semester?",
    "The class was strong in all aspects; Prof. Barringers deft management of class discussion and use of university materials were particularly wonderful.",
    "I enjoyed learning out of the YCBA's collection, and found the engagement with primary materials-- many not at all well-known-- to be highly valuable. However, sometimes I felt that our class discussion never reached the depth it could have because we had to rush up to the object study rooms. Overall, I really enjoyed exploring the same things across a diverse array of geographical locations and cultures represented in the collections.",
    "Strengths -- use of the YUAG collection, excellent secondary and primary source reading material, student presentations sparked robust class discussions Weaknesses -- heavy reading workload; it would be helpful if the readings were ranked in importance, as towards the end of the semester it was impossible to do every single reading.",
    "I don't think my understanding of the picturesque, sublime, or beautiful have advanced much beyond the hazy, impressionistic level that they were at the beginning of the course. This is not to say that I don't know how the picturesque, sublime, or beautiful operate. The problem is that I know how they operate *too well* for my own good, to the point that the repoussoir or atmospheric obscurity are cliches that I can't back up with adequate scholarly name-dropping. I have a poor understanding of Gilpin and Burke, and would very much have preferred leaving Global Landscape with the ability to cite from a Dialogue upon the Gardens at Stowe. I similarly feel that while I can argue that, say, the picturesque is implicated in power struggles, I have a poor grasp of the historiography of this program. I'd need to take an orals field with Tim on Global Landscape to improve my name recognition of the various talking heads in play."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in either the British Empire or art of the British empire.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only is it a new way of looking at a landscape, but I think many of the methodological strategies involved (strategies that operate both to interpret landscapes straightforwardly but also to trouble apparent meanings and find depth of other kinds) are likely to be applicable no matter what material one looks at.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend the course. I found the material extremely interesting, and I think it is useful for an art historian to grapple with questions of power and empire. The professor is excellent and seminars were exciting.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to other students - it caters to a wide range of disciplines and subject areas, which fostered fantastic group conversation.",
    "100%. Tim is a fantastic teacher\/person and this subject is his specialty.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes-- Tim is a wonderful and engaging professor who really makes his materials come alive. It was a privilege to watch him unpack paintings in the gallery. The course's breadth is an advantage: everyone had the chance to learn a little bit about representation in many geographic regions, and then could specifically focus in on what interested them most in the final paper.",
    "I would highly recommend the course as it offers a strong foundation in an integral genre of painting during the 18th and 19th centuries, which still shapes how landscapes are depicted, discussed, and even created in nature today.",
    "I would recommend it exclusively on the basis that it provides students a chance to work with the unparalleled and pitifully unresearched collections out of the Yale Center for British Art. I appreciated Tim's attempt to direct students to these understudied objects and engage his class in direct, object-based inquiry. There's nothing better than working with the archive itself and the course was structured to take full advantage of these resources. That said, it might have been structured *too well* to take full advantage of these resources, as our weekly visits to the Prints and Drawings study room often devolved into an abortive attempt by Tim to introduce all the objects he'd called up for that day and fitfully marshal our interests!"
