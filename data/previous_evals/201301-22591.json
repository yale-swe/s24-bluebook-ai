   "comments": [
    "If you are comfortable with C++ coming into the course, it will be relatively easy. Otherwise, expect to learn a lot of C++ on your own. Small homework assignments are easy and fun. Final project is to make a 3D game, which is a nice thing to have under your belt. Midterm project is to make a raytracer; this is a bit of a pain, as the skeleton code is buggy and undocumented. However, the grading for that was very reasonable, as it was for everything else. Lectures cover high-level aspects, and readings cover the details, in an almost disjoint manner; be warned that you'll be tested on both, so learn the algorithms and formulas properly and quantitatively. Be careful about these pitfalls (maybe take two weeks beforehand to learn C++\/STL), and you'll have a great time!",
    "CS 478 is a great class to take, particular if you're interested in how graphics are rendered. It's important to note, however, that this class is challenging, particularly if your previous experience in coding is limited (I only took 201 and 223 before taking 478). However, if you plan ahead and leave time to ask the TA about psets before they're due, this class is reasonable and rewarding.",
    "This is a good class but depending on your background it could either be too nitty-gritty or too elementary.",
    "Good comp sci elective even if you are still early-ish in the major. Start the raytracer and the final project early! The midterm exam is pretty unpleasant but after you get through that (and the raytracer) the rest is pretty fun (though still pretty work intensive).",
    "This is a decent class if you want to learn more about Computer Graphics. You probably want to take MATH 222 or get a basic understanding of linear algebra before taking this class, though, because you'll do a lot of math in this class involving vectors, normals, and matrices.",
    "Er... CAUTION AHEAD. The course material is very interesting BUT taught in such a way that it loses a lot of its interest. Professor Dorsey is quite dry and even confusing in her lectures and seemed quite disorganized this semester. Outside of class she is very reasonable, willing to listen, kind, and interested in helping you out. If you're trying to get an idea of what graphics is or if it's a field you want to go into, I don't think you should take this class because I don't think it will tip you in either direction. This was my situation entering the course - I thought it was something I might really like and after taking the course I still think it's something I might really like. But I also don't feel any more equipped to answer those questions. The course is just taught too poorly, the assignments too difficult and disorganized, and the overall picture too vague to get a lot out of it. I would seek out other ways of learning about graphics. Perhaps talk to Professor Dorsey and see what other options there are. Also, the course load will kick your butt so be warned about that too.",
    "A LOT of work. You may end up spending just as much as you did in 323. However, you will learn quite a bit, and for me, the course was very rewarding. Take it if your semester isn't too busy.",
    "Yes, if you're into graphics. A lot of math, and C++ really helps.",
    "The math isn't too bad and the problem sets\/projects are fun. Only take if you have an interest in graphics.",
    "A great course for learning computer graphics. Homework assignments are a bit difficult but highly enjoyable. Final project takes a lot of time but is very rewarding to complete."
