    "Definitely take this class! Plantinga is fantastic and the classroom environment is pretty informal. For a class about music in European thought (entirely concerning Monteverdi, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven and the contemporaneous political\/philosophical thought), I learned a lot and enjoyed myself.",
    "This is a great class to credit\/d if you care about western music and its place in a historical context. The workload is light, and it's only once a week. Definitely worthwhile for anyone who is curious about music history.",
    "I took it Credit D, which I thought was nice and a very stress free class. It's difficult to gauge your grade however, because I think it depends on the students. There are few assignments.",
    "Professor Plantinga is a gem. Take this class if you have the opportunity."
