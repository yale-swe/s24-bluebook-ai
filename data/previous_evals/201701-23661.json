   "comments": [
    "It is good at teaching you but very hard at grading.",
    "I had a good professor and the class was great about teaching culture as well as language. I wish we practiced more conversation.",
    "Strengths: practice speaking every day, online homework forces students to have consistent practice with grammar Weaknesses: much of the work is tedious and does not help (FLASH CULTURA)",
    "it could have been better at developing speaking skills, by speaking all in spanish but making sure that the spanish was spoken slowly",
    "I thought that the flash culturas were graded very harshly for a homework assignment. However on the supersite homework, I liked that you were given 3 attempts.",
    "Strengths: many varied assignments that got you practicing Spanish every day. Weaknesses: too focused on exams and grades. Many students are freshmen straight out of high school, so they are still coming in with the \"get the grade\" mentality, rather than a desire to learn a new language. I think the syllabus is also too much geared towards a bunch of quizzes, tests, and presentations. Also, there should be more freedom given to individual instructors, and it was a bit too Spain-oriented."
