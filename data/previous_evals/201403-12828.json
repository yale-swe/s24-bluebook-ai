   "comments": [
    "FREN 110 is an intense but extremely rewarding course. I would recommend it to anyone who is at all interested in learning French.",
    "good",
    "French 110 was a good experience. Like almost any lower level language class, there will be a lot of work, but once you get past some of the often repetitive exercises the class is thoroughly enjoyable. Don't get caught off guard by the easiness of the first few tests. They will most definitely get harder as you go along. If you take the course, make sure you study hard at the beginning to give yourself a little grade buffer as the semester progresses. Also, try to get Koizim. She's great",
    "It is a hard class, so I would not recommend it if you are looking for an easy language. Ruth Koizim is the best, so I don't know how the class is with Grad students, but I would recommend this class overall.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to start learning a language, take it. Realize: for best results, you must do the nightly homework. These can be looong (2 hours) on the days after videos (Tuesdays for us), but on the grand scheme, are highly manageable and very rewarding. I cannot wait to continue.",
    "Take it because its effective but you should know its a very heavy workload and if you want a good grade you will have to work hard for it.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. I found it a challenging but worthwhile course.",
    "French 110 is an introduction course for beginners to the language. I would recommend this course, but only if the student has an adequate amount of time. There is a lot of homework and with watching multiple videos multiple times per week, it can be difficult to manage your time effectively. It is also important to note that the class is taught entirely in French, and while it may seem overwhelming at times, it is possible to be successful."
