    "I would recommend the class as an excellent introduction to the high redshift universe.",
    "ASTR 565 presents extragalactic astronomy as a synthesis of almost all astronomical knowledge we have so far. It covers basics of stellar evolution, galaxy properties and cosmology in the beginning, moving on to studying evolution of the universe in two aspects (theoretically and observationally) and ending with current state of knowledge on evolution of galaxies. I would recommend it to all astronomy students, those who plan to have a thesis topic in the field, but also for those who don't because Pieter does a great job of painting a big picture which all astronomers should be aware of."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very relevant for my thesis research topicwise, but also in presenting not only basic, well established knowledge on the subject, but also current state of the field. This was emphasised through commenting on recently posted papers on arxiv, as well as in homework assignments where we usually had to compare a recent paper to the classic one and comment on the way field progresses."
