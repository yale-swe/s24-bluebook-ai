    "I took it becauuse I thought it would be exciting\/ wanted to see the engineering side of things and was very dissappionted how boring it was",
    "Terrible class. Easy material, but an overwhelming workload: 75 minute mandatory sections, awful psets, Saturday morning midterms, and a final project that you need programming experience to accomplish.",
    "This course has potential as a topic (and could be very interesting if taught well), but with Kailas Purushothaman teaching, it was legitimately awful. I'll just paste my professor review here to explain why: First and foremost, he was impossible to hear--he talked very quietly in a room with a loud air conditioning system, and usually faced into the board. This made it impossible to hear him. (I was once curious, so I recorded 60 seconds of audio of him talking, and compared it to a 60 second sample of another one of my professors in the same classroom, and found that given the decibel levels he was ~1\/3 the volume). Likewise, he wrote very faintly on the board, so it was very difficult to read what was going on. These two combined meant that the only way I could follow was to watch his hand moving to visualize in my head what characters he was writing, and therefore imagine the formulas to get them into my notes. This also meant that if one lost track of something there was no way to recover mid-explanation. On top of this, the explanations were very poorly explained, and often turned out to be wrong later. Then, there were issues with how he interacted with the class. Whenever he would ask a question, and someone would answer, he would ALWAYS cut them off mid-sentence and try to complete the idea they were saying. Conversely, when a student asked a question he would often not seem to listen to what they had said but rather just repeat, word-for-word, what he had just said, which didn't clear anything up. Additionally, if someone gets the answer right to a question he asks, he would respond by first acting like they were wrong, then proceeding to say the same answer they had just given. For example, a direct quote from class I wrote down: S: \"It's related to Theta\" P: \"Well, actually ... it's related to theta\" and S: \"It's P times Theta\" P: \"Actually, it's positive so it's P times Theta.\" This type of response, in addition to making the student feel wrong when they were right, added to the confusion of the class, because it made correct answers seem incorrect, and left us confused what to believe. Finally, with the final project, he assigned an immensely difficult design problem involving the simulation of the loads in a solar car's frame. He seemed to believe that this project would be simple, but kept having to revise it because it turned out to be more complex than he thought. For example, he had to remove one of the 5 main goals of the project because he figured out it was impossible, and for another one had to look up a formula (which we didn't cover in class) from a book in the library that cited N.A.C.A, the predecessor to NASA which was disbanded in 1958. That said, each of these changes he only told to one or two members of the class, and the rest of us just found out by hearing it on facebook from each other.",
    "Do not take this class unless it is necessary for your major. The class should be worth 1.5 credits because of the amount of time put into it. The professor is very nice and means well, but does not excel at teaching this subject.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF KAILAS IS TEACHING. It will be an extraordinarily frustrating time for you without actually learning anything. He talks so quietly that you can't hear him sitting in the second row. He didn't wear a microphone (even though there was one in the room) even after we asked him to. During class, he would ask a question that no one would hear, and he would just stop talking and expect an answer. We would sit in silence for several minutes. His handwriting is almost illegible, both on the board and on the scanned online notes- rendering them basically useless. He took attendance and gave pop quizzes, so it wasn't like people could just use the textbook. Who gives pop quizzes in college? We had mandatory 75 minute section (with attendance taken also) so you waste a lot of time on this class. The section would have been okay but Kailas taught it too, not the TA, so it was just a reprise of class- though we did talk about the homework instead of getting new material. Unfortunately, he wanted everyone to come to section with the homework done (4 days before it was ACTUALLY due) to check answers, so effectively you would have 3 days to do the pset, or you waste your time in section. .... Its such a shame. I think the material actually could have been good and interesting if taught by literally anyone else- or nobody! the textbook for the class is quite good. The first part of the course is basic physics (free-body diagrams) and thats basically it. It never really gets more complicated, there are just variables that you have to keep track of. The final project comes out of nowhere, takes a lot of time. Kailas will ask you to meet with him individually multiple times about it- still not helpful one-on-one. ...... In short, do anything you can to NOT take this class if Kailasnath Purushothaman will be teaching it. Even if some other class says this is a pre-req, you will be able to figure the class material out without actually taking this class. Don't do it with him- its not worth a semester worth of frustration.",
    "This class is required for MechE students and apparently it used to be awesome when Dufresne taught it, but if Purushothaman is teaching it again DON'T TAKE IT. Just take it next semester. He's possibly the worst lecturer ever.",
    "I definitely would not recommend this course if you are not a MechE major. I have heard good things about the class under different professors, so I'm sure your experience will not be as negative as mine if you do not have Professor Purushothaman. He is a very nice and caring man, but I do not think his teaching style was helpful to me in learning the material.",
    "I would not recommend MENG 280 to any student. This is the most disappointing class I have taken at Yale. The lectures were nonsensical and uninteresting, and the professor was consistently difficult to understand. The material is very easy, just a repetition of PHYS 180 with a focus on engineering structures; while this was helpful considering I had to teach myself all of the material, it also made the process more excruciating because it was barely engaging. If this class is not required for your major, then do not consider taking it, even if you think you are interested in the material; literally any class at Yale will be more worthwhile than this one. If it is required for your major, wait to take it with someone reasonable; I heard Professor Dufresne was quite good.",
    "This is one of the first core classes in mechanical engineering and it really does introduce you to the fundamental concepts and topics that make up the major. It is undoubtedly an incredibly important class, and it utterly frustrates me that this class could not be taught better. There is often little clarity about the expectations of problems\/assignments, and the final exam\/final project combination was very overwhelming. In addition, we had mandatory Sunday\/Monday night sections (unheard of in STEM), along with pop quizzes (also somewhat unheard of in STEM). I know several students who dropped the class, even dropped this MAJOR, because of the way it was taught this semester. The teacher was super knowledgeable and available time-wise, don't get me wrong. The whole experience just could have been way more effective\/less painful than it was.",
    "WARNING: pop quizzes, midterms on SATURDAY, section on SUNDAY, and a project at the end that requires CODING (not a prerequisite). Take this with a different prof if possible.",
    "Being in this class was like sitting and watching a car crash happen twice a week and not being able to stop it. If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it, and I'm so sorry. It takes Newtonian physics and just makes them 1000x more confusing. The mandatory problem sessions were on Sunday and Monday nights, with the problem sets not being posted until Friday afternoons which was incredibly frustrating. Professor Purushothaman is very kind, but his lessons are very confusing and unorganized and his attempts to involve the class often fail (partly the students own faults, and partly because we were all so lost all the time). This class is painful but not the most difficult and thank god for that, because if the material were any harder, everyone would have failed.",
    "The professor is a genuinely nice guy that wants you to do well. Unfortunately, his teaching is near impossible to pay attention to and general communication about everything is far from great.",
    "Terrible class. Learned everything from the book - the professor was completely useless. Wasn't clear at all, mumbles all the time, and can't understand him. Problem-solving sessions are unreasonable and problem sets are given too late in the week. Midterms were timed with two parts (each part was timed which is pretty stupid) and are on Saturdays. The TA was much better, but the professor always intervened whenever someone went to the TA for help. Worst professor at Yale and worse than my high school teachers - he should not be teaching any class here.",
    "Take this amazing subject if it's not taught by Professor Purushothaman.",
    "If you're looking at this class you're probably an engineer or trying to do architecture or something. As a mechanical engineer speaking, this will not be the hardest class you have to take, but it is one of the most foundational ones. The concepts in the beginning are easy but get harder as the class progresses. The math to go along with it also steadily increases in difficulty. If you have to take this class with Kailsanath, DO NOT TAKE IT. He is a horrible lecturer and professor, you will learn absolutely nothing from him. Probably the worst part about the class is the Saturday midterms and the project, that is 15% of your grade, that he gives you in the last three weeks of the semester. If you have to take this class for a requirement wait till to you get a good professor, otherwise if you're not engineering I definitely wouldn't recommend this class."
