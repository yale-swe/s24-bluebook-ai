    "This class didn't live up to its potential. If you're interested in art\/color, then you will definitely enjoy the readings, etc...but the class itself was poorly run\u2014discussions were not helpful, and instead were tedious and unnecessarily drawn out, as were critiques. I feel as though I could have learned just as much doing the readings\/assignments on my own.",
    "COLOR! A vibrant class for both majors and non-majors- an opportunity to read great texts on color, go to museums + galleries + different color spaces, and explore concepts through work of your own. Especially if you're interested in art + art history, pigments\/material culture, perception and cognitive science, this is a great way to combine those things.",
    "I am really torn about this course. If your interested in color (or aesthetic, art, media, etc.) it's such a useful and interesting way of learning to see and re-see your work and the world. I am really happy to be walking away with the sorts of insights and knowledge I picked up in this class. That said, I found the day to day grind less than thrilling and many of the assignments a bit dull, rooted in a type of busy work that sometimes drove me mental (and sometimes class meetings would drag). If you don't like busy work, don't take this class. If your'e down to suffer through some of that in the interest of gaining a pretty great comprehensive survey about color, then you'll survive just fine and maybe even like it."
