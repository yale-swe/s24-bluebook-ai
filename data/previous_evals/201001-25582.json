    "Great Class",
    "This class is great for solidifying your French speaking and writing ability. You do this through grammar exercises, writing exercises, and various readings. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "French 151 is basically your typical high school French class. Material can be rather tedious, but if you want to learn a foreign language it's pretty much necessary to get through this type of class in order to have the appropriate skills for the more interesting classes. Quite a lot of work though.Prof. Sherak is a very nice lady and tries really hard to help out her students, both during class and in making herself available to go over things with you outside of class.",
    "If you are passionate about French or are serious about wanting to improve your French reading, writing, and speaking abilities, then I DEFINITELY recommend French 151 (as well as French 150...and, if you're super serious, take BOTH one right after the other, REALLY). This course will REALLY help you solidify your grasp on grammar; it will teach you ENORMOUS amounts of very useful vocabulary; and it will expose you to some really great, interesting, and fun works of literature and film. The course is a fair amount of work...rarely, if ever, do you leave class without a homework assignment (or several) for the next class. However, the work is definitely manageable (especially if you enjoy French, in which case it's fun!) and a lot more fun and interesting than the work for many other classes...AND it REALLY pays off, so like I said, if you are serious about wanting to improve your French speaking\/reading\/writing abilities, this is WITHOUT A DOUBT the course for you. Lastly, DEFINITELY take this class with Constance Sherak. She is super nice and SUPER dedicated to her students; she really wants every one to succeed to the best of their ability and she does everything in her power to help you along.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, because it really solidified my previous knowledge of grammar and improved my speaking skills. It also involved some interesting texts and movies.",
    "It's exactly what you would expect, although with a little bit more work that I was anticipating. If you want to improve your French, take it. If you need a language credit, well, you have to take it.",
    "Lots of work, like all French classes, but a good first L5 class to take to consolidate your knowledge of french.",
    "I would recommend French 151 03 for a fellow student. It offers the perfect opportunity to perfect your French grammar, and get a taste of French films and literature. The course is very structured so once you get used to the workload and the requirements, it becomes easy.",
    "i would probably recommend the other L5 because its a lot of busy work if what you're interested in is learning to speak the language"
