    "This is a good course. Feiszli is a great prof -- probably the most clear and approachable math professor I have ever had. The Shifrin textbook is also great, albeit challenging and a bit dense. It would be nice if the structure of the course changed a little bit. I felt that even though I was challenged by the assignments and exams, there wasn't too much fresh content in this class. That said it was hard to make the 9.25 lecture three times a week.",
    "Math 250 is for people who need to take it or really like math. I would not recommend it if you don't fit either of these categories. The problem sets take 8 hours a week, and this course covers a lot of material. It requires a lot of creative thinking and ability to understand things that are difficult to visualize.",
    "Challenging but at looking back at the end of the semester, it all ties together perfectly and it's really amazing. Professor is EXCELLENT and super accessible and helpful. Be prepared to work - but it'll be worth it.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. It's at an awkward place in the math curriculum- it moves a bit slow for math majors, but if you come into Yale having taken Linear Algebra, then there isn't any other way to learn Vector Analysis.",
    "If you're going to take this class, hopefully you like math, because this is a math class. The lectures move fairly quickly because a lot of material has to be covered. Problem sets can take over 10 hours. When all is said and done, you will have learned some math.",
    "Take this only if you're willing to put in the effort. Otherwise, you'll get lost really early.",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "Here was my experience:I'm not a star at math. I'm an economics major, who received an A- in Math120, and a B in Linear Algebra. I would like to complete graduate study in economics, which requires a math background that includes vector calculus, which was my reason for taking this course.I found that this course was well taught, though those who had a lot of math prior to studying Math250, or who were able to intuitively understand the material performed well. I was not one of these people. This meant that I did not understand the material in class. I attended math tutoring sessions every week for help with homework, and performed mediocre in exams. I ended up with either a B or a B-, but wisely took the class CR\/D\/F after performing poorly on the first midterm.I'd recommend this class to math majors, or those who have a propensity to quickly and easily grasp mathematical concepts. To others, I'd advise that to get a good mark in this course, you'd be best prepared for a heavy workload.",
    "I would recommend math 250 for a fellow student. It's a really good introduction to vector analysis and follow-up of math 120. Make sure you tak it with Prof. Feisizli! He's a really good lecturer."
