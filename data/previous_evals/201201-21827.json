   "comments": [
    "Sure, take this course. This course is pretty interesting and the material tends to reappear in daily life in the strangest ways. That is to say that the course teaches you about things that are hard to quantify: \"attitudes\" from a particular country about another particular country, or basically, generalizations by those French folk across the pond and what they imply, what the political\/social context is at the time, etc. If anything, it taught me a lot about my own country. However, I think the material starts getting a little repetitive at some point. A lot of the material is based on French people's preconceptions about America and they generally aren't drastically different from each other. The workload is will keep you on your toes as there is quite a bit of reading to do, but all is very much manageable. Madame Pinzka is the most dynamic, engaging, helpful lady ever, and you will love her sense of humor. She will get the class talking about the topics in her own unique way, involving presentations and ripostes, or asking individuals questions about the readings - definitely not a single silent moment.",
    "Classic French lit.",
    "I took French 172 because I wanted the experience of reading and writing as much as in French 170, but I was more interested in the cultural history focus of 172. It was a great choice, and I would highly recommend it! The topic will likely change next year, but this year we read quite a large selection of texts in different styles (memoir, novel, travel writing, essay) and from different time periods (18th century-present) and Madame Pinzka is really wonderful. Fun class and you do get a lot more experience writing than in something like 160.",
    "This is a wonderful class, but a lot of work. The reading is intense and you probably won't be able to do all of it, but any class with Madame Pinzka is worth taking--she's the best. You will have a lot of fun.",
    "French 172 is a great course with a challenging, but really meaningful and rewarding syllabus. If you are looking for an L5-class that avoids all the boring grammar and vocab exercises a la 150\/151, this class is it: interesting topic, great readings (though quite a bit). Prof. Pinzka is a great professor, she puts a lot of effort into teaching and will help improve your French skills in a meaningful way.",
    "French 172 is an enjoyable French literature class that pushes your reading and writing skills without having too much emphasis on literature theory or close reading. This semester's theme was \"French Intellectuals' View of America.\" The well-chosen readings and films sparked some very interesting discussions on America's changing role as a symbol for Europeans. The work load is reasonable and Professor Pinzka is a great seminar leader. I would highly recommend it for those who want to continue with French but do not necessarily want to study traditional french literature.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. You get a good mix of practice in speaking, reading, and writing.",
    "Wonderful class - Mme Pinzka is super excited towards everything we discuss and all of our oral skills improved. The topic does get a little repetitive but if you are interested, it's sure to be rewarding. Do keep in mind that there is a lot of reading.",
    "Great class if you're interested in furthering your French education. Beware: it's a lot of reading, and some of the readings can be very dry. Overall, however, it's a very fulfilling class, and Madame Pinzka is lovely and extremely helpful. Her energy will carry you throughout the course.",
    "This is an interesting course within the French department, and the books and pieces covered in the class are all great. Class discussion feels pretty good, as Pinzka does a great job organizing the class and controlling the flow of the topic. Beware that some of the readings are pretty dense and maybe a bit dry at times. If you really love the materials and are willing to put in efforts, you will do fine, but remember to check the course carefully since every semester it has a different topic. Overall this is a great class on French intellectuals and you really get to practice writing."
