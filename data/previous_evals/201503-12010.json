   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommend 10\/10.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student if it were going to be available in the future. I would summarize it briefly as this: refreshingly, not what you expect. The mode of thinking and the type of work in the course was more difficult than many people expected. I enjoyed the opportunity to take a critical look at the Disney materials as well as learn about the company's history and influence in America and the world.",
    "I'm so, so sorry this isn't being offered again. It was waaaay more intense than anyone anticipated (like, actually a film studies class), but so worth it.",
    "I wouldn't say I recommend Disney. The class is more boring than you would expect this sort of thing to be.",
    "If you have the chance to take Disney, please do. It is not a gut - you will write a lot and deal with the company in a rigorous way you previously may not have imagined. J.D. is an incredible lecturer with so much insight about film. The class assignments are a perfect mix of formal and cultural analysis.",
    "I would say it is VERY different than it seems, it is in fact not about Disney's art, but the corporation itself. Interesting, but not really what was on the package",
    "YES, if it is offered again take it.",
    "I would if you are interested in the history of film, not the production of it.",
    "Gut gut gut gut gut. This is an excellent 5th class or a Cr\/D class. There is very little work (3 papers), but the papers are graded rather harshly, so don't expect to do well in this class if you are taking it for a grade. The readings are obscenely long and there are too many of them, but you don't actually have to read them. Take it for fun, but don't expect to gain a lot from it unless you put the effort in.",
    "Take it!!",
    "Although I doubt this course will be offered again (though Id be thrilled if somehow Professor Connor stays and teaches it), Id HIGHLY recommend it. Film & Media Studies majors, there shouldnt be any question in your mind. Professor Connor is brilliant, the material is excellent, you learn so much and get to have a lot of fun doing it. Reading and writing are a smidge heavy but manageable, and watching Disney movies is such a joyous way to spend an evening. Non-majors, I still recommend the course, but be prepared to play catch-up on basic film analysis skills. You may have grown up watching the movies, but the content can be very detailed and fast-moving. But youll gain new insight into a huge part of American culture (and likely your childhood) and learn from a phenomenal instructor. Also, majors, try to get a TF with film background! Makes a definite difference in the quality of section discussions..",
    "Disney was a ton of fun (when Yale offers a course on Disney and you are a fan, take it!) It was great to be able to gain a more nuanced perspective into some of the animated films that I had grown up watching. Historical context, company politics, film analysis--al of these things were covered in a way that was really insightful. Professor Connor is also a great lecturer (be prepared to have your mind blown)",
    "This class = blessing.",
    "I would wholly recommend this course to others, though it may not be offered again. Professor Connor is incredible, I wish he were staying. Everyone should try taking a course like this, it is a great addition to a schedule full of boring classes.",
    "Would highly recommend! We're all Disney fans, so its important to know what happened in the company's history behind the scenes and how to more accurately appreciate what is on the screen.",
    "A wonderful, interesting course.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. I know it's not being offered again in the (forseeable) future, but I can't praise it highly enough. It's a class about Disney, which is already more than anyone could ever ask for. It's taught by J.D. Connor, who is one of the best professors at Yale, in my opinion. It's not a gut, but if you put effort into writing your papers (it is a writing credit, after all), you should do fine. It's a really fun class, and I would absolutely take it again.",
    "Awesome class! Harder than you expect (lots of reading, and three papers), but you get a lot out of it, and learn some really cool stuff about a subject you might not have thought could be explored academically. Dr. Connor is also epic!",
    "I would recommend this class because it is incredibly interesting and teaches many things that one may never come across in their years at Yale. It explores topics of media, film, and consumerism that are valuable and interesting to young adults in this day and age.",
    "It's a pretty good class, I would recommend it because there is freedom to talk about almost anything you are passionate about in the essays because Disney owns a lot of things.",
    "An analysis of Disney from conception to date. Be ready for historical, economical, social, and close analysis of material.",
    "This class was always the highlight of my week, so I would definitely recommend it. Don't expect it to be a gut\/easy just because it's about Disney--it requires just as much work as any Yale class, along with extensive writing assignments.",
    "Unfortunately, I don't think this class will be offered again, at least not with JD Connor. It will not be the same class without him, his sense of humor, his keen observations about the relationship between cultural artifacts and their contexts. Disney is fun material--who wouldn't want to watch Pirates of the Caribbean and Frozen for class?--so it'll probably still be a class worth taking.",
    "It was a very interesting class. It was not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. I would, however, recommend this to another student.",
    "DIsney is all about Disney and follows the development of the company into stardom which is where it is today. The class follows the company in a business context, in a personal context to Walt Disney, in a production context, and in an film context. J.D. is so knowledgable and passionate about the topic, plus his witty remarks and frozen references, he is probably the best professor I have had at yale! Must take although it is a writing credit so be cognizant that the three papers require a substantial amount of research and writing,",
    "Not sure",
    "Disney is a fun and interesting course, especially if you're a Disney lover. But it's not a gut! It's a lot of reading and writing. Highly recommended.",
    "Absolutely you should absolutely take this class if you have any interest in film or just Disney as a brand. It is NOT a gut, but absolutely worth the work.",
    "Disney is a great fifth course. The lectures were compelling and section was interesting. Do not take it, however, in the hopes of becoming a better writer.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all students interested in Disney.",
    "If you love Disney\/Pixar\/Marvel\/Star Wars\/all of the above, take Disney. It is a great opportunity to apply multiple different lenses to examining the same company, which is a really cool experience.",
    "Sadly, this won't be offered in the future, which is a real shame. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The students at whatever school JD is going to are incredibly lucky.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student, although I gather it won't be offered again. It was a great class and I learned a ton.",
    "This was an amazing class for those who are interested in STUDYING pop culture rather than just consuming it. There is so much literature out there about Disney (I took out more library books to write the papers in this class than I have during my whole Yale career combined), and there's no better prompt to read it than listening to Professor Connor's lectures. A ton of reading and writing, but I found that I wanted to do all of it just to procrastinate my other work since this was so much more enjoyable. The screenings on Thursday nights were highlights of my week. I'm so happy I got the chance to take this!",
    "DISNEY WAS THE BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE! For real, I learned more in this class than any other and now I'm going to major in Film and Media Studies. I heard it was never going to be offered again, which is a shame because more students should have the opportunity to take it! People complained about it not being a gut, but the workload was super manageable and all of the readings and essays were super interesting.",
    "FILM 285 01 was a great class to take in film as well as for a writing credit. I would recommend this course to another student because it analyzes the progression of Disney animations from a film, media, and marketing standpoint.",
    "A survey of Disney history from Walt to Iger. A dynamic course with many relevant and interesting lectures, readings, and papers, I would highly recommend this course to all Yale students.",
    "I would not recommend FILM 285 for a fellow student. Though the subject material is interesting, it's hard to really appreciate this course unless one has prior experience in film analysis. The class covers a lot of material and is very fast paced.",
    "It was harder than any of us expected.",
    "I'm not sure what will happen since J.D. is leaving Yale, but Disney was an incredible course and I would definitely recommend it. J.D. was a relatable and engaging professor who made it worthwhile to go to lecture. The course material was also interesting and well-organized. Having never taken a film course before, Disney was a nice introduction to Film Studies. While it's not exactly a gut (especially if you have a TF who actually cares), the assignments were straightforward and graded fairly. If he's still around, definitely take Andrey's section! He's awesome and you will learn so much from him.",
    "A very anti-Disney class.",
    "Disney was a lot about animation and details in film. If you are interested in that go for it. I am so I took it but I am also really interested in cultural and material history and how those relate to political context which was the weakness of the course so beware. If you don't care about how Disney impacts global american influence, soft power or identity politics, and you just want someone to tell you about Bambi's background art sure this class is great - but has ALOT of writing.",
    "If they ever offer this class again, you should definitely take it if Disney or film study is something you're interested in! If this isn't really your area of expertise (like me), I would recommend taking it Credit\/D so that you can still enjoy the brilliance of Professor Connor and find the lectures and movie screenings fun and insightful without getting overly stressed about the readings (there are a lot if you actually read them) and the paper assignments (which were actually really fun to write). I learned a lot more than I thought I would, and I definitely see Disney (and all movies) in a different light than I did before.",
    "Yea for C\/D\/F",
    "NOT A GUT COURSE. It might sound like a gut course, it might appear to be one, but it is not a gut course. That said, take it anyway, because it's a really interesting look at Disney.",
    "LOVED IT! Definitely recommend.",
    "Disney turned out to be a very enjoyable class, but only once I had shifted around my expectations a bit. I enrolled in the course thinking it would be an easy & fun 5th class, but it turned out to be more rigorous, more technical (from a business perspective), and more writing-heavy than I had anticipated. The film screenings are fun -- an opportunity to watch a Disney classic every Thursday night \"for school.\" J.D. is a great professor, though I don't think that he will be teaching next year, which is a shame. All in all, I would say take this class, but only if you're actually interested in going pretty in-depth into the history of the Disney Studio, which is not always so glamorous or magical.",
    "JDC PLEASE DONT GO BACK TO HARVARD I WILL CRY",
    "Best class ever.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who would like to learn about the entire history of the Walt Disney company, and learn a little bit about film analysis along the way. This class helps you look at feature films or shorts in a more analytical way, and it really covers all Disney parks, events, business decisions, acquisitions, etc. over the years. It is an interesting class; very informative and enjoyable.",
    "It was an okay course-- I'm happy I took it credit\/d.",
    "I don't think this class will be offered again. However, I really enjoyed Professor Connor's teaching style and would probably take another class taught by him.",
    "I would recommend Disney to another student only if they were passionate about Disney or film studies. At times, the course became a bit overwhelming for someone who was not very passionate about Disney.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a writing credit with only 3 papers on a surprisingly interesting and complex topic. Professor Connor makes the class truly enjoyable and taught me a lot about the world of Disney.",
    "FILM 285 analyzes a company, in this case Disney, from multiple points of view, such as film, art, technology, and business. I would recommend this course for not only is it engaging, but in the process of learning about Disney, one also gains valuable skills in writing, close-analysis, and looking both with and against the grain.",
    "I would recommend Disney to another student. It was a very interesting course and different from most at Yale. However, I would first warn them that there is a lot more work (readings, section, screenings, papers) than expected. Regardless, it is still a great course to take.",
    "To another freshman, no.",
    "Good class. The material in lecture doesn't have much to do with the papers but the lectures were still interesting. It provides you with lots of information you wouldn't come across anywhere else. Good class to take if you've never taken a film class before.",
    "This is a great, serious class. It requires work but will teach you more than you thought could ever be learned about your favorite childhood movies. Between the readings, writing assignments, revisions, and mandatory discussion sections, it's a significant amount of time. Would definitely recommend if J.D. Connor is still at Yale teaching this class.",
    "I wish i could take the class again. It was so great",
    "Great film class for non film majors.",
    "I would recommend. Super interesting, Connor was a great lecturerer. This class was very good.",
    "This course a good class if you are interested in the business side of the Disney Corporation. A knowledge of Art History or Film is not necessary, but there is a lot of reading, and some of it is very dry. Be prepared for the professor to talk smack about some of your favorite childhood movies. The weekly screenings are not \"mandatory\" but you do have to watch the films in order to follow the lectures. If this course is offered again, I would recommend taking it. It really is interesting to learn more about a company that basically owns every franchise you've ever loved.",
    "A summary of the history of the Walt Disney Company.",
    "This was a great class! I highly recommend it! It's a pretty decent workload there's a vaguely impossible amount of reading and the papers are no joke but it's so worth it. If you've never taken a film class before, take this one. If you've taken many film classes before, take this one. JD structures the course such that you'll learn a ton no matter what your background is, and his lectures are just consistently amazing. This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Take the class! Not that you can, but. You should've. I'm not sure what the point of answering this question is, since the course will never be taught again. I guess everyone should know that they really missed out. If you can travel back in time, go to the Fall of 2015 and audit Disney (you probably can't actually enroll since you're from a different point in space-time), because the lectures alone are worth coming to, and you should take a class with JD before he's gone.",
    "A course on the Walt Disney corporation, its impact on animations, and its development as a corporate enterprise. I'd definitely recommend it, but know that it isn't JUST watching disney movies.",
    "This course is an intellectual look into every facet of the Disney empire. Lectures will cover everything from animation techniques to corporate takeovers to character development, so don't expect to simply talk about movies. If you t make the class seriously you will learn a ton and have a great time and if you don't you will probably get frustrated by the expected intellectual work they want you to put into the writing assignments.",
    "Should it be taught again, be warned -- this is not a gut. Not even close. I took it Credit\/D and was very thankful that I made that choice. I thought we were going to watch some Disney movies and talk about our feelings, but that is not at all what this class is about. That being said, I really liked this class. Both the reading and writing assignments were demanding but engaging, and the lectures were fascinating. I will have a hard time watching Disney productions the same way now (and that's not necessarily a bad thing!) given the wealth of knowledge I acquired about the company's origins, history, and evolution. I learned some things about the film industry in general as well that I found very interesting. I would recommend this class if you want to take a very serious, academic and critical look at a cultural product that probably defined part of your childhood, as you will come away from the class knowing a lot more than you did before. However, achieving that end will require considerable effort - well worth it in my opinion, but that's not everyone's cup of tea.",
    "It wasn't exactly what I expected. Much less FIlm \/ Art History than I thought.",
    "The title of HSAR 328 says it all: Disney. The course is a great introduction into all aspects of Disney, including animation\/film, theme parks, business enterprise, etc. Professor Connor is a phenomenal lecturer who is witty, engaging, and efficient. He integrates and presents material well, making each class a worthwhile endeavor. I would recommend this course to another student if it is ever offered again. If not, I wish Professor Connor much success in his future courses and encourage students to shop his classes to see how he lectures, as they are truly enjoyable experiences!",
    "It's an awesome class--very theory heavy and JD Connor is an incredible lecturer. Even if you don't have room in your schedule just go and audit it, totally worth it. Plus he keeps finding new ways to sneak \"Frozen\" into class.",
    "A great course. Not a gut. The writing is hard. Without prof Connor idk what this course will be. He was awesome. Make sure you are interested in Disney beyond having a fond childhood memory of it. You get into the nitty gritty of the film industry, corporations and cultural production.",
    "This was a wonderful multidisciplinary approach to Disney. Our readings and lectures touched upon film studies, business history, and even some philosophy. Professor Connor is an engaging, funny, thought-provoking lecturer, and this class was one of my favorites! The class also seemed to students with a wide variety of backgrounds, whether they were film majors or just students who wanted to take a class on Disney. I left with a very changed and much more nuanced understanding of Disney as a company, and of Disney's earlier films as pieces of art."
