    "Discontinued.",
    "Without a doubt, if there is any chance you can take this course, take it. But I don't think you'll be able to. This is one of my top three classes at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in learning more about the political dynamics involved in multinational firm expansion.",
    "Yes. Case studies are a great way to learn and the course is different from all others I've taken in terms of its applicability to the real world and practicality in understanding how business functions.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. We covered a lot of topics that I had never learned about in any other class, and I felt that a lot of what we were learning about corporate and political management would be relevant to my future career. I thought the workload was totally appropriate. I particularly enjoyed the second half of the course during which we would go over case studies. Discussing specific companies helped me understand the concepts more clearly. We had a manageable amount of reading each week, three 1000 word papers and your choice of a final exam or a final paper. Professor LaPalombara is a fantastic teacher and if he decides to teach again, you should jump at the opportunity. He has a lot of experience teaching and a lot of professional experience in the US and abroad so you can tell he knows what he is talking about."
