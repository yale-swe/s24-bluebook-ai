   "comments": [
    "I would most certainly recommend this class to others! It's a very interesting topic and is very comprehensive. It does include a good amount of reading and requires group and outreach projects that are more a little more labor\/thought intensive than just paper homework but that I think is an advantage.",
    "If you love this stuff take it. There is no better class at yale for problem-solving agriculture policy, etc.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are willing to put in a LOT of work. Don't take this with four other reasonably difficult classes--trust me, you will have NO life if you do so. The amount of work assigned for this class may be manageable on a less difficult schedule, but nonetheless expect to have around 5-10 hours of homework (sometimes more) weekly. The material is great, and the professor is, too, but be sure you are prepared for the work.",
    "I enjoyed this course topic and Karen's teaching immensely. Karen is this course's #1 strength! She is a rockstar. Studying global food systems through the lens of the demographic transition and urbanization was even more valuable than I realized entering the course. I recommend any Karen Seto seminar that you can get in to strongly.",
    "BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN. Get ready to work harder than you ever have before but all of the assignments are interesting and exciting and you will get a great exposure to many different issues in regarding food systems and urbanization. Karen Seto is also really interesting in making sure all of the assignments her students complete have a purpose, so you will never feel as though you're doing tedious or pointless work - instead of writing a final paper for the course, you'll do an outreach project, whether that means surveying food waste in the Yale dining system or writing a letter to the editor of a national newspaper.Get after it.",
    "Yes!!! This class draws a group of students who are passionate about food policy, and so not only do you learn from the readings, discussions and professor, but your fellow peers. It is one the best classes I've taken at Yale because it challenged me to think outside of the box. Instead of looking at environmental issue from one angle, the class taught me that the only way to solve these issues is to understand and challenge it from every perspective possible.",
    "If you're lucky enough to have the option of taking a course with Professor Seto, take it!It's a lot of work, but if you're looking for a course that covers a wide range of topics related to urbanization, agriculture and sustainable development and that will equip you with practical skills (writing well, data analysis, interviews), you couldn't find a better course.WATCH OUT, though: the applications are often due, via email to her, before or during shopping period.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!!! One of my favorites at Yale, I learned so much about food systems, and feel like I also became a much better thinker, speaker, and writer as a result. Take this class if you get it!!! FYI, there was an application.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Do not take this class unless you're prepared to work for it; the workload is intense. But if you've got the time and energy, it's completely worth it. Readings are impeccably chosen, assignments are informative and leave lots of room for students to do what interests them, and class discussions are FASCINATING because the professor is brilliant and because she did a great job at picking a smart and passionate group of students. One major complaint I have is that the second half of the class was mostly small simulations (if you've ever taken a class with Professor Starr, you know what I mean) which were fun but which seriously restricted class discussions.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed EVST 349 and if it's taught again, take it if you're at all interested. It's different than many classes at Yale. There are many short assignments using real data and information (surveys, FAO data), instead of one big research paper. In-class time was spent in multiple small group discussions, not in one big congo. I found these changes, along with Seto's energy, made the class very engaging as well as educational. There were weaknesses-- namely timing details and a lack of depth in discussions-- but I thought they were outweighed by the strengths and suspect that many of them would be greatly improved the second go around. It's not the best course ever, but it's a very good one, so take it if you can.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!!! The conversations around food systems are really heating up, and this class is the best way to look at these issues, and those of urbanizations, in a current and comprehensive way. The structure is great, the material interesting, and the professor very helpful."
