    "Great course. I thought Professor Ruger's Intro lecture could have been a bit improved--it was a bit dry. Great range of speakers, and it really touched on the ethics, politics, and economics of the issues.",
    "The course was interesting and informative but given the fact that it was a class on global health, it was extremely disappointing to the LACK of diversity of speakers. This lack of diversity only promoted the \"white knight\" phenomenon common in today's practice of global health. I had high hopes for this course and was very disappointed; there was little to no critique of the current global health practice that is immensely flawed. I expected a more comprehensive course on global health and all I got was that everything in global health was positive.",
    "This course is a seminar course. Unfortunately, this means that both professors had little opportunity to teach, know the students, and connect the dots between all of the themes. I still don't understand the grade distribution: only 20% for concept sheets (the assignment which make the most sense related to this course), 30% for class participation (when some speakers took almost 2 hours and only a handful of people were able to ask questions, and mind you, some people really just don't like speaking in a lecture hall of 30+ students), and 50% for a final paper that was 10,000 words (the paper had no guidance, no themes, and 10,000 words is a huge requirement considering there was no teaching in the entire course). I also found out that the professors had a secret grader, so were they really even doing anything themselves?Also, the course caters to a large variety of concentrations and often I was criticized for MY OWN OPINION in concept sheets. If I feel that and that is my reaction, how am I being punished? I am NOT a philosopher, I am entitled to my opinion, and my papers were well written.",
    "Overall it was a great class structure. All interesting and informative guest lecturers. Choosing which weeks to write concept papers allowed students to spend more time on subjects in which they were most interested. Lastly, the lunches were a great opportunity to further interact with guest lecturers as well as to both hear and participate in discourse between the class instructors and the guest lecturers.",
    "Final paper was a bit too long. Would rather have 5 to 8 concept papers than final.",
    "This is an excellent class. It ably balances broad issues with deep exploration of certain aspects of those issues (e.g. drug resistance in malaria treatment). The format is good and work expectations are fair.",
    "I like the lunch with speakers after the sessions. However, I hope we can get the feedback of our reflection paper much earlier-not till the end of the sem.",
    "Great speakers; could have had more class in between speaker sessions to discuss themes, key concepts.",
    "The course does well in trying to introduce us to various topics and leaders in the field. However, while the concept is excellent, the choice of speakers was extremely biased - we often focused on developing countries yet with the exception of one speaker, all the rest were not from developing countries and often had very biased, poorly informed views. They relied on their research and academic pedigree too much even when it was not sufficient for the context of the subject matter. I understand that there are limitations to whom we can invite, but I think more effort needs to be put in bringing in different voices or else the students will continue to learn only from one perspective."

    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Prof Ruger brought valuable practical experience, and I really enjoyed her contributions to the lectures and lunches. Her opening lecture, however, was a bit dry. I think it could have done a better job framing the course and outlining a few key themes.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Did not add much to the course.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Extremely unavailable to meet with students - no office hours and not responsive to emails.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Professor Ruger was knowledgeable, interesting, and approachable",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Professor Ruger asked incisive questions, and allowed the speakers and students to guide the discussion.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Dr. Ruger is nice but sometimes not reachable.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Prof. Ruger rarely spoke in class (apart from one lecture she did and a few comments in others) and never graded any of my work so I don't think it will be fair to evaluate her.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Fantastic. Really valuable insight from both a philosophical and more practical perspective. And he gave pretty extensive feedback even on ungraded concept papers, in addition to the final essay. One of my favorite professors at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Added little to the course but sometimes made some seemingly out of the box, unrealistic challenges of speakers.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Has office hours, but shared office hours with all the classes he teaches so I often met him when students from another class were there as well, so he actually had little time to help.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Professor Pogge provided helpful feedback on the concept papers and interesting perspective during class discussions and lunches.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Professor Pogge was clearly very invested in the course and its materials. Sometimes he asked questions at the expense of students'.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0Dr. Pogge did a very goo job.",
    "Instructor: Thomas Pogge \u00a0I really appreciate Prof. Pogge's ability to push the envelope and always challenge others' way of thinking."

   "comments": [
    "A comprehensive course on global health, albeit more structured for philosophy rather than economics.",
    "The course brings in grade A speakers on a range of really relevant issues. Their talks and ensuing discussion were always engaging, and I appreciated both the diversity and expertise of the speakers. Really fun, and definitely worth your time.",
    "A broad look at how \"great\" global health is with little to no critique of the current landscape. I would only recommend this course to show them how skewed and flawed the global health field of study is.",
    "Great speakers- great seminar, but awful system of grading and no connection or teaching between themes.",
    "Overall a wonderful opportunity to hear from global health experts first hand about a wide range of topics.",
    "Good guest speakers. Again, would rather critique speakers' work than write final paper. It would provide room for more learning via critiques\/analysis.",
    "This is an excellent class. It ably balances broad issues with deep exploration of certain aspects of those issues (e.g. drug resistance in malaria treatment). The format is good and work expectations are fair.",
    "I would recommend it to others given the speakers of that year are of high quality.",
    "really interesting to either take or audit, but a lot of independent digestion of key themes.",
    "This one is hard - I think if you are looking for a fresh and new perspective on how to think about Global Health, you may be a little disappointed."
