    "Case studies of Chinese companies entering the international market, read actual Chinese news articles on different topics (e.g. Chinese investment in Africa, the Chinese stock market, Chinese social enterprises, etc.)",
    "The list goes on, but the major goals of this course were to improve students' Chinese speaking, writing, and reading skills and I believe that this course has helped me improve upon all of those. I learned all about Chinese businesses and their place in the global markets, which was a topic I never really looked into, but am glad that I did through this class."

   "comments": [
    "Weakness: lack of feedback, in the sense that you can ask what you did wrong and she'll tell you, and you'll fix it, but there's no improvement in your grade (which is fair because school's not all about grades right, but there should actually be some incentive to improve right) Good structure, good textbook, didn't really like the supplementary course materials that were part of the course; most kids didn't actually read it and just picked out five vocab words randomly to email to her.",
    "Strengths: great emphasis on reading, writing and oral presentations, Weaknesses: maybe more grammar structures? Teacher could compile a list for students to use during essays, like vocabulary.",
    "There was little to no engagement in the class. Almost everything was either just reciting what was said in the text or repeating sentences after the teacher (something usually reserved for L1 language courses. Unlike other Chinese classes, there wasn't lots of engagement with your fellow students and you didn't get to talk about personal perspectives about anything. The amount of work was almost absurd. During finals, we not only had a final essay and presentation, we also had a final exam. For midterms, it was even worse. In the span of two weeks, we had two essay due, two presentations, and a midterm examination. There was homework due at least every other day. In one week there was at least: two chapters of reading, either an essay or presentation, a dictation, vocabulary words that we would have to pick out from text\/video and write about, a quiz on the reading (only four questions), and a written homework assignment (typically four-ten sentences). I actually did really like the requirement to pick out vocab words from text and create our own sentences from that, but we didn't actually do anything with those vocab words, which I think we should have. After each essay (which was about every other week, sometimes more often) we had to do an in class presentation, which (with ten people) typically took at least the entire class. This felt like a complete waste of time. Not only did we 1.5 hours of instruction time, we also were wholly uninvolved with whatever was being presented on. We also had weekly dictations, which I actually really liked BUT were based on sentences she chose based on the text that seemed just incredibly not useful. I think it would've been so much more helpful if they were based on the vocabulary words we were assigned to come up with. Something a little more applicable to the real world. Really, in the entire class, there was almost no real world application. Unlike other Chinese classes, the amount of effort you put in really does not matter. Whether or not I spent 5 hours on a presentation or 30 minutes, I would almost always get the same score. Many other students I talked to shared this similar frustration.",
    "though I learned a lot of new material, I think having this class only twice a week actually made it difficult to improve your spoken Chinese. Though my reading and writing definitely improved, because we had an essay and presentation every two weeks, and Chen laoshi is really nice and provides good feedback",
    "The professor, for me, was the biggest strength of this course. Her knowledge and expertise in the field and her warmth made it welcoming for all students, ranging from foreign students studying Chinese and native speakers. A weakness would be the large number of essays and presentations we have to make and the lack of time between each of them (there was practically a new essay every week along with a presentation on each essay)"

   "comments": [
    "no, not the best chinese course out there; didn't really learn much and would learn much more from a class like 163 slaved my butt off, but seems as if I didn't really learn much",
    "Yes, definitely. Solid amount of work but you learn very much about business and entrepreneurship in China. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Unless the student is incredibly invested in Chinese business and doesn't mind sitting through class to feel pushed to read the readings, I really really would not recommend this class. It is not conducive to learning (neither about the subject nor about Chinese) and I think other L5 Chinese classes would be much better. The workload was higher than any other class I have ever had at Yale (and I am on my fourth year) and I also did not feel like I learned anything.",
    "Yes! Chen laoshi is great and if you've done CHNS 162\/163 or the Light Fellowship (like level 4 at HBA) then this class will be pretty smooth for you. Even though I was pretty prepared for the class, I was still able to learn a lot and my Chinese did improve",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student just because it is my favorite class thus far at Yale."
