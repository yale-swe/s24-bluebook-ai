    "Thinking about art",
    "I learned so much about the art industry and about making art as a whole. Before that, I'd only had a really rudimentary understanding of the art industry, and I was only really exposed to illustrative or older art history works -- this class felt like a crash course in contemporary art, and both the professor and the TA always raised interesting artists\/brought our discussions to the industry.",
    "Experience in making art across multiple different 2D and 3D mediums",
    "Learned to evaluate and think about mediums of art I was not familiar with",
    "I learned how to think about art in more contemporary terms. I think a gained the important skill of being able to evaluate my own artistic ideas from more angles and more objectively. I also was experienced to a breadth of contemporary and non-contemporary artists that I did not know which I really appreciated. It was refreshing to be in a class that was not confined by medium because, as I've learned from this course, that is the direction art is going today.",
    "This course is an overview to the various approaches of making art. Each class usually has a workshop where we learned how to work with different materials: collage, photo, video, sculpture, etc.",
    "Literally nothing"

   "comments": [
    "strengths: creative? weaknesses: very chaotic, not well organized, didn't enjoy most of the assignments",
    "This course was also incredibly early - an 8.15AM class seems reasonable until it's partway through the semester, you were up all night studying for another midterm, and have to finish an assignment for the class. Class attendance could get really low, which made it pretty demoralising at times. On the other hand, I really really liked Professor Schinwald and Randi, who were always a joy to talk to, and who were so generous with their knowledge, and really inclusive.",
    "Loved the chillness and variety of mediums we covered. Sometimes I wished we could dive deeper into some mediums.",
    "The strengths of this course were the extensive knowledge of the professor and the ta and the discussions we held in class. I especially liked when we critiqued our assignments because it gave a lot of great ideas and helped apply what we had learned about professional artists to our own work. A weakness of this course was its lack of organization. I think I wasn't as engaged in this course because I didn't often have a clear and more detailed plan of what I was heading into for the next few classes, and it wasn't as easy to look back at what we had done as connected under clear topics. Another weakness of the course was its early time. It made the attendance of the class really unpredictable even though it is based on discussion. Thus, I don't think I was able to engage with other students and the professor like I wanted. I liked the projects we had in class but I wanted to and knew I could do more. It would be fun if the some of the projects were bigger but we were given more time.",
    "The course is whatever you make of it. If you want to work hard on your assignments, they will be rewarding in the end. Of course, you can also get away with barely doing anything but don't expect to enjoy it.",
    "The course did an amazing job discussing different ways of making art and the theory behind them.",
    "Perhaps would benefit from some structure? Actual assignments? Feedback? A grading scale?"

   "comments": [
    "No, unless they need for the art prerequisite.",
    "Yes, a nice fun art class!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches a lot of basic theoretical concepts about art and because of its intimate setting. The class was enjoyable and entertaining.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who does not want to be tied to a particular art medium throughout the semester.",
    "Yes! An awesome class with not that much work and very engaging meetings."
