   "comments": [
    "Everything. I never really considered how important food was or its history. This course taught me that food is central to life and history.",
    "Food is a choice and thus a marker of individuality, religion, broader culture movements, etc.",
    "Honestly not much. I learned that there were huge restaurants in China around 1000AD and some other food facts. That's about all.",
    "Quite literally the history of food - its importance in exploration\/colonization, its functions in different religions, its development in the US, the growth of restaurants, etc. Seriously so much information.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of the history of food, what influences different cuisines, and how preferences and practices have spread across the globe since the dawn of human civilization. A large emphasis was placed on the taste preferences of certain regions, such as Medieval and modern Europe (especially France), the international high-end French food standard, and the development of 19th and 20th century American cuisine.",
    "This course focused heavily on the cultural factors associated with cooking - religion, politics, economics, and environment. If you're interested about food and food only, don't take it!",
    "I learned a lot about the specific ways that food reflects the how race, class, religions, and philosophies have interacted over the course of history. I found that the information was relevant to my everyday experience.",
    "Interesting course on the history of food!",
    "I really developed an understanding of how food and cuisine has impacted cultures throughout time.",
    "I learned about the importance of cuisine in shaping global history, and that studying the history of food can be fascinating and worthwhile.",
    "Very few.",
    "I didn't really develop many insights. I learned how to take half-decent notes in lecture, and the effect that food and cuisine has had in our historical development.",
    "This course teaches you about American culture and a bit about world food cultures\/histories. It's pretty interesting -- social ideas undergirding food system, production, consumption -- but kind of a very basic course. 2nd half of the semester (about american culture) is basically stuff most people know already -- 50s suburb\/consumption culture; industrialization of food system\/ food advertising. So...in sum...I wouldn't take it, as it's a bit of a waste of time. But it's not a bad course.",
    "Was my first Yale History class, so it was a good intro on methods of history research & writing essays. We learned a lot about food and cuisines around the world, as well as the field of food history in general. It was a really enjoyable class, and Prof. Freedman is a great lecturer. The readings are all very interesting and the essays are manageable + you write about whatever you want about food, so it was a lot of fun.",
    "I really appreciate how this class was imagined, something set out on the first day, as a discussion of the food culturally rather than practically. It is so true: we have a lot to learn about historical societal values from food! The learning I did in this course was primarily factual.",
    "This class definitely helped with research and writing skills.",
    "In History of Food I developed my ability to read and comprehend texts and compare historical situations. I got better at drawing in information from different time periods and seeing how history forms a coherent story.",
    "I learned a little bit about foodways throughout the world. Lectures were often repetitive and somewhat disorganized and I feel like I could have learned more from them had they not been this way.",
    "I was able to learn that history can be studied through various media. While the medium for this course was food and cuisine, the class made me wonder about other lenses through which history can be analyzed. Food is a central part of any culture and a heavy influence in shaping culture. I think that studying history via clothing\/fashion, popular pastime\/leisure, or celebrities could prove interesting as well.",
    "Food is a critical, revealing, and powerful element of societies throughout history, and must not be overlooked. It is really inspiring to have learned how to approach a subject rigorously from every angle e.g. industry, religion, economy, politics, especially one that is often regarded trivial.",
    "I learned how important food is to not just life but to culture and civilization. I'd never thought about studying food from an academic perspective before, so this course was very interesting in that regard. Seeing how influential food was and how much view on it have changed over time was brand new to me and fascinating.",
    "Being a STEM major, I did not have very much exposure to writing or to the humanities. This course provided me with exposure and introduced me to the world of history (of food). I loved this class because it gave me an entirely different perspective about food and has changed the way I observe\/eat\/encounter food today. I learned how to better write a research paper, and I learned how to analyze restaurant menus throughout history. I grasped food trends and was able to better characterize cultures through their methods of preparation and consumption of cuisine.",
    "Great social history knowledge as well as some very interesting perspectives on the development of our American cuisine.",
    "You learn a ton of interesting information about food. It is as useful as you make it.",
    "History of food from beginning of agriculture to modern times. Covers regions all around the world for the first part of the semester and then focuses on the United States for the second part of the semester.",
    "My biggest takeaways: Understanding foreign cultures, a new interest in cooking, a better understanding of the historian's job, and two fun essays.",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for the gastronomic landscape of the present and the past, and made significant strides as a writer of history papers.",
    "I gained an entirely new perspective on how food affects societies and cultures. I learned how there are intersections in academia between interesting topics such as food and history. I really appreciated learning how people throughout history have connected with one another and interacted with one another over food.",
    "The global food trends of how food and cuisine have developed and changed over time.",
    "This was the first history class I had ever taken at Yale. From it I learned how to form and argument and use primary and secondary sources to support my claim. I learn about cuisine from around the world and different time periods and the factors that lead to this cuisine.",
    "A survey understanding of the history of diet, cuisine, and social eating habits surrounding food...I learned about more things that I never knew existed in academic study.",
    "Essentially none. I learned some cool facts about culinary history before the midterm but the class kind of tanked afterwards."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting course, and it's nice to hear Prof. Freedman's opinions as he has studied many of these things.",
    "The material of this class had a lot of potential. I found a lot of the readings pretty interesting, but lecture was given in such a boring way that I became disengaged with the material pretty early on in the semester.",
    "A long final paper and a final exam with three long essays is demanding at the end of semester when we have other coursework too. Appreciate the freedom to choose paper topics. Some lectures are redundant.",
    "Professor Freedman is fantastic and shares so much knowledge which is really valuable. I do wish that the course was more focused\/the topics were more specific because oftentimes because the topics were so broad it got repetitive.",
    "Information was superficial and basic. You learn a few food facts. There was a surprising amount of work required for the very little content. Don't spend one lecture on covering 2000 years of a region's food history. The whole point is to see how food interacts with culture\/history\/politics\/economics\/gender\/etc but we talk VERY little about any of those things.",
    "I didn't enjoy the dry lecture format. I wish there had been some kind of visual stimuli as the classes were very boring\/it was easy to zone out and do other work.",
    "Essays are graded arbitrarily.",
    "I enjoyed Professor Freedman's teaching style: he didn't use a PowerPoint, but his lectures were coherent and well-paced. He often included interesting anecdotes, and it was clear that he was passionate about the material. Additionally, I liked the breadth of the course, as well as the depth for the French standard and American food. I would have liked to learn a bit more about food trends in other regions, such as Latin America or Korea\/Japan\/China. Also, most of the readings were quite interesting. One thing I did not like is that section participation was not part of the grade. Many students did the readings and engaged in section, and not receiving a grade to distinguish them from the students who didn't participate was a bit disappointing.",
    "Generally well-organized and interesting. Could do with a little better more structure for lectures.",
    "The lectures could get very dry when Professor Freedman just read off of his notes. The course didn't seem particularly well organized with lots of jumping around between different topics.",
    "I found the readings to be incredibly interesting, and lecture content was extremely engaging. At some points, I wished that Professor Freedman had some form of voice amplification-- if sitting in the back, he could be slightly hard to hear.",
    "Lectures were really great. I'm not sure if grades are adjusted among sections, but they should be. Some TFs were evidently more difficult graders than others.",
    "More global perspective in the later half of the course.",
    "The strength of the class is the breadth of the syllabus- the course covers from prehistory to modern times, and I felt that Professor Freedman did justice to each culture and time period. I also loved the visit from Lidia Bastianich- I wish there were more guest lectures! The weakness of the class is the structure of it. The lectures were often disorganized, and it would have been helpful to have posted slides or some kind of lecture notes to make it easier for students to go back and study previous lectures. I also felt that the amount of reading was excessive. It was often impossible for me to complete all the reading, which left me feeling disengaged and led to me falling behind in the course. The readings were interesting (especially Nestle's \"Food Politics\"), but I would encourage Professor Freedman to consider reducing the reading amounts to around 20-30 pages per lecture, which I think would be sufficient for most of the classes.",
    "I wish the lectures were a little more structured out. Professor Freedman is very knowledgeable on the subject, but he does hop to and from topics which makes lectures hard to follow. Power Points may help this but I couldn't take out main points when everything was so scattered. But, the material was fun to engage with and the papers were interesting to write.",
    "The lecture is unfortunately so unorganized as to be uninteresting.",
    "This is a difficult question. I would say that it would be better if the amount of reading was more manageable and covered the main points of lecture. A lot of students taking this course aren't taking it for their major, and are instead taking it as a fifth credit, and thus dont have the time to commit to reading over 120 pages for every lecture. For example, I didn't do any of the readings past the first two lectures, and relied entirely on lecture notes for the midterm and the final.",
    "Strengths: first half of the course -- I really liked when we talked about social stratification and agriculture, how food systems influence social systems and in turn are influenced by them. FOCUS ON THIS STUFF -- this is really what the course has to offer... Weaknesses: 2nd half of the course is semi-useless. It really is stuff people already know -- about the 50s and industrialization etc. Lectures are WAY too surface level. Naming popular national brands is pretty much a waste of time...entertaining but not very scholarly. A lot of the second half of the course is too \"pop\". ALSO: the way things are structured, no one needs to do the reading. So, I would reformulate to make people do the reading. Be clear that people need to do the reading.",
    "This class was excellent in the first half. I discovered countless new things every class period and came away gushing. I think my favorite class session was the medieval one; how fascinating the dishes were! I liked that most class lectures included a discussion of both the prevalent ingredients, the values shaping them, but also, when possible, the reading of a recipe or menu, primary sources that were important context. The only content comment I would have is that, although in the moment I enjoyed learning how the historical trends were manifest in the modern world, especially in migration cuisine, it felt repetitive in the second half of the course, especially when we reread a piece on African cuisine in America. Have you thought about including visuals? Beyond the menus\/ advertisements, it could have been fun and helpful to flip through a few images of iconic national dishes as they were introduced. For example, because I hand write my notes, I only looked up bunny chow after the Africa course and was blown away! My reception of the second half of the course is very different. Firstly, I felt as though much of the lecture material was repetitive. It was the same information framed in a different way. Oftentimes, the contextual information was not essential. In the discussion of fads, the lengthy debate over a modern term for neurasthenia I believe was in regard to Battle Creek, but I took no new information from the discussion and feel as though I can say little more about \"food fads\" (and your flat out refusal of certain translations for neurasthenia, like depression\/ anxiety, is, I believe, not exactly fair: https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2016\/03\/the-history-of-neurasthenia-or-americanitis-health-happiness-and-culture\/473253\/). I don't want to be too harsh, but I would say that a lot of the material was reductive as well. I didn't appreciate in the discussion of female food habits. While I am hoping it was intended to be about stereotypes, it wasn't framed this way. You risk alienating half your students when you ask how their taste differs based upon their gender! I would consider axing the second half of the course and extending the first half! This being said, the readings for the course were consistently excellent. Laudan was revelatory! And the readings continued to be educational and enriching throughout the second half of the course. Something from the Oven was the best book I read over the course of the semester in any class! And now that I have free reading time over the summer, I'm looking forward to finishing the Gabaccia.",
    "It was sometimes hard to hear during lecture.",
    "The strengths of History of Food were the particular focus on early twentieth century American cuisine and impact of social and technological developments on it. Professor Freedman did a good job of explaining this time period well, as well as making the rest of the course interesting. The main weakness of the course was that it had to gloss over a lot of different countries and regions, because there wasn't enough time to address their culinary traditions.",
    "The first half of this course was stronger and had more of a focus, but I think that the second half of the course was rather disorganized and I did not learn as much. There were no slides for the presentations and sometimes they did not seem to flow very well, and it was hard to take away anything from the lectures.",
    "The primary strength of this course is the relative novelty and excitement surrounding the topic: food. The instructors are also very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic. I would have enjoyed seeing more variety in the cuisines we studied.",
    "The course covered powerfully revealing materials in a flow structure atypical of history classes, and it was highly effective. The paper\/exam couple every half-semester, though tough to handle, were great in encouraging self-exploration and research while ensuring that we learned the necessary principles. Lectures were captivating, and played well to the strength of the subject matter being close to daily life, while not losing analytical rigor. It would've been more helpful if some of the lectures repeated less of the contents in the readings; they should go further, extend and clarify the principles.",
    "The course seemed to be a good, basic description and history of food throughout the world. However, I don't think the course material was very in-depth or taught me much that I didn't already know or that I couldn't have just assumed. I really enjoyed the guest speaker who came to our class. I would have liked to hear from more prominent people in the food industry.",
    "Professor Freedman is a wonderful lecturer and really grabs your attention with his love for the subject. His lectures were always interesting and the readings complemented them very well. Section was always interesting, although I did not always feel like it pertained directly to the readings every week. The midterm and final exam were composed only of essay questions, and our only other grades were from a midterm essay and final essay; I think this class could be improved by diversifying the assignments on which students are graded (possibly short answer questions or IDs on exams in addition to the few essay questions).",
    "It goes into a lot of detail it just goes a little too fast and has a lot of readings. Not too much though.",
    "Paul Freedman is a wonderful teacher and lecturer",
    "The strength of this course was Professor Freedman who was extremely knowledgeable in his field and a wonderful professor who was very likable. A weakness of the course was the low level of engagement during lecture time. This is a result of the large class size, however, sections help improve on this.",
    "Could be strengthened with a variation on reading assignments: a lot gets repeated in lecture. Also, section should count for something.",
    "A strength of this class is that most of the material is interesting and very easy to understand. All the concepts make sense and usually have a simple explanation."

    "It's a nice, interesting course that isn't going to kill you in terms of work. Grading is fair and not too strict, and the topics discussed are interesting. It's one of the lighter history courses I've taken, but I think that's the best way to really enjoy this topic.",
    "This class is very interesting, but the grading is inconsistent and really depends on your TA. Lectures bounced around and were individually hard to follow. Sections were supposedly not mandatory, yet you got points off if you didn't go or didn't submit a writing response.",
    "Yes. It is very interesting.",
    "Worth it just to have Freedman. It's not a gut.",
    "Fun, relatively easy lecture course. Professor Freedman is a lot of fun to listen to. There is a short essay, midterm, final essay, and final exam (plus weekly section attendance), but the subject matter is pretty light.",
    "No. I don't know why but I just did not enjoy this class. It was poorly run. We spent like one lecture on like 2000 years of a country's history. It was so general it was boring. It felt like a high school class but with 150 students. Awful section experience, didn't learn anything, turned into a pain in my ass rather than something enjoyable.",
    "I would say this is an easy class to not have to pay attention in and still do well in. The readings line up with lectures pretty similarly, there is no lecture slides and Professor Freedman talks very quietly. This makes it difficult to pay attention in lecture but it is not too much work and relatively interesting if you do the readings\/have the ability to pay attention.",
    "Learn something completely new. Have random tidbits of knowledge to bring out at parties\/dinners about the very foods you're eating! Question everything you know about Italian food. This class has it all.",
    "Idk man. Essays were graded arbitrarily. Depends on how interested you are in the material. You can get by without doing the readings if your TF is chill.",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in learning about a broad scope of history, or are curious about how food preferences have become what they are today. Professor Freedman is a good lecturer (he doesn't use a PPT), and the readings are interesting. None of the material is overly complex, and, if you take some time to think about your papers, you will do well. Additionally, the midterm and final exams consist of 2 and 4 essays, respectively, and cover broad trends from the course. Just note that section participation is not counted as part of the grade, which is a bit irritating. Overall, I really enjoyed the material and found the workload quite manageable.",
    "Interesting readings and lectures. I STRESS THAT THIS CLASS IS NOT A GUT!!! MIDTERM AND FINAL AND FINAL PAPER WITH SECTION AND UP TO 200+ PAGES OF READING A WEEK!!!!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student without hesitation. Understanding food is understanding history as it presents itself to us on the day to day, making the end-result of such learning a more enriching experience of life overall. A very important class to take for anyone interested in food and\/or culture.",
    "Definitely wold recommend! Pretty interesting topics. A few dull lectures, but looking back I learned some cool stuff.",
    "Prof. Freedman's lectures are very interesting. If you are at all interested in food, I'd recommend taking the course. Not a true gut, however.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! It's a pretty chill history\/environmental studies course that gives you a great outlook on food and its history. While the second half of the semester focused mostly on American themes (big food companies, slavery, farming, etc.), the first half was really interesting in that we got to learn a lot about the different world cuisines. The readings are really interesting (don't really need to dive deep into them. I skimmed, and I was fine), and the professor is really funny at points. Intellectually not very challenging, so if you're into a bit of a challenge or you're looking for a chill 5th class, this could be a good option!",
    "Yes, very interesting!",
    "I would recommend this as a humanities credit for someone who doesn't mind a lot of reading, but don't treat it like a 5th class. The readings are often interesting but also excessive, and the exams (which are timed essays) are based primarily on these readings. We had some interesting discussions in my section, so if you are genuinely interested in the topic and have the time to invest in it, this is a wonderful history course taught by a notable professor.",
    "History of Food was not an easy class by any means. It had so much more potential to be fun and interesting but for the \"fun class\" I took for this semester, it turned out to be my hardest and most challenging one. You class experience depends on your TA too, so mine was horrible and a harsh grader but others were nice and fun. Professor Freedman's lectures are a little scattered and hard to follow, which makes it easy to stop paying attention. Overall, it should have been much more interesting than it turned out to be.",
    "I wouldn't recommend History of Food because the lectures are very poorly organized (i.e. rambling).",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless it is for your major. I know a lot of people took this course expecting it to be an easy grade. However, it was a lot more difficult to get a decent grade in this class than it was made out to be.",
    "Yes. It's a fair amount of work, but not too difficult to keep up with readings and do well. The topic is interesting, and Prof. Freedman does a great job. Very good as a one-off class, especially if you're not that interested in history.",
    "This course teaches you about American culture and a bit about world food cultures\/histories. It's pretty interesting -- social ideas undergirding food system, production, consumption -- but kind of a very basic course. 2nd half of the semester (about american culture) is basically stuff most people know already -- 50s suburb\/consumption culture; industrialization of food system\/ food advertising. So...in sum...I wouldn't take it, as it's a bit of a waste of time. But it's not a bad course.",
    "Take the class if you're going to do the readings. It's not a lot per week, but the readings make up a huge part of what you learn from the course.",
    "While the subject is excellent, and there is a wealth of material covered, and you will learn a lot, I would recommend this course with caution. The first half of the course was when this learning curve occurred, and I felt the second, \"thematic,\" section was a regurgitation of the same material, without much context that would make it rewarding thematically. But if the class has been restructured and reworked, I would highly recommend it.",
    "Really interesting course, worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this course. The lectures are fairly interesting and the course flows well from topic to topic. The exams weren't hard, nor were the essays. However, the reading is a bit unevenly distributed and there are some weeks when you have to do a ton of reading. Professor Freedman is engaging, and does a good job, especially in regards to twentieth century America. Also, there are several interesting opportunities connected to the course and guest speakers.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class to a fellow student if it was taught in the same manner, it just did not seem as though enough time was put into preparing a cohesive course, especially in the second half.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The lectures are disorganized and repetitive and the readings really don't fill in the gaps. Not a wholesome course. The final was a compilation of random questions, many of which on topics we had not even touched on in lecture.",
    "Worth taking if the idea of food piques your general interest. Can recommend to both history buffs and those that are less historically inclined. A good cultural survey course even for those just looking for a humanities credit.",
    "Amazing class. Do not regard it as a \"gut\", or a trivial random \"liberal arts\" class. The kind of insight from this class is no less rigorous than one analyzing another subject matter that might be less \"daily life\" than food and cuisine. It crosses disciplines, geography, and time, and really showed some universal but nuanced facets of societies.",
    "I would recommend this course to others. It is fun and interesting and although the workload is heavier than a gut the work is not very difficult. Lots of writing is involved. Paul Freedman is a soft-spoken, intriguing professor although sometimes it is difficult to hear him. You can get away in this course without doing the readings or without going to all of the lectures (although I suggest you do one or the other). Lectures basically just review the reading.",
    "The history of food was one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Freedman is engaging and the material is very interesting and relates to everyday life.",
    "History of Food is a fun class without too much work. It's a good way to get a humanities credit or just to take a fun class if you're interested.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially if that student likes food. The class will change your perspective on food and will teach you about food history that would have never crossed your mind as being important. The essays are fun to write, and the information is almost always interesting.",
    "Absolutely. Great history course for anyone.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the origins of food and will dedicate thectime",
    "Fun fifth class",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While the course is certainly not a \"gut,\" as some students assume the course title might imply, it is interesting and worthwhile. Lectures were engaging, the course material was fresh and thought provoking, and sections were enjoyable.",
    "I do recommend this course to anyone who's a foodie and food addict. You gain an entirely knew perspective on how food affects the world and you learn a lot of interesting facts about different cultural foods.",
    "Absolutely. The subject matter is fascinating, if you're interested in it.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was fairly interesting and the concepts were easy to understand. However, it is not a gut and there is plenty of work that needs to be done in this class in order to receive a good grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the subject, but not to someone who is just looking for a filler history course because it can get kind of tedious for those not mildly interested in the topic.",
    "Ehhh. It starts out good but then gets pretty boring and professor Freedman just starts rambling about American food culture in the last 50 years. She includes some dubious statements about race, gender and mental health he doesn't seem qualified to make.",
    "People think this is a gut. It's really not. There's a midterm paper and a midterm, and a long final paper on top of a final. It's a cool class and Prof. Freedman is one of the most wonderful professors I've ever had, but know that it's not just a walk-in-the-park gut."
