    "This class is unlikely to ever be offered at Yale again. if it is, start it C\/D\/F just to make sure the grading is fair, but the class is a great way to learn about Catholicism.",
    "This class filled a gap that I had been looking for at Yale, in that it teaches the position of the CatholicChurch on many key issues and explains how the moral theology has progressed and changed overtime. It provides a very interesting insight into who really has power in the Church to incite change. It's a surprising amount of reading, which was sometimes overwhelming, especially because our TA, Andrew, is very socratic and requires that you have read every page. But the midterm was really fun and not difficult (an open notes moral case study), the one 8-page paper was fun to write, and the final was a 2-hour take home that was not difficult. Professor Kaveny was a marvelous lecturer -- I don't think she is returning to Yale, which is a shame because she was terrific and brilliant, but this class is awesome nonetheless. Definitely recommended!"
