    "This course is well worth taking for a student who wants to learn more about practical and theoretical stuff about bioinformatics. I would recommend it to students in CBB since it's rather useful.",
    "If you're interested in bioinformatics you should of course take this. However, even if you're not but you are fascinated by understanding the frontier of research going on in a field I'd recommend it as well. The psets may be difficult, but the opportunity to take a peek at the future of how we understand and analyze the human genome is an opportunity that few will get.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students. It covers alot of useful information and sequence analysis methods.",
    "I would summarize it as a walkthrough of DNA variant, RNA-seq, and DNA methylation analysis methods. I would recommend the course to another student, mostly because the homework assignments, though too long in their current form, were extremely valuable (perhaps because of the complexity)."
