   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting and unique class that teaches you the basic grammar and sentence types along with how to read and look up different words. The language itself is a bit more of puzzle than your standard more oral language. The class is also a bit more history flavored. Its a bit of work, but you put in the work and you'll do fine.",
    "Highly recommended! So different and fascinating!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for others. It is a very interesting topic and a great language option that you wouldn't receive at other universities. Take advantage of it while you can.",
    "REALLY REALLY FASCINATING! If you're a language person that's also interested in ancient history, take this for sure! Hieroglyphs are so unique... I've never encountered any language likeit! Just make sure that you're NOT taking this as a gut; it might be less work than other languages, but it's still a fair amount of work for a 1 credit language class that meets twice a week. Plus, some of the grammar concepts are really difficult to grasp.",
    "If you want an interesting language class with a manageable workload, then this is your course. Don't think that Hieroglyphics is an easy language, however, as it can be quite tricky and you won't be able to simply breeze through this course. That being said, Professor Hsieh offers generous extra credit and all of the assignments are fair, so the grade you want is always within reach. If Ancient Egypt interests you and you want to learn a language with absolutely no similarities to English, then take this class.",
    "EGYP 110 is a basic introduction to the language of Egyptian Hieroglyphs and also a brief introduction to the religious practices, history, culture, and art of the ancient Egyptians. It is a wonderful opportunity to study a unique language in an intimate setting, but it shouldn't be looked at as an easy way to fulfill a language requirement. The complexity and unfamiliarity of the material merits a certain amount of commitment to its study.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The work load is pretty light so the class is a nice complement to other more intensive classes. With that being said, the weekly quizzes can be kind of tricky so it's important not to fall behind. Learning hieroglyphs is a new, interesting, and fun experience. I loved this class, and I think it provides a great way to fulfill a language requirement."
