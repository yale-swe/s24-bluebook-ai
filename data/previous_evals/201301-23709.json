    "It's incredibly fulfilling and you will learn a tremendous amount of material with Fabi!!!",
    "If you can take it with Fabi",
    "Definitely! L2 is a lot of grammar, which can be tedious, but it it was a pretty drastic jump over the course of the semester in terms of comfort and speaking\/reading ability.",
    "Port L2 is not so hard! There is less stress to memorize vocab as there is in other language departments. The Portuguese program at Yale is more centered around increasing communication skills and sentence formation.",
    "It is a very useful course, and after taking it it you should be ready to communicate in Portuguese if you do reasonably well.",
    "I enjoyed this course. Fabi is a great teacher, and I felt that I learned a lot as a result. I would recommend this course to other students."
