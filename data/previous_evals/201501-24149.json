    "Great course.",
    "This class was really interesting! There's really something here for everyone - race issues, environmental issues, architecture and urban planning, energy politics, history, art, etc etc. I really, really enjoyed the readings; there was a fair amount, but it was my favorite homework because they were so interesting (for example, you read about urban exploring in Detroit, meth in small-town america, and how to label nuclear energy reserves for future generations). When I took it, the class was tiny, just 5 people. That was a little challenging for a 2-hour seminar because you really had to be on top of your game, no one can slide by - but obviously this will vary semester to semester. I think this was the first time it was taught, so it'll probably grow by next spring. Chloe is really approachable, sweet, and gives a lot of great feedback, but she's not the best at leading discussion. Sometimes it felt like we were just asking lots of questions and providing no answers, which I guess is something that happens in most seminars like this. However, I really enjoyed the diversity of the material covered, and the work is super manageable (reading responses every week, short paper, long final paper, and 2 short presentations in class). I'd also never taken such a small class, and really enjoyed the experience - it felt like a really open and low-risk environment for discussion.",
    "Yes! Super fun and you discuss important implications about issues that are extremely relevant today. Definitely changed my perspective on urban development; I don't think I will be able to see cities the same without questioning underlying legacies and future implications."
