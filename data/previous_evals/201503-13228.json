Any question that begins along the lines of \"List 15 of the 17 items...\" is NOT testing your understanding of the concepts of the course - just how much you studied the evening prior. I don't know what the correct kind of assessment is for the material, but this wasn't it.",

    "I think it would be great if he has outline of the lecture for the day printed or distributed in some way so we can follow better.",
    "I think it is not acceptable to grade people based on the work of others, outside their control. Group projects where the group shares one grade are absolutely unfair when one person ends up carrying the majority of the weight, just to ensure they can do well. Allow the projects to be broken up into pieces and grade based on who did which pieces.",
    "I think this class has invaluable information for being a production or technical manager. However the course suffers from dated content and dogmatic support of certain management prescriptions. Thinking abstractly about managing a production is a very useful exercise, but this class is not a conducive environment to critical discussion. There are certainly good reasons behind \"the way we do thing at YSD\", but this course often seems limited by the impulse to dismiss any other way of doing things as inferior.",
