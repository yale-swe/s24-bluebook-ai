   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy sleep inducing derivations of entirely abstract relations approximating fluid behavior, most to extremely marginal utility, then this is the class for you. Also if you enjoy furthering the military-industrial complex, this might pique your interest.",
    "Definitely a fair and educational class!!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone that is interested in the effects of flow. I would not recommend this class to anyone that does not have a strong math and physics background, as it is a little complex.",
    "I thought the material in Fluid Mechanics was very interesting. The fact that the class was a 9 AM made it really hard to appreciate the material at times. I ended up not going to class several times due to this and falling behind at times. Smooke was a good lecturer and always tried to spice up the class by showing us a video that related to what we were learning. His handwriting was a bit sloppy and he sometimes talked into the board so sitting towards the front was the only way you were going to have a chance of staying awake and alert in the class. The exams were fair. He decided to give us four midterms and no final (none of which were cumulative exams), which I liked. Smooke followed the book rather closely, and I thought the book was very helpful. The problem sets were manageable, never impossibly difficult.",
    "This course is a pretty good course. It's probably required for your major if you're looking into it. It's a pretty math intensive intro to fluid mechanics, with a good mix of conceptual and practical learning.",
    "One of the more manageable and straightforward classes in the major. Prof. Smooke is incredibly clear and makes the material very digestible. The four midterms breakdown this semester made the class much less stressful than it could have been, and homework assignments were not that bad. Extra credit questions on the tests are always impossible though!",
    "Definitely challenging, but possible. It's also one of those classes when you know when you got a problem right -- it just clicks in some areas. Good class.",
    "A good introduction to the material. I'd recommend it to fellow applied math majors as it has some neat applications.",
    "Yeah - can't be a Mechanical Engineering major without an intense fluids course. You learn so so so much - one way or another. You'll have to put in a lot of time and effort and frustration in the course but you'll come away with a fair bit.",
    "Overall this course is an average MechE course. Don't take it unless you have to. The homework is fairly easy, but the tests are a lot harder and very challenging. Also, the class being at 9am doesn't help either.",
    "MENG 361 was a good course that was structured in a standardized lecture-pset-exam format. The course was fair, and I really appreciated the four exam format. When supplemented with the textbook, the lectures provide all the information you need to understand to do well on the psets and exams.",
    "Fluids is generally a good class. Smooke is one of the best professors Yale STEM has to offer, so that really makes the class a bearable, even pleasurable experience. He is extremely clear in lecture, brings in lots of outside applications (we watch rocket launches and NatGeo clips in class), and makes fair tests every time. I didn't find the material very engaging, but it was Smooke that made it so. Assuming you're taking this for your major, it is not as bad as some of the other junior year STEM classes. Just don't underestimate it, because a lot of complicated derivations go on in class, and he'll often take examples from class and put them right on the test. But again, Smooke makes going to class a good experience, so it's worth the 8 AM wake up.",
    "MENG 361 is a math intensive introduction to fluid mechanics course. It covers basic equations of fluid motion and starts to delve into solving these equations for different situations. I would recommend MENG 361 to another student. I would recommend it because it helps further understand basic concepts of any and every engineering field.",
    "This is a fundamental class for ME. If you do not take this and still have ME on your degree, your degree is eternally blemished. Seriously, you need to learn and suffer through the fluids to become an engineer. There simply is not a substitute for this class at Yale.",
    "It was a challenging course and very mathematical. Smooke did a great job of relating the material to the real world which was always interesting.",
    "First, let me set the stage: you're only looking at this course because you have to take it. That being said, I *still* recommend it for people very interested in engineering and physics. Smooke's lectures are clear and easy to follow, his problem sets are reasonable in difficulty, and his exams mirror the problem sets. He also does a great job making the material interesting and applicable. Pretty much every lecture, he does a (slightly forced) segway into a fascinating application or real-world example of the concepts we're discussing, and this really helps to keep the students engaged in the class. Once you start taking this class, you won't want to skip Smooke's lecture.",
    "This course has weekly problem sets and had 4 exams (this year we voted) without a final. It wasn't an unreasonable amount of work, but he concepts are numerous, math-heavy, and not always explained clearly. The exam questions can seem kinda random in comparison to the homework, but if you go to class and understand the concepts in lecture and in the homework, the exams would be doable, but this is easier said than done...",
    "It's a great course with a decent workload where you learn a lot. I enjoyed the course.",
    "Fluid Mechanics is a lot of fun to take, but also pretty difficult. Homework problems can sometimes be very different from lecture and exam problems, so it's a bit disorienting. Problem sessions are run more like office hours than section, so, depending on what helps you learn the best, this may not be the greatest course to take. Professor Smooke is a really wonderful teacher, but frequently runs into problems with the A\/V system.",
    "This class walked a weird line of not being challenging \/ made interesting enough to really force me to focus, but not being easy enough to chill through. It's not always clear which sections in the book need to be read \/ understood, and office hours are pretty low enthusiasm. Because many times problems seem simple it's hard to dedicate yourself to a full understanding of the material, because you think you get what you need to know, but then all of a sudden the exams are 5x harder than the psets -- depressing. Also a significant amount of the class is doing derivations on the blackboard for the full 75 minutes. Overall I wouldn't recommend it unless you are really interested in fluids (turned out I wasn't).",
    "If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it for your major (MechE, EnveE, ChemE, Applied Math). It is a solid course overall, not terribly exciting, but Professor Smooke adds in fun facts and real-life examples into his lessons. The Problems sets are not usually overly time consuming they were sometimes difficult because we didn't cover the material on the problem set until after it was due (this needs to be fixed!) They could also be frustrating because it sometimes seemed like Professor Smooke picked the problems haphazardly without checking if they had to do with what we had covered. Also the tests were fair, but be warned!-they often were nothing like the homework or problems we did in class. The TAs really made this class - two hour office hours three times a week - get on top of your homework and go to this an you'll be fine. One of the better MechE classes I've taken, but still has room for improvement.",
    "If you are a mechanical engineer, you have to take this class for your major, and youll likely find a lot of the applications like aerospace and military to be relevant and interesting. If you are majoring in anything else that requires this course, like G&G, however, do not expect to see any connections between the material in this class and the applications of fluid mechanics for the major, like climate and ocean systems.",
    "Fun class (at least when taught by Professor Smooke). I can see how the material is applicable and useful to engineering work in different industries. The workload is moderate and definitely manageable. Exams are straightforward. A lot of learning comes from reading the textbook and finding answer keys online.",
    "A solid course for ME majors looking to fulfill the requirements. People can be divided on their opinions of Smooke, but as someone who likes structured and progressive curriculums, I thought he did a very good job. The math can seem a bit scary towards the latter half of the book, but the textbook clearly explains anything you didn't get in class. The homework is predictable, and there are ample review sessions to go over the homework. Hopefully this class won't be offered at 9AM again. At the beginning of the semester, he offered to give four midterms instead of two midterms and a final. Go for the former. It relieves a lot of stress.",
    "Very well taught class. Exams are difficult, but also reasonable. Word of advice - also study from the book. Derivations are mostly from class, but other types of problems on the exams in the book."
