   "comments": [
    "Definitely. This was a great introduction to issues about gender and women's rights in the Middle East and North Africa. The readings were very manageable. The weekly reflection wasn't bad to write and it helped connect the readings. Student presentations were low-key and Dr. Shaker jumped in often to facilitate conversation so there wasn't a lot of pressure on the presenter. The final paper topic was wide open so you could pick anything that seemed interesting. Dr. Shaker was super interesting and friendly and this was an easy and enjoyable class. Take it if you have any interest in gender issues or would like a new perspective on the Middle East.",
    "It is absolutely worth taking a class in order to be with Dr. Shaker. This class exposed me to a side of the world and of the Middle East that I was prior unfamiliar to. You read some great first hand sources, the workload and the grading are both very reasonable. This is a great fifth class in my opinion.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it to fellow students."
