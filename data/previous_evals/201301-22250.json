    "Good credit\/D. Schell is a decent seminar leader, there is a lot of reading but most is not absolutely necessary, and you get a lot of freedom with the final paper.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Schell is a very knowledgeable man and his curriculum is extremely comprehensive and interesting.",
    "Take it. Professor Schell is extremely warm and accessible. He gave us his cell number on the first day of class should we like to discuss any of the readings with him. Class was infinitely the better for the little digressions and anecdotes Schell would dole out. I thought the inclusion of the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring was a great supplement to the older stuff (Gandhi, MLK, Mandela) and the theoretical stuff (Arendt, Havel, Clausewitz).",
    "The topic material of this class is phenomenal and inspiring--the kind of analysis that should change how you look at your role in the world around you. Class discussion was sometimes pretty stagnant, though. If you don't take it, read Schell's book. It's beautifully written and the same kind of inspiration you should get from the class.",
    "It's a really interesting examination of nonviolent movements throughout the 20th and early 21st century. Schell has a ton of cool insights on the topics, and he really wants you to speak in class. That said, the workload isn't too terrible (one week of leading discussion, and one 20 page paper, define your grade), but make sure you keep up on the reading or class meetings will be tricky. Overall, I would recommend it if you want a good way to get your EPE advanced seminar done.",
    "This class is a really fantastic study of nonviolent movements over the course of the 20th Century. I think it balances two key aspects very well - first, a case-by-case study of 20th Century nonviolent movements and second, an analytic study of the nature of nonviolence and what makes it unique. I really dont think the course has any major weaknesses - I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the course. The reading in particular is fantastic, and very well chosen. I also think Prof. Schell is fantastic - I think he is incredibly erudite, and a real pleasure to learn with. First, his office hours are incredibly accessible, and he is not at all intimidating in terms of he runs them. They are as much an opportunity to understand course material as they are an opportunity to talk about things you are interested in. Second, he is a very strong seminar leader - he asks pointed questions, and really champions discussion by leading it in the right direction. Perhaps he is more involved than most Professors leading a seminar, but I think his incredible life history and experiences make that worth it. I also think the course syllabus is very well constructed - it is interesting and has the perfect balance of analytic and historical aspects. I really enjoyed this class and look forward to the day Prof.Schell teaches another seminar I can take.",
    "I would recommend this class on the strength of the readings, with the caveat that, in my experience, class discussion itself was sometimes not the best. As someone who knew very little about nonviolent movements coming into the class, I found it an interesting area to learn about. And many of the readings are more broadly relevant for what they have to say about the nature of political power itself, so it's not just a niche class. But while Professor Schell is very nice, and clearly passionate and knowledgeable about his subject, he was not always the best discussion moderator. However, especially given the relatively light workload (the only written assignment was a final paper), I would still consider the class a worthwhile experience."
