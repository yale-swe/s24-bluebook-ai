   "comments": [
    "This class made me appreciate dance as a medium for storytelling, and it fundamentally changed how I relate to the information within my body. Even the idea that I have information in my body at all was something I grasped in this class. Definitely learned some dance skills though I dont currently do any performance dances, and got a good stretch in twice a week.",
    "This course was incredible. It gave me a chance to learn dancing technical skills - vocabulary of movement, how to move (integration of transition, opposition, breath) and also thinking through the use of space, music and symbols within dance. I also learned how to listen to my body, and to understand issues of alignment, posture, balance \/ weight shifting and how that impacted movement.",
    "For the first time in my life, I have felt fully present inside my body outside of deep meditation and Yoga. This class teaches you how to move in a way that is amazing, multi-disciplinary, hopeful, and truly revolutionary. In addition to the Movement Practice portion of the course, Professor Robinson also teaches the theory of Movement and Storyteling, in a way that is immediately accessible to all her students, regardless of their backgrounds.",
    "learned a lot about my body awareness",
    "I learned about the history of dance, and about the action of dance and storytelling itself. I learned about my body. I learned about building choreography. I went into this class with the intention of learning how to choreograph dances for the music I make. I came out learning how to not just do that, but how to make better music too.",
    "I learned a lot about how my body moves and awareness in movement practice. Having floor barre to start off every class helped develop this sense of self. I also learned to create a movement piece with the information internalized in class. I also learned in depth about how opposition and transition can factor into dance and other art forms.",
    "This course provided extensive exposure to the work of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in terms of both dancing and community outreach work. It also provided interactive exposure to modern dance technique, Zena Rommett floor barre, and the practice of choreography.",
    "How to move with your body and use it to tell stories."

   "comments": [
    "Prof R.R. is one of the sweetest, most grounded and connected women I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Just to get to know her and listen to her guide you through movement is worth taking the class. Its applicable to any major, especially anything that interacts with story or relating to an audience. If there were any cons, it would be that the professor is a typical I-cant-navigate-technology type of professor, so the syllabus and assignments could be confusing sometimes, but she was always understanding and didnt penalize people. Also you really have to attend 99% of classes in order to get the full experience as well as maintain an A.",
    "Ms Renee was the strength - without her this course would not be the same. She has a warm, caring and magical presence in the classroom and helps deliver the material in a way that is accessible. I wish there was another practice day for movement so that we can take extra time to integrate things we are learning, particularly for those of us who do not have dance backgrounds. I loved it so much and would have been happy to have an extra day.",
    "I do wish the assignments were more free-form. We had to respond to a specific prompt, and I find that limiting. While limits can sometimes be productive, I found that the pointed questions of the assignments made the difficult to complete. I also think a more structured syllabus would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: Phenomenal course in the structure, movement practices, and Professor Robinson's history makes her one of the most qualified people on the planet to teach this course. Weaknesses: I wish it went longer than I semester because I will miss this course.",
    "this class is different from any other class at yale and its what you make it, it can be really meaningful. as a dance class its a lot of exploring on your own (because the class is pretty big) with some guidance from the professor, the academic portion seemed disconnected and we often didn't get our grades back so it was hard to know where we stood in the class",
    "All strengths. Only weakness is that I would have hoped to receive feedback on assignments earlier, I received amazing feedback on my actual movement though.",
    "Strengths: Floor barre! Bodily manipulation by Ms. Robinson - it's always nice to have a dance teacher than can really get in there to help you get a sense for how to do things right. Weakness: Assignment times and details on Canvas were always confusing and hard to figure out.",
    "One of the course's greatest strengths is how interactive it is. Rather than sitting in a traditional classroom, students actively participate and gain body awareness by moving throughout the class. It required students to think creatively and really engage with the material rather than taking a backseat. It was also great the the class included a wide range of material, including guest teachers and a trip to the British art gallery. The only weaknesses were that the course was somewhat disorganized and assignments given in class often failed to match the online syllabus, which also failed to match the actual \"assignments\" given on Canvas. This could be somewhat confusing. It would also be very helpful to get grades back throughout the semester instead of having no idea how you are doing in the class. Not grading anything until the end of the semester seems to make the grading fuzzy, especially in a class like this where grades are somewhat subjective.",
    "The texts for the course where not very engaging, the course shouldn't shy away from focusing on choreography in exchange for \"rigor\". The movement practice and texts about the movement practice, are rigorous enough."

    "If you can get into this class and will actually attend, its 1000% worth taking. I recommend it to everyone. Its low-stakes and empowering and nourishing, something nearly impossible to get on this campus.",
    "100% YES. Loved how I got to use my body and learn by doing.",
    "Yes. Body knowledge is important.",
    "If you are comfortable dancing and moving your entire body in a way that hasn't been done before, YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No matter your major, Professional devotion, artistic background, or emotional barriers, this course is for you. I don;t have any other words for how wonderful this course is, if you are AT ALL interested in dance, or motion as a modus for storytelling, TAKE. THIS. COURSE!",
    "yes",
    "Yes. Whoever you are, you will benefit from this course.",
    "Yes! Wonderful class with a wonderful instructor and wonderful opportunities to learn :) Also make a group chat because it'll be cute and helpful.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students, whether they are dancers or not. It has been one of my favorite classes at Yale and very unlike any other that I've taken.",
    "A fantastic and enlightening class. Opens your mind up to so much and builds your confidence too!"
