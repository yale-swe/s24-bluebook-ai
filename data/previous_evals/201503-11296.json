   "comments": [
    "The class itself is quite dry and boring, but if you need to take a Statistics course and\/or want to learn how to use Stata take this one.",
    "GLBL 802 teaches the mathematical concepts needed to understand statistical methods. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This is an excellent course. And I love the professor.",
    "If you need to recalibrate your quantitative skills or you want to explore the field before a full commitment to such a discipline, this course is a perfect fit for you.",
    "I'd definitely suggest this class since it is a great introductory course to statistics especially if it is given by Lloyd Grieger.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course does a great job of teaching relevant quant skills to policy students. Lloyd is extremely approachable and teaches skills that will actually be useful after graduation. This course is extremely valuable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend, particularly if more attention is paid to analysis.",
    "Great class - wish he was teaching more classes that I was interested in. It's a mandatory class, but I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "GLBL 802 01 is a review of calculus and introduction to Stata, with a particular focus on understanding statistics for a public policy agenda. I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in public policy, international development, or similar fields.",
    "I would split the description in two: 1) the maths part (first half of the term) is either a great refresher course for someone with a quant background (and not overly simplified\/ boring), or a great way to have a basis in quants for people with policy backgrounds - both helpful cases 2) the stata part is helpful for anyone I think who is going to have to deal with data at some point in their career, which presumably is almost everyone. It helped me figure out what kinds of quant courses I would want to take in the remainder of my time at Yale, also - I don't think Justin Thomas's class is for me, but I know what I'm looking for in an econ class for instance (applied concepts and understanding of the algebra\/ maths behind them)",
    "I would summarize the class as consisting of a half semester of calculus and a half semester of data analysis using Stata. I would tell them that we covered the concepts very quickly, but it was very clear and engaging and a very efficient use of their time to gain skills that are very practical for most disciplines.",
    "Totally recommend. It's the essential foundation for anyone who wants to do anything data-related. You will come out of the class at least seeming like you know what you're talking about when it comes to data and social science research.",
    "Yes. GLBL 802 compared very favorably with a statistics class I took as an undergraduate student at a peer institution. The final exam demonstrated to us how much we had learned and how our new skills could be very fruitfully combined to create useful analysis.",
    "For those with advanced mathematics backgrounds, this class would be too easy. For those needing more review or are quantitatively challenged, this class is more suitable. Because of disparate backgrounds and ability, this class could be split up between those who are OK with 1\/2 stata\/ 1\/2 calculus and those who already are strong in calculus and want more stata."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This class helped me learn to think from a quantitative perspective and consider studies through a critical lens. I think the skills I learned in this class will be very helpful in the future.",
    "It has inspired me to want to take more classes on statistical modeling, as I truly see the value of it in the policy and global affairs field.",
    "This course aligned perfectly with my professional goals.",
    "It definitely deepened my knowledge in quantitative analysis and encouraged me to take similar courses.",
    "This course directly contributed to increasing my knowledge of global affairs. I came back to school to learn more quantitative skills",
    "I can now critically look at studies and read the methods section so that's useful to me!",
    "I feel much more prepared to review and analyze academic materials relevant to my field of interest, as well as perform basic data analysis of my own.",
    "I don't think it's necessarily applicable to what I want to do after but it might be helpful if I have to work with people who analyze data at some point. I think it's good to have a basis in statistical analysis in any case.",
    "It helped me develop basic data analysis skills, and ground those in both theory and real world situations. More than that, it gave me an enthusiasm for data analysis that I had not had prior to the class, and an interest in pursuing it further.",
    "This will help my technical qualifications because I now have knowledge of STATA.",
    "Excellent course. Felt like I am really developing skills that I will need in the real world. Can't wait to keep going next semester with the follow-up practicum. Essential for the degree, in my opinion.",
    "Not particularly relevant to my specific field or an occupation I'm likely to have later BUT it still provided \"hard\" skills.",
    "Before taking GLBL 802 with Professor Grieger, I hadn't considered conducting statistical analysis as part of my career. After taking GLBL 802, I not only feel capable of doing so, but more interested in taking statistics classes in this program and using statistical analysis software in my career.",
    "The calculus portion served as a good refresher and background to stata. The stata portion was a good basic introduction to the program and regressions in general. I look forward to taking Data Analysis as a follow on course."
