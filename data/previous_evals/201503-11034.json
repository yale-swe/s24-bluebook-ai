   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this for students that do not have engineering background. It is a good overview of transport processes and introduction to topics like flux and mass balances. The first half of the course is very challenging but prepares you well for more applied topics in the second half of the course.",
    "A good general introduction to fluid mechanics and material transport. I would recommend this to a friend.",
    "Learning the basics of transport isn't always the most fun or interesting, but is necessary in order to understand more complex material in the future.",
    "I would recommend it to future students. It is the fundamental of fluid mechanics and also environmental transportation.",
    "I'd recommend taking this class. Mass transfer and mathematics of fluid flows is important for an environmental scientist to know. Meny teaches the course well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The lectures were very comprehensive and we learned a tremendous amount during the lectures- owing to the high level of organization of the professor."

   "comments": [
    "Great introduction to engineering techniques and concepts for environmental engineering. It will be helpful for some of the mathematical analysis that will be required in my research.",
    "I don't think this class will be very relevant to my research, but I need to learn the material so that I will be prepared to take Meny's required course for CEE grad. students.",
    "This course significantly deepened my knowledge of environmental transport. The knowledge I gained in this course has not yet contributed to my research, however I anticipate that it will be useful in the future."
