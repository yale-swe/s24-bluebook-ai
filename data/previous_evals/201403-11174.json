    "This is a rigorous introduction to ideas in the field, and is an overview of professional elements.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The professional socialization component of the course is particularly helpful for incoming students.",
    "PLSC 510 was an intro course that focused half on exploring the ways different sub-fields look at the question of representation and half on professional strategies for success in the field of political science. There is a pretty significant amount of reading but the only assignments are a 5 and a 10 page paper. 510 is mandatory for new graduate students and is pass\/fail but I would recommend that one do as much reading as possible so as to make the discussions more interesting."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt that I got a comprehensive overview of ideas relating to representation which often seeps in to each subfield.",
    "Without the final paper requirement, I may not have ventured further into the representative theory literature, and my thinking about phenomena in my own research area would have been worse for it. The course absolutely convinced me of the utility, and perhaps necessity, of drawing insights from several different subfields to produce interesting research questions. I am very appreciative of that.",
    "While the course didn't specifically contribute to my research, it was useful for my professional socialization and understanding of what my colleagues are doing in the field.",
    "I don't think the course was terribly effective in deepening my understanding or knowledge in terms of my dissertation or research, but it was excellent in terms of building community with my cohort, exposing us to parts of the field of political science that we might otherwise avoid and not discuss critically, and giving some good lessons on how to succeed as a professional. 510 is clearly a constantly-evolving course, and I look forward to seeing how it changes in the coming years.",
    "This course gave me helpful information about making it through the PhD program successfully, preparing for the job market and preparing to publish. It was not particularly helpful preparation for my own research.",
    "The course provided an interesting exposure and discussion of topics on a PhD level, but selection of texts was perhaps too broad (even haphazard?)"
