   "comments": [
    "This is a solid class! It will significantly deepen your knowledge of statistical physics, and it's probably a good course for anyone to take, irrespective of whether it's required.",
    "Departmental requirements aside, I would absolutely recommend this course, because the subject matter is among the most interesting stuff I've learned all year.",
    "This course is very basic and important for physics students. I think more and more science subjects are starting to use methods in statistical mechanics.",
    "PHY 512 is a great overall survey of statistical physics with a brief overview of thermodynamics; the connections are made clear and the statistical physics of different systems and particle types are examined. I would recommend this course to a fellow student; it gives a good theoretical basis and practical knowledge of distributions.",
    "Yes, it's a crucial course.",
    "Phys 512 is a very interesting class. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "The course reached deeply into the study of the theory involved in Statistical Physics, covering the mathematical foundations for many topics in thermodynamics."

   "comments": [
    "Statistical mechanics is at the heart of my discipline - it permeates everything I do. This course significantly increased my knowledge of stat mech and improved my skill with using its concepts. I doubt I could take enough stat mech, to be honest - it's so useful.",
    "Stat Mech is relevant to a lot of contemporary physics research. I'm not doing theoretical condensed matter, but much of what we learned is still very important for understanding superconductivity and cryogenics.",
    "Having had a sparse understanding of statistical physics before this course, this class gave me a great basis for statistical physics. My research includes much work with atomic spins and the spin distributions, which will require the skills taught in this class",
    "I have a greater appretiation for the importance of statistical mechanics.",
    "This course offered a very deep treatment of the subject, and revealed how rich the theory of the field can be."
