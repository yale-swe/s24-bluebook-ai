   "comments": [
    "It is a great class where you study different chords and modulation techniques than you had studied previously. However, instead of just studying how to use these new things, you see how they were applied by the greats, and see how these things are not academic, but rather ways to enhance the music.",
    "Definitely. The mixture of harmony and music history was great, and the composition exercises were fun.",
    "A continuation of 210. More about harmony, and more about form. You do some pretty fun analyses. By the end, you are composing much fuller model compositions.",
    "I loved this class! Professor McCreless was really fun and just a really cool guy. I really enjoyed going to class, and he was very helpful with everything I needed help with. The second half of the class is somewhat free-form... a lot of random topics in Chromatic theory and looks at applications. But every topic was interesting, so I always found myself intrigued.",
    "This class is required for the major, but as a musician, I would have taken it anyway. You study music theory on a more advanced level than in 210, and you get to try your hand at composing some of the forms you have studied. Some of these techniques, like hexatonicism, are really fascinating. If you can, take it with Professor McCreless--he's both knowledgeable and reasonable.",
    "Good class with McCreless, you learn a fair amount and not tons of work.",
    "The class definitely expects you to have fulfilled the prerequisites. There isn't a slow beginning or anything, you pretty much just start going with the material. But, it is a good course following 210, and it's interesting and enjoyable. I do recommend this class to other students.",
    "Music 211 is an excellent course, both as a requirement for the major and simply as an exploration of more advanced theory concepts. I found the composition component to be a highlight of the class. Professor McCreless was exceptional and extremely familiar with all of the music we listened to.",
    "Music 211 is a required course for the music major if you didn't place out of it. It covers music of the romantic period and continues the trend of complexity of harmony across the 200-level theory courses to include chromatic harmony. Major works covered in the class are the Beethoven piano sonatas and the Schubert song cycles.",
    "Music 211 is a great prerequisite class; however, if you're just looking for a music class to take, it might not be your best choice. The class concentrates very heavily on art songs and opera, so if you're not interested in either one of these things, you'll want to look into another course.",
    "Definitely try to take this with McCreless if you can. He's delightful and a very fair grader. The workload isn't bad at all with him. From what I hear though, this class will be completely different if it's taught by another professor though."
