    "Fun, challenging, opportunities to both analyze and compose.",
    "Great introductory music theory course. I found it a lot more informative and interesting than 210, though the analysis gets trickier. Professor McCreless is great, I would recommend taking the course with him, though I'm sure the TFs are fine too. Overall I didn't find this class to be too much work, though some assignments take longer than others.",
    "Music 211 teaches the student to notice, observe, appreciate, and apply the various concepts in music theory, building off of those learned in Music 210. The expectation is that concepts from 210 are well-understood, but given sufficient time dedicated to the study and application of concepts, the class proves a thorough and rewarding exploration of the development of certain forms of classical music. Several projects will involve composition of original pieces based upon those studied in class; for these, little to no experience in composition is necessary, and 210 should sufficiently equip\/prepare the student for work on these projects. I would recommend 211 to students, especially those considering a music major. However, non-music majors, if they seek a more thorough understanding of music theory, should not discount this course, given sufficient dedication to study."
