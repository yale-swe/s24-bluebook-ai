    "The course was very interesting inthat it gave the opportunity to visit many different museum institutions and explore multiple resources. It also gave the opportunity to work hands-on with the paper material, making handmade paper and casting it into molds.Be wary, however, that depending on the the instructor, the class exercises and lessons can be quite disorganized.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you are at all interested in learning about art in general and learning about ways of talking about\/evaluating art. However, know that this class is not the gut class you think it is! There is actually quite a bit of work (an assortment of small art projects, a research paper+presentation, final art project), but it is all totally manageable if you stay on top of things.",
    "Art 002 was not what I expected at all. At first it seemed like it was going to be a very enjoyable class and that we were going to learn interesting things about paper and how artists use paper in their art, but I really did not enjoy the class at all. We read things that were barely relevant and all of the assignments seemed to be just busy work. I would definitely not recommend the class at all. It turned out to be a lot more work than it should have been.",
    "TAKE PAPER YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Such an amazing class - the opportunities to visit hidden parts of campus and see AMAZING art. It is a tuesday-thursday class: on tuesday we were in the studio making really cool projects, and on thursday we took trips to art galleries and museums on campus. We even got a trip to NYC to visit artists' studios. I feel like I've experienced part of Yale I never would have without this class.",
    "An exploration of paper from a wide array of artistic and historical perspectives. The best part of this class is the weekly field trips to amazing Yale libraries like the Beinecke and the Haas Library, as well as one field trip to artist studios in New York City! Getting to explore Yale's resources was really amazing for me; I felt so privileged to be able to interview two prominent Yale curators for my final paper. Occasionally, the workload became greater than I expected from this class, especially around the final paper and project. For the most part, though, this was a great class.",
    "Don't take. Not recommended as a fifth class either, which is what I tried to take. There are other worthwhile classes that you can learn from.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class! It's not a very difficult class, but do expect to put in a lot of time when you do your projects. If the professor knows that you don't commit as much time to this class as to your other classes, she'll generally be more critical of your work and maybe grade harsher on your assignments, so be sure that you have time in your schedule before signing up. It's a good fifth class, and doing the work sometimes felt more relaxing than under pressure."
