    "Good course, interesting readings.",
    "Great class. You read some fantastic\/interesting books that you wont read in any other class at Yale. Professor Ghambou can be a strict grader but he's a good discussion leader and really cares about the material that he teaches. Also not too much work, a novel a week with a 5-6 page paper, presentation and longer 10-12 page paper.",
    "Yes take this class and read awesome african writers, you'll enjoy it.",
    "I would reccomend this class for anybody.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn more about these topics. The novels we read were wonderful and not generally books I would have thought to read on my own, and class discussion was enlightening and interesting. The workload is not too bad and you come out of the class feeling like you really have an immense amount of new knowledge. Definitely, definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone seeking to read works they would not normally have read. We were exposed to the foremost postcolonial writers and works, from household names like Conrad and Achebe at the beginning of the course, to recent stars in the field such as Cristina Garcia and Tayeb Salih. Prof. Ghambou knows what he is talking about, and although I would have been content with just listening to him, he provided us ample opportunity to engage these texts in class discussions. It wasn't an extremely strenuous class either in terms of workload (one book a week, one presentation, a short paper and a longer final paper).",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. The reading list is amazing and the discussions made me look at the texts in ways I wouldn't have thought of before. Prepare yourself to read a book a week but fortunately they're not too long. They are also fun to read. If you don't like the prof's style, you'llknow from the first meeting so shop it just to be sure. I had a great experience in the course but it depends so much on the students, it's hard to say if it will be the same next time. Prof Ghambou is really excellent though."
