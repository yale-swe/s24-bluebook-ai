   "comments": [
    "A fun art class for beginners or the more experienced--you'll mainly spend a lot of time getting the hang of charcoal drawings. Be careful, because this class is all about the professor you get. Serrano is one of the more chill ones out there, although the critiques will still be brutally honest, for better or for worse. If you're willing to spend enough time practicing and working on your drawings, you'll actually see some real improvement, and you'll probably get a decent amount out of this class no matter what your level of prior experience is.",
    "Make sure you have sufficient time in your schedule to dedicate to this class. It's not extremely work-intensive, but will be much more rewarding if you are able to work on the projects at a leisurely pace. Otherwise, definitely a good exploratory class.",
    "A very good course. You get back what you put in, but if art genuinely excites you, whatever your innate ability, you will probably find the course meaningful.",
    "Yes - If you actually like drawing and want to get better. Not as a gut.",
    "I would recommend Basic Drawing to another student. At times the workload seemed quite a burden, but it paid off to put the hours in each week to produce quality work, and I made noticeable progress in my drawings over the course of the semester. There was a heavy focus on still lives for the first half of the semester, which eventually became rather tiring, but the assignments during the second half of the semester were much more thought-provoking and interesting. The class emphasizes drawing from observation, and I think that as long as people are willing to put in the time they have the potential to gain impressive drawing skills, even if they have never done art before or think they \"can't draw.\"",
    "ART 114 is definitely not geared towards non-art majors. Unless you're serious about drawing, I wouldn't recommend this class."
