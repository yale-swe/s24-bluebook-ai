   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is an excellent course. While the material is complex, it is to understand given the quality of lectures.",
    "This is a very information intensive course. A lot of material is covered over the course of 36 lectures - each one about an hour long. Sometimes it is tough to tell what level of detail you need to know for assessments and TAs are not super helpful in providing guidelines regarding this. Just going to each lecture and interacting with all professors\/TAs\/students may help give you a sense of what is important and what is not. Exams are only a couple questions long so be prepared to have only a few of all the concepts actually tested.",
    "Definitely one of the best course.",
    "Yes, definitely for students who is interested in projects related to immunology.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student because it provides a thorough and conceptual view of the immune system.",
    "Yes. Great immunology course to learn everything from the basics to more in depth.",
    "It covers the most important aspects of immunology in short lecture sessions, and since the most important topics are repeatedly brought up it's really easy to understand and remember. Seriously recommended to anyone who intends to work in immunology-related labs in the future.",
    "Yes",
    "It's a great course that introduces the department, but challenging if you haven't taken an intro immunology course before because it jumps around a lot.",
    "Strongly recommend.This course is very useful to get a overview of immunology.",
    "This is a strong introduction to Immunology. The quality of lectures varies, but it is a very worthwhile course overall."

   "comments": [
    "If I end up going to medical school, I imagine this will be a very useful course. Similarly if plan on doing research in biology, some knowledge from this course can prove useful. Unfortunately, because so much information is presented I'm not really sure how much I will actually remember as I was not able to study material very deeply.",
    "This course contributed to my research by teaching the fundamentals of immunology that my future work will depend upon.",
    "IBIO 530 helped lay the groundwork for much exciting immunology to come! Lots of paradigms have been developed through the history of the field and we covered many of them, but it was also made clear through a number of lectures that these paradigms are also being reformed and challenged as well. There are many exciting new discoveries that are allowing immunology to cross-pollinate with a number of other fields.",
    "It gave me a basic understanding of a topic that is closely related to what my research is. It's so much better than trying to read up everything by myself.",
    "I took this course after taking several advanced departmental courses. It was helpful to return to the fundamentals and ensure that I have a solid, broad foundation in Immunology."
