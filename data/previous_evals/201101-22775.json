    "Modern philosophy is definitely interesting and worth the larger amount of work (compared to first semester) if you're willing to take it! Try to get into a section where you're comfortable with your classmates and your professor. It makes the learning a lot easier and the conversation really organic and fruitful, not to mention fun.",
    "DS philosophy spring term is just excellent, and I really appreciated Grewal's efforts.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy covers the latter half of the Western cannon in philosophy including Descartes, Hume, Kant, and Nietzsche. Small discussion groups are very useful to help learn the philosophy and the variety of lectures were useful in gaining different perspectives on philosophers.",
    "Yes stick with it",
    "Second semester philosophy is quite different from the first, as the modern works focus more on ethics and morality, with theology taking more of a backseat compared to the end of first semester. I for one found this refreshing; in any case it\u0092s something those questioning whether to continue with DS should know. In terms of teaching: Dr. Grewal has her own way of looking at each work and her own interests, and as such often focuses on things in section that one wouldn\u0092t initially expect. I found this interesting, but it could be frustrating for someone looking for section to really reinforce the main ideas of the text. In our class, discussion was fairly open, but at the same time, I think we covered the important ideas from each work - just not with the same precision as other sections did. If you do have Dr. Grewal, I would recommend going to office hours \u0096 she\u0092s not a tough grader, but I think it really helped to talk things out with her before writing."
