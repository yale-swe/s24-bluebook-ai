    "The introductory information to evaluate markets separately",
    "I learned so much from this course, about both economics and life. I learned all of the topics we covered very thoroughly, as well as developed study tactics that will be helpful in future college courses. Furthermore, Tolga made sure to connect almost every economic topic with some sort of real world application.",
    "The fundamentals to economics, fundamentals to life, everything you could imagine.",
    "I learned an overview of microeconomics and acquired skills such concerning consumer theory and such.",
    "Through this course, I learned the basics of microeconomics. This course was an excellent introduction to economics.",
    "The basics of microeconomics and how to apply them to real life.",
    "My understanding of economics.",
    "I improved my ability to analyze the economic advantages and disadvantages of a policy or course of action. I learned a huge amount about optimization, market structures, and game theory. I am able to analyze situations in a quantifiable way.",
    "Given that I do not plan on majoring in economics, I found many of the conceptual components of this course most pertinent to my potential future. While I don't think the heavy focus on math will be especially useful to me, it helped enforce the underlying concepts, demonstrating why they are to be believed in the first place."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: the fact that it's a seminar, the way the information is presented Weakness: doesn't line up with the lecture so hard for students to collaborate",
    "Office hours are convenient because Tolga walks through each question on the week's pset. There is not scheduled opportunity, however, to have a conversation with Tolga about more conceptual economic questions. I was able to get through this by going to residential college tutors office hours, but I think that there should be something offered through Econ 110.",
    "I don't see any weaknesses in this course.",
    "Tolga was an amazing teacher. Very engaging, the problem sets were the right amount of difficult. Great format, loved the class as is.",
    "Strengths - problem sets were very helpful in learning material and reinforcing concepts from lecture. Lectures were informative, fun, and entertaining. Small size helpful with ability to ask questions. Weaknesses - some concepts from lecture were not covered or thoroughly practiced in problem sets. Sometimes, what lectures concepts were important and which ones were less important was not made clear.",
    "The strengths are that this course gave me an overview of economics as a whole and also helped me understand specific concepts such as monopolies and competitive markets. However, the material was rushed through and could have been taught much better.",
    "The strengths of this course were the small classroom setting, and the proficiency of our professor. There were not any weaknesses to the course.",
    "A strength is the instructor he was extremely helpful.",
    "Tolga is a great teacher and I thought it was a great class! No weaknesses.",
    "The course was taught in an extremely engaging way and the material was organized perfectly. I think the material was administered in the perfect way."

    "Tolga is a wonderful instructor and this is a worthwhile class to take",
    "This course is much more motivating than Econ 115. In Econ 115, a number of students may be asleep or on Buzzfeed at any time, and it is easy to either miss lecture or do other work during lecture. In Econ 110, the small class size is more demanding of your attention, and Tolga expects a lot from his students. Overall, the in-class experience of Econ 110 will be more rigorous. I found, however, that much of my economic intuition comes from simply working through the textbook outside of lecture, an experience which would not differ whether you were in 110 or 115. The curve in this class is tough, but not awful. Unless you're great at econ, just doing the psets each week will not be enough to get by. If you read the textbook regularly (ideally an in depth read of a chapter before a lecture and a quick skim after the lecture), you can do well. I have found there to be a bit of a misconception about what it means that this course is a \"seminar.\" A seminar is not, for this course, a roundtable discussion. This course is taught in a lecture style . The advantage which this gives over the Econ 115 is that there are only 15-30 students in each lecture, so it is easier to ask the professor questions.",
    "I would recommend this to any student at Yale College, from those who are looking to major in Economics or simply trying to broaden their horizons. This class provides a much more engaging and developed foundation on the subject of Economics that is far more useful than the equivalent lecture course.",
    "YES. I would without a doubt recommend this course to another student!!! The seminar is so much better than the lecture, so for anyone considering taking an intro econ course or becoming an econ major, I would definitely recommend taking 110. The smaller class size makes it much easier to address any questions you could have. Furthermore, it's easier to get to know some of your classmates and form study groups (and if you have Tolga, he makes sure you form study groups, which is super helpful!!) Also, while you learn everything students in 115 learn (and more, because we go at a faster pace), you learn topics in more depth and end up with a greater understanding of the material. Overall, it's an amazing class that everyone should take!!",
    "I strongly recommend this class. My favorite class at yale so far. Tolga is an incredible teacher, and teaches so much more than economics.",
    "My students who can't do large lecture classes, the econ seminar is a great way to learn intro econ.",
    "I recommend the lecture because it is much more lenient and isn't as rushed through.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Any student interested in Economics should take 110 with Professor Koker.",
    "Yes because Tolga is a great professor my love for this class is because of him and less about the material covered.",
    "Yes I was very stuck between the seminar and lecture but the seminar for me personally was much easier to learn in so students who prefer small classroom settings may like it more.",
    "Yes as its a good course to take and Tolga is a great teacher. Really engaging!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is taught so well and Tolga is extremely wise. It is a one-of-a-kind course and you will learn massive amounts.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in economics with a good math foundation. Though I made it through the course as a prospective humanities major, I saw that students with stronger math backgrounds more easily processed the rapid pace of the class, and fared far better on the midterm which was less a regurgitation of information than an exploration of applications (as it should be). I was not a student in the lecture, but I have heard that students who would handle a more conceptual approach better should take the lecture."
