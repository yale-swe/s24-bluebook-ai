    "The class is hands on experience in an archaeological field as well as learning how to examine and write up a report based on archaeological finds and research. It is a necessary class for archaeology majors and a fun class for other students.",
    "Easy introduction to archaeology field techniques, but if really want to learn go to a reputable field school over a summer. Definitely not for students with any experience.",

    "I was able to go one step further in my archaeological experience.",
    "As a grad student with significant field experience this course was a bit of a waste of time. I guess it could serve as a refresher in some field techniques, but most of the time I found myself advising the other students, not learning any thing new. Definitely did not contribute significantly to my knowledge of the discipline or to my dissertation research.",
    "This course served as a broad and instructive launching pad for future courses in the field, as well as for my thesis preparation."
