   "comments": [
    "This class provides a useful introduction to a broad array of topics in cybersecurity. You'll learn a lot, and Ted Wittenstein is a great person to get to know.",
    "A decent class about cybersecurity, of which there are few at Yale. If you are looking for a class that is extremely engaging, this may not be it. If you are looking to dabble in Cybersecurity, look no further.",
    "This is a really great course. I learned a ton about cybersecurity, and class discussions were fantastic, although this probably depends more on the people in your seminar than anything else. Professor Wittenstein is a wonderful professor. Would definitely take it again. Be forewarned that the course is probably about an average (maybe slightly above average) workload, but that it can really bunch up if you leave the group project\/final paper\/policy memo all to the last half of the semester. Do the policy memo early and get it out of the way, start research for the paper over spring break (you'll need to submit a topic beforehand anyway) and you'll be just fine.",
    "Yes, especially if you'd like to learn more about the intersection between security and technology. Cybersecurity is often a misnomer; this isn't a class just about cyber warfare or critical infrastructure protection--there's also Internet governance, government surveillance, and a litany of other important issues to discuss and learn about."
