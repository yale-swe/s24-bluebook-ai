   "comments": [
    "It's a good foundational political science course that will be interesting even if you have some knowledge of the material being read in the class. The papers are fun and easy to write.",
    "yah as long as you dont think its easy",
    "I would recommend this course. There sometimes seems to be a lot of reading but if you do the majority of it and read Professor Shapiro's bookyou would be completely fine. If you take the course without writing, all the tests are open book and open note so they are not especially stressful. Overall, this course introduces you to a lot of thinkers that I think everyone should read at one point in their lives. However, if you do not enjoy philosophical thinking, I would not take it.",
    "A great course! Professor Shapiro is a great lecturer and he keeps the information interesting. I definitely have a better understand of political theory. If you are deciding between different intro courses, definitely consider this one!!",
    "The class is incredibly interesting, but lacks a bit of applicability to real world situations. You do learn the moral foundations of politics in general, but you do not learn much that can explain the politics of our day. Towards the end, democracy is touched upon a little, but very superficially.All in all, a good class to take if majoring in philosophy\/political science. It's more about how societies or governments are formed, and have been formed throughout the past few centuries, than about morality.",
    "This course is an overall good summary of some pretty well known works\/philosophers that I think are interesting to read, and although the course itself is not necessarily the most interesting I'm still glad I took it. I guess if you are interested in political science or want to figure out if you are interested in it I would take the course.",
    "Great class. Only two 7-8 pg papers and the final, however, you are required to read through numerous books in order to keep up in section and lecture.",
    "SHOP BEFORE YOU PICK IT. I HATED THIS CLASS. HATED IT. I REPEAT I HATED THIS CLASS. IT IS TERRIBLE. If I could go back in time and not take this class I would. If you aren't a philosophy person do not take this class. And look at the textbook list before you decide to take it. First of all buying all the books can get expensive and second of all the amount of reading there is is horrific. I love reading, and there's always a lot of reading at Yale, but you will not do all the reading for this class, I promise you that. And some of it is extremely boring (MacIntyre? gag). Really ask people about this class before you take it. Now that I feel I've gotten revenge, the more rational side of will say that all the reading was a good base for a Poli Sci major or something along those lines. Also the final\/midterm or papers if writing intensive aren't that hard at all. But seriously don't say I didn't warn you.",
    "This class is really interesting for anyone interested in political philosophy. The readings can be a bit dry sometimes, but overall the class is pretty cool. I would definitely recommend this class to other people, especially if you are interested in reading the works of some of the most influential political thinkers of the Western world.",
    "If you've never taken a political philosophy course before, this is a great class to take. Professor Shapiro is very well versed in the philosophy and the decision to frame the course around the story of Adolph Eichmann is genius. That said, the lecture can sometimes be a little dry and readings are often dense and sometimes hard to get through. But if you do all the readings the course will be very rewarding and you will emerge with a great sense of major philosophical traditions that still impact our society today and with an ability to apply these philosophies to modern issues.",
    "Great course teaching you five intellectual traditions during Enlightenment& Post-Enlightenment. The lectures may seem a bit fragmented, but if you really understand everything, you will realize how everything really elegantly fit together (for this piecing things together, definitely get Professor Shapiro's book). Also, go for the writing credit--it's much less stressful and an easy way to knock out an WR credit.",
    "Absolutely, if you have any interest at all in political philosophy. It'll give you a great cursory understanding of some of the most important political thinkers and their writings\/ideas.Take it writing-intensive.",
    "yeah but you gotta go to lecture",
    "MoFoPo is a strange creature.You'll get about 200 pages of reading assigned every week, and usually you'll be reading someone like John Locke or Descartes whose writing is purposely convoluted and archaic.The thing is, you'll rarely actually discuss the reading in lecture, and even in section, you'll only ever go over the most basic stuff. If you take this class writing intensive (you should), you'll have no midterm and a relatively easy final that's open-note and asks broad essay questions rather than specific details.You'll have two 3000 word papers, but no one ever seems to get anything below a B+ on them and lots of people get A-.Shapiro wrote a book called \"The Moral Foundations of Politics\" specifically for this course, and it contains simplified summaries of all the readings in plain English.Long story short, if you do none of the readings except for his book, which you should read cover-to-cover during reading week, you can still easily get an A. The essays are broad and can be written based on the lectures.Now, I'm not saying you should do this. It's what I did and I sort of regret it because I think I could have gotten more out of the class if I'd done all the reading. But it's just so much reading that unless you really care, you'll end up not doing it.Also, all the lectures are available online on OYC, meaning that if you're not a morning person, you'll find it difficult to motivate yourself to go to lecture when you could just stay in bed and watch the lecture. Go to class.",
    "Good introduction. Wouldn't kill Shapiro to update his slides and the material once in a while. Good writing credit",
    "MOFOPO is a great intro course. You will learn so much about political philosophy!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The material is fascinating, and Professor Shapiro's lens is a really valuable one. Professor Shapiro is not the most dynamic lecturer, so sometimes I found my mind wandering during lecture. However, the content of the lectures is not only interesting but well-presented, so that paying attention really pays off. For the first few lectures, I actually heard someone say something along the lines of \"I love this class, it makes me think\" almost every class when I was leaving. There is a lot of reading, and because there is only the final and the mid term it can be tempting not to skip some assignments. However, you won't get nearly as much out of lecture if you haven't done the reading, and any time that I didn't do it I always found myself wishing that I had.",
    "It's worth it. It's cool to have a chance to read these thinkers and Shapiro's synthesis of them is outstanding. Plus Shapiro's lectures are in depth enough that the readings aren't really necessary (at least if you're not in a WR section), which means that you can read what you want to\/what you have time for without killing yourself over it. It's a great introduction to political philosophy; it gave me a new and interesting framework to consider governments.",
    "If you take Mofopo, take it WR intensive. I find that WR intensive TAs are much better instructors than the non-WR intensive ones, and you'll get much more out of the class by writing essays about philosophers and by analyzing practical uses of political philosophy.That being said, don't take this class if you're not willing to put the work into reading\/attending lectures. There are much better classes out there if you're looking for a fifth class, but this class is good because it's a nice survey course of philosophers and it's so established as a \"Yale\" course that you'll find that a lot of your friends have taken it before and are available to help you out. I think I learned a lot, but only because I applied myself towards the end of the semester. You'll probably learn more if you apply yourself consistently throughout the course.",
    "A great survey of important and relevant political theory, organized by concept, not by chronology.Good course -- and on yale open courses. This is useful if you don't understand a certain lecture and want to go back and review.Easy writing credit (two papers which you get to revise with feedback before they are graded).",
    "I would recommend PLSC 118 as a good introductory course, but as it is a survey course it does not go into that much depth on each philosopher. Without taking it writing intensive the course really is not much work at all, but it is really worth it to take it writing intensive. There are only two papers that are not too long and the prompts are really fun to write about and help you get much more out of the class.",
    "What makes a nation legitimate? To begin to answer this question, take this class! You will never look at the world the same way again! The readings are wonderful, the lectures are wonderful, the section discussions are heated debates and fascinating. You will love it!",
    "A really great class. Shapiro does a great job of giving a clear, concise, and fascinating overview of the major philosophical trends after the Enlightenment. PLSC 118 is more devoted to policy applications than its counterparts, so you will write a lot of \"how would X philosopher analyze Y policy\" papers, but I think that's a super useful exercise. Make sure to shop around TAs, because some are a lot better than others.",
    "This is a really great class. Professor Shapiro is a commanding and engaging lecturer, and the readings are good (though sometimes a bit long). A working knowledge of the Enlightenment project should be had by every learned person\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially since our democratic system is structured around fulfilling the goals of that project. That said, discussion in section can lag a bit, especially if the students in it are uncommitted. It is unfortunate that there is a reputation that Political Science courses can be taken as 'gut' courses; this is class the demands real attention and engagement. On the plus side, it is on Yale OpenCourses, and there is a companion book (which prints Professor Shapiro's lectures almost word-for-word), which is *incredibly* helpful when studying for the final.",
    "I recommend this class if you are willing to do a lot of reading and put in a lot of time outside of class to get it done. If you are willing to do that the class is a great one. Ian Shapiro is a great lecturer and taught the class very well. The course is tightly structured and has a lot of reading, so it is a little hard to keep up, but it is a good course. The syllabus was completely covered and the lectures weren't too fast. The course definitely covered what the moral foundations of politics were.",
    "I would recommend it - the classwork isn't too bad (not all the readings are strictly necessary and lecture does a good job of covering important ideas) and it's an easy WR credit.Professor Shapiro is decent, if a little dry.",
    "MoFoPo is a decent introduction to political philosophy. I was initially under the impression that it would be an easy writing credit, but retrospectively, I'm not so sure that it was. Take it if you're interested in the material, but don't if you just want an easy 5th class.",
    "Extremely easy but super boring.",
    "It's a great introductory class for political science. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Old political thinkers and the material can get pretty dry, at least for me. It does set you up with a good political foundation though, so if that interests you I would recommend the class.",
    "great course in political philosophy. that being said, i would recommend it over intro to political philosophy .",
    "I enjoyed it. Look at the syllabus and take it if you want to read those authors. Great wr credit.",
    "MoFoPo is a great class if you're considering majoring in political science or ethics, politics, and economics. Professor Shapiro isn't the most lively speaker, but he explains the reading really well and is worth listening to. One of my favorite things about MoFoPo is that it's on Yale Open Courses. Whenever I missed lecture or wanted to prepare for a test, I could go online to watch a video of it or download the essay prompts\/midterm\/final from a few years ago. The reading is pretty long and dense, so don't expect to do it all. The philosophers have really interesting perspectives though and they challenged my political opinions on a whole new level. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in government or policy.",
    "Lots of reading, but very interesting if you have little knowledge of many of these philosophers.",
    "Depends. DONT take it thinking I like politics and I like philosophy so I would like political philosophy. it is one of the open courses so go on youtube listen to first 2 lectures and decide. also if you must, take it WR credit at least in the end it will be useful for something",
    "A good course, but very dense and abstract. Provides a very in-depth background to the development of different forms of government\/mentalities of what a society should provide.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in political philosophy and want to build a strong foundation, it is important to understand thinkers such as Locke, Rawls, etc. and how all of the philosophers' ideas relate to democracy. I suggest the writing credit - two 10 page papers that are not hard as long as you find evidence in the assigned reading to back up your points. final was long and arduous but no surprises, it was pretty straightforward. the lectures can be boring but its almost relaxing because you can just sit there andtype out notes without really having to think much...although eventually you have to put the pieces together for the papers and final.",
    "Great summary of major thinkers of the past 2-3 centuries. after taking this class, I really want to get in more depth with the scholars we talked about as well as explore other thinkers",
    "Great course! It covers the essential thinkers of the enlightenment, readings are great but papers are not that easy to write.",
    "great course for those who want to major in polisci or who have an interest in politics and its philosophical foundations.",
    "I don't know. If there's another course you can take to get a basic background in political philosophy, take that instead.",
    "Great introduction to political science and philosophers including Marx, Rawls, Engels, Locke, Mill, Nozick, etc. Cover a lot of material not incredibly deep but writing optional allows for more depth. Very heavy on reading work - if you choose to do them all. Read as many as possible before section though and discussions will be really intellectually stimulating.",
    "Good intro course to philosophy. If you fall behind on a certain author, you can bypass the readings by doing sufficient outside research. Take it writing intensive; the essays are a phenomenal way of synthesizing the material learned in the course, and they help you understand philosophers so that you can later apply them on the final.",
    "Moral Foundations of Politics gives a good introduction to and overview of many of the most famous political philosophers. The lectures are interesting and the class provides an opportunity to read many of the texts you feel you should read before graduation.",
    "This was an interesting class. The lecture could get boring at times, but it was never too bad. Your section can pretty much make or break the class for you so make sure you end up in a good one. There was quite a bit of reading and a lot of it is neccessary especially to prepare for section. I would recommend this class to another student as long as they were interested in reading about political theory."
