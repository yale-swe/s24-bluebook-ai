   "comments": [
    "You read different works of writing and try to emulate them, the course is divided into segments like cultural criticism, opinion, profile, place, memoir.. you write the essays and get workshopped by your peers once. I would DEFINITELY recommend it to ANYONE at Yale.. great class and very useful because even if you dont want to be a journalist so you might not ever have to write a \"place\" essay in particular, the skills you will learn (and you learn a lot!) will be valuable in virtually ANY profession.",
    "ENGL 120 is about writing nonfiction essays, but in a creative and engaging way (no research papers or stuff like that). There's a paper draft due every week, but usually the rough draft is the greatest load, followed by revisions and the final draft. Pick a section that only has 5 papers, not 6, and your reading week will be so much better!This is honestly the best class that I have taken at Yale. My writing has improved vastly, and I had fun while doing so. I definitely recommend it, even if you already technically have your writing credits.",
    "Take it if you want to explore different kinds of creative writing. Don't take it if the idea of turning in a polished draft or final essay every week daunts you.",
    "Where do I even begin? I've never fancied myself a writer. All throughout childhood and high school I always preferred doing math problems or reading science books to literature and creating prose. I took English 120 because my freshman counselor said it would make me a better writer, and it did. The class was hard, without a doubt, but it's demanding nature was its greatest strength. Every essay seemed to be a do-or-die assignment. If I wrote a poor first draft, my professor made it a point to bluntly say so and it hurt a bit. BUT, the end result was me learning how to effectively manipulate the English language in such a way that could be read comprehensively. Truly a great class. I highly recommend that everyone take it, especially freshmen.",
    "Yes, trust.",
    "Take it! Even if you don't get placed into a section, if you wait it out things generally work out. The readings, assignments, and workshops are a lot of fun!",
    "Definitely recommend it, but be ready to put in the work. If you put in a lot of work to it you will learn so much and improve your writing tons. The class is structured into units, such as profile, place essay, memoir etc. and you spend two weeks doing readings that relate to the topic and then finding ways in which you can incorporate their techniques into your own writing. Fehrman's comments are incredibly helpful, and the readings we did were fantastic. Take this class!",
    "Yes. Without a doubt. Do it.",
    "It's a great class for those who want to improve their writing. It requires a lot of time and hard work to do well and feel satisfied by the assignments, but it's worth the work and the readings for each class are interesting and fun.",
    "Good class. About an essay every week. This doesn't sound too difficult but for a student like myself that takes forever to write papers, it was a definitely more time consuming than I had anticipated. Craig Fehrman was a great professor and really chill guy. The readings were really engaging and the different units kept the readings and essays exciting. I would definitely recommend this for anyone interested in improving their non-fictional writing. Keep in mind that if you are a fictional writer, you may find this class a little restricting and will have to learn new ways to write which is actually very useful.",
    "This is a must-take course at Yale. Everyone, no matter what major, will benefit from learning to write better. Take this course.",
    "Take it. Definitely worth it, if you're looking for input on your writing, great class discussion and interaction between students, and new ways to evaluate writing. Hard to get a good grade, though.",
    "This is a class about writing. If you're interested in literary analysis -- or, more broadly, in the pure meaning of a work -- don't take 120. The analysis done is all of form and style, which is wonderful from a writer's perspective, but potentially dull for a strict English major.",
    "You should take this class. If you like writing non fiction\/journalism at all, this is a great class and it's fun."
