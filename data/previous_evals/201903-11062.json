   "comments": [
    "Much knowledge about this period in Viennese history and critical thinking, reasoning. I was exposed to a wide, diverse array of writers I wasn't familiar with.",
    "I gained an understanding of important authors, artists, philosophers, etc of fin-de-siecle Vienna, and the impact of this cultural era on the West and modernity. Skills-wise, I improved my writing greatly through close feedback and benefited from the expertise of graduate students in the course.",
    "I developed a good understanding of the literature, film and art of Vienna c. 1900. The small class size allowed me to be actively involved in our discussions. I improved my paper writing, and also my German reading skills."
   ]
  },
  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were the diverse array of interesting authors and professor Naqvi's deep knowledge on all related topics. No weaknesses-- it was an awesome course!",
    "I think this course is great if you are really interested in fin-de-siecle Vienna and think through philosophy, art, and writing. However, if you are not specifically interested in this niche topic, I don't recommend it, as the texts are often quite difficult to understand or abstract, and I think the class will only be meaningful if you have a strong interest in the topics explored beforehand.",
    "I liked the interdisciplinary approach. I also liked the balance between canonical and less-studied authors."
   ]

  {
   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "YES definitely. It was well set up for students from different schools and disciplines. Everyone was able to share their own knowledge and opinions which made the course even that much more interesting and engaging.",
    "Again, I would recommend this course if you have a strong passion for Vienna and philosophy, art, architecture, and literature. I don't recommend the course if you are taking it as a random humanities credit and don't have a previous interest in Vienna. It is quite abstract and is only good for that specific type of student. Additionally, though this class is listed as a humanities credit, you do write significantly and often with multiple drafts, so beware of those expectations."
