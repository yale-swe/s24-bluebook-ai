    "As a freshman, I feel like I gained exposure to the classics department and its resources. Moreover, although I feel that my translation skills did not improve drastically, I feel that taking such a course was necessary to learn more about classical scholarship and interpretation -- the course had particular elements valuable to that.",
    "Learned a lot about literary analysis of Latin.",
    "This class greatly enhanced my knowledge of Latin poetry, with particular attention to the interplay of Horace and Catullus. Professor Kraus kept us to a high standard of translation and so I was encouraged to keep my Latin in good shape throughout the semester.",
    "This course was fantastic in helping expand my ability to read & analyze poetry",
    "I learned a lot about the great Roman lyric poets Horace and Catullus and their respective writing styles."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a decent class if you're very into Horace there's certainly more Horace than Catullus, and no Ovid, Propertius, etc. I think the class takes a bit of a sanitized view of the poems, especially the Catullus.",
    "Strengths: 1. The help offered was plentiful and available. 2. Provided a strong first impression of and introduction to the Department. 3. The students and teachers respected each other and engaged in serious and forthright discussion. Weaknesses: 1. 9 A.M. Meeting time (rather self-explanatory) 2. Other than that, I can think of nothing specific.",
    "Could have used more structure to discussions.",
    "This class was very thorough and generally well-run. I honestly don't have too much critical feedback. But a few things could have been improved: WLH 113 was a really unfortunate room for a class that tried to be a seminar; sometimes it would have been nice if we could have had a slightly more detailed syllabus, with more (optional) outside readings and indications about how we might get a firmer grasp of the tradition.",
    "This course was overall fantastic; the amount of reading for each class was just enough to be challenging, and professor Kraus covered the material with an engaging style. As one of the people who wasn't as comfortable speaking up in class, a more structured discussion - even a few discussion questions or reading response questions provided ahead of time would have helped a lot in organizing my thoughts.",
    "I didn't find any weaknesses with this class. It was very engaging and I loved our discussions of the poems."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely recommend this course. The syllabus is well-organized, and Professor Kraus is an excellent teacher.",
    "IMO a bit boring unless you really like Horace and theory. Might have just been the class or the fact that it met at 9am, but the discussion never seemed to flow naturally.",
    "Yes. I chose the course initially because I thought it would provide the best introduction to the classics department and build upon my largest strength, translation. I feel that my translation greatly improved over the course of the class and I learned other skills. The professor was particularly accommodating and, despite the class' relatively large size, it never felt as if one was completely under deluge. Particularly good for freshmen -- I cannot speak to taking the class as an upperclassman.",
    "Reading assignments were light, but we went into great depth on each. Professor Kraus is wonderful -- very knowledgable, and very kind. Would absolutely recommend.",
    "Yes. If you're looking to read Horace and Catullus, this course will go much further than you went in high school Latin.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course and anything taught by Professor Kraus.",
    "Anyone interested in learning more about Latin lyric, should definitely take this class. It will teach you a lot!"
