   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course! It was an excellent course on Indian popular culture, understood through an exploration of the nation's postcolonial history, gender relations, its Diaspora and the idea of Indianness.",
    "An amazing class about so much more than Bollywood. You learn the basic underpinnings of Indian pop culture and learn an incredible amount about the Indian people and culture in general. Professor Chanda is basically who I want to be when I grow up. The movie assignments can get long, but the readings are really interesting and not hard to get through. Class discussions are really illuminating and everyone is encouraged to contribute, and no one ever gets shot down. The best possible learning environment. I can't say enough good things about this class. Also, a very fair workload for a writing credit.",
    "Great class. This was the first time it was being taught so at times, it seemed to lack structure but I am pretty sure that this would not be the case in the years ahead. This class is a LOT more than just watching bollywoood films. Professor Chanda does an excellent job in making this class a fun, learning and an extremely meaningful experience. I loved every one in the class and enjoyed most of our discussions.",
    "This is a class where you will delve into various aspects of Indian pop culture and theoretical readings about both pop culture and other aspects of postcolonial, contemporary India. Professor Chanda is awesome - she is so smart, super helpful, and very accessible. You can also really tell that she cares about her students and values their input. Really fun class, but its definitely not easy! Even though I am Indian, I learned so much more about India through this class. I also learned how to consider and understand culture from an academic perspective.",
    "If you want to understand what drives modern Indian culture, take this class! Worth the work!",
    "Lots of reading, some light, some heavy - but very relevant. The movie choices are very carefully thought out. Each week, ask for advice on what to think about wrt film and reading in preparation for next class.Through this course, look for a better understanding (or a fresh understanding) of what it means for something to be popular culture, how that is different in the South Asian continent, how that travels around the world through the diaspora - what Indianness means to various types of Indians, what unites and divides them, what gender and regional differences have existed and how they have and continue to evolve.",
    "Definitely recommend -- really interesting readings\/movies, great discussion, and a professor who pushes you out of your comfort zone.",
    "Definitely.",
    "By all means! Prof. Chanda is great, both in moderating class discussions and giving help outside of class. Discussions are informal enough that it's fine to give personal opinions (as long as they're backed by evidence) and ask questions. Readings are, for the most part, relevant, and the texts and films are a joy to see. Don't worry if you have no background in Indian culture\/history - the class is very supportive in getting you up to speed in the basics. This was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "This is not exclusively a Bollywood class-- it's about all sorts of Indian pop culture. It's a lot of fun, and I'd highly recommend it."
