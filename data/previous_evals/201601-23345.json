    "This course was an unbelievable experience. The discussions were rich, my mind was pushed, i would definitely recommend this course",
    "This was a great immersion learning experience, and the range of organizations and individuals we were able to talk to was unlike other experiences I have had at FES.",
    "Justin did a phenomenal job leading this class. The field trip was a highlight of my time at FES this semester and having the chance to visit Wyoming put everything we discussed in the classroom into perspective.",
    "This course was an incredible opportunity to consider environmental and social change in a place - through readings, field study, and writing. Much of what we learned could only be accomplished through an in-depth case study, and Justin crafted a cohesive and fascinating schedule of stakeholders with whom we met.",
    "A fantastic field course in the West, which fills a vital gap in the FES curricular offerings. Professor Farrell did an excellent job of framing a Wyoming experience that highlighted the many different, conflicting worldviews that must be understood to make environmental and social progress in the West. The field component was well complemented by reflective papers that helped students reflect upon lessons from the field and coalesce them into a more complete understanding of western issues. This on the ground training is really an essential component for helping to translate other coursework into a usable context on the ground. Would highly recommend to others - a highlight of my time at FES!"

   "comments": [
    "The field trip - but all of the readings and assignments made the class much more engaging",
    "The field trip to Wyoming was very valuable to provide context to my own career interests and also to understanding the intersection of social and environmental issues in the broader perspective.",
    "There was a strong sense of community within the class, and the range of backgrounds of students in the class made conversations really valuable. Also, being able to connect the threads of regional politics (rather than staying in just one location) was unique.",
    "The field trip to Western Wyoming, Prof. Farrell, and the friendships made with other people in the class.",
    "Meetings with a variety of stakeholders, making lasting friendships with my classmates",
    "The field, and the patchwork of stakeholders we met with. Stepping back and looking at all of the folks we met with within one landscape greatly contributes to my growth in understanding diverse stakeholders and perspectives on western environmental issues. It was also great to have a diversity of backgrounds of students participating in the course.",
    "This was a phenomenal course. The field trip was by far one of the most professionally relevant and interesting things I've done while at F&ES, and the pacing of assignments, research, readings etc. supported the overall course structure. The group of students was quite varied, which made for really productive discussions and a great dynamic during the trip. While a case study \/ overview of the region and its issues, the way the course was led allowed each student to pursue their individual interests while still benefiting from the wide variety of interconnected topics, stakeholders, and issues.",
    "The field component of this corse was invaluable. We engaged in participatory learning with the communities of our study. As a student interested in studying and working in the American West, this course provided unparalled exposure to some of the stakeholders in the region, allowing for ongoing dialogue beyond the classroom readings. This was the best course in my FES career.",
    "The field trip was the centerpiece and highlight of the course. I think the small size and careful grouping of students with complementary interests played a big role in the success of the course as well."

    "I would appreciate more concrete deadline for papers etc.",
    "A lot was really crammed into a small amount of time and the field trip was exhausting.",
    "A free \/ rest day during the middle of the field trip, not the beginning, would have helped break up the intensity a bit. Also, having a scheduled class time (even if it didn't meet every week) would help people plan around other courses more effectively.",
    "I think meeting a little more regularly, maybe every other week, before and after the trip might help by providing more space to discuss pre-trip readings and post-trip projects."
