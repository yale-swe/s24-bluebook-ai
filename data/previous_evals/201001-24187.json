    "Most people taking this course are planning to be art majors, so you have to take it, but I would also recommend it for somebody interested in trying out a variety of media.",
    "If you're an Art major, it's not really an option is it?",
    "This is a rigorous art class with some academic backbone. Expect to work a bit harder (as in shorter timespan) in the middle of the course. I heard this is the best instructor to take this course with. I really enjoyed the structure and would definitely recommend the course."
