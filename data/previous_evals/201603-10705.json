   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to make my writing more academic in nature. I also learned about various sorts of academic writing and how much flexibility each allows in format, creative style, etc. I enjoyed that the course focused on a specific topic (my section was called Globally Speaking) because I was able to learn a lot about linguistics and the relationships between cognition, language, and culture.",
    "This course helped improve my writing skills immensely. Improving topic sentences, correcting grammatical errors, and cleaning up introduction and conclusion paragraphs were some of the concepts I developed.",
    "I developed a new perspective on language and community, and learned about a number of particularly interesting points of interaction between the two.",
    "I was able to transition from a high-school level of writing to the writing necessary to do well at Yale.",
    "In this course, I improved my academic writing while learning more about language and the many different aspects to it. Personally, I developed my thesis-writing skills and skills needed to write research papers. I learned how to look for information I need for my paper more efficiently, and I learned how to better incorporate that into my essay so that it makes my thesis stronger. I also learned a lot about how language interacts with culture and identity, and how it can symbolize different things for different communities.",
    "I was able to significantly improve my writing skills and learned the importance of discussion in a classroom setting. I also learned to read more carefully and how to properly structure an argument and how to better support it with textual evidence.",
    "Writing and reading skills, especially writing introductions and conclusions and created elegant and mechanically correct sentences."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength is that it addresses one specific subject area. I felt many of the readings were extraneous and wasted time in class that would have been better used by focusing on how to write each type of paper.",
    "Some of the strengths of this class are how one is constantly developing his or her's writing technique. Writing different kinds of papers whether it be a cultural criticism or research argument is very beneficial. This course could be improved if the timing of the papers did not overlap.",
    "Strengths: very close and personal relationship with instructor, plenty of good feedback, interesting topic Weakness: unequal participation levels of students",
    "The course developed my writing skills very well. The deadlines for the course, however, were quite strenuous.",
    "This course was very discussion-based, and that allowed for a lot of insightful perspectives on the communities and languages we talked about in class. The readings were really interesting and provided a lot of ideas to analyze. The discussions were very involved and I feel that everyone learned something from them.",
    "The course placed a major emphasis on the development of an argument and structuring a paper around a very specific format. It also dealt with very particular themes that we were encouraged to write about. One major strength is the way the course was designed to have 4 papers throughout the semester that were not overly burdening. However, we did have more time to edit our papers than to actually write them and I would prefer if that were the other way around.",
    "Strengths: I loved the workshopping part of English 114-- it was very helpful to be able to get comments from the teacher and peers before handing the paper in for a grade. Weaknesses: Although the course emphasized writing techniques in introductions and conclusions, as well as grammar and syntax, I felt like it could have spent more time talking about body paragraphs and how to structure the core of the paper\/argument Also many of the readings felt irrelevent"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a good baseline for learning to write in the college academic environment, especially for non-STEM majors. As a STEM major, I still think it is worthwhile because I might employ some techniques when writing research down the road, although at times writing these papers can seem pointless from the perspective of one who is scientifically inclined.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. My writing definitely improved from only one semester in this course.",
    "Yes, but only if they are genuinely interested in the topic and like the instructor. If they are just looking to satisfy a writing credit, I would recommend taking a class more directly related to their field of interest in place of ENGL 114\/115\/120.",
    "Yes, if you are not already swamped with other work.",
    "Yes, this course allows you to develop a strong foundation in academic writing while learning about a topic that interests you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because writing is such an essential skill to have and this course served as a perfect introduction to different ways to approach many different strategies. It is also a very useful class to take before diving into higher level english courses since it teaches the basics of argument based writing which will undoubtedly come into play in any other class taken at Yale.",
    "I suppose I would recommend it as long as you go in knowing that it will not be an easy or fun course. The papers were pretty brutal in my opinion, especially the research paper (p3) because it felt like we were just writing for the sake of writing, which obviously we were. (Papers in general just take me a very long time, though.) If you want to improve your writing though this is probably the way to do it. Also grading is very fair."
