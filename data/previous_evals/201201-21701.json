   "comments": [
    "This was a really interesting class. It helped that I came into it with a lot of experience reading primary literature in cognitive science and psychology, because the reading was pretty thick for the most part. All of it was very interesting, and I loved being able to combine ideas from so many different disciplines. I would recommend this course if you are really interested in a more scientific approach to looking at music.Professor Tomlinson is a really cool guy and a great teacher, I recommend taking any of his classes if you have the chance.",
    "This seminar is challenging \u0096 an engaging look at some of the oldest, strangest mysteries of humanity that plunges you into very deep waters very quickly. The literature can be dense and complex, but discussion brings the key points to light. The course is extremely (perhaps too) interdisciplinary, spanning everything from archaeology to cognitive science to linguistics, so that each week you build up a whole new lexicon. It is a course of questions, and questioning the questions, but certainly not of answers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is not a lot of work (just a few readings a week, two short responses, and a final paper) and definitely rewarding in class. The topic is super fascinating and I found it interesting to look at the emergence of music from various subject areas such as archeology, cognitive science, and linguistics. Professor Tomlinson is great--so sweet and very intelligent.",
    "This was a truly fascinating class. It was also a frustrating class. The key thing to realize is that it's a class that asks one basic question--in evolutionary terms, how and why have humans come to have musical capacities?--and comes nowhere close to providing a definitive answer. The class ranges far and wide over the course of evolutionary history and across academic disciplines. The interdisciplinary approach was both unusual and invigorating; so many interesting revelations can come out of examining big humanities questions by means of scientific methods. If you're willing to cast about for a semester in the only-slightly-charted waters of the evolutionary development of complex human behaviors and capacities, willing to do a lot of dense reading, willing to write papers about concepts you're not sure you understand, and (perhaps most importantly) willing to spend most of your time not directly talking or thinking about music, it will be rewarding. If not, it won't be worth the time and effort. Tomlinson is brilliant, at the absolute vanguard of this area of inquiry, and very generous with his time and attention.",
    "This course asks an unanswerable question, and, as a result, can feel like it's taking a student in many different directions at once. Therefore, it was easy for the class discussions to lose their direction and focus. However, all of the different disciplines that were discussed in this course were very fascinating, and the points where they overlapped were definitely exciting. I enjoyed this course quite a lot, even if it could get a bit confusing at times.",
    "This class didn't focus on music all that much, so don't take it if you're hoping for that.",
    "I would take it if you want to dig deep into the issues surrounding music and human evolution and if you don't want to come out with any answers.",
    "This class covers the intersection of archeology, music cognition and evolution. The subject matter can be very interesting, then, for someone who wants to spend part of their semester on each of these topics separately and then combine them. However, the class is a 2 hour seminar based on long, dense readings that you are expected to really understand so that you can come in and discuss them. 2 hours of sporadic discussion that didn't quite come naturally filled in by the professor talking to us got a little tedious. Professor Tomlinson is really great in that he is sociable and understanding and sometimes fun; he is also ridiculously knowledgeable in sooo much. This class struggled, though, and I think he's better in a class where there's more readily discussion. The class still needs some rearranging to become something more dynamic. The other struggle for this class is that everything we are studying is questioned and there are no real answers, which can be frustrating sometimes, to feel like you're going nowhere. It's interesting, but all very speculative. But that should be expected with this topic. You just have to be ready for it. As for workload, it's just sometimes a lot of reading that you really should do to be able to participate and not be awkward, and 2-3 small papers, 1 10-12 research paper."
