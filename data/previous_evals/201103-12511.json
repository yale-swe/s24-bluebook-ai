   "comments": [
    "MUST TAKE! It's one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Regardless of your ethnicity, this class showed how Asians played a large influence in American history, from the formation of America to current political movements. The lectures are incredible and the TAs are just as amazing. But be warned, the workload is overwhelming at times but very worthwhile.",
    "As previously alluded to, I would recommend HIST 183 in an instant regarding the professor and course material, but would offer the following caveat: this class is a ridiculous amount of work and extremely challenging (almost frustratingly so)",
    "The class was fine up until the last week. We had a 10 page paper due and then another one assigned DURING finals that was due in a week. This class has a lot of reading each week, but the material is pretty interesting and Professor Lui is a good lecturer.",
    "This class has a lot of reading. The midterm is pretty fair, but the final is a take-home paper that is ridiculously long (10 pages and 3 primary sources) and there's also a final paper. So much work was geared toward the second-half of the course! But Lui's lectures were outstanding, especially the last 5 minutes where she brings everything to the broad themes of the course. I left every single class knowing how the material presented fit within the the objectives of the class.",
    "An overview of Asian American history that makes you sad but aware.",
    "I think everyone, especially Asian American students, should take this class; it explains so much about how we ended up in the world we're in today. Too often, racial histories of the United States focus on the white-black experience, relegating Asian American stories to merely the Chinese Exclusion Act and Japanese internment. Professor Lui does a good job of placing Asians in the center of American history, part of mainstream racial narratives.This course is particularly important for Asian Americans, in my opinion, because it shows why and how the Asian American community emerged in the modern world. Too often, people resist the categorization of \"Asian American,\" emphasizing the differences between Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other Asian races. Yet this course really emphasizes why all these groups need to work together and how the shared experience of all Asian groups necessitates some common action.",
    "HIST 183 is a very solid (and I believe the only) class to learn about Asian American history in general. The course covers several broad themes of AA history, and lectures go chronologically. The course is pretty tough (paper, midterm, final paper, final take home) so you have to put in a fair deal of work. However, Professor Lui is very knowledgeable in this area of history and her lectures are put together very well. Worth it if you're interested in the topic and if you're willing to put in the work. If you want to learn the material but don't have the time for the readings\/papers, I recommend cr\/d'ng the class.",
    "I highly recommend this class. I'm a senior, and this class was one of the best I've taken at Yale. It's very rewarding, since the class is about stuff you don't really get to learn outside of it. The work load is a bit high, though, since there's an 8 page final paper and a 10 page final take home.",
    "Title of the course is pretty self-explanatory.I took it Credit\/D, so I did not do all the reading toward the end of the course. What reading I did was really interesting though. Lots of writing even if you are not taking it for a writing credit (weekly responses, midterm paper, final paper, and final exam that was basically a paper). The extra work is worth it though.Lui is an excellent lecturer and the class content will really open your eyes to the treatment of Asian Americans throughout history.",
    "Asian American History is an incredible history class - perhaps the best taught one I've taken at Yale. Professor Lui blends primary sources, personal accounts, and modern media into a compelling narrative that absolutely enlightened the manner in which I look at U.S. history overall. She presented that narrative in a very accessible manner, with streamlined powerpoints full of pictures and key term sheets. The readings were sometimes substantial, but almost always very interesting. We had two papers, an in-class midterm and a take-home final, all of which required careful thought. However, being able to practice weaving the information she has shared into a narrative on one's own is a fantastic exercise in what I imagine it must be like being a historian. Take this class.",
    "not an easy course, but provides great new perspective"
