    "I became much more familiar with the book of Kings, and particularly with the prophetic stories therein. I also further developed my skills in close reading and exegesis, and became more proficient in writing the sorts of papers that are expected in the field of biblical studies.",
    "I learned about the traditio-historical issues within the Books of Kings and trends in scholarship on various topics.",
    "I learned a lot about the books of 1 and 2 Kings and the intricacies of its development.",
    "I learned a great deal about the general scholarship behind to book of Kings, and especially about the role and placement of the prophetic stories within the greater context of the book. I enjoy taking classes like this one, where looking at the details of the text and reading closely are encouraged and explored. This process of close reading and careful discussion encouraged me to think about connections across the text."

   "comments": [
    "For the most part, this was an excellent course and a very effective seminar. If there is any room for improvement, it would have to be in the level of student engagement with reading and discussion; questions posed in class were often met with blank stares and silence, which significantly slowed the pace of the course and our progress through the text. I am not entirely sure what could be done to rectify this issue, but it may have helped if expectations for discussion were more explicitly stated, either in the syllabus or perhaps at the end of each class in preparation for the next. Although certain guiding themes and topics were covered in the first couple lectures, it was easy to lose track of these as we progressed through the assigned readings for each week.",
    "Great class, no weaknesses. Professor is extremely knowledgeable.",
    "The strength of the course was the close detail and attention given to the text. Unfortunately, this also lead to the class going a bit slower and not making it all the way through the assigned text."

    "I would recommend this course to any student proficient in Biblical Hebrew who has a strong interest in the Hebrew Bible, the history of Israel, or Israelite prophecy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The seminar is very useful as an introduction to scholarship on and literary and historical problems within the books of Kings, with a special focus on the prophetical stories.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in textual history and in-deptyh analyses."
