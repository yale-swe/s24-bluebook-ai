She also sometimes replies to e-mails and\/or the Piazza course site -- and these replies can be helpful, too, although I recommend in-person, which is worth the effort. Jill is enthusiastic and supportive."

    "While Professor Tomlin was very accessible, I found that we were required to do many assignments with little feedback.

I did not get anything more out of the course than from the course materials, which were well composed.",

The materials are well-organized, the ungraded homework assignments are great, and the sample codes are very useful.",

   "comments": [
    "I really didn't get much out of the lectures. I think it would be helpful to make them a bit more interactive.",
    "This course would be well-served in lab environment. I don't believe that this material is best taught through lecture. Additionally, the instructor could have done a better job of introducing students to the basics of coding, as no prior knowledge was stated as a necessary prerequisite.",
    "- I feel both ArcGIS and Google Earth Engine covered in this class are oriented for students who have an interest in land use type of subject, not so much for those interested in social science subjects - Language used to explain codes in the handouts is hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. I was not able to understand much from the explanation unless I run the codes.",
    "Sometimes the freedom of the homework assignments was daunting. It takes almost as long to come up with a homework idea as it does to actually carry out that idea.",
    "Might be useful to conduct the course in a computer lab so everyone can follow along",
    "-The classroom culture of this course was one in which students neglected to speak up and ask questions due to the fear of being judged by the professor and\/or other students. Collaboration among students was minimal. For next year, I strongly encourage the professor to have students introduce themselves to each-other and the professor at the beginning of this course - this is simple but it makes a huge difference. It would also be helpful to divide students into small groups that are required to meet weekly to go over the codes together. -For most of the semester, this class met for three hours straight with one ten-minute break. I recommend that more breaks be offered and that the lecture be shortened (max 2 hours) to allow students to absorb the material. Small group work in class would also help to keep the students alert and engaged. -This course was billed as an introductory geospatial programming class, but basic concepts of coding were not explained. This led to much confusion at the beginning of the semester for students. I suggest that the professor refer students to specific resources\/ chapters in a textbook that align with each lecture so that students who do not have a background in coding can better prepare for class.",
    "Clearer expectations and instructions for assignments, feedback on weekly assignments.",
    "*The grading scheme (ranking the whole class) is alarming and not very helpful. A regular grade and a few comments would help me better understand the quality of my work. *Due dates and a rubric or description for the 2 final assignments should be available online. I wasn't able to find anything like this. *The class is a little too long, so I appreciated that Dr. Tomlin often ended early. *In the Python section, I felt like we spent too much time on the subjects in the first few weeks and not enough time on practical applications. Realistically, it is hard to see myself writing a full algorithm from scratch, and it would have been useful to see more examples of how to use Python to implement, combine, and modify existing tools and algorithms.",
    "The Earth Engine handouts are weak in that they don't really explain much. Their internal linking is good."
