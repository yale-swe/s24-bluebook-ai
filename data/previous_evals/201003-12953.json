   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class. Not too much work, kind of easy, and provides a good base for philosophy.",
    "Don't take it with Darwall. He is a bad lecturer, and you'll be lost. This is a class you could survive through sparknotes, which is a shame. It really turned me off of philosophy.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student if a different professor taught it. As it is, I found it boring, and there are tons of other Yale classes I would have taken instead. The papers are good though; they get you to really learn and focus in on a certain subject.",
    "I would not recommend Intro to ethics to anyone who's not genuinely interested in the course and was relatively strong with writing.",
    "Unless you really loved your DS reading, have a knack for philosophy (as some do), or have sworn to yourself that you would do EP&E, don't take this course. It's just meh.",
    "Don't take this class unless you really like philosophy. Also, you may realize it is bs halfway through. I did.Sincerely,Draco Wong.OOOHHH YEAAAHHH",
    "After a full term, ethics got pretty old. I like philosophy, but I learned that ethics doesn't particularly interest me. It's a good class if you're really into ethics or want an introduction to some important philosophers, but not good if you just want to dabble in philosophy.",
    "Dunno if Darwall will teach it again in the future, so I might look at Kagan's reviews. That being said, the course was solid and I would recommend it.",
    "It's an interesting course, but at the same time, a lot of the ideas of the different philosophers covered all come to the same thing. But overall, it's not a ton of work, and was very interesting.",
    "Great introduction to ethics. Would seriously recommend if it interests you. Darwall seems to be a much better grader than Kagan, and has a really interesting metaethical background I found really informative.",
    "Important survey course of ethical thought that will serve you well in many other disciplines. Do the reading, buy the professor's commentary book, and you'll come out a better thinker for taking the class.",
    "This course goes over the main theories about ethics and morality. There is a lot of focus on the readings, and not so much focus on everyday life ethical dilemmas. I particularly enjoyed the structure of thecourse: starting with Mill, and then going over Kant, Nietzsche, and Aristotle. Professor Darwall's lectures were a little dry, but his book clarified most of the questions that came up in the course of the semester. If you want to learn about the philosophical grounds of ethical behavior, you should take \"Introduction to Ethics.\"",
    "It's not \"how to be a good, ethical person.\" Like most classes, it's helpful for learning about what really smart people have thought and then trying to figure out what you think about some topic, in this case ethics. i would recommend it to another student, because I think the ideas are important for everyone to know.",
    "Yes. It's a fun, low-stress introduction to the big names in ethical thought.",
    "I took this class at the last minute because I thought ethics might be interesting. The readings were a little inaccessible because I had never taken a philosophy class before. However, all the information you could possibly need to know is contained in Darwall's book Philosophical Ethics. This should not be recommended reading. It is extremely interesting and helpful and necessary. This is a woeful sort of thing to find out during reading week. Do yourself a favor and read it first; if you're sort on time, you would do better by skipping reading of the actual essays.",
    "Take the class, but don't expect it to answer any questions. Philosophy of Religion does a better job of recognizing that it is a class that would have been taught in the university a hundred years ago, tackling the big questions of life. The ethics course seems to lack that consciousness and therefore makes itself irrelevant, which is unfortunate. It is a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend it. It's an interesting subject to delve into a little bit.",
    "You need it for an EP&E major. Got to get it done with.",
    "I would recommend it. The class was hard but the material was interesting. There were many outlets to understanding the readings when they were convoluted and section was also very helpful.",
    "This class is a broad survey of ethical philosophers; we read Mill, Kant, Nietzsche, Aristotle, and some metaethical philosophers. Lecture wasn't thrilling, and it actually made me more confused sometimes- Professor Darwall's very smart and pretty funny, but I had trouble following him on some days.I do have to say, though, that my section for this class was one of my favorite parts of the week-- while reading the philosophers themselves might not be the most thrilling, talking about ethics in real life is, I think, extremely important.Overall, I'm glad I took the class- it wasn't amazing, but I don't think I could have made myself sit down and read that much philosophy otherwise. It's not at all that I feel like I *should* read those philosophers-- I think it's important (and interesting) to be able to talk about ethics and to consider different theories. I've definitely used what I've learned in this class in conversations with my friends. So....take the class for the subject, not for the lectures. Sitting through lecture may not be the most fun--but it suddenly becomes GREAT fun when you know this stuff and can talk about it with other people!",
    "It is a fairly easy but thorough introductory course which is really not too hard if you are interested in the material and enjoy the subject matter (this does not mean you have to read every page of every reading). The lecture and homework schedule (readings and two papers and one exam) was very flexible and easy to fit in amongst a busy science-heavy schedule.",
    "Take it! Even if it is not with the notable Shelly Kagin, it is a good course and gets you thinking! Put the time and effort into the essays if you want to get top marks. Otherwise, last minute papers can earn you between A B and B+.",
    "I would recommend Intro to Ethics, although if you're willing to do two semesters of philosophy, I think the two semester Intro to Ancient Philosophy\/Intro to Modern Philosophy sequence might be more interesting because it might give more historical context and a better understanding of the evolution of ideas.Be prepared for lots of dense reading!",
    "You read different philosophers which is really cool. Take the course if you want to learn about moral\/ethical theories, but over all not a great course.",
    "Good intro course to take if you've never taken an ethics class before. Darwall is great and he picks great TFs. It's a normal to less amount of work, and you get to consider really interesting questions about ethics.",
    "I took this class thinking that it would be a good introduction to philosophy because I had never studied philosophy before. Unfortunately, it seemed that there were a lot of upperclassmen in the class fulfilling their EP&E requirements.This was frustrating because I was just starting to understand how to read these difficult and challenging texts, while they had already read them and other books of the authors. This was especially frustrating during section.In addition, the lectures were not very helpful, but Stephen Darwall's book was very helpful, especially for the final exam.Overall, I enjoyed the material, but I did not enjoy the class.",
    "If you really love philosophy, read the texts on your own, and make sure to buy Darwall's book if you'd like the same experience. Course is good if you need to take it - very good in fact. But I can see myself learning the material on my own time.",
    "This is an introduction to the key areas of thoughts in ethics. An actual understanding of the course material will require you to invest time in reading not only the material but also supplementary explanations of the material. The readings were all very enjoyable, and lecture was also helpful. I recommend this course wholeheartedly, regardless of your interest in philosophy. After the semester is over, you will be proud of all you have learned and perhaps even desire to explore certain philosophers further.",
    "I doubt that I learnt much from the actual lectures. A lot of it was just self-study and then seeing my TA for additional help. The books are worth reading.",
    "Take it. Read closely, though, because the exciting parts of the course are subtle. It can be laborious at times, but the workload isn't overwhelming. Darwall's a great lecturer. A good intro class to take -- gets your mind going.",
    "Intro to Ethics gave me a concrete understanding about material such as metaethics and normative ethics and other things such as the open question argument. Many of the things taught in the course were contradictory, but I feel that I learned more about how to define my own ethical philosophy. I recommend this course if you have little understanding about ethical theories and philosophy. I really enjoyed it!",
    "it's a good intro class",
    "Mill, Kant, Nietzsche, Aristotle---what more could you ask for? This course is an interesting, rigorous introduction to the historical \u0093giants\u0094 of Western ethics. The readings are challenging, but Professor Darwall\u0092s lectures are very clear and helpful. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a thorough background in philosophical ethics. (Do be aware that the course isn\u0092t centrally focused on helping you personally answer the question, \u0093How should I live?\u0094 However, you\u0092ll surely get some insights by carefully reading the primary source texts.)",
    "this class is mill, kant, nietzsche and aristotle, with some randos thrown in like rawls and some dude named harman. ethics are always fun but if you've taken any kind of DS or philosophy class, it's boring as shit. i presume it'd be great for someone with no exposure to philosophy but if you've done DS DO NOT BOTHER.",
    "Good class. I took it as a pre-req for EP&E, but regardless, Darwall is a good professor. choosing the right TA is pretty important.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class - lecture and discussions are fun, workload is reasonable, and the material is fascinating.",
    "A great class to take if you are already interested in ethics. If not, look for a class that caters to your interests more.",
    "It is a survey course of the the basics of philosophy and ethics. It covered Aristotle,Kant, Mill, and a little Nietzsche. I would recommend it for most students to at least check out to get a sense of these basic ethical dilemmas, though I know it's a rec for Philosophy and EPE students.",
    "A solid, somewhat writing-intensive course in Western ethical thought.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in the material (esp someone who has not studied the materials previously).",
    "Yes if you're interested in the topic. It wasn't easy, but very doable.",
    "A nice intro to philosophical ethics and ethical thought.Will get your brain moving. It sounds like the standard advice, but if you fall behind on the readings, it'll be hard to keep up with some concepts that will seem like needlessly small distinctions, but actually do make sense. Good class.",
    "Take it if you like philosophy or think you might like philosophy. Not my favorite class ever but bearable.Read his \"optional\" book. It helps you make sense of the lectures and the readings.",
    "I would recommend this class. Darwall's lectures are always very clear and he is great at breaking down the important points (even if he is a bit repetitive.) You cover a lot of material and I feel like I got a good overview of philosophy. I also don't believe he is as hard of a grader as Kagan.",
    "Interesting, not too much work, and though-provoking.",
    "You learn material that is always handy to know. Hard work is necessary but does not always pay off. Go to lecture, don't take it if you're not interested."
