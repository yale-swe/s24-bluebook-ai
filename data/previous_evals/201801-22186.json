   "comments": [
    "I learned how to enter an archive and the steps to take once I arrive at an object. I truly learned how to do book history work and found a new passion in my scholarship.",
    "This course gave me an enormous range of tools with which to approach literature in a new and extremely refreshing way. It provided me with the ability to engage with a text on an incredibly different level than that which I am accustomed to: as a material object rather than just a collection of ideas. It showed me that the physical experiences of a text can, at times, serve to formulate it just as much as its intellectual experiences that what a text has undergone at the hands of its printers, readers, and librarians can serve to impact it just as much as its writer. It also motivated me to spend more time with the books and manuscripts and papers at the Beinecke, and really opened my eyes to the opportunities and insights primary research can offer. This course also very much developed my knowledge of the Renaissance, and in doing so reinvigorated my interest in the works of the period. Although I had worked with Renaissance texts before, Professor Stallybrass's course really allowed me to see that they can continue to be fresh, interesting, and relevant in our current times.",
    "New perspectives on Christian materialism, the history of printing and the book, paratextual investigation, transcription of manuscripts, questioning authorship, considering multiple temporalities present in published works, and many practical lessons in navigating rare book collections\/archives."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Peter Stallybrass was an incredible teacher and guide through the objects at the Beinecke and for teaching the tools of research. \"Weaknesses\" of the course: I would not really say there are any weaknesses but I think it would have been helpful to look more intently as a group at the objects that were pulled out for us to look at in class. We often, simply, did not have enough time.",
    "This course's emphasis on the materiality of literary objects, and the fact that it encouraged us to pursue our own individual interests regarding the holdings of the Beinecke while still giving us the guidance needed to delve into the library's enormous and intimidating collection, were some of its particular strengths. I also really enjoyed the rare books and manuscripts that Professor Stallybrass, Maria, and Kathryn brought up for us to look at every seminar, and I think that the seminars really benefitted from being held in the Beinecke, surrounded by the material texts that we were working on. I especially loved the inclusion of photographs in Professor Stallybrass's powerpoints (the powerpoints on manicules and father\/son iconography particularly come to mind) , as I think they embodied the spirit of the class's aims: to make us more aware of the tangible realities of texts, and to renew or enjoyment in literature. I also loved it whenever we were given the opportunity to interact with physical documents in an even more hands-on way, as during our seminar on letters (which was wonderful). I was so surprised when, looking through the manuscripts and books that were set on the tables before every class, I suddenly came upon a first folio and second quarto - it is this immediacy and accessibility, both of texts and of learning, that I think really sets this course apart and above.",
    "I can't speak highly enough of this class. The only real minor fault was that we usually got too wrapped up in discussions and lectures to thoroughly examine the incredible materials that sat right in front of us in class, which generally differed from the materials we had examined on our own time before class."

    "I would recommend this course to all students interested in how to engage an archive in the most effective way possible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as I think it is very rare that students of literature are given the opportunity to 1. conduct primary research 2. interact with manuscripts so closely and immediately. Professor Stallybrass is also a joy to work with.",
    "Yes, absolutely."
