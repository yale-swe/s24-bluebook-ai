    "Take English 114 06 if you want to improve your writing ability and meet some fellow freshmen (or upperclassmen!). The small class size makes it easy to get to know your peers and the material is fun to discuss. Professor Groves allows each student a lot of freedom to develop their own writing style and voice. This class is very helpful if you are struggling with essays for other classes!",
    "I would recommend the class only if the student were very interested in extinction. I feel like the class was largely limited by its title.",
    "If you are an international student who is not confident with your writing like me, you should definitely take English 114. You can improve your writing A LOT through this course. Also this course is not all about how to write an essay. You are going to read a lot of interesting stuff and if you really pay attention to class you are going to learn more than essay writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to someone who wants to better his\/her writing.",
    "English 114 is a really great course for freshman year, I'd almost go as far as to say it's essential. It really gives you some insight on what kind of writing you will be expected to produce over the next four years while keeping you interested with a cool topic. English 114 06 was focused on Extinction and I would definitely recommend it to another student. The topics of extinction range from human extinction to animals and then to life after extinction. Groves is a really great professor and in the small setting, you'll make some great friends in that class.",
    "I would recommend because it helps students transition from high school writing to college research writing. It is very effective in laying the foundations of writing well at yale",
    "I would recommend this class to almost any student, unless he already has a very solid background in writing. Even then, it is a great refresher course that summarizes the basic elements of good research-based writing.",
    "All things considered, I'm glad I took a 114 class. I wish that I didn't take this section though. This course dealt with extinction and how it is viewed and portrayed in literature and media today. The readings were quite dense and I felt like we didn't really discuss them in class. I don't think my writing improved because of what was presented in this course, it simply improved because of the volume of writing I was doing. Class time wasn't used as effectively as it could have been; I could have done the reading and essays on my own and just gone to office hours like I did and I would have taken away as much as I did from this course without even attending class."
