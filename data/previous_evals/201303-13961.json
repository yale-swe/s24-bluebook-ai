   "comments": [
    "The class is very interesting and provides invaluable insight to policing. Assignments are actually fun (ride along in a police car and write a one page reflection on your experience) and there are few of them.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested at all in the world of policing. Chief Esserman requires his students to go on a ride along and attend the New Haven Police Department's CompStat meeting at least once. The workload is fairly light. The readings are manageable, and the essays are not too difficult. This is an easy seminar for someone who has a definite interest in the topic.",
    "Take it. Not too much work and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes! It is a good class if you want to get an inside look at a local police department.",
    "A thorough introduction to the world of policing and unlike any other class I've taken at Yale. Get a flavor for it during shopping period and if you like it stick with it. A tremendous class if you put the work in and find the subject interesting.",
    "This is a really great opportunity to really learn from the best. Esserman has brought community policing successfully to new haven twice, and is one of the most respected police chiefs in the country. This isn't an incredibly academically rigorous class but everything that you learn will stick with you. This is really a class where you learn not just theory but how to apply it and how the best has applied it.",
    "Only take this class if you're looking forward to a very HUMAN study of policing. It will not be especially academic, though there will be weekly readings and a few essays. Most of the time, you're simply hearing from people: hearing their stories, perspectives, aspirations, etc. You'll experience: Chief Esserman required each student to visit one of the weekly NHPD command meetings, as well as go on a ride-along in a patrol car for a night's shift. The class is very unique: do not miss it if you have the chance! Of the 25 people who came on the first day of shopping, I think 21 stayed, and he let everyone in. You'll learn a lot about police theory and practice (not a common topic), as well as local news and politics. Chief Esserman will, by example, also end up inadvertently teaching you a lot about leadership. Definitely take it.",
    "I'd recommend this class, but it is a mixed bag, with Esserman being infinitely interesting and amazing individual who will provide you great access to any part of the police force, but the syllabus being weak and perfunctory. I would take it just for Esserman, who has clearly thought a lot about policing, management, and government in general, and has many great anecdotes. It also bursts the Yale bubble in an astounding way when you go on the ride-along and meet the officers, and if you're willing to, Esserman will put you in touch with police academy leaders, corrections officers. It's unprecedented access, but the other students were clearly not doing the readings, and the class discussion itself is faltering.",
    "I would hands down recommend this course to anyone who is curious about policing or thinks that they have an opinion about policing because it definitely causes you to challenge your assumptions.",
    "Take it. Unique and important perspective on policing. It's low stress, though grading is a mystery.",
    "Take this class! Chief Esserman was an awesome lecturer. The material was interesting and he brought in a lot of different guest lecturers. A great seminar overall!",
    "A very unconventional class, which I don't think will be offered any more in the future. Chief Esserman is the full-time police chief of New Haven, and he takes a few hours out of each week to teach this seminar. It's an amazing way to get an inside look at how police departments operate, because Chief Esserman has had a long career and has seen pretty much everything there is to see in the world of police. He knows the police chiefs of almost every major city in America. The class is not particularly structured; there are readings and a few papers, but mostly the class is like a weekly Master's Tea with the Chief and interesting speakers that he brings in, including FBI agents and retired homicide detectives.",
    "Take it! The class has the best professor you can ask for in this topic: New Haven Police Chief Dean Esserman. It teaches you the essential trends in policing, but what is far more interesting is the insight into the day-to-day operations of the New Haven Police. The classes are a bit slow, but always interesting. __________ FORMAT: The class itself involves Chief Esserman asking us to go around the room and share our experiences or thoughts at the start of class. The Chief then usually introduces guests (ranging from detectives to district managers to assistant chiefs), who share their experiences and thoughts on policing. Students then ask the guests questions. In addition to going to class, students are required to go on a 4-hour ride-along with a police officer and attend a 2-hour weekly Comparative Statistics (COMPSTAT) meeting, both of which are really interesting. __________ PROFESSOR: Professor (Chief) Esserman is what makes this class great. He is an extremely nice and principled chief. He frankly answers all of the students' questions, from those about a murder last weekend to those about the time the New Haven Police raided a Yale party at a nightclub. He completely understands the police's organization, the different theories of policing, the individual motivations of police, the day-to-day operations of police, and the relations between police agencies, other agencies, politicians, and the city. Above all, he shares his insight into leadership, which mostly involves setting a good example and institutionalizing great behaviour. He's willing to provide us access to everything if we ask for it. __________ CONTENT: We cover all of the following and more: (a) the development of community policing and strategic policing; (b) patrol vs. beat policing; (c) police-union relations; (d) day-to-day policing and how cases tend to be solved; (e) promotions, academies, and how advancement works; (f) district politics; (g) police corruption and internal investigations; (h) how different departments differ; (i) relationships between management and lower-level police; (j) hot-spot and hot-people policing. __________ WORK: The workload is very light - there are theoretical readings, but they're not assigned very specifically, and while I did read the handouts, I never read the books thoroughly. There 2 long papers (5 pages each) and 2 short reflections (2 pages each) on your Ride-Along and CompStat. Since teaching is not his priority, do not expect to get these back quickly. __________ SUMMARY: A once-in-a-lifetime chance to get to know the police intimately on friendly terms. These are the kinds of classes I come to Yale for. The classes may be a little dry, butthey are so incredibly interesting! Don't miss this.",
    "Overview of issues in modern policing, a lot of talk about current events. Chief Esserman makes great resources available so you get out of the class and discussion what you put in. Good class if you're at all interested in the subject."
