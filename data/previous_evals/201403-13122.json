   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this with Shirkhani - so worth it. Hard but really great!",
    "Everyone raves about this class, and it is not overrated. The readings are interesting and fun to read, and the writing assignments are fun and easy to tailor to your specific interests. Professor Shirkhani is great at leading class discussions and very good about making herself available outside of class time. If you need a writing credit, this is the best possible way to do it; if you don't need a writing credit, you should take this class anyway.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Take Shirkhani's section! She is kind but will push you to write a lot better than you thought you ever would. This course helped me to better understand all aspects of society better too, as our readings were astute cultural criticisms and talked about other events. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for that liberal arts education at Yale.",
    "Lots of time will go into each essay and all the readings, but it will be because you sincerely want to put your all into every assignment, not because you feel like you have to.",
    "English 120 is a fine class. I think it's a good introduction to writing in a college setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I would call it high intensity personal essay writing for someone who likes english writing, who possesses some kind of ability, and wants to improve.",
    "Yes! Take it! The assignments are interesting and the essays are a fun challenge. Don't be afraid to fail though.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in English.",
    "English 120 is an amazing course in which you will learn to not only write but also to look at the world and the issues around you in an analytical way. I would recommend this course if you wish to expand your thinking and improve your writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! For ANYONE who wants to improve their personal\/non-fiction writing, this course is a great stepping stone. I feel like I have a lot more confidence and self-awareness as a writer, and can now look at really good essays and personal non-fiction writing and actually explain what the author is doing well. Everyone should be able to communicate eloquently in writing, no matter your field (I'm a STEM major), so I'd recommend this course to everyone! Also, took it with Professor Shirkhani and she's awesome! Take it with her!"
