   "comments": [
    "I would summarize the course as a course talking about the intellectual foundation and methodology for ethnographic writing and representation. It's definitely not a research methods course but it provides a great survey of the different ways ethnographic projects are created, implemented, and represented. It also very importantly considers some of the ethics of ethnographic projects like authorial voice, issues of ethical representations, the stakes of one's project, and the kinds of interactions that are occurring in the field between the ethnographer and their interlocutors. I would totally recommend this course to any student interested in ethnographic work and also to any student who is interested in issues of representing and portraying other people in their scholarly work. I recommend it because Kate is a great instructor, I read some really life-changing books, and learned in a way that changed my perspective on my own projects for the better.",
    "The course forces students to think about the politics of writing and knowledge production, it demands that students think through the questions of representation that are not talked about often enough. I would certainly recommend this course to fellow students. I actually think it should be required for all anthropology students - including those in subfields other than sociocultural.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, to anyone.",
    "Essential for anyone in the humanities -great texts, great class, wont think you've wasted your time at all. Transcends narrowly disciplinary interests to address broader questions of what it means to be human, without sinking into fuzziness, theoretically very sound, yet in general very liberatong",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any graduate student interested in writing and representation in Ethnography or American Studies. I was hesitant to take the course because I have little prior ethnographic experience, but the course readings and seminar discussions provided an introduction to the field while also offering different ways of transforming raw research and interview transcripts into a polished article or manuscript. In addition to be readings being diverse stylistically and thematically, they are also international in scope, and would be useful to any student thinking about transnational research or a hemispheric United States.",
    "An excellent combination of american studies and cultural anthropology students provided a unique opportunity for cross disciplinary conversations. I would definitely recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline by providing an intellectual framework for considering the ethics, practices, and representational work of my own projects and the kind of conversations I want to be involved in through my research. It provided as safe and generative space for me to consider my personal, political, and ethical stakes in my own research and showed me the conversations that occurring on an interdisciplinary level about the kinds of questions I want to ask. I would say that some of the texts we read will directly contribute to my dissertation research as relevant work in the field. However, most importantly I believe this course helped me grow intellectually in ways that will position me to think in more nuanced, self-aware, and ethical ways when approaching my own project. To me that is invaluable.",
    "I learned a great deal from this course. The course has definitely helped to deepen my knowledge of ethnography as a genera and the discipline of Anthropology generally. This course also forces students to approach ethnographic writing and craft with seriousness and care.",
    "Given its focus on issues of writing and representation, this course is the kind of course which inspires thinking that will play a meaningful role in all future projects.",
    "Yes, most definitely - I have learnt about the trajectories of anthropology, what guides and limits any kind of representation, about what it means to do a decent job, lead a decent life, academically stimulating, not prescriptive.",
    "In addition to improving my writing with weekly blog posts, this course gave me a sense of the major theoretical questions in the field of ethnography. Though I do not yet have a dissertation project, seminar discussions helped me to consider my own theoretical questions and improved my way of representing them clearly in my writing.",
    "American Studies has had an interesting relationship with Cultural Anthropology. I was able to write experimentally for my research, which gave me creative control. This greatly facilitated the beginnings of my writing on my dissertation."
