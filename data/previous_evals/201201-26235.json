   "comments": [
    "If you're an anthro major, this class will be good for you to practice the kinds of methods you'll need to use in the field. It's not too difficult--- there are a lot of assignments, but they don't get graded till the end.Class itself is pretty useless. Most of the classes were just people presenting their stuff. Every time it's three different people. So it was quite boring and not that enriching. Prof Clarke is pretty distant and doesn't give you a whole lot of feedback verbally, though her comments on your work are sometimes helpful.",
    "It's a project based course where you get practice doing each of the ethnography techniques. The seminar format of the class was also helpful because it was small enough that everyone can offer feedback to everyone else's presentation during class.",
    "yes, if you need a methods class",
    "This is a straightforward introduction to ethnographic techniques. If you want to do ethnographic research, it is somewhat helpful. But to be honest, you could probably glean most of the information by doing the readings and practicing some of the techniques on your own. It isn't so much work, so that's not a big deal, but class could be tedious because there wasn't much material to go over per se. Still, if you're interested in doing ethnographic work, I'd recommend the class.",
    "In this class, you learn different methods of collecting and analyzing data from the people around you. The assignments are fun to do, and are very helpful in terms of the tips you get from the professor and the class when presenting your findings.",
    "Yes. It's fairly low-key, and you have the chance to design your own projects around whatever you're interested in. You really need to set your own deadlines and make sure you stay on top of it. Meets once a week with occasional breaks to work on the projects. Potentially can do some AMAZING work under this class!!",
    "The class is a great introduction to anthropological research methods. I took it as a methods requirement for the sociology major and it was very interesting to approach ethnographic research from an anthropological view. Kamari Clarke is an excellent prof and was very helpful especially in the ethical issues of ethnographic research. Everyone in class is pretty laidback too so there's no pressure but it's pretty easy to participate and offer opinions. The outside research exercises are pretty fun too though they can take a bit of time.",
    "This is a very chill course, despite the somewhat intimidating presence of Professor Clarke. The four assignments each throw you into a different anthropological method, and are really useful and also very generously graded. Class discussions can be very awkward, as Professor Clarke is not a very good facilitator of discussion."
