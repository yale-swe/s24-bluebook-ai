   "comments": [
    "topic is tough to beat; very pertinent for any public health student",
    "The MTBE debate was fun and a great learning tool. I'm glad that the class was small, since it was more conducive to discussion than a large class size.",
    "maybe a standard textbook instead of only lecture ppt",
    "boring",
    "This course has no focus. The professor gave little direction for assignments and tests.",
    "There was a good amount of confusion\/miscommunication regarding what was expected, when tests were going to be, what was going to be covered...It would help to have a syllabus.",
    "I think that course should not be called risk assessment, this course could be called toxicology 2. The course focuses too much on reading risk assessment and regurgitation rather than on teaching us how to perform a risk assessment. I also think that beyond the issues in the focus of this course, that it is also poorly structured.",
    "Practical and helpful, insightful",
    "One of the major strengths is that at the end of the semester I felt comfortable with the course content and was able to read a risk assessment and understand it. However I do think the couse can be improved by having the students read portions of risk assessments throughout the semester rather than only at the end. I think this may help to tie the pieces together. The reason I make this suggestionis because at times the course lectures seemed disconnected from one another and did not flow smoothly (possibly because of lack of examples). Also I believe the course could benefit from having both instructors lecture more evenly. At the beginning of the semester I was under the impression that the two instructors were going to distribute the lectures more evenly. I was a little bit disappointed that this was not the case. Unfortunately the class only met once a week and I think it might have been better to meet twice a week for a shorter amount of time.",
    "Strengths: There was a lot of information to learn but using case studies helped us to understand it better.Weaknesses: Too much of the work\/grade were weighted towards the end of the course. A midterm would help us better get an understanding on what to expect.",
    "Strengths: I think that for how difficult of the topic Risk Assessment would be to teach, I was impressed at the clarity and flow of the material. I found the course interesting and enjoyed learning a new way of thinking.Weaknesses: It was difficult to know how we were doing in the course at any given time and I didn't like that so much of our grade was determined by the last week of the course. It was difficult to know what we were supposed to get out of the course.",
    "The lectures and discussions\/debates were helpful in providing a basic understanding of how risk assessments are done and the evaluation of animal and epidemiologic studies used in risk assessments. But perhaps the discussions (benzene, asbestos) could have been done parallel to the lectures rather than at the end of the course for a better understanding of the material at an earlier stage.\u00c2\u00a0The MTBE debate was very useful in understanding the material, but as it was scheduled during finals period and the preparation for the debate takes up quite a lot of time, preparation was at the cost of preparation for finals of other classes. (in part because the other risk assessments were covered right before finals and it made sense to start preparation for the MTBE debate after the other risk assessments had been covered)"

    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0she only taught one class. though that one class was very well organized. I appreciated her going over the key points of the lecture as well as materials to focus on for tests, which are helpful when there are a lot of material to cover and memorize",

    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Mrs.Fields is very kind and responsible",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0As stated previously I believed that both instructors were going to lead the class but this was not the case. I would have liked for Cheryl to have led more lectures and\/or discussions as she was extremely clear and provided examples to help aid in her lecture\/discussion. It is difficult to assess how her teaching may be improved as she did not lead enough lectures or discussions for me to provide constructive criticisms.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Dr. Borak and Ms. Fields were both great instructors who wanted you to understand and succeed in their class.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0Cheryl did a good job with the Precautionary Principle lecture, however, it was difficult to understand or see her role in the course beyond that one lecture.",
    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0very interesting lecturer! incredible amounts of knowledge of history of risk assessment and plenty of good examples of different concepts we covered in class. class discussions were a pleasure.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0ok",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Readily available, presented interesting tidbits to give examples for concepts.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is an entertaining instructor, he is brilliant but also intimidating and at times insulting. He cares that we learn the material and is willing to help us do so.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr.Borak is extreamely insightful, kind and helpful",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak's instructor of such as a complex topic was really great. Each of his lectures were different and never presented a redundant amount of information on a single topic. Another strength is that he never assumed that the students knew about the biological interactions or processes and took the time to explained it. While I always enjoyed the course due to his instructor I believe that the course could have benefited from more interactive classes with student participation. He lead two or three of these discussion type classes at the end of the semester but I would have liked for this to have occurred earlier on.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak and Ms. Fields were both great instructors who wanted you to understand and succeed in their class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak clearly knew the course material inside and out which is always a nice qualityfor a professor to have. He was interesting to listen to and I really liked that he valued student input in discussions and was willing to answer questions during class in detail. He did a good job explaining things during lectures, but his expectations were not always clear in terms of what we were expected to get out of the course or how to prepare for the presentation, debate, and final.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Clear lectures and very useful discussion sections.\u00c2\u00a0I would have appreciated hearing feedback\/grades on assignments such as the risk characterization assignment. This would have helped to prepare for the MTBE debate and final.\u00c2"

    "This course needs to be re-evaluated. I would suggest that students interested in learning risk assessment take the environmental risk assessment course offered through FES. In the FES counterpart taught by Yehia Khalil, a student learns practical skills, how to model, evaluate and perform a risk assessment, in comparison YSPH's risk assessment focuses on toxicology (shares 70% of slides with the toxicology course) and on regurgitation. If a student wants to be able to write a risk assessment, how to perform cost-benefit analysis, use software to run models this is not the course for them.",
    "The greatest course I've ever had.",

    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Good course, would recommend."
