    "Super fun class! Take if you like performing opera and you will get an unparalleled opportunity to work with a professional creative team.",
    "If you like singing\/acting and are down with opera, this is a great class. The production is a lot of work during tech week, so be prepared, but the rest of the course is extremely manageable. Grant is one of the most talented musicians I've had the pleasure of working with, and Toni is a wonderful director who will help you bring your character to life and create a compelling production.",
    "If you like tosing classical music, audition in the fall. When you leave Yale, you'll never get an opportunity quite like this one; Ellen Rosand, who supervises the project, is the foremost expert on 17th century Venetian Baroque opera.",
    "Awesome class where you get to put on an opera and study its history in all aspects. Take it. This is about as professional, inspiring, and impressive as performance classes go at Yale. Or take it just for Toni and Grant. They are fantastic leaders and friends.",
    "I would recommend the class. It\u0092s a great way to get practiced in the separate art form that is learning an opera role and preparing oneself to really do the character justice. Also, I would be remiss if I neglected to mention how much fun it really is.",
    "Take this class! It was absolutely awesome, and I will DEFINITELY do it again! However, check your finals schedule beforehand. The class has essentially no work (aside from learning your music) before Spring Break, but then it picks up gradually, starting with staging--a couple hours a week--and becoming a Baroque frenzy--two-week tech, which overlaps with reading week and finals week, has you in the theater 4 hours every night.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class if you are interested in the following:learning a baroque opera and putting on a very professional productionfalling in love with baroque opera in general, and working with amazing baroque musicians\/ scholarshaving a class with practically no work, other than learning music, for the first half of the semesterand then having a lot of extra rehearsals for a few weeks and then a (potentially 2 week) tech that coincides with finals. Basically you should check your finals schedule before signing up for the class... but overall, it was a wonderful experience!",
    "Just take it. No other time do you get the chance to put on a beautiful, fully staged Baroque opera with some of the leading professionals in the world.",
    "Every year, the Yale Baroque Opera Project (YBOP) puts on a baroque opera through this class. If you are a singer at Yale at all interested in opera, audition for this class!"
