   "comments": [
    "MATLAB programming basic polymer modeling Physical\/Spatial intuitions about biological phenomena.",
    "I learned how to do some coding in Matlab. I also learned more about what various types of simulations entail.",
    "The biggest thing this helped me do is become good at MATLAB. It would have been nice for more theory to have been an emphasis in the assignments, as opposed to simply coding up what we were given.",
    "Corey's class was both fun and an intellectual adventure. I really enjoy the mathematical descriptions and rigor that underly most studies of physics.Sadly, this same analytical spirit is often underhanded in the field of biology, where the focus is more on rote memorization of mechanisms, processes and complex molecules with intricate abbreviations. This course did a good job of bridging the two approaches together. I had prior experience with statistics and MATLAB, so this course was also a good refresher in both of those two disciplines.",
    "An understanding of biological physics and modeling from both conceptual and practical (computational) perspectives",
    "I definitely developed my MATLAB skills in this course.",
    "I had little experience before with most topics in the course and this was a great way to be introduced to polymer physics, molecular dynamics, and simulations. I learned the theory and implementation of a variety of MATLAB techniques that I can hopefully apply as I go along.",
    "Insight into current research going on in computational biology, modelling biological systems, coding skills. This course was a great beginner's lesson in MATLAB, especially for non-coders",
    "I gained skills in matlab and some knowledge in ways to model biological systems",
    "Programming, basic biological phenomena and how to simulate them",
    "Very little\/few. This was the least informative class that I have taken in my academic career. The lectures were poorly presented and as a student with a biology background, I was unable to understand the significance of the material being presented to me. The lectures were not helpful in doing the homeworks. All in all, I found this class highly ineffective in teaching me the fundamentals of biophysics. Either this course should have prerequisites or it should be revamped for the future.",
    "Mastery of Matlab as well as understanding of biological physics applications",
    "First coding experience applied to simulations of Biological Systems.",
    "MD, basic biophysics",
    "Topics covered: physics of biological processes - theoretical background and matlab computer simulations for following topics: fundamentals of histograms and normalization, random walk statistics (biased and unbiased), model for particle diffusing in a cell, chain models, persistence length, Ramachandran plots from crystal structure, Vicsek velocity model (repulsive and standard), radial distribution function, velocity verlet model (for collapse of bacterial nucleoid). Also learned to read\/parse protein data bank files, and of course matlab coding fundamentals.",
    "learned how to use matlab, and learned about how it can be used for making simulations and looking at protein files, etc",
    "Simulation techniques, Matlab",
    "Mostly how to use Matlab to describe various biological principles and phenomena."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "More structured lectures and a more rigorous pace could help this course greatly. Disparities in programming ability amongst students appeared to slow the course down.",
    "For people who are new to Matlab, it was difficult to start right in with the problem sets. I think it would have been helpful to have a few more help sessions in the beginning for crash courses in coding. On the other hand, the TAs tried to be as helpful as possible for working through coding problems and debugging.",
    "Everything was great. I loved how this class seemed to be about learned instead of stressing about grades.",
    "My favorite thing about the course was that it was computationally and analytically heavy. Although I have prior background in these two areas, I still was able to pick up new skills I might otherwise not have been able to. One way the course could be improved is if there was a more organized structure\/syllabus when it comes to the homeworks. They were often delayed in release and sometimes had errors\/typos.",
    "Strengths: a thorough and rigorous introduction to a wide variety of topics of great interest in understanding biological physics Weaknesses: the organization of the help sessions could be improved so as to reinforce concepts learned in class and systematically develop programming skills, both in a more EFFICIENT manner",
    "I wish the lectures and the homework assignments were more directly related. Also, I wish we got more specific feedback on our problem sets to help us improve more.",
    "I think the organization could have used some improvement, but overall the course was enjoyable. The lectures were fun and pleasant to follow, but it was often unclear why people should pay attention.",
    "Strengths: For the most part well-defined MATLAB assignments, interesting guest lectures to see how what we learn is applied, and the TFs were very knowledgeable and helpful Weaknesses: The theory was taught at a bit of a high level, as someone who has not had much experience with the material previously. I feel like there was a heterogeneous mix of people in the class and I imagine some parts were a bit confusing to some people. Still I was able to get through without too much trouble. Also one weakness related to the assignments is that we were not told what we lost points for, which could have been helpful when doing future assignments.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed going to lectures, and learning the materials. I did not find the homework assignments to be particularly enlightening.",
    "Strengths: Gives insight into current research, helps develop basic MATLAB skills, introduction to modelling biological systems. The course instructor was really lenient, and designed to help students learn, and not test them all the time. Weaknesses: Some problem sets were just beyond me, and I had to depend heavily on the TAs and other classmates to understand what was being asked. Usually, the math was clear but the problem lay in translating that into code. I hope in future there will be some basic problem sets in the beginning of the course designed for non-coders to familiarize them with basic coding tricks. Also, I wish the classroom teaching was a bit more engaging. I mostly benefited from the problems sets, which were great!",
    "The assignments did not seem to be especially dependent on attending class, but lectures were entertainjng",
    "Strength- the course is based on the on-going research and it was interesting to learn the cutting-edge research from different professors Weakness- The assignments were sometimes not clear on instruction",
    "This course can be improved by better teaching. Many of the students coming from a biology background did not follow Professor O'Hern's lectures including myself. My notes and those posted did little to help me. Revamping the course to appeal more to students with a biology background will help.",
    "Strengths: Homework tested mastery of subject taught Weakness: Should have a prerequisite of Matlab experience",
    "This course has very interesting and enjoyable lectures with diverse Topics and also visiting experts giving talks. The coding assignments boosted the understanding and were mostly well prepared, albeit sometimes messy and lacking sufficient Feedback. All in all this was one of the best courses I have ever taken.",
    "Overall great, but the intro material is too easy....the instructor does not have to explain what a PDF is or what a histogram is to students tkaing this class.",
    "The organization of the course could be improved. I really appreciated the lectures containing derivations, but felt that they came across slightly disjointed. Part of this was due to the scattered research oriented lectures. In addition, a lot of this class was predicated upon our ability to read code written with less than optimal comments. While this is a useful skill, I feel as though it may have hindered understanding of the core material.",
    "Strengths: topics covered were interesting and the problem sets were challenging, well-rounded and consistent in terms of difficulty. TAs were helpful. Weaknesses: timing of topics covered in class could use improvement (homework on given subjects was assigned weeks after the relative topic was covered in class). Because the class is large and assignments lengthy, there was little to no feedback on homework sets and solutions were only provided for the first homework set.",
    "the matlab work was very challenging without any background in it",
    "We had quite much practice in programming. It would be better if we had more detailed info in the bio part"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, with the caveat that the course fluctuates yearly and the material covered changes. I was under the impression that the course would be mostly physics taught from biological perspectives. Instead, what was taught in 2016 was first principles approaches to physical problems that can be abstracted to biology. To the physics student, this makes sense and it is easy to understand the flow and structure of the course. To the biologist, it is hard to connect the dots.",
    "The topics covered were interesting (although not too relevant to my research area), and I was able to pick up some coding skills.",
    "Yeah -- it is a good class to take, but beware that MATLAB isn't really taught that much in class. Just know that if you are like me and have no programming experience, you will have to learn to code on your own. But, the TAs are there for help all the time, so take advantage of them. Corey just wants everyone to succeed!",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to other students. I like the emphasis on learning without the need for overly assessing a student with problem sets AND midterm exams and a final exam, etc. Corey is also an excellent instructor, who makes things fun during every lecture.",
    "Yes! This class was one of the most valuable I have taken considering both my graduate and undergraduate education; moreover, what is most rare, is that the class teaches you HOW to study questions in biological physics, rather than merely telling us how others have studied biological physics",
    "Yes, I found this course interesting overall.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes - I believe I gained a lot from this class. It was probably the most interesting class to me out of the three I took this semester. I'm glad I had a chance to engage with the material.",
    "Yes, of course. This course, if taken seriously, will help you get in sync with what's going on in the world of research and you'll learn a lot of biophysics and computational biology.",
    "I would recommend this course because it really helps you develop programming skills.",
    "No I would not.",
    "Yes, great course :)",
    "Yes, if the student has Matlab experience and wishes to broaden their abilities to include biological physics applications",
    "Yes. Very strongly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in learning the applications of statistical mechanics, molecular dynamics, and polymer physics in biological systems.",
    "This class is required for the people I would recommend it to. It is a good to great class, as it covers a wide variety of biological physics. All assignments were coding in matlab, which really helped my ability to code and renewed my interest in computer science.",
    "Maybe, I think it depends on their background and what they hope to get out of it. For me, it was really interesting to learn about what can be done in this field more generally, but the work was more than I was prepared for and maybe more in depth than necessary for me right now.",
    "yes, very useful course for those who do a lot of simulation, and those who study biophysics\/soft matter"
