    "The course is a surveyof the major literature in anthropology from the 1970s to present. I would highly recommend it for another student -- in the past year, this has been one of the two most important courses for me for developing an understanding of what the project of anthropology is, and where it articulates with other bodies of social theory.",
    "Yes, it informs us what anthropologists have been observing and writing in more recent periods. It offers a good perspective in understanding ongoing scholarly debates while engaging with other disciplines like history.",
    "See above",
    "it's a required course. good for students new to the discipline"

   "comments": [
    "See above. Some of the readings for the course will specifically contribute to my dissertation research, but the most important aspect of it was to gain a better understanding of trends and debates in the discipline.",
    "I understood from this course how anthropologists are self-reflexive upon their studies throughout the entire process of anthropological research. In particular, the sections on development, nationalism and globalization accord well with the ongoing (de)construction of \"modernity\", within which knowledge production and our own research is involved.",
    "My only advice for next year is for more coordination with 501b, in order to cover more themes\/ trends, for example Gramsci-Hegemony-Resistance, Power, Phenomenology, Hermeneutics, Social Change, Performance.",
