    "If you are interested in archaeology this course is a great way to get hands-on experience digging.",

    "3 weekends.No classwork until next semester",
    "It isn't actually 8-5 on Saturdays, or whatever it says on here. For our class, we spent 3 weekends of October digging in Pennsylvania. The rest of the lab portion (cleaning&analyzing the artifacts) was done mostly independently. Next year, I think they plan to work on a site in CT, so I don't know how the weekends will work. It's great class, though!",
    "If you're a freshman, you probably want to save this for later because you'll be on the dig from Friday to Sunday every weekend in October. But for upperclassmen, I think this is one of the must-take courses at Yale--and it's not that hard to get into.",
    "AWESOME COURSE."
