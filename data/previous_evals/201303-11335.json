    "A solid yes. Takes in writers on any level and makes their prose better, if they want to write in any genre of nonfiction. I'd recommend Fadiman's seminar over this course, but Genre is far from second-rate.Strengths: Writing every week (short, not time-consuming unless you want it to be, topic of your choice), great edits\/evaluations, interesting readings that cover a variety of style, in-class edits succeed in adding value to VK's work. I've never been scared of writing or self-expression, but if you come into class feeling either of those things, VK will cure them--lots of mellow speeches on how you're just as good as any MFA student, and on how you should write whatever sorts of things you want to write.Weaknesses: Easy to fall into the trap of writing solid workmanlike prose and refrain from risk-taking (even though risk-taking isn't punished), just for the pleasure of seeing less red ink on your paper when it comes back to you. No idea what my grade will be, and didn't think to ask until it was too late to do anything about it. Take risks, ask early, and there's basically no downside to the class.",
    "This class was amazing! You write an essay every week, simple as that. No prompts. You write about whatever you want, in whatever style, so I learned a lot of independence (maybe the most valuable part of the experience forme). Petition if you get wait-listed; I didn't think it was going to work out, but show up the first and second days and you never know what will happen. Verlyn is super chill and an amazing person (and writer) to learn from. You'll spend a lot of time working on and thinking about your pieces (and reading everyone else's pieces!) but it's always a lot of fun, and worth it to walk away with twelve halfway-decent essays.",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough. It has improved the quality of my creative and academic writing and changed the way I approach creative writing.",
    "My first writing seminar, and really all I imagined a writing seminar would or should be. You write a piece each week, which usually ends up being a cross between an artful journal entry and a personal essay, with maybe a dash of journalism. There are no prompts but don't let that scare you--it's quite liberating. You'll see your writing improve and others' too, even if it's not a perfectly straight trajectory. Also quite a good way to keep yourself writing habitually. Readings and seminars were always pleasure--Verlyn moderates discussion very well and students are sensitive critics and listeners. I.e. No section assholery to speak of. Note: if you are put on thewait list don't be afraid to show up and see if you can get in--it's well worth it.",
    "Absolutely. If you get the chance to take ENGL 474, take it! Verlyn is an amazing teacher. He's down-to-earth, approachable, and really cares about his students. His approach to writing is that it should be fun and liberating. Each week the assignment is simply to write. And that's what makes the class so special. Verlyn made writing enjoyable, and I'll never look at it the same way after taking his class.",
    "Verlyn believes that everyone can write about anything.He's right.See for yourself.",
    "Take this class! Take this class! Verlyn may be blunt, but his comments are on-point and always helpful. He picks perfect pieces for discussion -- John Cheever, Joan Didion, Annie Dillard, George Orwell -- and articulates the vague, nebulous feelings you've always had about words. He's well-spoken and down-to-earth, funny and honest. Please go to office hours and hear what he has to say outside the classroom. He's always ready to give more personal advice. He's always happy to decipher his own scrawlings on your pieces. Please take this class! (Remember, always remember -- don't let anyone change your writing, even Verlyn.)",
    "Write a midlength piece weekly and submit it to the class. Workshop each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pieces and read great gems of published nonfiction pieces selected by Prof. Klinkenborg. If you get in, take it! If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, try to audit it! A weekly thoughtful discussion of writing and calm recalibration.",
    "yup, do it. you come out a much stronger writer.",
    "Take it! Verlyn gives your work an incredible level of attention. No matter how well you write at the beginning of the semester, your writing will improve by the end of it.",
    "This is a great class! You get to write pretty much whatever you want, and the environment is incredibly supportive. Verlyn pays really close attention to each student, both as a writer and as a person. He also offers a lot of wisdom about life as well as writing. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who enjoys writing and wants to learn about it, with no bullshit. This course was a total joy.",
    "EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS. I wasn't so sure about it during shopping period and even the first couple weeks of class, but it could very well have been my favorite class at Yale (speaking as a second semester senior, therefore best class out of four years). At first, I was intimidated by the all the English majors and YDN\/Herald writers in the class, but then I became more comfortable. Verlyn taught us that we all can be, and ARE, in fact writers. He really empowers his students. Verlyn is so great to listen to and so so encouraging. Your writing will improve, but most importantly, your confidence in your ability to writer will improve even more. I wish I could somehow rank this class above \"Excellent\" in this evaluation.",
    "Wonderful class. A great way to become more comfortable writing thoughtful nonfiction, and developing my voice. The workshop format worked very well, and felt like a very safe environment. The assigned reading pieces, and discussions of them, also worked well. Highly recommended."
