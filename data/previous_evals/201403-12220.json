    "TAKE this class, the best class ever.",
    "Everyone should take a class with Professor Lofton at some point! Her lectures are mind-blowing and she encourages you to think about important issues of your own life. In this class, you get a chance to think about how you want to define your life in relation to the ubiquitous technology and how to position yourself in relation to that status quo. I got by with doing about half of the reading. You're supposed to do all of it, but you can get by with just doing some. But definitely do some--because it really helps and a lot of the readings are super interesting. Don't skip lectures because each one was so valuable. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS. You may not take many other courses that are THIS relevant to your life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material was interesting, and Lofton is amazing. The workload is more spread out, which is kind of nice. You have three exams and two papers, which might seem like a lot, but takes the pressure off of one assignment. There is also less material on each exam, so it really gives you the chance to engage with that amount of material.",
    "Great presentation. Take it if you like the readings. Otherwise, sit in on a few lectures and see what you think.",
    "Professor Lofton is awesome (SO enthusiastic) and I really enjoyed the class. I would recommend it.",
    "Professor Lofton is great! She engages with both the ideas in the course and the students she's teaching. Take this course if you're looking for an interesting elective!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is a great introductory course into religious studies as it is oriented very much in the present making the class and its topics easier to digest. Professor Lofton is hilarious and a great educator. Go to her office hours and get to know her because she is an awesome mentor.",
    "Do it! Lofton is one of those Yale legends (who isnt an old straight white dude, yay!) who you should really take a class with if you can, especially if bombastic lecturer-preacher hybrids appeal at all. This class was new this year, but lived up to Loftons reputation for making religion accessible and interesting for more secular students by addressing it in the context of things that seem more immediately relevant to our lives in this case, technology. It would be hard to articulate exactly what I learned in this class, but I know its one Ill be thinking about on and off for years to come.",
    "Overall the course was very interesting and made me think differently about the technology I use everyday.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested and puzzled by our technology use. Why do we use it and to what ends? How is it affecting society?"
