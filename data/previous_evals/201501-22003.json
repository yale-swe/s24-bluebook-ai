    "Amazing. This course, due largely to Prof. Alfred Guy but also due to the wonderful selection of novels and short stories we read over the semester, has been the best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Guy is the kind of personality in the lecture hall that can make even the most ambivalent CreditD'er care deeply about the reading material and the importance of science fiction. He has the unique and severely undervalued power to make you feel like you're having a one-on-one conversation in a lecture hall of 120 people. Absolutely take this class, you won't regret it.",
    "Science Fiction YAS.",
    "Hello there, future ENGL 132 student. Now why don't you just sit back in that comfy chair and light yourself a pipe? Let the euphoria fill your mind. Imagine a rainbow-colored sky, with a purple dragon belching Skittles and gold everywhere. You're there, flying through the sky on your magic carpet, the clouds tickling your buttocks as you receive a six-star massage of your mind from Professor Guy, the science fiction hero of the eighteen seas and six thousand galaxies of this dimension. That's where I am, right now, with a slice of watermelon in one hand and the keys to a new Ferrari in the other, because I stumbled into ENGL 132 on the first day of reading period and my sins were forgiven and I was raised from my humble deadpan existence into gilded heaven by the gatekeeper: you guessed it, Professor Guy. If you just opened your eyes and found yourself sitting in your normal room in your boring college on our ordinary planet, and your heart is sinking like a bag of soaked tomatoes dropped into the ocean under the moonlight because you know that you aren't on a magic carpet flying through the rainbow sky next to a purple Skittles-spitting dragon while Professor Guy massages your mind with his Star Trek figures, you know where you need to be next semester. ENGL 132 beckons to you. Because you need it. And it needs you.",
    "Wow. Such a good course. Reading list is on point, professor is incredible, lectures are a joy, writing assignments aren't too bad. Would recommend taking during a lighter semester so that you can put in time every day to write like Professor Guy suggests, I imagine it would've been helpful for the papers. If you're a Sci-Fi fan or a Sci-Fi sceptic, you will leave this course loving it.",
    "Take this course, just do it. I took it because I love to read (am a STEM major) but had long felt a lot of wariness toward scifi. This class made me really care about scifi and see the ways that it is an unbelievably important genre. Now I can't wait to read more. Also, Professor Guy is amazing and cares about his students more than almost any other professor I've ever met. Listen, join this special community if you at all have the chance.",
    "As a senior and this was hands down the best class I have ever taken at Yale. And not just because of the material, this class got me thinking about human nature\/gender\/the future\/the point of my liberal arts education. Really just a fantastic experience. Take this class.",
    "If you're interested in the genre, take it for Professor Guy; he's the best lecturer I've ever had at Yale.",
    "I definitely recommend Engl 132! It is a fantastic course with interesting reading and a very engaged Professor. Lectures were always fun to attend and as its an intro English course, it's relatively low-intensity.",
    "A fantastic english course that analyzes science fiction as literature in an intriguing and interesting manner. It will broaden your scope of literature and improve your critical analysis skills and make you think hard about what it means to be human.",
    "Sci-fi is a genre I enjoy but realized I didn't know much about, since it isn't one I normally think of studying in an academic context; I can now say that doing so is broadening, informative, and enjoyable. I appreciate studying these texts, the approach to writing them, as serious literature and highly recommend that to everyone--whether you like reading scifi, or whether it's not your thing but you like engaging with literature, its tools, and its context. This is a great course and it is fantastically taught, you will not regret taking it.",
    "TAKE IT. Especially if you're a science major. Especially if you like taking good classes.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yeah, probably, if you're into that kind of thing.",
    "YES",
    "Whether you like science fiction, good literature, or just words in general, you should take this course",
    "This is definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you like science fiction at all, you should definitely take it. I really enjoyed most of the books we read, and Professor Guy is awesome. (So much geeking out over Captain Kirk.) That said, it is an English class, and if you're like me and rarely take humanities classes, it can be a little hard to adjust to writing the sort of papers expected for this class. Still worth taking for sure, but I'm glad I took it credit\/D.",
    "TAKE IT. As someone who had very low familiarity with this genre, this class was accessible and screamingly fun. Guy is an enthusiastic and cogent lecturer, and it's clear he really cares about his students. The class isn't just about \"nerd stuff\" or spaceships and hoverboards. It's really about human nature and how we define our human identity across a variety of different metrics. The class takes a healthy dip into gender and sexuality studies, with books by, for, and about communities that have tended to be underrepresented in science fiction (women and people of color). Guy was also good about making sure those discussions were at hand even when we're watching Star Trek or The Matrix. Also he dresses up like characters from the movies we watch sometimes, which is hilarious and fun.",
    "Best English class ever. Possibly my favorite class at Yale. Would definitely recommend to everyone.",
    "I would highly recommend English 132 to any student in need of a writing credit, or if they are simply interested in Science Fiction. I think that sometimes the materials that are assigned in English classes at Yale can be inaccessible, but with Science Fiction, it is interesting to connect books that may not usually examined in an academic context and having interesting dialogues.",
    "A must-take, no matter your major. Fun, but thoughtful and provocative. Professor Guy will be the highlight of your Monday\/Wednesday.",
    "This is a good survey of science fiction. Prof Guy connects most of the texts to the theme of \"technologies of identity\" - but as a WGSS major, I don't feel like he went as far as he might have in considering SF works as politically implicated texts. The lectures were always fun and engaging, because Prof. Guy is an excellent lecturer. The readings left something to be desired: while there were many moves to include texts that have a more political or literary bent, and that aren't by white men (like The Female Man and Dawn), the lectures did not always push that hard on the implications of these texts. I think that the addition of more texts by women and people of color (Samuel Delaney certainly comes to mind) would help to make a more cohesive syllabus. Overall, though, a great class and lots of fun!",
    "This course will have you read a lot about gender and feminism before you get to more traditional SciFi books. If you like that or can stand it, take this course; the texts that follow are worth pursuing, and the manner in which they are pursued is fantastic.",
    "Absolutely awesome. Work is a bit front loaded but works out fine since it eases up just as most other classes heat up. Most of all through, take it even if you don't think you are a huge sci fi fan - Professor Guy will turn you into one right away, he is hands down my favorite professor at Yale.",
    "You must take this course!!!!!",
    "This is a great class! It is the most fun you will ever have in a writing credit.",
    "Overall my feelings are somewhat mixed. The selection of texts is pretty good---people complained about the focus on gender in the first half of the course, but while spending an entire month on feminist sf might be a little much, I thought that almost everything we read was definitely worth reading and spending time on. Professor Guy is also a very exciting lecturer and works hard to be funny and engaging. But, it seems like he prefers to avoid doing much in-depth textual analysis during lecture, which can make class feel a little pointless at times. Having a good section helped make up for this, though.",
    "An excellent course, especially if you want to do a useful writing credit or like the books on the excellently chosen syllabus. And you should like the books; they are some of the most interesting I've read.",
    "An awesome course. Take this class if you are interested in sci-fi. Hands down. Front-loaded with work but it peters off in the last few weeks, allowing you to focus on other classes. Reading list is awesome and Prof. Guy is one of the best lecturers at Yale. Read the books if you take the class. And go to class. It's worth it. The TAs weren't amazing and didn't really teach you how to write an essay, but were helpful and kind.",
    "Lots of cool parts about this course, though be prepared for lectures that ask you to talk to the person next to you and raise your hand in response to questions. Lots of class participation. If you're excited to read the books you'll enjoy this. If you don't read them you'll be lost in lecture.",
    "Take it, good blend of contemporary science fiction.",
    "I would hesitantly recommend ENGL 132. First be advised that this isn't a gut by any stretch of the imagination, and doing the reading is the most important part of the course. Secondly, only take this if you have the time to commit to it. It is certainly a time-consuming course; the essays are really hard, and nigh on impossible if you haven't done the readings. Third, I would say if you aren't an English person already, this course won't make you one. Though it's advertised as science fiction, be advised that it is an English course in every single way except that you read books from the genre known as speculative, or science fiction. And last, make sure Professor Guy is teaching it. He's one of the most incredible lecturers at Yale, and if you haven't taken a course with him, and you like English, and have some time to devote, definitely take this course.",
    "Wonderfully engaging and enthusiastic professor gives lectures that really help to tie the course texts together. He really has very insightful things to say which make you a better critical reader and persuasive argument writer just by listening to them. At first the texts are interesting in and of themselves, but as the course progresses, it's clear that everything being consumed and analyzed is really in service of wrestling with larger questions and truths. The professor really prioritizes hearing students' points of view, and he does so by building discourse and interaction into lectures, visiting, observing, and participating in each section, and strongly encouraging students to interface with him outside of class, at office hours and film screenings. Some of the assignment prompts can feel constraining - you get the sense that there are certain arguments that you are supposed to be making. They are also a bit strict with what kind of essay they expect - they are definitely teaching you how to write in a specific way. There are opportunities built in for revision however, and incentives for using the Writing Center - which you should be using anyway!",
    "Yes, I would recommend ENGL 132 to another student. The course is a great survey course of science fiction and a highly interactive lecture. Professor Guy is incredibly enthusiastic and a very good facilitator of class discussions. The novels are weird, but interesting and certainly thought provoking. Occasionally lectures were a little less organized\/ pointed in their discussion but overall this is a great class to take whether or not you are an English major",
    "I recommend this course. The readings are fun and the lectures are fascinating.",
    "Excellent and challenging course, very entertaining but not easy by any means.",
    "I would most definitely recommend ENGL 132 to fellow student. This class is completely different from any other I have taken. It is not just about science fiction, it is about how to approach life on a new level. It will teach you about the world and will force you to question things you never thought needed explaining.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. It is an amazing class with the coolest selection of texts. The discussions we have in class are also highly relevant to the issues of identity and technology that we face in our daily lives.",
    "Take it. The books rock, and Professor Guy is probably the most organized, fair, hilarious, passionate professor you'll have at Yale.",
    "If you want to read, write, and think about Science Fiction, this class is perfect for you. If you're not sure if you like Science Fiction, this class is also perfect for you. Professor Guy is stellar. The lectures are interactive, engaging, and a breath of fresh air. Readings are fantastic, and reason enough to take the course (do the readings, they're so much fun). Assignments are well spaced, and you get plenty of feedback. I took it Credit-D, and still did all the work, because I wanted to, just with less stress. The class has a moderate stream of work, which you'll be fine with, because the class is too good for you to resent it."
