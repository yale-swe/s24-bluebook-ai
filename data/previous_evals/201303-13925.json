   "comments": [
    "I would recommend NELC 116 to another student. If you are at all interested in ancient history then this is a great class to get your feet wet. Professor Slanski is a wonderful and engaging instructor, and the stories we study are fascinating.Overall the workload is not bad at all: each week for section you have to submit a 1-2 page response to that week's readings, and then there are two 5-7 page papers and a final exam.",
    "If you like literary analysis, you should take this class because much of what goes on involves interpretations of ancient texts and the intertextuality of texts from the Ancient Near East.",
    "The class is about the cultures of Ancient Mesopotamia, which you study through the artifacts and myths they left behind. The two papers you write are meant to further deepen your understanding of the culture, and also improve your ability to analyze the myths and connect them with the culture. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "This is an interesting class that treats Ancient Near Eastern mythology in the context of both contemporary ritual and parallel texts like the Bible. It's mostly a survey of the literature (not too much historical context) and the papers and reading responses you'll do are largely close readings. It's definitely an introduction, but it's a lot of fun for someone who hasn't had a lot of exposure to the traditions of the area and would be interested to know things like how Gilgamesh relates to the Dead Sea Scrolls.",
    "Yes. Definitely take it, no matter what your major is. It's a super interesting and unusual subject."
