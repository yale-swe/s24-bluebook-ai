   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in reading the material take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Modern Irish Drama for any student interested in Irish or British literature, or for any student interested in theater, and even film. The class is a wonderfully in-depth look at drama from 20th+21st century Ireland. The works are all engaging, and the themes of the literature are interesting. I might recommend it to any English major, actually. The workload is pretty light (since the readings are generally short).",
    "Great syllabus, but bad seminar. If you want to talk about the text, don't take this class.",
    "Professor Biggs is a little intimidating, but very manageable workload and interesting plays.",
    "An interesting class if you care about the material. Two plays a week an three papers. A good deal of reading, but most of it is interesting.",
    "I would strongly recommend Modern Irish Drama to a fellow student. The material studied is varied and allows for the development of an understanding of themes in modern Irish drama, from early plays through the present. In doing so it also illustrates Irish history and culture - the connection between the literature and the story of the nation is vital. Class discussions are very engaging and enjoyable. Professor Biggs is a wonderful teacher.",
    "If you're ready to be engaged in the subject, this is a great course - a great combination of factual learning and more standard literary discussion and writing."
