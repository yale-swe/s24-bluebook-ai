    "Art majors should definitely take advantage of independent projects. It's a great forum to design their own project for the semester and focus their energy on achieving these specific goals. Also, the individualized mentorship you get by working closely with one faculty member is really helpful and not something that always happens in other courses.",
    "Independent Projects are what you make of them. I have talked to friends who have had really intense advisers for their projects, and very laid back ones. My advice would be to take advantage of this class if you have a well thought outproject or medium you would like to explore that 1) cannot be done in an already established art class, 2) you have a professor in mind who can advise you, 3) you are ready to put in work in an unstructured class setting.",
    "Independent Study.",
    "Yes, if they don't offer a class in what you want, you'll probably do this."
