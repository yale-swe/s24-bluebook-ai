   "comments": [
    "I learned time management skills because the problem sets took quite a while to do so I had to make sure that I had enough time to do them. I also learned how important my peers are. We always worked together in class to figure out problems we didn't understand. Of course, our teacher, Nick, helped us when we needed it, but sometimes he wanted to see how well we could work together and whether we could figure it out just by helping one another.",
    "Calc II material. Integrals, series, volumes, polar coords, parametrics.",
    "Basic calculus class. Learned to approach problems a little bit differently.",
    "I learn how to find the areas under curves, how to solve sequences and series problems, and how to apply different integration techniques.",
    "I learned not only formulas and how to set up problems, but why the formulas look the way they do, and why we set up certain problems the way we do. I feel like I got a deeper understanding of the calculus I learned in high school.",
    "Bring back calculus knowledge",
    "The class covers what the syllabus shows. The calculus is fairly straightforward and prepares one for Multivariable decently. Could be taught in a way that develops intuition better, rather than continue the high-school-vibe of rote memorization and plug-in formulas. Overall a good class, challenging but not too hard.",
    "How to do calculus",
    "I gained a deeper insight on how to solve integrals and how to work with series.",
    "Through this course, I learned all of the calculus concepts necessary for multivariable calculus. This course also taught me how to look at mathematics from a more broader and abstract scope and understand the implications of the math that I was learning.",
    "We learned about Calculus principles. The first half of the class we mostly learned about integrals, and the second half was mostly on series\/sequences.",
    "I learned a lot about Calculus, mainly Taylor series and polar and parametric calculus."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class helped develop my problem-solving skills by forcing me to challenge myself, a definite strength of this course. However, sometimes the challenges were so large that I felt I couldn't overcome them and I wish, in those moments, I had a little more help. I think we should have started with easier questions and then built our way to harder questions over the course of the class, a structure that we didn't always follow.",
    "I felt that the explorations prior to class were not much help for prep.",
    "Wish there were some easier problems on the practice tests that were \"warm up\" problems.",
    "The teaching skills could improve a little.",
    "The class could be a lot shorter. Once he explained concepts in depth, there wasnt really much less to do during class. Also the pre class explorations were a waste of time. However, the comments on exams were probably the most helpful of any of my classes, as they were very thorough and explained exactly what I did wrong.",
    "The videos are helpful, but I was unaware of them until the first midterm",
    "My understanding is that, bar a few, it is poorly taught across all sections, and the students rely heavily on self-teaching. Again, could develop intuition and love for math\/calculus a lot better if the educators took on a more enthusiastic and nuanced approach to covering the topics in sections. Nick's section was overall good, but required an already developed sense of approach to calculus and math\/proofs in general to really understand what he was doing.",
    "No explorations Better teaching style",
    "I like how the course eased away from the use of the online videos and flipped classroom style, which didnt line up well with the curriculum. The review sessions were always very helpful to review exam material and problem sets were catered to understanding the discussed material.",
    "I wish we could be provided with a list of formulas\/identifies that it was necessary to memorize.",
    "I think the course was strong in its format; small classes allow for a personal experience with the class. I think the content could have been better curated. This isn't high school anymore, but the school should consider how many kids taking this course only took Calculus AB in high school, so a college level course should cover at least all of the material in BC. There was a lot of time at the beginning of the semester going over things one would have learned in Calc I, and a lot of stuff high schoolers cover (surface area, partial fractions) that we did not get to, at least in my semester.",
    "Honestly one of the worst classes Ive taken so far. Unless you need this class for your major, do not take it."

    "Yeah, I had fun.",

    "Decent introduction course to calculus, so yes. Not too hard, not too easy. Good first course to take\/",
    "I would recommend it to people who enjoy learning about math.",
    "Yes, I not only learned how to do calculus problems, but also got a pretty solid understanding of what I was doing.",
    "This class is usually a requirement for a lot of the majors, so there's really no choice unless you place out of it. I recommend taking it anyway, to develop a broader mindset about math and functions and how they might be applied in the real world.",
    "Yes.",
    "Not unless it was required",
    "I would recommend this course. It taught me how to do integrals at a higher level than I was previously exposed to, and how to think about math as a process rather than just plugging in numbers.",
    "No, I would recommend taking an equivalent class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if he\/she\/they are interested in learning more about calculus. As a student who was only ever introduced to AB (calculus 1) content in high school, I had to play a little bit of catch up, but it wasnt unmanageable. The course material is very interesting although memorization heavy at times.",
    "I would only recommend the class if you need it for a major or if you're really passionate about math.",
    "Yes. It's a requirement for almost anything, so there's no choice. But it's honestly not a bad course.",
    "No. Do not take this course unless you need it for your major. It is poorly run and poorly taught with more professors. The grading is extremely harsh and there are no curves."
