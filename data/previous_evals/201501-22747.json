    "Great class that covers policy landscape in U.S. from both a historical and analytical lens. Professor Boorman is a hidden gem at Yale. Incredibly knowledgable and very approachable. Stick with it past shopping period and you will be happy you did.",
    "A very well organized course. The installments and the emails Prof. Boorman sends out are very helpful. The historical material especially was well presented. The formal models were a little more difficult as someone without a mathematical background but Prof. Boorman did try to make the models accessible. Not going to be the most engaging class you've taken at Yale but I think it's a good class for a variety of interests, not just in sociology but maybe political science and especially Econ. Only grade is the final so you have to keep up with the material .",
    "Intro to Social Policy Analysis covers complex statutes and trends on the domestic policy landscape from the New Deal to the present. It also introduces students to a wide variety of formal modeling techniques used in social policy research.",
    "A good class that is about half policy in the 20th century and about half modeling tools. A good introduction but will likely leave you wanting more. Fair grading and helpful professor.",
    "SOCY 147 01 is a good intro-level course. The material can be a bit challenging for a student with no sociology background, but it is well within the grasp of a serious student."
