   "comments": [
    "I learned about the process of running a comparative psych study and the day to day administration involved. I also read a lot of scientific papers and discussed them with the aid of other undergrads and grad students. I also helped code a scientific study.",
    "I learned to collect physiology data, analyze HRV data. I learned about attention and emotional stimuli, eyetracking, and EEG.",
    "Better ability to conduct research",
    "Under Professor Gee, I gained insight into the collaborative research process and appreciation for being part of a team in the lab. In terms of concrete skills, I began several training processes, including running participants in the fMRI scanner, using a GSR machine, and administering the WASI and participant questionnaires. I also learned a great deal about the process of diagnosis and how to negotiate the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-V. In particular, I gained a detailed understanding of PTSD and look forward to continuing that learning process next year.",
    "I learned more about experimental design and implementation."

   "comments": [
    "I love how engaged and involved the undergrads can be in this lab and how we're taken seriously and helped in weekly lab discussion, and even encouraged to come up with our own ideas for research. I think the grad students are very approachable, and Professor Santos is as well. This was an amazing lab experience.",
    "The course really depends on your PI's involvement. My PI was wonderful, so it worked out well",
    "There is a lot of opportunity to hands on work, great mentors available, and lots of feedback throughout the semester. However, whether or not you get that mentoring depends on what shift you have. Working with Angie is fantastic; she is so engaged, and enthusiastic about giving feedback on projects. The other adults (Mikey and other grad students\/postdocs) in the lab are also smart and nice, but they do not feel like mentors."

    "I would definitely recommend this lab to another student. The studies are usually enjoyable to run, everyone is so friendly and eager to help, and you learn a lot by running your study, coding, and reading a lot of scientific papers and analyzing them with other people in the lab.",
    "Learned so much with fantastic mentors and peers. Brainstorming sessions felt productive and students truly have their own voices to critique and design experiments.",
    "Yes! It's a good class.",
    "Yes, this is a great way to get involved in research!",
    "Doing a research credit is a great way to get hands on experience."
