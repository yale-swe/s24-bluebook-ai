   "comments": [
    "This is a well-curated class, tightly organized around important themes in legal history and spanning diverse readings from different periods in history. Rohit De was a very strong discussion leader, encouraging student contributions while marshaling the class in a productive direction. The weekly reading responses kept everyone honest about the readings, and the process of writing the final paper was enjoyable. Highly recommended.",
    "Great class! Prof. De is amazing at running a seminar of this size, and the readings are really good and reasonable in length. The class doesn't really have an overarching theme or direction, but almost every week gives you a new angle on the law that I wouldn't have thought about before. Take it!!!",
    "The class is a fascinating inter-disciplinary look at law. Its biggest strength - its breadth - is perhaps also its greatest weakness. I would recommend this class to students who are interested in new ways of thinking about law, and have pre-existing knowledge\/interest in the history of certain country\/region already. If that's true for you, the class will be valuable in broadening your understanding, give you some great comparative tools, without being too general and undefined.",
    "This is a hard class. There is a lot of reading (often dry), weekly reading responses, and a very active seminar. Do not take this class if you will not thoughtfully do the reading. Importantly, do not take this class if you will not talk -- most in the class were very talkative. I enjoyed having an active seminar (being fairly talkative myself), but I imagine the class could be difficult if unwilling to speak. Also, much of the graded work is self-motivated. Also, do not take this class if you are expecting a linear legal history. If you acknowledge these things and are okay with them, you will love this class. In hindsight, I really did enjoy this class. Yes, some seemed already gunning for law school. Yes, there was too much reading. Yes, weekly reading responses were burdensome. But Professor De's enthusiasm in the classroom really made this class worth it. Out of the 3 history seminars I have taken, I felt this was the most challenging, but I really did learn a lot. Thinking about the social\/historical impact of an institution throughout the semester really was interesting. Comparisons in different locations and time periods was also fascinating. In sum, a hard (sometimes frustrating) class, but worth it.",
    "I was really excited to get in to this class and Professor De is amazing, very willing to meet and incredibly knowledgable, but the course itself had some flaws, in particular the lack of direction and dry class discussions. This class is an incredible amount of work and stressful-- the readings are extensive and you must do every word to be able to fully contribute to class discussion. There are also weekly forum reading response posts. Professor De is amazing, however, and I have really enjoyed learning from him, and he's very helpful in office hours.",
    "GREAT class. Amazing way to do a junior seminar as a history major and great prof to learn from universally. A delight!",
    "It's a good one",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. You will learn to rethink a lot of things you thought you already knew about law and government and society and distributions of power. It's a lot of dense reading and the discussions sometimes went over my head, but it was worth it.",
    "Take this course if you get in! It will give you are more critical perspective on extremely important and pervasive phenomena of our world, and tear down some of your assumptions about \"law.\" Especially take this class if you are thinking of pursuing politics or law in the future: a critical understanding of the law's framework and historical organization are vital to both paths.",
    "A broad, ambitious class, whose goal is to teach you how law and society have interacted throughout history. It is not focused on a specific time or place, though India and the US pop up frequently, as Professor De is most well versed in those topics. Weekly readings with a short reading response. There is only one paper-- the final, which is ten pages. The reading is usually quite interesting-- with varying accounts and points of view covered-- though there can be some drier areas, as is to be expected with some forms of law. Professor De is well aware of this and was conscientious of it, as well as of students' lives. Overall a great course with a great professor."
