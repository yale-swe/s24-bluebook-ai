   "comments": [
    "Take it take it take it! Thompson is a wonderful professor, and she really explores the thoughts of each author. You always leave class enlightened. She leads the class discussion well by balancing between student's comments and her own comments.",
    "Directed Studies HP looks at historians and political thinkers from ancient Greece through the 20th century. A very interesting class that looks not only at events, but at how events are interpreted by their contemporaries, with a bit of political science thrown in. It was an amazing class, and one I would highly recommend!",
    "This class was truly amazing, and I would recommend it again and again. The texts were challenging and you had to be on your toes with the discussion, but I learned so much.",
    "An intro to historical and political thought, with the emphasis on politics. Really not a history class at all, but reading the great historians and tracking political themes, seeing how nations rise and fall and clash with each other from Herodotus to Aquinas. I would definitely recommend it, as I felt like it worked in very well at points with DS Philosophy, and gave really interesting context for the things we'll read in the spring, as well as historical context for our society today.",
    "Yes and no. The fact that this section was at 9 AM did not always make for the most fruitful discussions. The class sometimes lulled.",
    "In general, Directed Studies is a phenomenal program for those who want to trace the evolution of certain ideas in a thorough, but by no means comprehensive survey of the Western canon. The syllabus for H&P is split between two types of readings: historians, like Herodotus and Livy, and political philosophers, like Plato and Aquinas. One of the challenges of the course is drawing connections between the two molds, but the lectures did a good job of providing the necessary context to make discussions rewarding. Professor Thompson runs a tight ship, not imposing on section discussion, but also not letting the class deviate too far from the text. Her comments on papers were exhaustive and insightful, and she often made herself available outside of her office hours for extra help. One caveat about the curriculum: the title \"Historiography and Politics\" would fit better, as our analysis about the historians centered more (but not exclusively) on the method of their historical writing than on the actual events themselves.",
    "Overview course on western political thought.",
    "DS History and Politics is an expansive examination of political theory over the history of Western civilization. The course grounds itself mostly in political thought, rather than \"history\" in the high school sense of the term. Such a course requires both patience and a willingness to closely read large amounts of reading; should one be able to do this, one will find the course highly rewarding. If one puts in the energy, the experienceis highly rewarding, giving students a greater insight into the political ideals of the past and present."
