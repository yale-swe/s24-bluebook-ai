    "Even if one does not intend on being a policy maker, this class is a great overview in the various opinions on what, if anything, needs to be done with our schools. It also sheds light on higher education, even looking at the history of admissions at Yale. No one should not take this class.",
    "Umm...not really. I didn't learn much. But I think I was the only one who felt that way. It's easy, though. A lot of reading.",
    "This was a very laid-back foray into the different schools of thought on how best to provide equal educational opportunity to all American students. We went through four of the five main education policy camps: the libertarians (school vouchers, charterschools), conservatives (back-to-basics education, high expectations for students), liberal (including developmental psychology in education techniques and desegregating schools), and the \"radicals\" (the achievement gap can't be eliminated until the socioeconomic gap is lessened). We didn't discuss the fifth camp, because they just believe there's nothing really wrong with America's education system--it might have been good to discuss these people's views, but not many people are in that group, and we wouldn't be in this class if we thought American education was perfect the way it is anyway! What was interesting is that this year Professor Saxon decided to spend the second half of the semester discussing equity in college admissions, and in that section we read what I thought was the most interesting book of the semester, The Chosen. (No, not the Chaim Potok novel--the book about the history of college admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. It's fascinating.) The midterm paper assignment was not hard, just a 5-page paper about the readings so far, and the final (15-page) paper can be on basically anything you want. Seminar is really relaxed, and we all get to vent about our high school experiences in the context of the week's readings while Professor Saxon tells stories about his time teaching in the New Haven Public Schools or about his grandchildren. Not much work if you don't want it to be. I highly recommend it.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you are interested in American education. Professor Saxon is really friendly and available and will definitely mix in his own stories. One of the best parts of the class was being able to hear perspectives from other Yalies who are equally passionate. The workload isn't bad at all, and the readings are worth doing. Take it!",
    "Seminar taken mostly by students who had immense experience in education so I kind of felt out of place. Overall, glad I took it, though.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class - the readings are excellent, the topics interesting, and Burt is a great prof. Unlike many (all?) Yale seminar instructors, he spent years teaching high schoolers, so he actually knows how to teach and lead a productive discussion. The workload is light, and the papers are enjoyable.",
    "It was a good introduction to education reform. If you care about the future of education in America, then take it.",
    "This is an interesting class for folks who want to learn a bit about the background and history of education reform. However, it doesn't go into great detail about current proposals, or data about student results. The ideological and historical discussions were helpful supplements to what I already knew about the issue, but the in-class discussion was less than stellar. If you care about ed reform, though, at least shop the first day of class, when Prof. Saxon introduces the education reform omega. A great guiding concept for how you analyze ed reform issues.",
    "I fairly easy class grade wise, but it is important to participate in the discussions. The class is entirely discussion based, not very much lecturing, so come prepared to talk.",
    "If you want to figure out what the big fuss is about in public education and secondary education, take this class. It won't give you any answers, only suggestions, but you'll probably leave feeling like something has to be done, and you'll have a better idea of what works, and what doesn't. Standardized testing, charter schools, No Child Left Behind, school reform, national standards, and a whole lot more.",
    "Definitely take the class if you're interested in American education. Prepare to challenge your thinking, definitely do the reading and get ready to hear some fun stories.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Saxon is so caring and creates a fun, laid back environment. The material is interesting and the work load is totally reasonable.",
    "This class is essentially a survey course of major issues in inequality in education, from the elementary to the university level. The topics are wide-ranging but overlapping in many ways, and the class discussions allow for ample examination of connections and analysis of themes.",
    "Good class, light on the reading, but heavily rewarding when you put in the work. Prof. Saxon is well-read on the material, and uses his personal experience in the schooling system to enrich and guide class discussion. Because of the freedom you have to choose the final paper topic and the work you will put into it, this class can be anywhere from a fifth class to a class you use to write your senior thesis. Both enjoyable and intellectually stimulating seminar.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course. The discussions each week are very enjoyable, and people often bring in their personal experiences and educational background to shed light on issues that we are discussions. But there's a flip side of that--there is little time devoted to discussion of the reading. And when 200-300 pages are assigned each week, there's not much incentive to read all (or much) of it when you know the discussion will only center on the reading for the first 40 minutes of the 2-hour seminar. With that in mind, the discussions can be pretty lively, especially if you're interested in education. On the whole: this is a good class as an introduction to a lot of broad topics in the field of education today, with an instructor who definitely knows his stuff. If you're willing to put in the time to do the reading, I think you can get a lot out of it."
