    "Do not take this class, especially unless the instructor changes the course (and his approach to it) significantly. The class will frustrate you every day because there is zero guidance on anything.",
    "Not recommend.",
    "I will recommend this course to any student who has interest in network science because it covers many topics and is very interesting to know and to think in that way.",
    "It is a useful course if you are interested in the research of large network",
    "This is the graduate version of Dan Spielman's \"Graphs and Networks.\" The material is similar (often directly taken from Dan's notes), but the style is different. Everyone's responsible for two long problem sets, a full lecture, and a short (but original) paper based on advanced material. If you're interested in applied mathematics, this is a great course to take. It brings together lin al, probability theory, discrete, CS and more in a very elegant way. The material is very well chosen and equally well motivated. Amin is a good lecturer and is interested in how the students are doing.",
    "It's quite challenging but definitely a good entry point for Network Science. Anyone interested in the theories behind networks is recommended to take it."
