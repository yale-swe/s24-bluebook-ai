    "I would definitely recommend this course, in fact, I would even recommend the entire course sequence. It's a lot of French, but completely worth it!",
    "Obviously you have to take it to get credit for L1. I took the class for fun and I think the class steered me away from ever taking French at Yale ever again. The professor I had was not too encouraging either--he was too focused on grading and ranking us and (therefore) the class became too antsy to create a welcoming environment for learning French."
