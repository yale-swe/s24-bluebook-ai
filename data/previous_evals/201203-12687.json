    "A solid introduction to contemporary Chinese literature. You have to go into the class prepared to learn a lot about late 20th century Chinese society--you won't be able to understand the works very well otherwise--but Professor Su is an entertaining, incredibly dedicated, and understanding professor. My reading comprehension and writing skills improved a lot. Also, for a language course, there isn't too much work.",
    "Amazing class! You will learn a lot about China and your appreciation of Chinese will increase phenomenally. Su laoshi is the man.",
    "You get out of this class what you put in. It is very easy to do no work for this class, and Su laoshi does not make it difficult to get away with this. If you put in enough work, and actually spend time doing the readings, you can get a lot out of this class and you can really learn a ton of him. Only take this if you are willing to do the work!!",
    "I would recommend this if you're an advanced Chinese speaker interested to learn more about contemporary Chinese history, culture, and literature. Grades are fair and it is not too hard to get a good grade.",
    "You should take this class if you'd like a relaxed semester of Chinese language. It is definitely a nice change of pace from the usual discussion on modern Chinese issues. For heritage learners, it can be weighed as more of a .5 credit in terms of workload."
