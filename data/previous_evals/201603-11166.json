    "I learned both ways to view and review film, as well as how the Italian films reflect and fit into the historical contexts in which they were made.",
    "My film-watching will never be the same again- I'll recognize the tropes of Hollywood cinema and now be searching for more enriching cinematic experiences!",
    "I learned to watch and think about film in a completely different way through this course. I am now much more critical about what I see and the way historic discourse is presented through the medium of film. The course covered a fascinating section of Italian history and taught me a lot about European politics.",
    "I learned about Italian cinema, in the context of neorealism, meta-cinema, Fascism revisited, and post-modernism. This class taught me to analyze films through the lens of Italy's historical background and cinematic movements.",
    "I learned a lot about different film and camera techniques, which gave me a whole new window through which I can watch and enjoy movies.",
    "Being able to analyze films and to write critical essays on them",
    "I developed a broad knowledge of Italian film throughout history, while learning how to closely analyse and write about film.",
    "I gained valuable knowledge of the methodology for critically analyzing film, along with exposure to the techniques used in filmmaking. The course also helped teach the vocabulary necessary for discussion of film. Additionally, the course provided insights into Italian culture and history, which were especially interesting to examine through the lens of film. Finally, through the films and Professor Marcus' lectures, the course provided important life lessons.",
    "Analyze films, especially from the aspect of cinematography",
    "The course helped me gain a newfound understanding and appreciation for not only Italian film, but the cinematic medium at large.",
    "This course opened my eyes to a whole history of Italian film and history. I learned about film critique, about important Italian films, and about the role those films played in people's lives.",
    "I got a very comprehensive understanding of the history of Italian Cinema, especially how films from different periods reflect on and influence one another, which I appreciated since this is not something one traditionally sees as much of in more generally-focused film survey courses. I became familiar with several different genres and recurring themes in Italian Cinema, especially neorealism, and learned to identify the way different films fit into or deviated from these categories.",
    "I'm not a movies\/film guy, and I never thought that I would care for film. This course changed that about me, and I'm extremely happy that it did. This course invites you to learn and eventually appreciate the tremendous effort that Italian directors, and by extension movie directors as a whole, give in constructing their movies. The details all matter; directors do what they do as a labor of love, and now, I'm far more likely to actually pay attention to films for their artistic value.",
    "!A: READ this. IMPRESSION: BEST WR credit at Yale, probably also one of my favorite courses. Advice: the first class of the semester did not sell this class enough. Glad I stuck with this. Marcus should consider making a preview reel and pick 1 scene from each 14 films of semester and play that on the screen during shopping period. Jumping into technical history immediately is not advisable. THE FILMS: Loved almost all; however perhaps a different fellini? Ive rewatched 8 1\/2 and I think its too complicated and existential to analyze in one class. Also maybe a different Sorrentino film. Also, what about rosy realism? We did not have a film exploring that. THE STRUCTURE: could not be any better. Having section would be overkill. Im worried about next year since the demand will be huge and they *cannot* turn this into a lecture. THE STUDENTS: eclectic mix of freshmen, asian computer science majors, and film studies people. Unique perspectives. THE WORKLOAD: papers paced out nicely. Wednesday film screening is optional and you can always watch online or in film center. THE PAPERS: liked writing these however I wish more than just one could explore a SINGLE film instead of comparative. THE FINAL: was extremely fair and enjoyable to synthesize everything. THE PROFESSOR: I loved her so much. It would be interesting to hear more about her scholarship and in general film theory and how academics have analyzed the films we discuss in class. That would be my advice to her.",
    "The class gave me an in-depth introduction into modern Italian history and film in Italy",
    "I learned an appreciation for the aesthetics, language, and history of Italian film."

   "comments": [
    "The professor was super nice and accessible, and had a lot of really intelligent things to say in the course. I suppose in terms of how things could be improved would just be making essay topics and exam material clearer beforehand, especially for the exam as this is a course where a lot of miscellaneous material is covered and it is unclear what is the most pertinent information.",
    "classes on tuesday weren't very engaging or helpful compared to film analysis on thursday, also i felt that class could be cut down to 50 minutes in general",
    "The course gives good historical context to the films and their directors- some of the more complex historical films such as Il Divo could have used a little more prefacing.",
    "The course was fun and the discussion was engaging, but there was no incentive to do the readings, as no papers required any external sources and the final exam did not reference them either.",
    "Professor Marcus was really engaging and enthusiastic about the topic, which made the subject all the more captivating. The TAs and the professor were also really helpful in discussing our essays with us. The structure of the class, giving a good introduction to the historical context on Tuesdays, an enjoyable communal screening on Wednesdays, and an in-depth analysis of the film on Thursdays, was very comprehensive and enjoyable!",
    "Strengths: Discussion based and encourages students to engage and share their opinions and thoughts in a very creative environment. Weaknesses: None.",
    "The strengths of this course are the incredible variety of films which is shown and the enthusiastic teaching of Professor Marcus. At times, the lectures could be slightly dry, but other than that it was a wonderful course.",
    "Professor Marcus is wonderful. The discussion format is effective and it's nice to get everyone involved in this course.",
    "The course's greatest strength is Professor Marcus, who put in a lot of effort to make the course great. Another strength of this course was its ability to engage students with no experience in film as well as students who are film studies majors. Finally, the course is very successful in familiarizing students with the iconic films and cultural phenomena of postwar Italy, condensing half a century of film into a semester. One way to improve the course might be to provide a bit more time for students to write essays, because the time between the pre-writing session and due date was often somewhat short.",
    "Wonderful professor and content! My only concern is that TA grading seemed pretty varied, perhaps if we were given a rubric to know the standards would be held at, that would've been helpful.",
    "I think that the selection of films was fantastic and the lectures were definitely engaging. I especially appreciated how interactive the lectures were. Since I know that I (along with some of my fellow classmates) occasionally disagreed with some of the points made in the lecture, it would be great if there could be some kind of discussion section component, or at least if students had more of an opportunity to discuss back and forth on certain questions (i.e. whether \"A Special Day\" should be classified as a love story).",
    "No weaknesses. The largest strength of this class was indeed the incredibly talented and well-informed Professor Marcus. I could listen to her lecture about Italian Film for hours; she knows soooo much!",

    "The strengths of this class are its interesting subject material, and a passionate and engaged professor",
    "The greatest strength of the course is, in my opinion, the forced, weekly consumption of art. It makes life so much better when you are forced to sit down once a week with something that is intellectually gritty. Prof. Marcus's approach, which was to have no phones, a darkened room with a big screen, comfortable chairs, and reverential silence, enhanced this experience immensely.",
    "Strengths: AMAZING selection of films, every single one is a banger Weaknesses: Lectures are dry, boring and long; final is ridiculously long"

    "Yes it was great.",
    "Fantastic course. Professor Marcus's passion for the material is infectious. You watch a bunch of beautiful films you probably wouldn't see otherwise and the in-class analysis is always interesting. Sometimes it feels like you're over-analyzing the films, though, and that can get annoying. You write 4 five page papers and take a final and that's it. There are minimal readings and they can be interesting but you truly do not have to do them at all. You basically just go to class, watch the films, and pump out the papers. Workload is super manageable, and the class really is great and you will never look at films the same way after taking it. Highly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course- the teacher is engaging, the material is interesting, and the workload is manageable!",
    "Phenomenal course. Professor Marcus is an exemplary human being and teacher. Her passion for the course material is enlightening and her dedication to the subject is admirable. Both a pleasure and privilege to have taken her class.",
    "Yes, Prof Marcus is a great lecturer and the content you learn about is interesting as well!",
    "A wonderful and relaxed writing credit, giving you insight into both modern Italian history and filmmaking techniques. The teaching staff are very supportive and the films are diverse, which will open your eyes to a variety of styles unlike popular Hollywood movies.",
    "I'd recommend this class, it's a reasonable writing credit, on an really enjoyable topic. Professor Marcus is so nice and enthusiastic that she makes every lecture worth going to. You don't need to be a film major or know Italian, and the class is very well structured.",
    "Italian Film is a great class to take even if you have no experience in film at all. You'll learn how to analyze films and think critically about them. There are 4 papers and a final. The papers are pretty open-topic and are a great way to demonstrate how you thought of the movies you are discussing. The final is an overall assessment of the general themes that you will cover throughout the class. Overall, a very solid class and a writing credit, Professor Marcus is very engaging and cares a lot about her students. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes, take it if you haven't taken any film studies classes yet",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student with an interest in film. I went in with absolutely no knowledge of Italian film and left with a comprehensive idea of some of the great films and directors, and a desire to learn more.",
    "A must take. This course is excellent and professor Marcus learns everyone's name and makes a point to personally meet every student. It's a great course to take even with no film or Italian background and is a highly enjoyable WR with a low workload.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has at least a bit of background in film and who is interested in studying Italian film. The course analyzes some of the most important Italian films and directors, and it puts them in their historical and cultural context. The course also provides individualized help with writing, as students met with the professor or a TA for a pre-writing sessions before each of the essays.",
    "Incredible class! By the end of the course, you'll gain a newfound appreciation for Italian films. Make sure you take a class with Professor Marcus before graduating.",
    "Fantastic course, thanks to a fantastic professor. Professor Marcus is incredibly passionate about Italian Film, which is contagious from her lectures. As a STEM major, I've neither taken a film nor Italian class before, yet Professor Marcus made the material very accessible. The workload wasn't too heavy- there are four five page essays and a final. You may spend a little more time in class, as there are two lectures and a 3 hour film screening every week, but it's absolutely worth it (and if you can't make the film screening, you can also watch the film on your own time).",
    "This was a really excellent course. Professor Marcus really cares about Italian Film and you learn more than you can picture learning in a semester, particularly since you cover films spanning over 50 years. The workload isn't too extreme - four 5 page papers plus a final exam, and the movies you watch are almost all excellent. No background in Italian (or even film) is needed.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course",
    "Take it for the films if you take it at all--Professor Marcus is, frankly, very nice but more interested in intellectual masturbation than in the films. The movies are used to explore the philosophy rather than the other way around. She also has an annoying bent against so-called 'low-brow hollywood film' as if America is only just catching up to the brooding Genius of Europe.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially anyone unfamiliar with Italian Cinema, because it's a great way to get a sense of the history of Italian film as a whole. The lectures were engaging and surprisingly interactive and the selection of films was fantastic.",
    "Do yourself a favor and at the very least, shop a lecture. You'll be blown away. :)",

    "I would recommend this course to another student. Many of the films are fantastic, and even more interesting when supplemented with knowledge about Italian film, culture and history. Professor Marcus does a fantastic job of describing important trends that need to be taken in context with the film.",
    "If you want to watch amazing Italian art films and learn a little theory while you do it take the class; lecture is a little annoying since participation is still a component; for film majors comments are a little tedious since the class is open to everyone"
