   "comments": [
    "If you're going to take French 150 take it with Mme. Burton. The class itself is not that difficult as long as you do all the work.",
    "Great class. Intense with a lot of work, but you improve a lot. Its a good mixture of writing, speaking and grammar.",
    "I would recommend French 150 to another student. It doesn't seem that different from 140, but it keeps you comfortable with the language in a slightly more enjoyable and hassle-free way.",
    "FREN 150 is a great course if you want to really practise using French. There is alot of opportunity for discussion and you speak alot in this class. The workload is heavy, but not any worse than any other language course.",
    "I would recommend French 150 to a fellow student. It's a great mix of writing, speaking, and grammar practice. It is time consuming, but it is a great way to become more fluent in French. It would be a good class for someone who is interested in reviewing grammar and working on writing and speaking about French films and movies.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student if they hope to drastically improve their French speaking abilities and comprehension of the French language. There is quite a bit of nightly homework and reading, that at times it can seem a bit tedious. Yet, overall this course does not disappoint."
