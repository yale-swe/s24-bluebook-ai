   "comments": [
    "I would recommend MCDB 109 to another student. I found that this course furthered my understanding of my immune system, and I think that this course is extremely important for students to take. I am not a science major, and I found the work load very manageable, and the course material very doable.",
    "If you need a science credit, I cannot more highly recommend this course. Only one test, easy problem sets, and a final paper\/presentation. The subject matter is also so interesting, so definitely take this over Issues Approach!",
    "I would recommend the course for someone looking for a somewhat easier science credit, but the course is definitely not a gut.",
    "Absolutely take this course, particularly if you're a non-STEM student looking for a non-blowoff yet non-impossible Science credit. The course is challenging; the content is largely new to all students. The first 3\/4 is very, very heavy in bio, don't be fooled; the course reminds more of AP Biology than of a humanities course. With that said, though, the class is very much geared toward non-STEM students. Really fun trips to the YUAG and the Medical School help a lot, and give great insights into the field beyond the pages of the textbook. Paula is an absolutely wonderful, wonderful woman. Wicked smart, incredibly kind, vastly knowledgable and experienced. She's your biggest friend and advocate in the course. Yale is lucky to have her. But, again, don't be fooled into thinking this is a gut. It's not at all, really, besides the Science-credit-for-non-STEM-students crowd. The midterm was pretty hard, the weekly PSets are graded a little harshly, and the workload is more than any gut I've heard of. But, again, the class is enjoyable enough to balance these complaints out. I truly did learn an enormous amount, more than I can say about easier courses.",
    "Immunity and contagion is a really good class if you're a nonscience student looking for a science credit. Fair warning: the first half of the class and the midterm can be very detail-oriented, and if you're like me, you'll think it's super boring and won't understand anything for a while. But it is necessary material for understanding the immune system and for the rest of the class. After the midterm the class becomes much more focused on public health and learning about famous diseases, which makes it a lot more engaging and by the end of the course I really enjoyed it. It's got a fair amount of work, so definitely wouldn't say it's a gut, but everything is manageable.",
    "Yes this is a great class for your science credit you will actually benefit from and enjoy.",
    "If you're taking this course coming from a weakish science background, seek help from TA\/Professor Kavathas immediately. You'll enjoy the course much more if you do.",
    "Take it if you are interested in public health because the discussion session centered on this topic instead of pure science. The lecture is clear but it is a bit boring to me.",
    "This is a relatively easy science credit, especially since there is only one midterm (which is really easy if you study decently enough for it) and the research paper at the end is low-stress and she gives you a lot of time for it. The research paper is also on something that you find interesting, so it is not forced work, but rather enjoyable. There is a lot of reading and we read full novels in the class, but those readings went by really quickly. Keep in mind that when I say reading, it means compared to what I would have expected a science course to entail. But these readings are novels, and not scientific research papers, which reduces the boredom-worthiness of each piece significantly. The content is not very hard to follow, especially if you've had any kind of AP bio knowledge in the past. It has been 3 years since I took AP bio, but I still recognized concepts from bio in this class. Also Professor Kavathas is an amazing person and so helpful that I doubt that you will not enjoy the course.",
    "The course is well-taught and fascinating -- a perfect mix for non-science majors seeking to get a taste of what the subject has to offer.",
    "This is a great class for a non-science major. Theres some Biology info, but its not too technical and theres also a big focus on public-health issues. Prof Kavathas is a very good lecturer -- clear, engaging, etc. This class will not blow your mind or change your life, but its a good class nonetheless. Structure of the course: bi-weekly lectures + 1 section meeting. Very little reading outside of class, although you do read a few books about public-health-type issues which are really soft-on-the-science and mostly kind of human-interest type books. Weekly P-sets on the lecture material and the readings. 1 midterm which is fairly easy and 1 final 6pg paper + 10 min oral presentation on a topic of your choice. A good course, not quite a gut, but almost. Don't buy or rent the textbook. You won't need it at all. Total waste of $$$.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with the caveat that it truly is a science course intended for non-science majors. I am in disagreement with this policy in general - just because I am not a science major doesn't mean that I can't handle more challenging material, as long as it is well taught. Overall, however, it was a positive experience.",
    "take the course it's a good intro to immunology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student because it is usable biology for the average Yalie. You don't need an extensive bio background (or any bio background at all) to be successful and walk away knowledgable of the immune system. It is undeniably very interesting and an awesome way to get in some science without being a pre-med student.",
    "Not too hard, really useful an informative. Great for non-science majors",
    "This is the PERFECT science credit for humanities majors. The material is really interesting and the pace is slow enough that you can actually digest it all before the midterm. It's not a gut, but the workload is very manageable even in an otherwise demanding semester. The midterm is fine if you've kept up with the lectures, and there's a short final paper instead of a final exam. If you're looking for a manageable science credit but don't want to waste your time in a gut that won't teach you anything, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "If you are a non-science major and need a science credit you MUST take this class. It is incredibly interesting and supportive and one of Yale's hidden gems.",
    "A really interesting class. Hard work to understand if you don't have a good background in biology and the immune system, but very interesting to learn. Assignments aren't bad",
    "It was fine, it spent too much time talking about random chemicals that we'd just have to memorize instead of teaching us more conceptual frameworks which would have been more useful",
    "If you're not particularly interested into the sciences, this class is still a pretty great class to take since it definitely deals with biology in the way that it most affects you and your body. The material is straightforward, and so it wasn't particularly hard to understand even the more complex processes that take place within the body. Definitely take the course!",
    "Great course. A good option for a science credit for non-science majors and can very well organized. Would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow non-science major looking for a science credit. It was not a gut, but the workload was never overwhelming. Likewise, while the content of the class did involve a lot of hard science, it was never too complex for a non-science student to understand.",
    "Wonderful course. This class really made immunology and microbiology accessible to me as a non-science major. The classes were structured effectively and did a great job of communicating complex science material in a clear manner. Professor Kavathas is an extremely dedicated and kind instructor, and she went above and beyond to make her class interesting, accessible, and relevant to non-science fields. It is important to note that, while this class is geared towards non-STEM majors, it is not a gut. You do learn substantial microbiology and are expected to do a decent amount of reading and studying for this course. Overall, I'm very happy that I completed this for my science credit. Highly recommend.",
    "i found it a bit dull. Prof Kavathas and the TFs were excellent and made a huge effort to make the class engaging, it was perhaps my most interactive and engaging class at yale. but i'm not interested in science at all so despite their efforts, i did not find the class interesting",
    "Definitely a good science course to take if you are interested in the topic",
    "Great science for non-science majors, especially for those with an interest in public\/global health. Interesting and relevant topics."
