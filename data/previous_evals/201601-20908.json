    "Introduction to Digital Video is a great class, and Sarah is an amazing teacher. The workload is pretty light and the material is super interesting. My only complaint is that we only made 4 videos over the course of the semester, so I didn't feel like I had as much time to explore and watch my style evolve as I would have liked.",
    "Perfect blend of structure to learn and freedom to create art meaningful to yourself",
    "AMAZING take this class! Sarah is a phenomenal, phenomenal teacher, and we learned so much about the art of digital video. With four diverse and exciting projects, I left this class with technical and creative growth. I navigate Final Cut easily, but more importantly have moved my own creative practice in a really exciting new direction. Expect to work hard, expect to laugh a lot, and expect to leave the semester with a really fabulous start to your filmmaking practice.",
    "You learn how to make good videos, and in the process challenge your notions of what visual art can be, if that hasn't been on your mind already.",
    "This class is awesome! Sarah is so kind and willing to help you be the best that you can be\/say what you want to say. The class caters to beginning, intermediate, and advanced filmmakers. Take it if you can.",
    "Yes definitely! It's a great class, even if you're not an art major. Everything is introductory and moves at a pace that most people are comfortable with and the content is engaging and accessible for most. Plus the assignments are engaging and very open-ended and really allow you to explore and bring your interest in different disciplines into your work.",
    "Opportunity to make 4 videos. They can be as structured or as abstract as you'd like. TONS to learn about different aspects of filmmaking. Obv you start with camera workshops, but then you learn about editing, lighting, and the coolest thing of all time...green screen. You can explore your voice narratively or use the class to refine your skill with the different types of tech. The classes are cycles of lectures w screenings, workshops, and critiques of each others work. Highly recommend to everyone who's looking to break out creatively or improve upon some skill they already have. If Sarah's not the teacher, I'm so sorry for you."
