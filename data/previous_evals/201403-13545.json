   "comments": [
    "This is FAR from an easy course. Don't take this expecting an easy going science credit. Yes, there are only 4 p-sets, but I can tell you, even with TF help, they are a massive commitment. The exams are very fairly graded, but I feel the style of the exams is a bit much. There's way too much information we need to memorize, but we're only tested on a tiny fraction of it, selected at random. It's not very good for retaining info, as I've nearly forgotten the first half of the semester. Again, this is just my experience. The class is very informative, however, and would totally recommend it for a credit-d-fail. It's really interesting and the lectures are good, but if you're looking for an easy credit, or a credit applicable to a non-geology major...steer clear. This class WILL challenge you.",
    "G&G 110 is a good intro geology course. If you want a basic overview of all geological processes, it is a good fit. If you are looking for a more in depth treatment or are only interested in one particular area of geology, I would recommend taking a more specific class. That being said, I'm very happy I took it and I feel as though I learned a lot.",
    "Boring. Not really a gut as it requires a lot of memorizing. Problem sets have 0 applicability to the material learned in class. It was really just so boring. Plate tectonics was ok but earth history was a real snooze.",
    "This class covers a lot of material because it is an intro class. The book has about 20 chapters, and it is essential that students keep up with the reading every week, which is about 1-3 chapters per week, depending on the week. Some of the material was interesting, but other topics were conceptually difficult. There are 4 problem sets throughout the semester. In addition, students are given ~ 50 potential exam questions before each exam with brief summaries, but students have to find answers for the elaboration aspect of each question to get full credit. This is a lot of work, and memorizing the answers afterwards is also difficult depending on how well one can memorize or synthesize material.",
    "I would recommend this class as a science for non-science majors (like myself) or anyone interested in geology. The problem sets are easy and infrequent and you can learn just as much from the book as from the class. The midterm and final require A LOT of studying but the professors are generally pretty great and want to help you pass.",
    "Pretty good intro to geology. The first half is focussed on the processes that create rocks, and the second half is focussed on more macro earth-processes. The exams are very silly though, with the profs providing you with roughly 50 questions for each half of the course (ranging from as easy as \"what is geology\" to \"list and discuss the different silicate chain formations and how they influence mineral properties\") and then choosing the questions by rolling dice (there doesn't appear to be any higher weight given to more fundamental questions). Don't choose this class if you don't like to cram",
    "I don't really know how I feel about this class. Just be warned if you take it that you will not only learn about cool geologic processes like tectonics, energy, and climate, but you will also be responsible for the details of rock minerals and rock formation, the many different kinds of drainage systems, glacial processes, drainage systems, etc. It is truly a survey course, for better or for worse. You could probably find a better science credit (that is not three days a week and not in KGL) if that's what you need, and you could probably find a more interestingly taught science class if you're looking to branch out. But, other than 4 problem sets, a midterm, and a final, it's not a lot of work, so that's a plus! By the end, I definitely would say that I learned a lot, but I didn't have that satisfying feeling of learning throughout most of the course. I guess it depends on what you're looking for!",
    "You read the book and hear the information reiterated in the lectures. The material builds up until we have the midterm or the final. There are a couple of homework assignments scattered throughout the semester but with generous due dates that make them entirely manageable.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. You will not regret knowing about how the earth works as Dave and Danny will give you a much better appreciation for the amazing, dynamic mass upon which we live. Dave is the greatest professor at Yale, and Danny is one of the most caring--you can't go wrong with a duo like that. There is a lot of information to be covered, but you'll be so excited about what you're learning that you won't mind studying for tests. This class gives you practical information that will change the way you view the world around you. Also, take the lab--you get to go on adventures disguised as lab classes (which include October break in the New England section of the Appalachians).",
    "You can take the class, but you have to be ready to clear space in your mind for the great amount of work you have to know. It's not hard, though. And its a little confusing, especially the homework pests from Google Earth.",
    "If you're interested in natural geography, geology, and climate change, this is a great introductory class."
