   "comments": [
    "I would heartily recommend it to another student-- it's the best! Though the exams can be a bit hard, if you took it Credit\/D\/Fail, it would be a delightful course.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class, even if you've never taken a science course at Yale, even if you've taken many. It's evolutionary biology through the lens of the fish world, and there are so many fish and so many different kinds. It's hard for it not to be fascinating.",
    "Ichthyology is a great lecture for either science or nonscience majors. I recommend it to everyone.",
    "Pretty good course. Probably really good if you're super into fish or E&EB",
    "Overview of more fishes than you ever thought existed---probably more than you care to know, but great cocktail party tidbits! And plenty of evolution biology discussions to keep it intellectually stimulating without being too challenging.",
    "It's interesting, but a little disorganized. The lectures sometimes bounce back and forth between topics. Also, some of the slides directly contradict each other (i.e. number of species, which living teleost is the largest). Professor Near is really really nice and helpful. Just a midterm, final, and 10pg paper.",
    "I hesitate to tell everyone to take this class. I was not blown away by this class like I expected to be. I decided to take the class because I love going to aquariums and I love SCUBA diving. I thought that taking a class about fish would make both experiences more meaningful. The class definitely did add meaning to these experiences. However, when I enrolled in Ichthyology, I believed that the class would be roughly akin to watching a semester-long nature documentary.In reality, the class was much, much grittier. A great deal of time is spent on phylogenetic relationships between families of fish, rather than the fish families themselves, which disappointed me. Lectures were often boring and meaningless, and the information didn't come together for me until I started studying for the exams.That said, the amount of information that you learn in this class is truly staggering, and there are enough miscellaneous details to make you seem more interesting at awkward Christmas parties over break.If you are really interested in evolution, then take this class. If you are really interested in fish, then shop it, but you may not necessarily want to take it. If you are not interested in fish and just want the class because you think it'll be an easy science credit, don't take it.If you take it, start studying a couple days before the exams.",
    "Take this course! Interesting and manageable. Although be aware that a lot of the course is about phylogeny so if you are not interested at all in phylogeny, another course may be better.",
    "TAKE IT. This is a great class period, and a great class to get a science requirement. You have a midterm and a final (which require a lot of memorizing but are totally manageable) and write a 10-12 page paper on any topic you want. And Professor Near wants you to approach fish from whatever angle you want in the paper, so history or english or anthropology...really whatever. It makes the paper really fun.The main reason to take the class is Professor Near. He's fantastic. He brings energy and passion to a subject that is unfamiliar to many. His enthusiasm is infectious and he's incredibly approachable. You'll leave this class knowing a ton more about fish than you ever thought you would. And it's awesome.",
    "If you are looking into this class, likely you are interested in an entry-level science credit, or are just extremely interested in fish. Either way, the class is a god pick. The science is approachable and interesting, and the fish facts are nonstop. Though a lot of information is involved, your assimilation of that information into broader movements is what is ultimately tested.",
    "Take this class. Awesome professor, awesome TAs, great and interesting material, well worth it. Also take the lab if you can, it's easy and very informative!",
    "You learn everything about fish--from what, precisely, a \"fish\" is to what characterizes certain types of fish to how certain fish mate to where the anus is located on certain types of fish.I would absolutely recommend this course: Professor Near is an incredible and generous lecturer. He makes it all very amusing and accessible.",
    "If you like fish and think they're cool, take it. It was a great class for my science requirement.",
    "Take it!Teacher is amazing, he is really engaging, challenges you to challenge him, and a really interesting course overall",
    "A relatively simple lab. I recommend students taking it to revise their fish species at the end of every fortnight or so, so the last exam doesn't get too gruelling.",
    "Ichthyology is great. If you're an E&EB major (or a science person), take this."
