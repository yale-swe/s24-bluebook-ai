    "I would not recommend this class as it is taught now. This was the first time it was offered, and this clearly was a trial run. However if the class size is smaller, there are more lectures on the part of the instructors, and if every session does not feel like browsing through Wikipedia, then yes.",
    "an ambitious class that attempts to cover a lot of materials from all over the world in the late European medieval period (800-1200). would have appreciated if the course made it clear in the beginning whether its objective is to 1) study different regions comparatively or connectedly, 2) emphasize the temporal aspect of ca. 1000 -- that something special, did in fact happen around this time",
    "This class is so different that it is sometimes difficult to articulate to others. It sounds very good in theory, but occasionally fell sort in practice. While I would recommend it to others, I'd caution them. On the one hand, this class can be frustrating and uncomfortable, but I think the course is designed to get students out of their comfort zone and areal foci. On the other hand, it is this discomfort that allowed me to appreciate other areas of study.",
    "I would summarize this class as a \"Mosaic of the Year 1000: as examined from the West, the East, and the Americas.\" I would recommend this course to any student wishing to broaden their horizons in a cross-cultural scope. If one is concerned with contemporary issues it may be useful in understanding the roots of those issues but will certainly not give one a concrete answer as to why those issues exist now. I would not recommend it to any graduate student outside of the humanities or social sciences because of the content matter and tempo of the class. It is fast and I believe that most of us were able to keep up because we had a deep knowledge of our own areas for comparison",
    "I would recommend it with the warning that there will be a lot of group projects because that's not everyone's cup of tea. Also the warning that it's going to be a bit disjointed.",
    "Yes, I strongly recommend this course! It is a lot of work, but is also fun and endlessly inspiring.",
    "HIST 800 is an exploration of the world around the year 1000. It is an ambitious attempt to bring together disciplines and fields of study through a series of activities, lectures, and class discussions and presentations. It would be excellent for anyone seeking to broaden their knowledge of the context of their own work."

   "comments": [
    "i loved the assignments -- coming up with bibliography for both inside and outside fields, coming up with a syllabus, writing a book review, exhibition, weekly handouts\/presentations. they helped with learning necessary skills to research and teach. having the interdisciplinary focus also helped with understanding the disciplinary boundaries.",
    "This course deepened the breadth of my knowledge of the world in general. The commonalities and differences that became evident between and among the cultures of the world in history has been enriched as a result of this course. Beyond the knowledge I gained about my specific geographic region I do not it will contribute directly to my dissertation research but it has better prepared me to make comparisons about different cultures which is ultimately important in my discipline and for teaching in the future.",
    "This course functions as an excellent complement to a 'traditional' program in history, both in terms of general knowledge and of methodological approaches."
