   "comments": [
    "This course was above all incredible. It more than achieved its goal of providing an overarching view of the most recent work on political violence, the gaps in that work and the field as a whole, as well as discussion of the interdisciplinary nature of the work. I learned a ton about political violence, reconsidered my stance on humanitarian interventions, and, more importantly, shored up my understanding of the complex nest of factors that contributes to political conflicts around the world.",
    "Phenomenal class. Learned so much about the discipline of political science and new approaches to political violence. It also gives you a lot of research design experience. It taught me how to engage critically with political science research.",
    "On top of an introduction to diverse aspects of political violence, I came out with a stronger sense of how to think about research design in political\/social science.",
    "This course gave me a quantum surge in my understanding of experimental design within political science; simply phenomenal. The course was also well-designed in its approach to different motifs within the macro political violence field.",
    "Most fundamentally I learned how to both critically evaluate political violence research and how to craft my own research design in the field. The workshop format of the class leant itself excellently to examinations of cutting-edge political science topics but the class did not flinch from, and indeed encouraged students to take aim at these papers and expose their flaws or shortcomings. This helped me to become a better consumer of research and to learn that even the most comprehensive works have limitations and areas for further investigation.",
    "This course is well-designed for students' learning and their own research. Substantively and methodologically, I learned a lot about political violence."

   "comments": [
    "This course was incredible. I only wish we'd had more time",
    "One of the best classes I have ever take. Fascinating selection of texts and prof. Lyall is a wonderful instructor and mentor. Its so great to see how readings from diverse fields fit together, Ive the course of a discussion. Has been one of the factors convincing me to go to grad school for political science.",
    "See comments below.",
    "Strengths: o The readings were excellent at portraying contending perspectives and hypotheses for understanding the drivers of political violence in different contexts. o Instructor classroom facilitation: the instructor was excellent at prompting student deliberation and discussion, and was able to allow us to work through a paper's argument and design without unduly influencing us to come to his own conclusions. o Student engagement: the idea of assigning a student to provide an executive summary of the readings at the start of class was excellent and really helped facilitate follow-on discussions. Weaknesses: o Honestly, can't think of any",
    "A strength of this course was the discussion-based format which allowed for free-flowing conversation and debate over the readings presented. The readings themselves and our precise, investigative focus on them was also a great part of this course and one thing which made it particularly rewarding for me. One area I would like to see improved upon was the time, as class often ended before we had discussed all the readings. A longer seminar may be an improvement going forward.",
    "This course is very enriching because every set of opinions from students and the instructor was unique and informative."

    "10\/10, but you won't get to take it because Lyall won't be here",
    "100% such a shame that prof. Lyall is leaving.",
    "Yes. Great survey of various manifestations of political violence.",
    "Absolutely. Interest in political violence is a requisite, but given that, any student would benefit from this course's approach to studying experimental design through exploration of political violence in different contexts and frames.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if it were to be taught again.",
    "This was a good class - sad to see Prof Lyall is leaving.",
    "Yes, because you can actually develop your own research with very helpful comments and intellectual challenges within class."
