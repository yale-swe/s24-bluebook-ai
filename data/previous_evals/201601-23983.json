   "comments": [
    "Kind of a mess at times, but Jaynes had such fascinating stories to share about his experiences with educational policy.",
    "No. I barely learned anything and it was a waste of time.",
    "Take the course, it's not tough and it's super interesting. You get to interact with local high schools and see how they operate, which was very surprising for the most part and very simple as well.",
    "In a few years time this might be a really great course once the partnerships with the different schools are better established and the structure of the syllabus is ironed out. As it is right now, I would not recommend it to other students.",
    "A good course that is definitely what you put in is what you get out.",
    "Below average class - didn't learn much",
    "Very poorly thought out class. Would not recommend to another student because it had absolutely no structure and I learned very little. Pretty much no work, but also pretty much nothing learned.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking ECON 171. It is a very interesting class and I wish every student at Yale was required to take a class that exposed century-old biases and challenges an average American faces daily. ECON 171 is a mixture of fascinating readings, eye-opening lectures, and a hands-on experience at New Haven high schools which I found invaluable.",
    "Intro level course to education studies.",
    "This is an extremely low-key class -- while Prof Jaynes tells fascinating stories from his own experience and expertise, most of class-time is dedicated to working on group projects that are very open-ended. The class is really what you make of it.",
    "A very fun, rewarding course. I enjoyed being able to help design an SAT prep course to install in the New Haven schools. The lectures after the SAT prep course ended on education policy were very general, but I enjoyed Professor Jaynes's anecdotes. It was a little scary not knowing how I was going to be graded, but it all turned out ok. Also, you may not get very much out of the lectures and it is pretty difficult to get into the course.",
    "Very low work, but interesting class if it's organized properly.",
    "Pretty interesting experiment with half the semester spent teaching an SAT prep course in a New Haven High School. Lecture isn't that informative for those already familiar with a little bit of education\/econ. Could be a great intro course for somebody wanting to get their toes wet.",
    "Highly disorganized. I would not recommend this course at all if you value consistency, organization, and stability.",
    "This class is a review of many of the issues that create inequalities in the educational system. It looks at many of these issues from an economic perspective, but also tries to give students a hands on understanding of these issues by devoting a large part of the class to teaching an SAT prep course in a nearby high school. The course was often disorganized, but it could have been an excellent experience if expectations were clarified and the standard for day-to-day preparation were raised.",
    "The course holds enormous potential. Education states that we learn better when we teach. Creating a SAT course and TEACHING it was one of the best experiences I've had at Yale. That being said, Jaynes is a little scrambled and disorganized (it was his first year teaching the course though). Work load was low, except for when you are creating the curriculum.",
    "This was the first year the course was offered, so it was a little disorganized. It was fun to get practical experience with educational administration and teaching as well as to learn a bit about the history of educational inequality. There was a lot of downtime though.",
    "As the course stands now (after its inaugural year), I would not recommend taking it. The first half of the semester entailed us launching headfirst into preparing an SAT prep course for New Haven high schoolers that we hadn't really learned how to prepare (i.e. spend time learning first and then applying lessons learned in lecture to the prep course) and then implementing it in a pretty unorganized way, and the second half of the semester involved a series of lectures that didn't really have a clear thematic structure or purpose. I don't want to be too critical of this course because I was, in truth, part of the \"guinea pig\" class. This course has a lot of potential, but just needs a stronger, more cohesive curriculum that is introduced at least in part before we are expected to do anything hands-on like an SAT prep course."
