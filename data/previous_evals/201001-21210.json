    "I would definitely recommend this course to others whose main research interest is IR or not. It is a good course for both of them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow MA student.",
    "I loved it. I'd absolutely recommend it. It's heavily theoretical but Nuno did a great job of simplifying the concepts and putting them in their historical context. I'd definitely suggest it for someone interested in IR theory, but I'd also suggest it for someone interested in branching out into that field - it's pretty tough going without a theory background at first but I think anyone could settle into the course and really enjoy it.",
    "I think that it should be a required course for anyone in the PhD program, and some version of it should also be required for the IR MA program. I loved the course, though I can't say that it is the type of material that everyone enjoys. Those disdainful of philosophy or uninterested in the theoretical aspects of IR scholarship would likely not love this class, though I could imagine it producing some converts.",
    "I think anyone in the PhD programs should take this course. I think it should be mandatory for all first semester graduate students."

    "It helped me get interested in IR in general.",
    "Even though I didn't necessarily need the background in theory for my future career, I definitely gained important critical thinking skills from this course.",
    "I took a course that included a lot of IR theory last semester but this one definitely gave me a much stronger understanding of the history of the theoretical discussion in the field. Great class.",
    "This course should be obligatory for those seeking to understand the sub-discipline of IR and the discipline of political science."
