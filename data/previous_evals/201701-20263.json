   "comments": [
    "Critical Race Theory was a phenomenal course that I thoroughly enjoyed. I came into the class not knowing anything about critical race theory, and it ended up being very different from what I had expected. It isn't a standard civil rights course, nor is it a typical legal theory class. It is definitely a kind of its own, and I enjoyed every seminar. The class challenges our preconceived notions, biases of various kinds, and welcomes everyone to share their experiences and relationship to the course material.",
    "CRT broadened my analysis of racial systems by pushing me to think about how they are constantly evolving while the underlying white supremacist structure remains the same.",
    "Not only did this class sharpen my critical thinking and writing skills, but it also equipped me with a wide range of frameworks and tools to advance social justice. Every single text assigned for this class was incredibly helpful and directly relevant to my life. And every seminar discussion deeply enlightened and challenged me in very productive ways. I feel like I have become significantly more intelligent after taking this course.",
    "This course provides an in-depth engagement with Critical Race Theory, a fascinating and incredibly important discipline for academics and action, all emphasized through the skill and craft of storytelling.",
    "This course teaches what Critical Race Theory is, how counter narratives function and the negotiations and interest convergences that have created the state if race relations in the US and in institutions.",
    "Critical Race Theory gave me an understanding of the this radical discipline within legal scholarship and the power of story telling when communicating stories about race. I also learned how my own experiences with race fit into a larger conversation about the relationship between race and culture and the breaking of the black-white binary. Overall, I was able to explore issues of colorblindness, racial realism, the property nature of whiteness, and the challenges between reformist and revolutionary schools of thought within movements for racial reform.",
    "This course taught me how to be a much more thoughtful and nuanced student\/activist\/human being when it comes to studying race in our world and responding to the current call to action.",
    "This class is a must in the list of \"decolonizing your mind\" classes at Yale. It will teach you about the law, about activism, about creativity, about truth, about stories, about contradictions, about empowerment, and about life. You will not take CRT and come out unchanged.",
    "I cannot begin to list all I've learned in this course. \"Learning\" just doesn't cut it. I was made to better understand what my positionality in the world means, what it means to take responsibility for the history that precedes you, and claim autonomy for your decisions going forward. I came to understand not only what \"solidarity\" should look like, but what it DOES look like: that is, as Prof. Feimster said in class, it's all about what you do when you leave the classroom. How are you going to make the world a better place than when you found it? I learned in such a deep way what your fate being bound to another's means--not just in an abstract way, but in a practical, tactical one. We were pushed to take broad lessons from discussion and reading and apply them to our particular life story and the fight we want to join\/have already. All of this was combined with an intense intellectual rigor. You learn about story-telling through a Critical Race Theory frame as a method not only of narrative construction, but political engagement too. This is embedded in a historical view of CRT, a critical view of those who use it, and many opportunities to apply this frame back to your own methodology. This class reaches beyond the classroom, into your life, into your soul, into the fiber that binds us all together."

   "comments": [
    "The best part of this course is professor feimster, but the syllabus and learning tools are also great. the intention behind each choice, assignment, facilitation of conversation - is very clear.",
    "Without a doubt, this has been the best class I have taken at Yale. In fact, there was not a single weakness in the course. Strengths: Extraordinary professor, incredibly engaging material, and brilliant classmates.",
    "This course is INCREDIBLE. It is challenging, painful, powerful, and transformative. It uses an important method--storytelling--as a force for dismantling white supremacy, through both engaging with others' stories and writing your own. The only slight, tiny downside is that sometimes Professor Feimster lectures a bit in seminar, but other than that, it is wholly incredible.",
    "The strengths of the course were the readings and the really important discussions we would have in class.",
    "I loved the way that this course was organized - it was very helpful to start with the origins of critical race theory and narrative as a tool and then dive into examples of critical race theory writing. Discussions at the beginning of the semester were excellent - time was typically well divided amongst the assigned texts and we would try to be pretty comprehensive in the two hour time we had to go over everything. Also, being forced to do the Voice Projects and the Final Autobiography were really critical to applying what we were learning to our own lives and stories. I've never taken a class that forces us to apply to abstract to our lived experience - that was absolutely amazing! However, more could have been done at the end of the semester to make sure we covered what we were assigned to read in seminar. It could be frustrating to have so much reading assigned and to spend a huge part of class discussion a small detail of the text or get off on a tangent that didn't relate to the text when we had put in the time to be prepared to discuss the text. I also felt that it was difficult to get a word in during discussion at the beginning of the semester, with more confident students being able to lead discussion. I think more could be done in the facilitation to give more people a chance to speak.",
    "This was hands-down the best course I have taken while at Yale. Our discussions were necessarily wide enough to encompass years of history; narrow enough to be able to really focus on the particulars of our own setting and our own education. Not enough courses turn to look at Yale itself as the seat from which our knowledge is unfolding. Not enough courses push you to reach back into your own life, realizing the patterns, structures, and choices that make it up. Prof. Feimster is the best discussion leader I have ever even dreamed of: She takes charge but also lets students--who were the most engaged I have ever seen\/been--set the agenda in a way that forces us to stretch our intellectual fiber, and, more importantly, our moral horizons. Another strength is that Prof. Feimster really brings out the spirit of her students. I learned so much from my peers, in a way that had never ever happened before in any classroom I'd been part of (and I'm a graduating senior)."

   "comments": [
    "absolutely.",
    "Yes! This is one of the best classes offered at Yale. I've taken many classes that were different in name but similar in content. I can say for certain that the information taught in CRT is unlike any other course at the university. Not taking it would be a mistake.",
    "Every student should strive to take a class with Professor Feimster",
    "YES YES YES!!!! Without a doubt, Critical Race Theory was the best class that I have taken at Yale. Professor Feimster is wow...she is the best, most brilliant, generous, and caring professor I had during my four years at Yale. Not only is she great at facilitating seminar discussions, but she is also SO brilliant and everything she says is worthy of writing down. The material itself was also incredibly engaging, intellectually challenging, and deeply rewarding. The assignments for the class give you the opportunity to directly relate the class's material to your life at home, at Yale, and beyond. Everything about this class is extraordinary. If you can get into this class, I highly, highly recommend!",
    "EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE. It is absolutely phenomenal, painful, transformative. It deconstructs white supremacy and complacency, emphasizes black stories, and teaches everyone to listen to each other. This forces you to examine your own positionality and privilege, and seeks to enlist you in the dismantling of white supremacy and the fight towards racial justice.",
    "Yes! This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. 10\/10",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student, it challenges the way you think about history and now.",
    "Definitely! This is a remarkably eye-opening class for people of any background thinking about race in the world.",
    "If you have the opportunity, please take Feimster's Critical Race Theory. This is one of those classes where not only will you learn a lot, but your ideas will be challenged and you will grow as a person. Professor Feimster is incredible. She truly cares for the wellbeing and academic growth of her students. As a seminar leader, she is engaging and facilitates thought provoking conversations. I couldn't speak higher of this course or Feimster!",
    "If you can get into this course, absolutely take it! Critical Race Theory gives you the language to think about race in a rigorous way and allows you to understand the ways that narrative can be used in order to communicate complexities about race. We start off talking about the legal origins of critical race theory as a form of radical scholarship in law and then talk about the role of narrative in discussion of race. We then read some key works of critical race theorists, work on colorblind racism, identity politics, and social movements around issues of race. Professor Feimster is brilliant and really fills in our understanding of the readings during discussions, helping us isolate key tensions, themes, and questions throughout the text. The people in our seminar also added so much discussion, constantly asking difficult questions and bringing up new tensions. The workload is really made up of being prepared for seminar by doing the readings ; there are only 3 reading responses and 2 voice projects and a final paper, so it's pretty manageable! The beginning of the semester probably was more rigorous in terms of discussion - the quality of our discussions waned a bit by the end. The class was still incredibly in helping me develop a better understanding of racial dynamics in the US and how to talk about and tell stories about race.",
    "Definitely. This is one of the best courses I've taken here in terms of intellectual growth.",
    "100%. Professor Feimster is the actual queen and the field of CRT is beyond interesting. This might be the first class I actually did all the readings for, and I looked forward to class every week. When one of our classes had to be canceled, I was actually disappointed. tl;dr you need this class.",
    "This course changed my life: Made me think, actually for the first time, come to find out, about what it truly means to exist in a world so loaded down with pain. What it means to think, well, if racism is permanent, how does this change our strategizing? If the conservative Right has created racial narratives that have stuck, then how do we re-harness and replace them? What does justice mean--materially, historically, culturally, in your own life? I have never been in a classroom with people who really really care about each other; who really really want to get to an answer (even if the answer is in the struggle itself). You learn more about your responsibilities in this world; Yale's responsibilities; our responsibilities to each other. I will be grateful for as long as I live to have sat in a room with such incredible students and such an incredible professor. You learn how to be in it for the long haul--because you have to be."
