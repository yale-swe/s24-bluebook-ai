    "This course has changed the way I go about writing and delivering speeches, but also how I hear and watch speeches. There are so many nuances in delivery and arrangement of public speech that I was unaware of before taking this class.",
    "Got the chance to practice public speaking, became more confident and more aware of my style.",
    "Confidence in my speaking and writing. Ability to analyze and understand the composition of great speeches.",
    "How to analyze speeches. Public speaking.",
    "Speaking abilities",
    "Frankly this class helped me learn about myself and my beliefs more than about classical rhetoric. In the process of writing six speeches of varying length, topic, purpose, and structure, you get to wrangle with your own beliefs and style\/method of expression.",
    "I developed my public speaking, rhetorical analysis, speech writing, and social awareness by taking this course.",
    "Public speaking skills! This is one of the classes that is really defined by the work, and just getting up there, speaking, and being critiqued made me a better speaker. Also improved my composition skills through conversations about rhetoric, and my ability to assess rhetoric similarly.",
    "This class dramatically improved my confidence when speaking in front of a group. It allowed me to overcome a lot of my anxiety about public speaking while developing insight on what makes a speech effective.",
    "This course provided an effective study of rhetoric, by writing\/delivering our own speeches and listening to speeches by other students and successful orators."

   "comments": [
    "This is such a practical, engaging class where you will engage in interesting discussions, gain meaningful feedback, and be pushed to improve as a speaker. It's so enriching in that sense. My one criticism is that some of the assigned reading felt disjointed from the course. I felt like discussion on the reading material could have been strengthened by simply assigning shorter segments of the books, rather than the entire books.",
    "Not many weaknesses for this course. Perhaps have written evaluations done by the students for the 2nd long speech in addition to the first five-minute long speech.",
    "Only strengths: pushes students to do better, forces them to confront their fears and to extend their knowledge and skill base in multiple directions. Mediocrity and non-commitment is not an option.",
    "At times, I wish there was more speeches - maybe a chance to speak extemporaneously",
    "In the process of writing six speeches of varying length, topic, purpose, and structure, you get to wrangle with your own beliefs and style\/method of expression. This class truly does galvanize critical examination of your identity and values. Additionally, because half of the class is built on delivery of speech, you get to know other people in the class incredibly well. I have never had a stronger connection to or community with a class before. At the same time, I wish there were a greater emphasis on digesting classic rhetorical methods, structures, and philosophies in the beginning weeks of the class. Although certain random days require you to read 200 pages of dense text (which few people actually did), a greater emphasis on class discussion around and variety of readings about classical methods would be of huge benefit. Additionally, it would be very useful to have more thorough feedback from Professor Roach after each speech.",
    "This is an excellent course. It provides an introduction to many important concepts in oratory and rhetoric. The amount you gain is also greatly amplified by the strengths of your peers in the class. Each individual in my class had a strength that I honed in on to improve my own speeches.",
    "The actual practice and getting to give feedback on so many different speeches is wonderful -- you really get to apply and learn and grow and see how you're changing over the course of the semester, which is wonderful and somewhat unusual for a Yale class. Would recommend!",
    "Prof. Roach loves his students and his subject, and brings a wealth of knowledge about rhetoric and public speaking to the class. Getting to hear other students speak about themselves and their interests made the class feel like an intimate community, and every student truly felt it was their responsibility to help their classmates improve their skills. I would say it would be valuable to talk more about techniques of public speaking - most of our discussion was about rhetoric, and less about how to physically speak better - and that I would have valued being videotaped so as to be able to better assess my speaking.",
    "Strengths: Professor Roach is stellar, the seminar-style allowed everyone in the class to get to know each other well, high relevance within the context of an election year Weaknesses: lacked a method for harsher feedback",
    "Strength: it was useful to rigorously study presidential rhetoric and attempt to emulate the effective techniques employed by great orators. I also enjoyed working on my speechwriting - and general persuasion - skills, which I felt improved significantly. Weakness: perhaps rhetoric from non-political speakers could be incorporated into the syllabus (e.g. speeches from executives\/entrepreneurs\/religious leaders). I also think we could have spent time studying the mechanics of delivery in a more granular way - it seemed like there was a somewhat uneven balance between the focus on speechwriting the first few weeks vs. delivery later on. Suggestion: it would have been useful to formally analyze the writing as well as the delivery of a speech early on in the class (perhaps right after the ethos\/pathos\/logos exercises)."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. What an amazing class. Our class kind of became a family in the end. You get to know everyone so well through their speeches, and the same becomes true of them to yours, which means they know exactly how to give you meaningful feedback. This is a class that teaches you a practical lifelong skill so effectively, but still is a traditionally liberal arts class where you will engage in interesting discussions. Take it! But take it senior year. He doesn't tend to let in non-seniors. Plus, it's almost a cooler experience being with only fellow seniors.",
    "Wow, what a blast of a semester it is. This is a class with 18 seniors, from all corners of the campus, and each of us had to make 6 speeches -- 3 short ones (1min) and 3 long ones. The latter three were graded. It was a whole lot of fun because the class really got to know each other well. Professor Roach was also extremely approachable, and really cared to know each of us personally. A great class to take senior year (maybe credit\/D), low workload, you learn a ton, and make a lot of friends. What more can you ask for?",
    "Amazing course that is unlike many courses you will take at Yale. It's a great opportunity to work on your persuasion and speaking abilities within a small group. You will get to know your class well and Prof Roach is very clearly invested in your success and well being. Incredibly knowledgable, insightful, and caring professor. Take this class and you won't regret it. One of my favorite you'll take at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. A must-take.",
    "Great course. Really, I see this as a two pronged course. Half of the course focuses on writing and becoming a great speech writer. The other half focuses on delivering speeches. If you're a good speaker, perhaps you aren't a great speech writer (me). And if you're a good speech writer, perhaps you aren't a great speaker. So you'll get the opportunity to practice both. 6 speeches all together, so roughly one every other week. Its a great course. But the best part is Joseph Roach - no joke, he's a legend. Great guy. Class went out for drinks on our last class. He gives sharp commentary on your writing and delivery, but generally in a nice way. I don't mind, but I think some people want harsher criticism. Get a good sense of the class on the first few days; the class can make all the difference in your experience- for me it was a wonderful course.",
    "Absolutely, but with a few key reservations. In the process of writing six speeches of varying length, topic, purpose, and structure, you get to wrangle with your own beliefs and style\/method of expression. This class truly does galvanize critical examination of your identity and values. Additionally, because half of the class is built on delivery of speech, you get to know other people in the class incredibly well. I have never had a stronger connection to or community with a class before.

Although certain random days require you to read 200 pages of dense text (which few people actually did), a greater emphasis on class discussion around and variety of readings about classical methods would be of huge benefit. Further, I think we all would have benefited from more thorough and thoughtful feedback from Professor Roach, who is truly a luminary in his field and honestly a wonderful man.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. You will learn a great deal on one of the most practical skills. You will receive a classical perspective on rhetoric in addition to modern applications. You get to make three short speeches at the beginning of the semester that are ungraded so that you can figure out your strengths and weaknesses, and improve upon them.",
    "Absolutely -- the class is a gem! You get actual practice speaking, Professor Roach is incredible, and honestly you get to be so close with other students in the seminar.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you are offered a spot. Besides learning the craft of speech writing, you'll learn how to present yourself in a poised, persuasive, and effective way. The implications of this class are so important, whether you plan to be an actor or businessperson after graduation.",
    "This was the best course I've taken at Yale, because it teaches a skill that is essential to any field--how to influence people through language and public speaking. I remember being nervous on the first day, but as our class grew to know each other better and we got more and more confident in our speaking skills, I found myself loving sharing my thoughts on stage and hearing everyone else. Professor Roach gives great feedback, and I will never forget the lessons in speaking (and life) that I learned in this class. It was truly inspiring to hear from my classmates, and this sounds cheesy to say, but this class honestly gave me hope for a better future for America.",
    "I came into this class as someone who visibly shakes when public speaking, and came out loving speaking in front of a group. It's a class that's about practice and honest feedback more than it's about discussion or readings, and about being part of a community that is composed of people trying to improve. That community is improved by the fact that students are asked to bare themselves during their speeches and to truly communicate themselves to a group of strangers, and because of this I felt this was the strongest community I've ever built within a class. Prof. Roach facilitates that community beautifully as well, and is a compassionate, brilliant, and accessible instructor. Two thumbs up, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "YES. Great senior course. Allowed me to get to know a whole new group of people pretty well and develop public speaking skills while growing closer to them.",
    "Yes! It was a great opportunity (particularly with the 2016 election) to take a rigorous look at effective speechwriting and delivery."
