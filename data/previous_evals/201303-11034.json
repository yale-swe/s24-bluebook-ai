    "Definitely! Take it if you can get in!",
    "Great class if you get an interesting project. Second half was so much better than the first simply by virtue of the lab we worked with and the project they gave us. Very manageable workload outside of lab.",
    "This lab varies a lot by the specific project. The final assignment for the second session is a presentation which is totally unrelated from the work you've been doing, which is perhaps a little odd but it was cool to learn about something new. Lab time itself is usually pretty fun, especially if you have friends in the class. It's really nice not to have to prepare anything beforehand, and homeworks are no problem as long as you take notes in class and it's an enormous help to have a friend in the class who really knows the relevant bio.",
    "Highly recommended!!! This class was everything that MCDB 342L was supposed to be and failed to live up to. It was chill, enjoyable, and not much work, but we still learned a lot about ion torrent and gene sequencing. Symposium presentations at the end are peer-graded and a lot less work than the final paper for MCDB 342L. We often got out by 4 p.m., and I really enjoyed the company of my classmates, who are great people. Overall the best lab class that I've taken at Yale, hands down.",
    "If the experiments, scheduling, and subject of Nucleic Acids lab stick to this particular experiment, I would whole-heartedly recommend this to any student who is interested in taking a lab that emphasizes new techniques with sequencing and DNA\/RNA processing. It is not your typical orgo lab procedural, but it moves at a pace more similar to a real research lab. You typically pick up on research already being performed by one of the professors here and continue their experiments. It's really cool! Take it if you want to easily get your bio lab requirements down - it's both fun and fulfilling!",
    "You get to do a project on stem cells, bit by bit. You use techniques that you read about in papers to do so, do 3 problem sets, present a paper in 10 minutes, and do a lab book. I really like this hands on type of learning, and since the experiment was broken up into so many steps, we got out in great time each time. Take it if you can get in!",
    "I thought the second half of the semester was very interesting and very chill. The first half had us working very late, but this half, professor Nelson made up for it by letting us out around 3 or 4 on most days. The chill pace also allowed us time to redo things when they failed...but unfortunately, we didn't quite make it to the RNAseq due to technical issues. Nevertheless, I think this lab was one of the best i've done at Yale and it really does emulate a real research lab",
    "I think because the class is based on current projects at the time, it fluctuates. It's hard to recommend a class that could be extremely chill or extremely time consuming.",
    "Yes! After a rough first semester, the professor learned a lot about how much should be expected from us and the second half semester was very manageable and we learned a lot, even using a new technique that was very recently created! Possibly you could get some amazing results!",
    "Much much better than 342L. Learn some awesome techniques (very high end).",
    "A continuation of Nucleic Acids I. It was great to learn about next generation sequencing and do a project using this technology. Labs in this section were very manageable compared to the previous section, as we only did one project instead of two simultaneously like the first half of the lab. I felt I learned a lot form this lab, and from Professor Nelson. The lab has weekly psets, and ends with a symposium where each student presents a paper on Next Generation sequencing, which, while somewhat lengthy for a last class, was a nice way to learn about other methods of sequencing and their applications. Definitely a must take MCDB lab!",
    "Very good lab. Take it if you can. Short and almost zero out of class work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Prof Nelson is a great teacher and the course was fun and not too stressful. It was nice being able to take a full semester in just half a semester."
