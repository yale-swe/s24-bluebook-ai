   "comments": [
    "This was a great fifth credit. Lectures and readings were always interesting, so the little work that we had to do never felt like a chore. I will say though that Professor Holmes tends to drone on a bit.",
    "Take the class, but for love of the subject. The lectures themselves aren't very interesting.",
    "PSYC 110 covers a lot of interesting material, but it is a very basic intro course and doesn't go in depth on any subject. I would recommend that another student take it if they need it as a prerequisite or want to see if they like psych. It is definitely dependent on the professor though.",
    "I would reccommend this class to anyone. It's an interesting topic, light workload, and the exams are fair. Probably better to take it with Bloom or Chun than with Holmes, but the class is still quite good.",
    "Pretty good class. Topics are interesting and its worth taking especially if you want to take more advanced level psych classes.",
    "Even if you don't want to major in psychology, I would recommend this class as an introduction for how the mind works, which can be very applicable in a variety of fields outside of psychology.",
    "A fast-paced survey course in which you cannot expect to cover anything in too much depth.",
    "You will get out of the class what you put into it. If you sit in the back, don't pay attention in lecture, and don't prioritize studying for exams or doing the reading responses, you will find the class incredibly dull and your grade will certainly suffer for it. The enjoyable part of this class definitely comes from focusing - Professor Holmes is a bit monotone, but delightfully clever in a subtle sense that would perhaps be easy to miss. The subject matter is interlaced with current issues, and Professor Holmes keeps the students informed of events going on around campus that relate to mental health and the study of the mind, which I personally found to be quite wonderful. While this isn't necessarily an easy A, this is one of the best examples I have found at Yale of a class that gives you in grades pretty much exactly what you contributed in effort. Overall, an interesting survey of psychological study. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a low-stress SO (provided that you're willing to put the time in when it counts).",
    "Standard intro lecture course, lot of reading but the material is interesting.",
    "I'd recommend PSYC 110 to anyone who wants a really chill class that's also really interesting. Do the reading, you won't do well on the tests without it.",
    "Great class - definitely would recommend it.",
    "A very interesting course. It is also very manageable, so even if you don't plan on majoring in Psychology, it is great to take.",
    "Recommend as an easy and interesting class to any major!!",
    "A good gut - it's a lot of reading, but really a very reasonable class that you should no trouble with if you pay attention.",
    "A very enjoyable class that is structured very well so as to facilitate stable learning. The class has 3 midterms which are all very fair and not too difficult if you study and 6 reading responses which don't require too much time. The reading is not too intensive and very helpful. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a class that isn't too stressful but also mentally stimulating and entertaining.",
    "Good intro course",
    "Great way to see if you have interest in psych, or just to explore new subjects.",
    "Great overview of all of psychology topics.",
    "Good introductory course into psychology. Covers all aspects of psychology so it's helpful when deciding what in particular you may like to study further. I would recommend this course, it was extremely interesting.",
    "Very basic introduction to psychology. Probably wouldn't recommend, if only because I think most students could pick up the same information from a higher level course if they were interested in the field, and that this wasn't especially dense in novel content.",
    "It was okay but overall really boring",
    "It is a good beginners lecture for incoming freshman or for anyone that has not taken a psychology class in the past. It's a class that touches a lot of parts in psychology without going into great depth.",
    "yeah! it's interesting! take it with chun or someone cool though",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is very useful to get a background in psychology and this course does a good job of it.",
    "A very good and interesting intro class. Take it!",
    "Why not? Take it to learn about the brain.",
    "I would recommend PSYC110 to anyone interested in the field.",
    "It's okay.",
    "The class covered a lot of fascinating topics, but I also had never taken any psyc courses. If you have I can imagine that it could become repetitive, but if not the course is not very difficult and covers many interesting things.",
    "This is a class that everyone should take. We learnt stuff that we can actually apply in real life. Super cool",
    "Very general survey course. Learned a lot, though sometimes not in great depth. Great course if you're interested at all about psychology. Manageable 5th class.",
    "Interesting but difficult.",
    "It's a great course, especially for anyone that is considering being premed. It might not be a premed requirement, but the knowledge you get from this class will probably be helpful on the MCAT.",
    "It was a prereq for me, so take it if you have to.",
    "It's an interesting course, but your enjoyment depends a lot on who's teaching it. I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless you are interesting in psychology specifically or need to take it.",
    "Psyc 110 is a nice gut class. If you're pre-med and taking this for the pre-med requirement, you'll breeze right through it. The material is easier (and easier to memorize) than the material in biology classes at Yale. Prof. Holmes is great, and has about as scientific an approach to psychology as you're ever going to find. He's also incredibly approachable and not intimidating at all. I'm still not sure that I believe everything we learned in the class (some stuff, like the Big Five personality traits, really didn't seem scientific) but I definitely learned some interesting things. I didn't expect to like Psychology, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd probably take it again. Note: You DO have to study for the exams. If you try to wing it, you'll do really badly. If you study all the lectures - even if you only spend one day (or less) on it, you'll do quite well. Also: GO TO CLASS, PAY ATTENTION, AND TAKE NOTES! This is the ONLY class I've EVER taken at Yale where I actually used my notes to study. If you haven't gone to class, you will never be able to figure out what happened in lecture by reading the slides (most of the slides just have pictures with no captions or explanations). Overall: Good class, not much work, take it :)",
    "Not the best class but not the worst. Some lectures are very interesting and engaging while others are quite dull. The homework consists of weekly reading responses to the different textbook chapters and articles assigned to correspond to each lecture; for Professor Holmes, the focus of the response is somewhat left up to you, so you can address the whole of the reading or talk about a more specific portion. These responses don't take long and are not difficult. There is also one final project, a book review. This is not a hard assignment but does require you to plan ahead so that you have time to do the assignment and actually read the book (as well as get a copy of your book, as the choices for this class were different than those that Paul Bloom gave for his). The tests were pretty difficult, but Professor Holmes does announce the average\/grade distribution, and he does curve the class as a whole based on the class performance across the three tests (all noncumulative, no final after reading period).",
    "Take the class! Readings are not necessary, but you will definitely take something away from them and it always helps for the exams. The three exams are non-cumulative which is great and the book report isn't too bad.",
    "PSYC 110 is an introduction to psychology that covers all sorts of topics including memory, dreams, social relationships, and more. I would absolutely recommend it because most students find the content really interesting, and it's great to have a basic knowledge of how our brains work.",
    "You will learn a lot of interesting stuff.",
    "This class is an intro to the topic. You will acquire a lot of new concepts that could be used not only if you are pursuing the psychology path, but also if you want to learn more about human and their relations. I would definitively recommend this course.",
    "Everyone should take Psych 110 to be exposed to some of the more exciting, challenging, and interesting \"stuff of life.\"",
    "It is a fairly easy and interesting class, but you have to be willing to put in effort studying for the midterms at the very least if you want to do well in the class. I would recommend it just to learn about cool stuff or as an introduction to social sciences."
