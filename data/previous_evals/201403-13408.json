   "comments": [
    "This class is great for beginning sculptures who would like to work with many different mediums such as metal welding, wood cutting, and clay sculpting. Michelle Lopez is an amazing professor and you really end up progressing throughout the course. The final project is cool because you work with a partner to set up an installation around Yale's campus. Overall, amazing course, and I definitely recommend this course.",
    "Very interesting. Not too much work. It encourages one to rethink about art, architecture and the world. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend ART110 O1 to another student because its taught me to think in a new way which can inspire me a lot.",
    "Fun and interesting",
    "Take it!",
    "ART 110 is basically a non-class. There's little to no work, so it's great as a fifth class if you want a chance to explore an artistic side. There are only 5-6 actual projects throughout the semester, which is basically nothing, so if you actually end up really enjoying sculpture you might find yourself a little frustrated.",
    "Good in terms of taking advantage of offered resources: you get to take a woodshop and metalworking tutorial and afterwords can use the two shops. In terms of the class: learned absolutely nothing. Although by taking it, I did end up making some cool stuff by virtue of having to complete assignments, so something came of it. Beware: the project assignments make no sense - but the teacher is as poor about holding people to her guidelines as she is about creating guidelines that make any sense, so if you want to take this class, you are best off taking advantage of this class's lack of structure and just making whatever you want. You will however, need to make up some sort of b.s. to back up the great \"meaning\" of your projects, because this teacher (Michelle) is very hung up on conceptual art. Doesn't even have to be good b.s. - so long as it's vast and big and detailed so as to seem important."
