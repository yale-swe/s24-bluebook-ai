    "If you have not taking calculus, this class is the class for you.",
    "Yes; it's a good course if you don't mind math and you're looking to fill a QR or just have a basic understanding of AB Calculus.",
    "Make sure you receive a good teacher. I makes all the difference!",
    "It's basic calculus: derivatives and a tiny bit of integration (less than on the AP Calc AB exam, though). It's not terribly difficult, especially if you've taken calc previously, but the tests can be quite tricky (this year's final was pretty horrific). If you took calc recently in high school, you can probably skip safely to 115. If it's been a while, 112 will be a pretty straightforward and solid review. Professor Hadari is a good teacher and does a great job mixing theory\/proof-type stuff with actual applications and examples.",
    "yes i would. not a bad QR and if you have a good teacher, its not so bad. curve is good as well.",
    "Take it if you're interested in learning basic calculus or need it for a requirement, but try to get a good teacher. Asaf Hadari was really wonderful--he was clear and made sure we really understood it all. If he teaches this again, I recommend him 100%.Do a lot of practice for the tests, though. They're tricky.",
    "If you took Calculus in High School, this shouldn't be too hard. They stop after the Fundamental Theorem.",
    "I took it as complementary to intermediate micro, and they were not good complements. The math taught in 112 is really basic. If you want math for econ, take math 118, its much better. Overall, math 12 is not difficult, but it is annoying.",
    "For a QR, no. But if someone is planning to take 115, then its definitely important."
