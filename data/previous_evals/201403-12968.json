    "Architecture in India is a class that explores different pieces of architecture in India from different time periods and rom different people groups\/religions. I would recommend it for a person who is interested in India and its art history.",
    "Yes, it is a good class and covers parts of Indian architecture that are not taught in Yale College otherwise. There are a lot of monuments and sites to keep up with, and the readings are heavy at times, but usually going to lecture before reading directs you to which readings are important to read\/skim\/let go. Generally recommended if you are interested in Indian architecture and Indian religions.",
    "Yes I would recommend it if you have any interest in foreign architecture.",
    "Architecture in India is a really great survey of architecture that covers a little bit of everything. The buildings are beautiful and I learned a lot. If you are interested in learning about Indian architecture, this is definitely the class your you.",
    "I took HSAR 387 because I felt like I needed to have at least some experience with Indian visual culture (and architecture seemed like a great way to approach that). I would recommend the course to another student with similar goals, or even one who may not have a particular interest in India--it's a good overview that manages to achieve depth as well as breadth, and Professor Sears knows A LOT. She's also always willing to help if you're looking for more information on a particular topic\/research question (directing you to sources, etc)."
