    "I have learned a lot about limits and refined skills of differential calculus I learned in High School to be able to apply them to more complicated functions. I also practiced my general speed of computation and ability to visualize mathematical models.",
    "Basic calculus.",
    "Despite having taken a ssimilarclass in high school, it substantially developed my knowledge of calculus",
    "I learned how to calculate derivatives, limits and basic integrals.",
    "I learned how to solve for unknowns and look at problems in different ways in order to solve them.",
    "I gained a solid grasp of basic calculus skills. Though I had a previous calculus class in high school, this class reinforced the knowledge I gained last year, especially in the areas of differential equations and integrals.",
    "I learned how to problem solve using the knowledge I learned in class or in the text book. Not all questions are going to ask something and give you the strategy you should use to do it."

   "comments": [
    "I took calculus AB in high school, but was still placed in math 112 and I felt I really didn't learn anything and the material was presented in a way that confused me more. The class seemed disjointed from lecture to lecture and I relied quite a bit on my prior knowledge to do all the work because I thought the techniques I learned in high school were more effective and clear than in this course. Lectures seemed rushed because we had to squeeze theory, example problems, and practice questions all into 50 minutes and it didn't help that my instructor often seemed hesitant, confused, and disorganized. Also, having psets due at the end of each week was difficult because there would only be one day between the last lecture and the day they were due. I also did not enjoy WebAssign, as it seemed to be just added busy work in a somewhat finnicky program that wasn't really necessary since we already had psets for practice.",
    "There are very few strengths of this course. Class time is minimal and is barely enough to cover the basics for what comes in the problem sets after. The problem sets are much more advanced than what is shown in class, and in many cases explanation cannot even be found in the text book. On top of this, the grading scale is harsh given the average scores on Midterms and the final and the test structures are basically meant to trip you up and confuse you.",
    "Generally, the class is not taught well as introductions to topics are unclear. Lessons assume previous knowledge and do not do a good job of explaining.",
    "I think that there are portions of the class that are taught either too swiftly of with the assumption that students already understand the material",
    "I think a major weakness was the ability of the teacher to teach, but a major strength was the Max Ehram's motivation to make us learn. He may not have always explained it clearly, but he always made himself available. The QR tutors were always great!",
    "This course covers a lot, but it moves quickly. Sometimes it was hard to keep up with the information.",
    "I loved the Peer Tutors, very helpful. I liked that different options for calculating the grade. I did not like the level of teaching and the fact that the exams were on a higher level than what was taught.",
    "On a day-to-day basis I felt like the course was disorganized as far as learning the material goes. I did not feel as prepared as I would have liked for the midterm and final exam.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is defintely the many resources available for students. The multiple peer tutor hours, professor office hours, and math coaching were extremely beneficial for my learning. I really had a hard time learning anything in my actual class. The content was not explained well and I usually had to go home and teach myself the information.",
    "A lot of Class time was used to show the proofs of simple theorems or went of on tangents of how to solve problems unrelated to the course. The peer tutors for the course were fantastic for help outside of class."

   "comments": [
    "If you need math 112 as a prereq, I guess you don't have a choice. However, if you took calculus in high school and placed into this for whatever reason, talk to someone and see if you can take a different course because otherwise, you will probably be bored and frustrated.",
    "Absolutely not. Most people only take it because it is a prerequisite to later Economic courses, which notably do not even use the skills conveyed in 112.",
    "Generally, everyone should take Calculus I. However, I am not sure if the class at Yale is the best place to learn the fundamentals.",
    "Yes I think it is an essential course",
    "Yes. It goes through the basics. But I would make sure to study the information quite frequently and get a tutor in the beginning if you think you might need one eventually.",
    "No. I would recommend to everyone who has another option to choose the other option.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to reinforce their knowledge on basic calculus skills.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anther student. The teaching is poor, but the material relatively difficult for students that had not had extensive instruction in calculus prior to coming to Yale.",
    "This course gives a good overview of the beginning of calculus but the teaching needs improvement. I would recommend this class to a friend who has taken some level of calculus in the past."
