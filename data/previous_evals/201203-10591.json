    "Yes I would, interesting topics",
    "Yes. AI is an important course and a famous topic in Computer Science. Anyone who has time and choice should take it.",

    "I'd recommend it to students that are looking for a reasonably broad introduction to AI but don't have a lot of specific interest in a given subfield.",
    "If you are seeking a very broad, introductory course on AI, yes.",
    "Yes - interesting topics.",
    "It is an introduction course, you will not learn anything really technical but you will get an idea about what can be done in AI. Do not expect to come out of this course with any technical skill, this is almost cultural.This is not what I expected from a graduate course so I would not recommend it. For the reasons, see my answer to the first question.",
    "It's hard, but generally good.",
    "Undergraduate students is more recommended.",
    "I recommend this course. It helps get a broad view of AI.",
    "Take this class for sure, even though its a hard class."
