    "This is an incredible class! If it's offered again and you have the chance to take it, you should absolutely do so. If you are interested in science and\/or environmental issues this is the ideal course because you will get to develop writing skills by writing about things that interest you instead of analyzing a dry old literary text. Be prepared because this class will take a lot of time and effort, but it will be more than worth it. Carl Zimmer is great: he's one of the best science writers around (check out some of his books and articles to see for yourself), but he's also incredibly kind and willing to work one-on-one with students to help them develop their writing skills.",
    "Such a good class if you are in any major. It will teach you how to write. Simply write. It'll teach you how to write for the general public which, unless you plan on going into scientific writing, will be extremely useful.",
    "Good way to sharpen the explanatory power and clarity of your writing skills.",
    "Yes, if you have any interest in improving writing or journalism. Awesome for science majors. Preferably take credit\/D if possible.",
    "I would recommend this course as long as they realized that it is a rigorous writing course with a very narrow objective of writing stylistic articles. You have to want to be a journalist in this course to really benefit from the style of writing you are trying to develop.",
    "This is an excellent course. You will get to explore how journalism works, from finding a topic to interviewing sources to writing and revising the article. You will also learn how to explain tough scientific concepts in non-scientific language. Of all the classes I've taken at Yale, I believe that this one has improved my writing skills the most. That said, however, the course is also very demanding. Finding and interviewing sources can be extremely stressful, and Professor Zimmer sets high expectations for the quality of the articles.",
    "It's a lot of work for a single credit but it's definitely worth it. If you can manage to take this class credit\/d\/fail, then do it.",
    "This class is the only one of its kind currently offered for undergraduates at Yale. So if you're interested in improving how you write about science and\/or the environment, you don't have much of a choice. The class is excellent practice, and you will learn a lot both from Zimmer's experience (and that of other people he brings in), and from all the writing you have to do. So if you're serious about wanting to learn to write better - and believe me, it's not easy - take theclass.But that said, be sure to go in with both eyes open, because you're in for one heck of a rough ride. Here's why:1) It's a TON of work. A fair amount of reading, and an inordinate amount of writing - as well as research, interviewing people (and arranging, preparing for, transcribing, etc. said interviews), and editing. You obsess over literally every word, you probably re-write every sentence five times, and all of this takes time. Every spare moment you have will need to go into this work. I've taken 2-credit intensive language classes before, and believe me, this class was more work than even that.2)Take it Cr\/D\/F. If you care about your grades at all, trust me on this. Zimmer is a very strict grader, and I doubt there were more than a handful of As given over the course of the entire class, for any of the assignments (that's 5 assignments x 15 people, so maybe 5 or less A grades ever given out of 75 grades returned).3) Be prepared to be frustrated anyway. This is the kind of class you take Cr\/D not because you want to kick back and relax, but because you don't want to kill your GPA. To make the class worth your while, you'll still need to put in a load of work - slacking off will turn it into a pure waste of time, the practice is where you get the benefit. And you probably still won't want to switch it to a letter grade. It's frustrating putting that much effort in just to get a Cr, but that's the way it is.4) Be technologically prepared. This basically means having Skype, and good recording software that can record both Skype calls and in-person interviews.5) Finally, the one serious issue one might take with this class as a -writing- class. It teaches a very specific type of writing, namely journalistic writing. Sometimes you'll feel you're in a journalism class, not a science writing class. It can be frustrating at times because the style taught is very specific, and doesn't necessarily suit everyone. The basic skills you'll pick up will serve you well in any kind of writing, but the snappy journalistic style might not - and the class is very inflexible about it.",
    "This is a great class. If you have any interest in learning to write about complex subjects with clear,direct, powerful and concise prose, take this course. You'll cover a lot of interesting topics, read some really cool articles (SUPER FUN STUFF - a breeze to read) and learn to be a much better writer. Even if you have experience with journalism, this is a class you should take. If you've never written for a publication before, take this course. It's guaranteed to be helpful and fun. Zimmer can be a little stiff at time, but he's brilliant and will turn you into a far better writer.",
    "recommended",
    "An excellent class to improve your writing. Professor Zimmer is clearly very dedicated to the class and to the improvement of his students. This class requires a lot of class, but you will get what you put into this class."
