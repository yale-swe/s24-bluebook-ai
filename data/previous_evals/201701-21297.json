   "comments": [
    "Strengths: a flexible, accessible, and low-stress classroom environment Weaknesses: doesn't dive into literary analysis as deeply as it could have",
    "Professor Su had a tendency to get off topic, but overall the class was great. He kept class engaging and did a good job of choosing readings that were challenging, but also interesting and effective in improving our language ability.",
    "of all the l5 classes only this class and contemporary chinese fiction allow a more cultural\/ literary application of chinese which i really appreciated. i think i would have enjoyed if the class taught us skills of literary analysis and appreciation in chinese as opposed to using the texts mostly as a medium to pick up new vocabulary though",
    "Interesting texts and strong vocab improvement. However the professor was verbose and often classes would end without us completing any work, but just the professor speaking about irrelevant or semi-relevant topics for over an hour."

   "comments": [
    "It's a good course to take for students interested in the literature of the period, or to understanding the current landscape of Chinese literature. That being said, I would counsel students who have taken many classes with Su Wei against taking this course, because you don't learn too much aside from what you've already learned from his other courses.",
    "I think a lot of non-heritage speakers get scared away early on, but they should definitely take this class! It's difficult, but doable. Professor Su is great at encouraging his students and providing feedback and is more than willing to go the extra mile for his students. This was the logical next step after completing all of the other L5 courses at Yale. The improvement in my language skills was well worth the time I had to invest in the course.",
    "yes! i thought it was an interesting and fairly easy course, definitely complemented the rest of my schedule well",
    "Only if that student is very interested in Chinese literature. If not, then the professor and coursework will be overwhelming.",
    "If you are interested in fiction and societal problems in China during the 1920s-1960s, take the course!"
