    "The advance graduate seminar is an opportunity to present your findings to a general audience. Often times, we forget about the \"big picture\" when we prepare presentations for members of our field. The most useful part of this seminar is the question\/comments from our peers.",
    "It teaches me what other people in the department are doing; this is helpful if I have a specific technique or method I need to do, because then I know who to go to.",
    "In addition to learning about aspects of biology that would not come to me normally, preparation of a good talk is essential for our careers, whether in academics or elsewhere.",
    "It is just another presentation opportunity. That is fine."
