    "This was a gem of a course. Joshua Knobe is brilliant and knows how to direct section. Please take this course. You just review much of the psychological and experimental literature on morality. I would say that those with a background in philosophy might want to make sure that they can stomach a great deal of empirical research as it is very experiment oriented. I say this as a researcher, so I had no problem and it was my favorite course this semester. Just saying what I saw in others.",
    "Great course that tackles most of the big topics in moral psychology. If you are at all interested in the subject matter, you could not ask for a better course. I would recommend it to anyone with interests in philosophy or psychology, even if morality is not your primary focus. Philosophers should be warned that the focus is primarily empirical work, but the material is fascinating and the professor superb. Can't recommend it enough. I looked forward to both the readings and the weekly seminar.",
    "Highly recommended for anyone who has at least a little interest in both psychology and philosophy.",
    "Take it of you can get it."
