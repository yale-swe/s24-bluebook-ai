   "comments": [
    "This class has both practical information and more detailed theory of cryo-EM. It is mostly single-molecule structural analysis. If you embarking on a collaboration or starting in a cryo-EM lab, this could be a great intro for you.",
    "Yeah, if you are interested in Cryo-EM. It's a great course to get a broad background on Cryo-EM.",
    "It's a great course if you're interested in doing Cryo-EM. I would not recommend the class if a student is not interested in Cryo-EM.",
    "Yes, it's helpful if you're interested in cryo-EM.",
    "Cryo-EM is a good introduction to help conceptualize the concepts of electron microscopy.",
    "It's a pretty good overview course for EM. I would recommend students with some experience about Fourier transform (taking MB&B 635 beforehand is strongly recommended).",
    "It is a good class to take if you are new to the field and planning to use the techniques."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my understanding of electron microscopy, and to some extent, microscopy in general. This is invaluable knowledge to have when going forward in any type of science that involves imaging. I am sure that I will continue to use some of the conceptual knowledge I gained in the course for the remainder of my career, whether explicitly or implicitly.",
    "Yeah, it would be a great help to combine different structural biology techniques together.",
    "helpful. it helped me understand and learn what cryo-EM is about. i learned more about the CTF function and Fourier transforms.",
    "I don't think this course will contribute significantly to my own research. It is nice to know a lot about a technique in the field however so it will aide my understanding of other scientists' research.",
    "I am actively undergoing research in structural biology using EM. This course has really improved my understanding of EM, especially in image formation theory (the mathematical aspects).",
    "This was very helpful, I know the use of Cryoem better and might end up using it in my research."
