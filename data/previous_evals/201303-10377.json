   "comments": [
    "Be ready for a ton of work, but a great class.",
    "First of all, Russian isn't as hard as everyone says it is. Yes, you learn a new alphabet. Yes, verb aspects are wonky. Yes, some of the words are kinda long. But overall it's a fun, idiosyncratic language.You have regular homework every day, but it shouldn't take more than an hour. The tests aren't especially hard -- just study your vocab and review the grammar concepts beforehand. Class can be a little frustrating because they throw new concepts at you A LOT, especially in Chapter 6, but it's manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend Russian to anyone. It is a very satisfying language to start from scratch. Learning the new alphabet is a fun challenge, and the language is not as difficult as some rumors claim it to be. Plus, Julia makes it a really enjoyable class.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in learning Russian! The professor is wonderful, the language is so fun to learn, and you will come away feeling like you have learned a bit about Russian culture as well.",
    "It is a rigorous but not overly challenging introduction to the Russian language. There is homework every night, but it never takes more than 45 minutes or so. I thought the class was well-paced.My main gripe is with the textbook. I think the textbook is organized in a somewhat counterintuitive way. In the whole first semester, we didn't learn certain BASIC verbs like \"to have\" or \"to go.\" I'm sure there is a certain pedagogical logic to this, but I found it frustrating."
