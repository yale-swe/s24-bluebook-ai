    "I learned how to better tailor my narrative to elicit specific effects from the reader. Prof Shore's insights on the writing process focused on how to construct a story, and why to employ\/forgo certain writing strategies. Her comments on the book reviews and additions to class discussion were extremely useful, and made me more confident as a writer. I feel that my approach to creating a narrative is more focused, and that I have a stronger sense of the reader's perspective."

    "The reading was broad and interesting, and discussion was always lively. Prof Shore's contributions to discussion were so helpful, particularly with some of the more difficult reading (Zizek, for example). The only real improvement I can think of is to maybe limit the number of participants; with such a large group, some students rarely contributed.",
    "The class size was too large for the way the course was structured. This meant that group engagement\/ discussion was difficult. There was therefore a lot of time spent listening to the Professor, rather than there being dialogues between the students. Despite being a course that was supposedly centred around writing, there was little engagement with writing techniques for intellectual history."
