   "comments": [
    "I would definetely recommend this course for any student. During the course, you read different types of texts (plays, epistles, poetry, political treatises, etc) that give you the chance to really understand the fascinating relationship between poetry and politics during the 14th-century Italy.",
    "If you are interested in the high middle ages or the Renaissance, or in Italian literature in general, this seminar is worth the effort. It is a great seminar on the problems of poetics, mythology and politics as treated by the most important Italian writers of the period.",
    "A course that is a little Petrarch heavy but overall great to see the politics of the poets we spend so much time studying. I'd recommend.",
    "I would summarize this course as a look at specific themes in a certain time period: I think it could be useful for any student interested in the evolution of poetic thought in Italian literature. I would definitely recommend it to another student, since I think the concept of the course is valuable for understanding the relationship of literature to politics and how the poet has historically figured himself into political life."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very helpful to make me think more accurately on some aspects of my dissertation, which I am currently writing. It was especially important to illuminate the approach that I am adopting in one of my chapters.",
    "I feel that this course gave me a good basis in the 14th century and allowed me to delve into certain texts that I would not have otherwise been exposed to. The more I think about the course the more I am convinced that the way we treated and compared these texts is instrumental to understanding the evolution of Italian literature. I'm sure that when I write my dissertation, I will be able to reflect on this course and pull useful information from it."
