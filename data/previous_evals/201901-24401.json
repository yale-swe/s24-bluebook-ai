    "Spanish film analysis, cultural awareness, language practice",
    "I learned of the great array of films of the spanish-speaking diaspora and learned what cultural contexts the films were made in.",
    "Great survey of different social issues and artistic achievements in Latin America",
    "Learned about film evaluation and history of Spanish in film",
    "I learned mostly about culture and history that goes into making a movie. I learned a lot from the filmmakers themselves about the process of creating a film and all their personal opinions about it.",
    "I gained a new understanding of Latin American culture, history, and the role of cinematography in communicating to diverse audiences.",
    "How to analyze and critique film, as well as take into account the context within which the film was made.",
    "I solidified my Spanish reading, speaking, and writing skills, all while learning about Latin America and the history of film. Each film we watched had a lecture dedicated to it and how it connected to film themes and techniques but also the histories of Latin American countries."

   "comments": [
    "The exams required a lot of memorization, instead of genuine understanding. I don't think that memorizing film directors and matching them to their movies is particularly eye-opening. I do think that the films we watched were very diverse and showcased a wide range of cultural issues in Latin America and Spain.",
    "Lots of movies and interesting class discussions. Assignments are fun relative to other Yale courses and there is a high degree of flexibility in the class",
    "The organization was weird. There wasn't a lot of discussion but it wasn't quite a lecture- I was never really sure what we were supposed to be doing in class or taking notes on. I loved the diversity of content, but I wish the class fell into the lecture or seminar category better because I think that would have allowed me to fully engage with it.",
    "The professor is very engaged and its more of a discussion based course. All the assignments are engaging and fun.",
    "Profesora Tortora always showed her support for students academically and otherwise. I never hesitated to ask her for help because of her warm and welcoming personality.",
    "Professor Tortora is extremely passionate and knowledgeable. She makes the class engaging and fun, as well as informative. I think one think I would have like is to have been in a round-table formation, rather than in a classroom where desks face the front. This would allow for more discussion between classmates, though I can see how this would be difficult seeing as we are often watching the screen.",
    "The class is well structured in that there is always a film to be watched for the next class. The films we watch are amazing and the structure of the class allows for discussion to happen often. At times, the syllabus felt a little disorganized and it wasn't always clear what we should read for class as the class packet didn't coincide with the flow of the syllabus. Also, the special presentations we had to attend were sometimes at times that were difficult to attend, specifically those in the middle of the day during other classes."

   "comments": [
    "If they are interested in world film or how latin american film reflects cultural happenings then this is the class for you.",
    "If you're interested in film, yes. It's probably not the most effective way to learn more Spanish as there is very little speaking and writing relative to other L5 courses.",
    "I recommend this course because it made me think about movies in a different way, especially those made in latin America. I enjoyed this course very much and the homework was fun because we got to watch and analyze movies to then discuss in class.",
    "Yes I would certainly recommend this course as the Professors Tortora is a very open and kind person. Additionally this felt like a course in Latin American history as each film allowed me to gain more insight into the social and political context that created many of the current issues in Latin America today.",
    "Yes, without a doubt. I learned a lot about not only the films, and the history of the films, but also improved my Spanish.",
    "Absolutely. If a student wishes to learn more about Latin America, this class is perfect as it utilizes film to highlight the different perspectives and histories of Latin America. The class is super interesting and the special presentations with filmmakers are great opportunities to learn more about film and their experiences with film."
