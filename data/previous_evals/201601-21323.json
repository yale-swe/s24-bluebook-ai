    "ENVE 360 is a project based course. The projects are interesting, though your enjoyment may vary depending on your group. My group was great, so I had a great time. I would recommend this class if you are interested in innovation or sustainability.",
    "Essentially glorified arts & crafts class with a LOT of annoying SOM and F&ES students. You do not learn engineering in this class, and the problems and design challenges you work on in small groups are all pretty lame and hard to get excited about. Wish it was more technical and a smaller class with more individual attention so that the projects ended up incredible like the other projects in the CEID. Wouldn't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Yes- GREAT class! Super interested and there is a lot to learn- all of the professors are well-versed in the subject material and the course provides you with a lot of skills that can be applied to other things, both technical engineering skills like 3d designing and profession skills such as presenting and pitching. Overall, fantastic. The problem sets at the beginning can be a little tedious, but the rest of the work is super interesting and hands-on.",
    "It's a great class. You do a lot of hands on stuff. It can be a little slow in the beginning but it really ramps up and you do lots of really cool stuff. They give you a budget for your final project which is pretty cool. You get to work with real clients.",
    "ENAS 360 is a class focused on the design and problem-solving process with a green twist. I would recommend to other students who enjoy being creative, working with others, and are interested in the environment."
