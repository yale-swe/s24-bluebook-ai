    "Relaxed introduction to networks\/graph theory (which incidentally was the one remaining math topic I wanted to take during my time at Yale.) Covers a decent span of topics at a somewhat introductory level; probably the most applied class I've taken at Yale. A small subset of topics are extremely technical, though. Since grading is done based on short discussion questions and a single presentation, you get what you put in. You by no means need to do the readings, but I found them quite instructive and interesting.",

    "Would have preferred professor commentary on presentation quality.",
    "Strengths: topics and the format Weakness: switched professors halfway through?",
    "The material and the topics in the course were really interesting. I think it was also a fun class in general. I think the main weakness of the course was the homework assignments. I thought being asked to comment on a discussion thread about other student's presentations was a complete waste of time. I found it especially frustrating to see the other commenters write pretentious sophisticated sounding (and sometimes substanceless) comments knowing that my comments would be compared against such comments when a busy instructor grades the course.) I think being asked to give an in-class presentation was a great and worthwhile assignment, but commenting on discussion threads online was not.",
    "Strength: it's a relaxing way to conclude the math major. Weaknesses: for learning's sake, it would be great to actually have problem sets or quizzes on the presented material. I wish we'd had professors who actually cared, maybe enough to review the material with the presenter before the presentation, or at least enough to stay with the class for the whole semester.",
    "For the econ\/math combined section, the material is super interesting. I was genuinely engaged in the material. People are browsing their phones and laptops during most presentations. Would be nice to have some more direct feedback on our presentations.",
    "I think there's not much you can change about the structure of this seminar, there's really no other way to do it.",
    "Very good student presentations More participation needed",
    "Take attendance",
    "This course was pretty bad, and was a terrible way to end the math major. Every week a student presented on one chapter of the textbook, and then we wrote responses on canvas about the lecture. However, the professors did not really look at the length of the chapters beforehand, and so some lectures were really short, and others were really long and rushed, and really should not have been taught in one class period. As a result, a lot of the content was hard to follow and understand. Additionally, the professors were not engaged with the class at all. Professor Casson sat far in the back every time he came, and never said anything to us. After a while, he stopped being the math professor and a new one came. Professor Ryota also left our class about halfway through the semester. At no point was it clear how we were graded or what we were being evaluated on. I never received a grade for my class presentation, or any feedback of any form. This class might be an acceptable class if it had professors that were engaged, interacted with us, and gave us any kind of feedback whatsoever so that we could improve as students. An even better senior seminar would probably allow the students to help decide what kind of content we wanted to learn about and present on.",
    "it was decent. the material was basic enough that the student presentations worked well in teaching the information. following a textbook was a great decision, because it's always easier to learn with associated material. the mandatory responses were annoying and not very instructive, but i can't think of any better way to ensure that students are engaged with the material aside from testing"

    "Yes",
    "This course (the math\/econ senior seminar) is by far the easiest way to fulfill the senior math requirement. I thought the student presentations were enjoyable and the topics covered this semester were fascinating. The homework assignments of commenting on discussion threads for each presentation was a complete waste of time. I found it especially frustrating to see the other commenters write pretentious, sophisticated sounding (and sometimes substanceless) comments knowing that my comments would be compared against such comments when a busy instructor grades the course.) I think being asked to give an in-class presentation was a great learning experience and an easy way to fulfill the senior requirement.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. Otherwise don't. It seemed like everyone in the class was there because they had to be. Few students paid much attention to the lectures.",
    "No, take the other math seminar if possible. This one gives intuition for large swaths of economics, with almost no details. You have almost no work, so it's chill: just a single presentation and weekly responses to the presentations. But I find not learning anything, when there's clearly material to learn, to be just frustrating. It's almost entirely student driven, from the format and tone of presentations to the content of responses. Furthermore, we started off with two professors. First the Math professor dropped out, then the Econ professor, and we got a permanent Applied math grad student as a substitute.",
    "This is the easiest class in the major and one of the most interesting.",
    "Yes - you probably have to take it anyway.",
    "You just have to take it so...",
    "Only take this course if you have to, but given that this was the senior seminar, I think everybody in the class had to take it. If different professors teach it next year, it has the potential to be a better class. The course material itself is extremely interesting in my opinion. However, this class was absolutely terrible otherwise.",
    "a good (albeit slow and not particularly challenging or fulfilling) overview of topics in network theory. take it if you need it, but this isn't a class that will leave you much better off than where you started from."
