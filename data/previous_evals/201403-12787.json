    "Take it. It's a crazy interesting view on storytelling. It will help you look at every book you ever read in a different light. This course will make you understand why you want to cry, laugh, and scream at characters and their decisions, why you become so emotionally attached, and why we try to hard to predict events and project ourselves onto the novel.",
    "IF you have to take it, it's a good class and you'll probably enjoy it, but if you're not a lit major, don't bother. Although it fulfills the writing requirement but doesn't actually feel like there's a lot of writing involved so that's a plus.",
    "Perfect class if you want to read and aren't interested in any of the introductory english options. You read a lot of amazing books and get to have some great discussions. The work load isn't too bad so long as you don't leave your papers till the last minute. All the section leaders seem like they have their own quirks and strengths.",
    "I didn't think I would enjoy this class mostly because it is a prereq for lit majors but I ended up learning a lot. It's structured very well and I really do feel that everything we read tied together quite beautifully in the end. I had Professor Gabriel as my section leader and once you get into the rhythm of his teaching (very organic and rather unstructured) you'd find it charming. He's also just a very intelligent individual and you'll end up learning so much from him as a person. The lectures can be a little difficult to follow sometimes if you haven't done the reading already--so try to do the reading before hand! The professors are pretty lenient in terms of reading but it would do you better if you actually read."
