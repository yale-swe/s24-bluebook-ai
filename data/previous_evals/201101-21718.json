    "I highly recommend this course. Now that its only 12 people, its actually a seminar in which you stand to learn a lot.",
    "If you can get into this seminar, take it. Bloom is one of the most brilliant and insightful minds on this campus, and a good, kind friend as well. Don't expect debates or discussion, but more a weekly opportunity to hear a master speak on his favorite topic. It's an honor to be in his seminars.",
    "Of course! Take it take it take it. Harold Bloom is absolutely inspirational.",
    "Harold Bloom's hilarious and amazing. Try to take it if you can! But good luck getting in!",
    "Absolutely take it. It's the best way to study Shakespeare at Yale (certainly better than the lecture course). Why wouldn't you?",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was especially refeshing to take a seminar that focused only on four plays since it allowed us to have time to give each play the attention that it deserved."
