   "comments": [
    "It was a great class. We spent a great deal of time translating while also dealing with the historical setting and context of all the texts we dealt with.",
    "Absolutely. However, I think the class is tailored more for Ancient Christianity students than for NT students. This is a great thing, but needs to be more explicit.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in deepening their familiarity and facility with the Greek language who is also interested in and has some prior knowledge of ancient Christianity. Even though I went into the class coming off of a semester of Patristics, the fact that, in practice if not on paper, a lot of knowledge seemed assumed I often felt out of place.",
    "Yes, great experience. Greek is always difficult, particularly twice a week, but it was the best Greek classroom experience I have had by far.",
    "This class should certainly be taken for someone wishing to study late-antiquity\/early Christianity. Based upon the readings we did in class, the course may be too specialized for students whose primary interests are not in Patristic Greek literature--especially if their Greek is not keen.For students who do have the interest and ability to take the course, it will not be wasted. The instructor for the course is especially good.",
    "Recommended. It will only improve your Greek-reading skills and, moreover, expose you to intriguing and useful material."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped my Greek skills and also widened my interests and knowledge in the Early Christian period.",
    "I'm a first year M.Div student, so I really have no dissertation\/research to speak of. My goal in taking the course was twofold: to learn a little more about ancient Christianity and to work on my Greek chops. While I still need to scurry through Liddell&Scott while translating, say, Basil, I now have a much easier time reading the New Testament which, as a seminarian, is my prime concern. As such, I'd say the course was a success, since I definitely feel prepared for an exegesis course on the Greek New Testament.",
    "Absolutely necessary to my dissertation research and field given that language skills are very important. It was a wonderful chance to study language for credit and not just translate mindlessly but actually approach the nuances of translation in a seminar as it should be handled at the graduate level. It was a great experience.",
    "The texts were very thought-provoking, as were the avenues of further research pursued in class. But, the Greek component could have been emphasized more. If nothing else, more time could have been devoted to resources for understanding later Greek texts, for pursuing word studies (i.e. an in-class walk-through of TLG), and for looking up meanings of particularly problematic words or prepositional phrases that occurred in the texts. This could even take the form of a short worksheet assignment (i.e. look up this word in all the major dictionaries, do a TLG search, discuss the grammar of a particular phrase and compare it to Attic Greek, etc.) The word studies we did captured some of this, but there wasn't enough guidance on these."
