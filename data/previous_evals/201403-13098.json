    "He is such a great professor! He really cares about his students, and is a really chill dude!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone questioning the issue of censorship. Professor Robinson is very accepting of the class regardless of nationalities and differing views on censorship are accommodated.Take it for your ideas to be challenged or challenge his as that is definitely welcomed as well.",
    "Fairly easy class and a great professor in addition to an interessing section topic. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the subject.",
    "I would recommend to students who are interested in censorship and writing.",
    "English 114 is overall a very useful course and Professor Robinson's section on Censorship and the Arts is great. A word of warning that the course is front-loaded and while there is a lot of work to begin with (with dense reading), this eased towards the end. Class discussions were generally very interesting and I enjoyed its fluid nature. Professor Robinson is a fair grader and his comments are useful (and occasionally even fun to read).",
    "Be prepared for a tough list of readings."
