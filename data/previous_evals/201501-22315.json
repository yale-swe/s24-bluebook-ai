    "This is a fun art history course with a minimal workload. The material is super interesting, and I genuinely enjoyed both lecture and section.",
    "I think that everyone should try to take this class as it brings a new perspective on major art works of the 20th century. It takes famous artists that we're all familiar with and really breaks down, asking what and why artists created what they did. You learn the motives behind each famous work and begin to understand abstract art, which is already a hard concept in itself. It's a little difficult in regards to breaking down the art pieces in visual and historical analysis because much of the work is almost too abstract and it begins to be hard to start writing about it. But overall, I definitely recommend this class!",
    "100%",
    "This is a survey of American art (mostly painting, photography, and sculpture) from around 1900-1980. It's a GREAT class if you are interested in art but don't know much about it.",
    "Overall fantastic course. You cover so many periods in modern American art, and while I didn't love the art from all of them, you will learn so much. Great class to take as an American Studies major, art history major, or if you are looking for an accessible art history class to take for the first time. The final paper was really cool-- you design your own art exhibition. Also Professor Raab is an amazing lecturer; I believe she'll be on sabbatical next year, but try to take a class with her the year after!",
    "Decent course- your standard art history class, two exams, short paper, long paper. The best part about the course for sure is being able to go see the real works from lecture in the YUAG during section. Bit difficult for a course to always stay inspirational when modern American art is overall not of terribly high quality.",
    "Great lectures. An essay, a project, a midterm, abd a final exam, so there's a lot of work at the end of the semester (both the project and the final are weighted very heavily). But you learn a lot! Most people were art\/art history\/history majors, so this is not as \"intro\" as some other classes, but the material is so cool.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Take i!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student!",
    "Great class!",
    "If the art appeals to you, the course will be fantastic. Prof Raab is an amazing lecturer. Readings, assignments, exams, and sections (by being in the gallery) provide excellent opportunities for deep engagement with the art. A fair bit of work: midterm (IDs, comparisons, essay); visual analysis paper (5 pages); final exam (cumulative: beware of 100+ images with exact dates!); exhibition catalogue essay (10 pages). Be wary of grading.",
    "Absolutely, even non art-history majors would love this class. We cover one of the most important periods in the history of American Art and I was blown away by how much I learned.",
    "Great class",
    "Great class. Great art. Take it if you're interested in art history or art at all.",
    "One of the best I've taken at Yale. The lectures are fantastic; I regretted enormously having to miss the few that I did. You have two paper assignments (5 pg, and 10 pg, the latter requiring you to design your own exhibit around whatever theme you come up with), a midterm exam, and a final exam. It's all very reasonable\/manageable, and so worth it to spend two days a week listening to Professor Raab share her insights into some of the most important\/exciting art of the 20th century (not to mention, 50 minutes per week walking around the YUAG for section). This class almost immediately went on my list of \"classes you must take,\" for when curious underclassmen asked. Don't miss it!",
    "Absolutely take this class",
    "really cool class if you are interested in 20th century american art. I felt like a came away from the class with a significantly better working knowledge, and its fun to go into the YUAG now and feel like I understand my surroundings.",
    "It's a focused art history class where you get to really understand the works that you study. The scope of the works chosen is still extensive enough that I felt like I did get an overview of modern art and issues in America. I would definitely recommend this class or any of Professor Raab's classes to a student in the major or especially to people just looking for an art history course. Her class will make you love the study of art.",
    "Modernism and Modernity was a really great course. Professor Raab is amazing and so personable, and the material is fascinating. As an art history major focusing on American art, this was basically my dream class. The final curatorial project was also a really great way to end the year and synthesize all that we had learned throughout the term. Writing a curatorial essay and designing our own exhibition made me think about art and writing in new ways, and really pushed me to make strong connections and think critically about American modern art. I would highly recommend this class, and any of Professor Raab's classes, to a fellow student!"
