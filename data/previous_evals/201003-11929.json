    "A great class for people who want to know more about the way we punish in the US, and the inequalities in our incarceration system. It gives a great overview of the different areas of inequality, and the material is interesting, although a little one sided. Reasonable amount of work, and Prof. Wildeman is nice and enthusiastic.",
    "This course was at once a broad and in depth study into the phenomenon of mass incarceration in the United States. Even as someone with no background in punishment, inequality, or sociology in general, I found it fascinating and incredibly relevant. There is some math in the readings (stats and modeling and such), but Wildeman's great at explaining the strengths and weaknesses of the tests if that's not your forte.",
    "YES. This class will help you articulate and support theories you may already believe about imprisonment's affect on inequality. Mass imprisonment is a fascinating American cultural phenomenon that I am glad to know more about. I have already started recommending this class to my friends.",
    "An excellent exploration of the topics relevant to incarceration: it rates, its connection with crime, its effect on the family, its effect on the neighborhood, its effect on health. It is a dynamic class with interesting readings and worthwhile discussions. You will learn a lot with a wonderfully dynamic professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings and class discussions will be eye opening for anyone who is unfamiliar with issues of racial and socioeconomic inequality in the US. Additionally, if you are more familiar with these issues the class will still teach you a lot you did not know. The course is substantial but not an overwhelming amount of work or reading compared with other seminars of this level. Even if you are not interested in sociology you should shop this class!"
