    "THST 302 is wonderful course about creating theatrical responses to the day's news. Working with JoAnne has been terrific! The class brought us to explore new ideas and make connections between today's world and the work we're creating. This course also introduced me to important theatrical directors and performers, whose work we studied throughout the semester.",
    "I did not have a positive experience in this course and would certainly not recommend it to any other student, so matter how interested he or she is in the subject matter. It consisted of many readings and assignments (plays, articles, museum visits, movies) that were thrown onto us at a great volume and then hardly discussed. Students performed pieces on everything from quotidian activities to items from the news. All were vigorous and negatively critiqued.",
    "I would not recommend this unless you are very very serious about going into theater or film (like I am) in which case you can at least salvage something from it. Otherwise, its a waste of your time"
