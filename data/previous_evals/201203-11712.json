   "comments": [
    "This is a great class taught by some of the best immunologists out there. It's definitely the most well-organized team taught class that I have taken, and the professors really know their stuff. The midterm and final were quite challenging but fair. The lectures are all chalk talks, so go to class and take good notes!",
    "Great class! You will learn SO MUCH about immunology and it's really a fascinating subject. Different lecturers come in to speak about the respective fields of expertise, so you get to learn about each subject from the leading researcher in the field. In terms of work, you'll need to study super hard to do well on the midterm and final because there is just so much information. Otherwise, there's 4 take-home questions that are pretty easy because you can use any resource you want, and section is laid-back. If you're at all interested in immuno take this class!",
    "Great class but the exams can be tough (and somewhat arbitrary). For example, the answer to a question might only have been known in the past four or so years (the textbook might not even have it) so it's difficult when it comes to grading for those questions. But the students who take this class are very hard-working and self-selecting, so it's not surprising that this class can seem very stressful at first. The TAs are great though (will and omotooke!) and some of the professors are excellent: David Schatz, Carla Rothlin and Ruslan Medzhitov!",
    "Very good upper level MCDB course. Interesting material, mostly good professors, and not too much work. Highly recommended for all MCDB majors and any others who have basic a biology background and interest in how the immune system works.",
    "This is a tough class and shouldn't be taken lightly, but it was fascinating. We learned so much about the immune system on such a detailed level, and we also learned about the big overarching questions that immunobiology has yet to answer. The workload on a day-to-day basis isn't bad--just four take-home questions (one page each) throughout the semester, section participation, a midterm, and a final. The hardest part is studying for the exams because there was so much material, but it is manageable.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Its a lot of material but its so good to know. You will challenge yourself and learn so much that is extremely useful as a scientist or doctor!",
    "A very cool upper level bio lecture.You're pretty much learning immunology from the people who invented it. Seriously. Not a lot of work and the exams are very reasonable if you put in the time to study a few days before.",
    "Highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in how your body fights off pathogens!!",
    "Great class. Very interesting material, taught by professors who are actually the experts in the field (people who discovered what you are learning).",
    "This course provided great and in-depth exposure to immunology. Its strengths include the expertise that it is able to give to students because of all of the different professors. Therein also lies its weakness - the course could benefit from more coordination on the professors end to make sure topics are lectured in order. That being said, you will learn so much about immunology. If you have the time to dedicate to this course, do yourself a favor and take it!",
    "Yes, 430 is an extremely interesting and manageable course that will provide you with a fundamental understanding on how our bodies prevent and respond to pathogens. Because of the variety of professors, some lectures are naturally much better than others.",
    "This class is AMAZING! The professors are all amazing (the Yale immunobiology dept is the best in the country) and give wonderful lectures. The TA's are great also. There is a midterm and a final and a few take-home short answer questions during the semester, so be prepared to keep up with the material on your own. The exams are difficult, but fair. Overall one of my favorite biology classes at Yale!",
    "I would recommend it if you're really interested in the material, but it's really hard. There are no weekly assignments, just four one-page take home assignments. It very difficult to keep up with the reading and teach yourself - you have to be really self-motivated. You can't cram for this before the exams, since there's a TON of material, more than any class I've taken here and I'd say 3-4x the material in Cell Bio (again, without any motivation to study by weekly quizzes). Your grade is based essentially on the midterm and final, and you lose points easily for not going into enough detail. Also, there are eleven professors with varying levels of teaching ability. So be careful when you take this! The material is fascinating though.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have already taken several advanced biology classes and you enjoyed cell bio.",
    "Team taught by Yale's renowned immunology department, this is the best biology course I have taken at Yale. A must take for sure.",
    "Take this class! It's a great class taught by leading experts in their respective fields!",
    "Yep, I'd recommend it. Great upper level bio course.",
    "My favorite biology course at Yale so far. The material is extremely interesting, and you're taught by some of the most brilliant minds in the field of immunobiology -- in the world. Be warned that it is a lot of reading and staying up-to-date with course material. I recommend forming a study group that meets weekly to review the week's material. That said, you don't have that many graded assignments (1 midterm, 1 final, 4 take-home assignments), and you don't have to do all the reading \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though it can certainly be helpful for some parts. Remember that this is an upper-level bio course, so the curve won't be as easy as you might expect from other bio courses. (You don't need the prereqs for the class though. I had taken neither cell bio nor biochem and was fine in the class.)Take really good notes in class. Don't be late; they start right at 9:25 a.m. Maybe helpful to tape record the lectures because the professors can go pretty fast.",
    "It's simultaneously very interesting and very, very hard. There are an imposible number of terms to learn but it is ultimately rewarding to fit all the pieces together and finally understand the basics of the immune system."
