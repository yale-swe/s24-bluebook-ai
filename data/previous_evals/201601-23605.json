    "Intro to adobe photoshop, audition, premiere, HTML\/CSS, a little bit of javascript but not enough to really understand it, Twine, character making, storytelling, gameplay.",
    "This course was a good course, though not necessarily what I thought it would be. I was hoping for more of a game design and study course, while Art of the Game was more of a storytelling course, with general multimedia lessons sprinkled in. That being said, it was a great outlet for creativity, which is critical when many other classes don't allow you to explore an artistic side. It was a fun class, the units were fun, the readings were interesting, I can't ask for much more.",
    "ART 007 stands out as a fun, unique way to learn important skills like how to work with the Adobe Creative Cloud, HTML, and other technologies that foster creativity. I loved making webpages, audio clips, and trailers, all while working with peers as interested in video games or telling stories as I was. Definitely take it if you have any interest in exploring games academically. Don't expect to make anything other than the simplest of games, thoughthe class's six modules are all about crafting narratives using different techniques, and you'll spend much more time telling stories than you will building levels or tweaking game mechanics."
