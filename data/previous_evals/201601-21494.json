   "comments": [
    "I would say if you want to work in global health or health you must take this course. If you're just interested in history, also take this class because the material is so interesting. This lecture helps you put real world situations in perspective that really shapes how you understand life and policy right now.",
    "A solid but pretty basic class that will attract those interested in global health, history of health or health in general.",
    "Take this class if you have an interest in global health! It is a really excellent introduction.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the sciences or the social sciences. It's incredibly engaging and incredibly relevant to current issues in global health (which relates to many different fields). Professor Radin is a wonderful lecturer and I always enjoy attending her class.",
    "This course is very engaging, and provides a very interesting set of perspectives on our modern world of global health. It is very well taught, and has a very reasonable workload. The class is truly what you make out of it, and you can focus on whatever topics you that intrigue you the most. The grading of the class, based upon two midterms and three papers, really gives students intellectual freedom to explore the subjects of the class and find meaning amid the large amount of content introduced.",
    "I would recommend this for a freshman or sophomore, but not a junior or senior who's looking for something more focused on depth than breadth.",
    "Highly recommend. ESSENTIAL for anyone that wants to pursue a career into global health.",
    "Interesting class that covers a wide range of topics that overlap with other courses in thought-provoking ways. Not too hard, but definitely go to lecture and the exams will be a breeze. Each student is assigned a country and must follow it through its history to write 3 papers throughout the course. The 3 papers were actually pretty fun to research and write, and helped me learn a ton about my country and the region in general.",
    "Health 280 maps the historical trends of global health from its beginnings, and gives a good understanding of the historical factors that shape global health today. It's a decent amount of reading with two weekly lectures and a mandatory section.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in global health, history, both or neither. Professor Radin is an amazing lecture and if you're ready to commit the time to do all the assignments and readings well, you will have a great overall experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's not a ton of work, and the subject material is super interesting. If you are already pretty familiar with global health, some of this might be review, but it's still a great class. Professor Radin and the teaching staff are great, too!",
    "Take it! Take it! Take it! Just do it. It sounds like the most random class ever but it's amazing. Joanna Radin will teach you things you never knew or thought about. This course inspired me to become a history major! It's a great course for freshmen and sophomores looking for something new and interesting. It's a very chill course and a great HU credit even if you're not a humanities person, without being a gut at the same time. Midterm and final were both very fair and just require you to know what you should know. The research papers were really interesting and fun to write because I got to do a lot of archival research. They'll vary in difficulty depending on which country you're assigned to. The readings are super interesting and you really ought to do them. You'll want to go to every lecture because they're great and Prof Radin's the best!",
    "fantastic course!!!! a must take! assigned a country at beginning of semester and follow your country for every paper through the centuries",
    "A fun HSHM class! Take it if you want to learn more about global health (though I'm still not sure what the difference between global health and public health is to be honest). Don't take it if you don't care. That's pretty much true for all humanities classes at Yale, though... Anywho. Very well taught, interesting material, boring-but-not-murderously-dull-and-long readings. I would recommend this class.",
    "This class is fantastic and very interesting. I would definitely recommend, although it could afford to be a bit more challenging.",
    "I enjoyed!! Papers are hard to write but the rest of the class is enjoyable.",
    "It was a pretty good class. We went over a lot of important global health issues that weren't even apparent to me. I feel more informed after taking this class. It was a little more work than I wanted because we had 3 papers and a midterm and final, but it wasn't actually that bad. The papers were sort of cool though.",
    "Yes, would recommend.",
    "Overall HSHN 212 was an amazing class! We learned a lot about health throughout the ages in league, then had the opportunity to look at these topics by being assigned one country and writing about different health problems brought the different eras. Overall I learned a lot about health in genera, as well as a lot of interesting information about health in my own country. Overall an amazing class, and I would HIGHLY recommend it!",
    "Such an interesting course, recommended to anyone interested in hshm, general history, public health, and everything else. Loved it.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class! It was really interesting and a very useful class for those thinking about going into the health sector.",
    "This class is wonderful for anyone interested in a new view of global health. This class does much more than teach you about historical events in the field, it sheds a new light on motivations, relationships, and politics affecting every public health decision and initiative. Overall, just a very good class.",
    "It's a decent course. Not anything to write home about, in my view. I think the course suffers from being a little too broad and not delving into detail on any one event or time period. A pretty large amount of reading is assigned, not all of which is really necessary to function effectively in section discussions. One neat thing about the course is the individual assignment of a country to each student, about which your course papers will be written. That's a nice chance to go into detail in one area of knowledge, but I felt that was really the only one that was built into the course. I took it as a Credit\/D, but it would make a nice fifth class as well as it isn't an extreme amount of work.",
    "HSHM 212 is an excellent introduction into the field of global health. Not only do you learn what \"global health\" means today, but you learn how this field has come together over the last several hundred years. For pre-med students thinking about doing some type of global health work, I think this class is perfect for you to learn what you are getting yourself into. In terms of coursework: there is one midterm, one final, and three 5-page papers. The tests are both very easy, and the essays are pretty straight forward and short. Meet with your TA to see how he or she likes the essays to be done - for example my TA preferred creative pieces and once I figured that out it was easy breezy and beautiful.",
    "Decent class. 3 essays, a midterm and final. But, despite that it didn't feel like too much work. If you're interested in the subject matter, take it.",
    "Good class, definitely take it if you're interested in global health or want to take a cool history class. 3 short papers on a specific country--can be a little challenging at first but gets easier and was a cool way to learn the course material. Midterm and final that were both very fair and reasonable. Section also. Lecture is pretty engaging, Joanna is quirky but cool",
    "Great intro history class. Not too difficult and covers many topics within global health",
    "I loved this course! Professor Radin is amazing, and the course is a valuable asset to anyone interested in medicine, global\/public health, or history. Covers a lot of material, but does so very well, following key themes across time periods. Highly recommend to anyone interested in HSHM, or looking for a fun, engaging course.",
    "YES. AMAZING LECTURES. TAKE IT. YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH.",
    "If you are interested in the global health field in any way, this is a good intro class to learn about the basics and the history of the area.",
    "Hist 146 01 is an interesting class that teaches you a lot about the complexities of trying to save the world. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who plans to go into public health or even just anyone who wants to do charity work around the world. Much in the same way that economics and history teach you why certain solutions that seem obvious don't work (i.e. printing more money), this class shows how seemingly clear solutions to health problems have gone wrong and encourages you to imagine problems more complexly. Also, Professor Radin gives great lectures and you will definitely learn something new every day.",
    "It is a great class! Please take it!",
    "Yes, this is such an important class to take.",
    "Looking at the realm of global health starting countless centuries ago. Amazing course",
    "Great class if you want to learn more about global health! You get to look into a country that you can really engage with whilst learning big global and western impacts on world health.",
    "Historical Perspectives on Global Health is a great introduction to global health that covers topics ranging from the Columbian Exchange to the founding of the World Health Organization. The lectures are fantastic, the course is well taught, and the readings are engaging. The opportunity to write three papers on a single country also gives you the opportunity to go very in depth with your particular region. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the History of Science and Medicine and Global Health. Take the class! You'll love it!",
    "The material is really enlightening and definitively a must-take for anyone interested in global health. Joanna Radin is a great lecturer, she is entertaining and engaging. The exams are fair. There are three 5-page papers written about a country you are assigned to. Honestly, the difficulty of the papers depends on the country you get, and mine was really hard. I never spent so much time on a 5 page paper before but it was difficult for me to find good, relevant sources about health care in English before the 20th century. There is also so so so so much reading, so either anticipate allocating a lot of time for weekly readings or have the skills to BS through section.",
    "A great history course. The three papers are all short and fun to write, and the midterm and final were both very fair. It was an engaging class that I think mostly everyone will enjoy.",
    "If you're already serious about global health, do not take this class. It is perfect for people looking for an easy extra class, a simple introduction to the field, or something to fill some sort of requirement, and not a lot else.",
    "HSHM 212 is a great class to take if you want an overview of how global public health has evolved. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the information, the lectures and the sections are very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class, it's easy enough to do well if you're interested and pay attention and it's very engaging for a large lecture. The assignments are creative and more fun to complete than stressful and the exams are very straightforward. This will not be a challenging class but a pleasant way to spend a credit.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I was dubious as to how much I would actually learn, but professor Radin made me think about the importance of history and how much of the difficulties faced in global health today can be overcome by looking back to lessons from the past.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to other students, especially those who are interested in global health. The country assignments for the semester were very unique and allowed each student to become an expert on one country.",
    "I would recommend this IF you like history a lot. If you are in it for the Global Health stuff I dont think you will learn much.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in health or development at all. It was a fascinating, well-taught course, and one of my favorites that I have ever taken"
