    "Strengths: the writing assignments were helpful, and the feedback was much appreciated Weaknesses: discussion most days was like pulling teeth - painful and awkward. Given that most of our engagement with texts occurred in our conversations as a class, this was disappointing. As I talked with students outside of class, none of us had an idea of why we were reading the texts on the syllabus, perhaps we needed a clearer idea of why the course included the texts it did? On a related note: at least half of the class was not engaged every week. People with laptops and tablets were visibly on facebook, checking email, doing other work, and the like for the whole semester. Perhaps in future iterations of this course electronics should be banned in order to make a productive learning environment for everyone. I do think the fact that the class was pass\/fail meant that people chose not to do the work - I heard this from many of my classmates. Perhaps using the standard grading system would improve student engagement?",
    "I do not think that this class should be a requirement for all PhD students in Religious Studies. My time would have been better spent taking a different course."
