    "This class focuses heavily on theory! Be cautious, if you aren't aware of IR theories, then you will face difficulties in this class. They're are covered once in the beginning of the semester and after that, every assignment refers back to them. Including the final. In addition this class DOES have a lot of assignments. 2 readings responses (originally 3 but b\/c of poor scheduling it was canceled- may not be the case next time), 1 memo assignment, 2 days of a Mock UN trial, and a midterm paper. It seemed that whenever we were almost done with one assignment, the next one was being handed out in class. You never really get the satisfaction of finishing an assignment b\/c there's no real break in between any of them.Overall this was a good class, Prof. Cashore is fun lecturer but has tendency to go on tangents and ends up rushing through the end of his slides. Readings are a bit lengthy and repetitive, but can be interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning about policy - we talked a lot about climate change and forestries, and then touched on fisheries very slightly at the end of the semester. I thought it was a very informative course.",
    "Good class. Lots of long assignments, but is manageable and is a good introduction to international environmental governance.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. There are probably other classes that are more flexible and would learn just as much.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend you take this course. The first two lectures made during shopping period were definitely, by far, the best two he ever made - probably because they were the only two he had actually written. For the rest of the semester, he used powerpoints made by other people in the field. Certainly, Dan Esty, Gus Speth, Graeme Auld, etc., are all fantastic and have contributed a lot in terms of thinking about international environmental policy, but Ben Cashore is the one teaching the class. If I want to have slides read to me aloud in class, no thank you, that's something I can do on my own.There's a lot of reading, many assignments here and there, and an extremely unfairly structured final; if you're going to give students the questions ahead of time, just make it a take home. The process of memorizing essay plans then struggling to get down all the ideas I'd brainstormed before hand in the span of 3 hours was excruciating.Please note that they grade hard. Very hard. This is the one class where I really tried to produce noteworthy work, and I'm probably in the B range - nothing to sneer at, but disappointing after all the work I've put in.What made this class enjoyable for me was the section experience. Stefan was a good TA, but more importantly the people in my section were amazing. We had a great vibe going, and bounced off each other's ideas to produce some really good discussions. All my true learning was done in section; in comparison, lecture was pretty irrelevant. I consistently left section feeling like I'd done something substantial and academically refreshing - definitely not a feeling I often get from section.As a whole, students in the class (all 12 of us) were all extremely motivated by the topic, which helped make the class worth it.Essentially, if the other people in the class are fantastic, the TA seems good, and you're extremely interested in the material, consider it.",
    "International Environmental Policy and Governance is much like its title: interesting but a bit wordy. The topics are fascinating and incredibly pertinent, but the readings are long and the lectures are often disorganized. Professor Cashore is great, but is the epitome of the enthusiastic yet absent-minded professor.Overall, I would recommend this course if you get Stefan as a TA. A great TA made this course incredibly enjoyable and helped us really understand and discuss the topics.",
    "Definitely recommended.",
    "Interesting, but a lot of reading and work. A little frustrating in terms of expectations vs. time and ability."
