    "The course taught me a great deal about social movement theory and how it has developed over the decades. It was a valuable introduction to the vocabulary needed to understand different elements of collective action. However it lacked in exposing us to the \"Islamic\" portion of the course in \"Islamic Social Movements\". I wish we had had the opportunity to engage with the Islamic elements of the movements we studies and to understand their variations. It might have been useful to have guest speakers or lecturers on this topic, or to become familiarized with Islamic theology and its development throughout the centuries as well.",
    "The course had a great syllabus, well informed professors, and good topic. I wish the students in the class participated more.",
    "I think that this class should have some pre-requisites or a disclaimer that it is preferable to have some background information about the Islamic world before enrolling. This is an intense class that requires a lot of heavy analysis. THIS IS NOT AN INTRO COURSE!"
