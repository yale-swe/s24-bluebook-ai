    "In the lab, you will learn about features of all of the important insect families, some families of spiders, and other arthropod orders. It has a strong focus on insectan hexapods, so if you're into all types of arthropods, this class might not be for you. But everyone who takes this course falls in love with bugs. We spend the entire semester working on a collection of 90 families of insects. It's such a rewarding project - not only do you actively learn how to ID insects, you also come out with a small personal museum. The weekend trip to Great Mountain Forest (Yale has its own camp!) and the fall break trip to Florida were absolutely incredible. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. But, be warned: it is a ton of work. You have to take the lecture course along with the lab, but you will do more than twice the amount of work for this lab than the lecture. And a lot of the work is just pure memorization. Still, you will love every second of the work that you do. Don't take this course with a heavy course load, but definitely, absolutely, take this course.",
    "I almost don't want to tell anyone how fabulous this class was, for fear that the entire school will try and sign up next fall. It was pure and utter joy. I have never learned so much (it's actually a lot of work! Make sure you like systematics\/don't mind memorizing organismal latin names!) and had so much fun at the same time. Ideal combination of hands-on, book and lab learning.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It was literally my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale. It is so much fun and you learn a lot. You go on a bunch of field trips (and go to Florida!) and make an insect collection-- which ends up being your pride and joy by the end of the semester. One word of caution though; it is a lot of work. There is a lot of memorization and time commitment, especially toward the end of the semester when all the identifying for the collection gets done. Don't view it as a 0.5 credit class-- more like a 1 or 1.5 credit one. But the amount of work is TOTALLY worth it. The material is awesome and Marta is amazing.",
    "Best. Thing. Ever. Seriously. Marta is awesome, and she chooses the best TAs. You will learn so much about arthropods, and have way to much fun chasing bugs in the field. The end of the class is really hectic, because you're scrambling to identify your last families of insects, and everyone is trading bugs and spending all night in lab and going crazy from staring through a microscope at Coleoptera abdomens...but it is so worth it. I'm pretty sure everyone in my class wanted the lab to last another semester. And you go to Florida over break. I mean, really. How could it get any better.",
    "This class was AWESOME! I learned more in this class than any other class this semester and also spent by far the most time on this collection. Start your identifying early! ALSO YOU GET TO GO TO FLORIDA FOR FREE! You bond a lot with the other students in the class. It is super fun and educational but also a ton of work.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. You have to take it with the lecture, but the two courses really complement each other and you'll really learn a lot by the end of the year, from identification to general arthropod biology. This course was amazing. You spend the entire course working on a museum-style pinned insect collection. You are graded on how many taxonomical families you collect (this year it was 90 families plus some other non-hexapod families). You take many field trips in the beginning of the year--including a three-day trip to a Yale owned forestry station in NW Connecticut and a four-day trip to Florida during fall break. Absolutely fantastic. One of the best courses at Yale. Be prepared to put in some work, though. Weekly quizes on how to identify families in insect orders and questions on general collecting technique. Also at the end of the semester, you'll need to put in a significant amount of time outside of class to finish your collection. As long as you study and don't slack, you'll do fine in the course. The class members also typically become a pretty friendly group so class is enjoyable. The TAs are usually very amazing as well.",
    "Take it if you wanna get the feeling of bugs.",
    "It's outstanding! One of the most memorable courses I've taken here. If you are not committed to doing fieldwork (long hours of catching bugs) don't take it. That said, it makes the lecture so much better and really for me the whole point of taking it was the lab. Furthermore, the number of hours you put in means you get really tight with the group of students you're working with. Great class for budding or already accomplished naturalists, scientists, and people who like catching bugs (and memorizing endless lists of bug families to regurgitate on quizzes... but thats another story).",
    "This was the most memorable course I have taken at Yale - you get totally immersed in the world of insects by going out into the field and creating your own collection, which you get to keep at the end. You get to go on an awesome collecting trip to Florida over Fall Break, and plenty of other places in CT. However, it is a large time commitment for 1\/2 credit - there are weekly quizzes and you will spend your entire reading week identifying insects instead of studying for other classes.",
    "Downsides: quiz most weeks, large time commitment (especially since you get only half a credit).Upsides: very committed, friendly professor, many fun field trips to collect insects (we went to Florida over fall break)"
