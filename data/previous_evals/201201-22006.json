    "This class is pretty good. The workload is light and it's a nice way to get a social science credit. Professor Sanneh is nice and really low key and so the class is really chill. It's just three short reading responses, a presentation and a final paper. The final paper is interesting and the presentations can be kind of fun depending on your class. She's quite strict with the reading responses, but it's overall a straightforward, interesting class.",
    "I would recommend it another student if he or she wanted to learn about the issues that pertain to South Africa. This class was a specific focus on a country, and a lot of my friends from other colleges have said that they've never heard of a class that was so specific to learning just one country in Africa. It's this focus that ultimately makes one learn slowly about Africa in general. Even non-Africans can slowly learn about Africa starting from this class. I loved it and I hope that a lot of my fellow Africans take this class. Anyone who is interested in African issues must take this class.",
    "I would summarize this course as a rather easy class but one that can seem irrelevant and that you may not get a lot out of, especially if you do not consciously commit yourself to the work. Linguistics and African Studies majors will appreciate the material much more than anyone else and will feel that they learned a lot through the readings (maybe not through the class itself though).",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Some of the readings are interesting, but you will not learn anything in class. Also, you will never be able to tell how you are doing in the class because you probably will not get your grades for months or at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you're interested in linguistics take it."
