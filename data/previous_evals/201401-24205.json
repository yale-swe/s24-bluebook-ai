    "I'm copying in some of my answer to the professor question because I think Craig really makes the class. It's a fascinating idea on its own and the syllabus demonstrates how broad but discerningly the net was cast for creating a history of the kinetic image through architecture, photo, film, design, etc. It's a nearly impossible class to describe to other people but by far my most interesting one. Craig is a phenomenal professor, engaging, sensitive, interested in students' ideas, and brilliant. He is at once one of the most well-spoken and efficient lecturers I've had -- each class is a smoothly organized discourse that covers more material (in incisive, interesting ways) than most lecturers I've had could cover in three. His organization and preparation is clear, but he is never rote. The material of this class is a bit esoteric and it's a hard class to describe to other people -- the history of the kinetic image? -- but that only makes it the more exciting when placed in good hands. Craig is extremely knowledgable well beyond the bounds of what this class could accomplish. I only wish there was more time to do it in. Shop the first class -- I walked in on a whim because I left a terrible class the floor above. I knew immediately this would be one where I actually described to my friends what we talked about that day.",
    "The class studies the ways in which movement and time have engaged questions of space over time though the medium of film. As such, it studies both the spatial implications of film from two vantage points: the image and the architecture that supports the image. It was a very inspiring course that I would encourage fellow students to take.",
    "I would recommend this to another student in a heartbeat. A really interesting class. A refreshing lens for looking at (on some occasions) well-worn material. A young professor who is really engaged with the topic and content. I think these fresh ideas, from a (in terms of academia) young mind, should be championed.",
    "Really fascinating lecture about the interaction between architecture and film in the 20th century. Buckley discussed a wide range of visual sources, from German expressionist films to Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis to World Fairs\u2019 pavilions to Blade Runner. The readings aren\u2019t very long but can be quite conceptually dense.",
    "If Architecture and the Kinetic Image is offered again, take it. It's a weird course, no question about it, and it's unclear whether it should rightly be considered a course in History of Art, as it's simultaneously about the history of film and architecture, urban space and aesthetics. The course is about the ways that the development of cinema interacted with the development of architecture, but is ultimately not about historical facts so much as it is about developing a new way of reading both architecture and film with an eye to their fundamental inseparability. Professor Buckley's approach is sharp and refreshing, he is a virtuosic lecturer and a joy to witness. Some advice: make sure to attend all the screenings, not because lectures are inaccessible without them (they're not) but because hearing Professor Buckley share his readings of films was one of the most illuminating and exciting parts of the course. Professor Buckley moves extremely quickly and everything is packed full of content, but lectures can get a bit monotonous during the latter half of the course as the subject matter shifts away from cinema and towards a strange counter-history (if that), so take note and don't miss any of the introductory lectures!"
