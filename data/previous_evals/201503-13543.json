    "Good that the student group was a small number (I liked also diversity of students - divinity, F&ES & SOM --> try to keep this in future) Although the next-to-class material was a lot of work I found the weekly reflections very helpful. Very important concepts and profound reflections on role of humans on earth. I liked the idea of students preparing the sessions. Loved the cosmic walk and the trip to the observatory! Good material that supported class (books, video, ...) For some classes people shared very personal feelings & experiences - felt like a small family, supporting community. Liked the multiple choice options for the personal reflection. Great Job.",
    "Flipped class allows for work on your own time, and to go into depth when possible.",
    "Viewing 14 B years of universe history. Time to consider the universe of matter and energy and whether there might be anything else. Discussion. Time to reflect in writing, comment on reflections of others, time to receive comments from others. Considering how we might tell a story in which we live, and why this might be valuable. The professors truly care about biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. A way to see us a truly part of the universe rather than apart or some how in charge.",

   "comments": [
    "students preparations for sessions (especially for second students presenting discussion questions) were almost always cut short (only 10-15min left to discuss topics). Maybe have the 2 students prepare the course material together. Maybe include more exercises where groups can discuss together topics and then present to all people - I found them very powerful. --> sometimes in class always the same students were talking. Most of the students had very interesting posts - how can all of the students be made to read them or how can they be integrated more fully into the class discussions? Focus in the end more on next steps: how can we integrate this learning into life? How can we share more of this with people? --> action plan for student & eventually report back after next semester. Maybe integrate a scientist into professor group? Have this double aspect of science & religion.",
    "If there are too many students, it can become a real challenge to engage with them all. It is definitely a balance to be struck. Sometimes posts can become repetitive and it is difficult to engage online after seeing the same types of responses over and over."

The concepts and take-aways (relationship between religion, science, policy,...) of how we talk about environment and our relationship with nature is of high importance. I also very much appreciated the positive aspect and hopefulness that you can gain - given that environmental protection\/action can for some people sometimes be depressing to work on this course material gives us strength and the ability for wonder. Thank you for this important contribution. '--> how can the course be scaled to a larger public?",

There is quite some work next to class related to it so make sure you plan for that. However, the work is not very hard but you will gain a lot of benefits having 6 weeks to reflect on the topic taught.",
    "Anyone with an interest in ecology and an appreciation for higher thought, meaning making, and different ways of knowing, should take at least one course taught by these professors. Take the time to engage with the readings, media, fellow students, and come ready to discuss in class. Your eyes will be opened and hopefully the way you understand the world around you will evolve.",
