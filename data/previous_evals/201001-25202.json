   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it only if you're a neuroscience psych major and need your research methods requirement or you really want to train rats. While training rats is super cool, it is a big time commitment, and has virtually nothing do to with your mark as its geared towards two hard tests (1 midterm, 1 final) and an experimental report. The marking is tough, and the lectures are very boring at times, but if you want to train rats, go for it.",
    "maybe",
    "If you're looking for an easy way out of the Research Methods requirement, I wouldn't take this course. But if you're looking for something different and if you're interested in delving into this particular topic, then go for it.",
    "not if you don't have to.",
    "I actually would recommend it because the material is interesting, it's fun to interact with the rats, and there was--at least when I took the class--a really pleasant camaraderie between some of the students. Also, I hear the other methodology class options are boring, which this one wasn't, and the professor does seem to try to make it quite feasible to get a satisfactory grade.",
    "Most people probably take this course for the psych data collection requirement and\/or for the neurobio track requirement - I did. I'm not a neurobio concentrator, and honestly, I wasn't thrilled with having to take this class - but it was 100 times better than I ever expected. You spend a lot of time the first two weeks running virtual rat simulations, but after that the lab requirement was very chill (feeding once a day unless you can trade with your partner, for 10 minutes; and about four weeks of a few more hours per week for training, none of which is difficult at all). The exams are very fair and Professor Wagner is brilliant. He's a bit reserved, but if you take good notes and study for the exams sufficiently, you'll be able to realize that his lectures are actually very well-structured and that he sneaks in more information than you realize. For the first time in my life I understand why someone would want to be a research scientists as a career. TAKE IT!!! it's a FANTASTIC option in comparison to the data collection fall lecture course.",
    "Don't take it just to get a Sc credit. Take it only if you are interested in the material or you have to take a research methods course asap.",
    "Most who take this class probably have no other choice. (E.g. neuro-track majors who took 160.) Although it only meets twice a week and the homework is light, one does have to feed one's and one's partner's rats every other day, which makes for many treks up to Dunham. And training the rats to do things means nearly daily sessions. That being sad, the rats are really cute and fun to work with, and it's gratifying to see the results of the conditioning at the end. One can adopt one's rat at the end to.My biggest suggestion is to shop this class first: make sure that you can take Prof. Wagner's lecture style and make sure the TF is approachable and the kind of person who'll be willing to help. It'll make the class much better for everyone.",
    "This class gives you a great opportunity to really get hands on experience with some basic training methods and understand in more details the methods behind some very important studies. I would recommend it if you are very interested in these. However, you should know that the lab component takes a great deal of time and should be prepared to make that commitment if you take this class",
    "I would recommend the course. I would just warn them that it takes up a lot of time (with feedings and weighing of rat every day around 30 minutes) and on top of that the training sessions around 4-6 sessions per week. The exams require a lot of studying as well and the final paper can be a bit challenging.",
    "Do it. Its a small lecture with one of the most famous professors in the field."
