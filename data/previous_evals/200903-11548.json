    "Yes.",
    "If you don't have to take it, think twice. You learn a lot, but it takes up your life. The assignments take about 20 wres each, so you'll spend quite a few nights in watson.",
    "teaches you about computer architecture (how computers do what they do) and programing in c and perl\/python\/ruby. lectures are usually unrelated to programing assignments.",
    "CPSC 323 is a great class that is worth all the work you put into it...and that's a lot. If you wish to vastly improve your programming and learn a lot about computers as well, and don't mind giving away 10 hours per week, then go ahead. As I have said before, Professor Eisenstat is truly a great instructor, so the quality of teaching isn't an issue. Word of advice: talk to him, and the TA, as regularly as you want. If something isn't clear, send an email. Trust me, don't learn the hard way that no man is an island.",
    "In lectures and on exams, you learn about machine architecture, computer organization and operating systems at a level that allows you to work well with the material without having to memorize too much about specific implementations. The programming assignments will allow you to apply some of that knowledge, but mostly just give you practice writing complicated C programs and some fairly simple scripts. The exams are thorough but fair. The material is maybe a bit too in-depth for non-majors, but for those with a strong interest in computing it can be fun.",
    "CPSC 323 is an extremely intense course in low-level computing. You study memory, architecture, parallel computing, error detection, and systems programming. The material can certainly be boring at times because it feels more like engineering than theory, but you definitely come out of the course understanding how computers work at a very deep level. You will also learn how Linux works and will be an expert in using the command line. This is absolutely not a course to take lightly and should never, ever be taken Cr\/D\/F. It is impossible to overestimate the amount of time you will spend on this course - each C program will take about 25 hours on average and the smaller ones will take about 10. Expect it to affect both your social life and your performance in other classes in very real ways. The single best thing you can do when you take this course (or 223 for that matter) is to go to office hours and ask Prof. Eisenstat for help whenever you need it. Once I realized that he is happy to answer lots of questions about the assignments, I started doing much better in the class.",
    "Definitely, but only if you're a CS major!",
    "Tough course! We had seven assignments. Here are the breakdowns:HW1 - 19:06HW2 - 6:55HW3 - 26:33HW4 - 7:07HW5 - 20:34HW6 - 26:45HW7 - 17:59Plus two exams. Programming assignments are mad hard and count for 70% of your grades; exams are pretty mild and count for 30% of your grade. So if you put time into your homework, you're pretty much guaranteed to do well in this class. And he gives about 50% of the class A's and A-'s.Eisenstat is a very helpful person and I think tries very hard to help you out, but YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS AND SEND HIM EMAIL. Otherwise, he assumes you have no problems and doesn't make the effort to approach you. Talk to the man and he can give you extensions on assignments and\/or wave lateness penalties for you. Ask him any sorts of questions and he will answer.This is a tough course, but if you start early, ask for help, talk problems out with classmates, it is manageable and somewhat fun along the way.",
    "If you are a comp sci major obviously have to take this course, but that isn't a bad thing. If you aren't and are still considering taking this course after reading all the reviews maybe you should consider being a comp sci major. Over the course of the semester you can expect to put a bit over 100 hours into the programming assignments and maybe 20 hours total on readings and test preparation (although you probably can get away with less than that - make sure to pay attention in lecture!). If you push off the assignments until a couple days before they are due they can be very painful. If you get started early though, they are actually enjoyable and you learn a lot from them. Take it to learn systems level C programming. Take it to learn a scripting language. Take it because you love the zoo.",
    "You have to take the class if you want to major. Otherwise, don't. It's too much work for any other schedule.",
    "I have mixed feelings about 323. They fall into a few categories:The overly bitter\/cynical left-brainer: This is not a course that can be recommended. If you are a CS major you have to take it. if not and you are reading these reviews then you have a specific reason that you need to take this class or you are just a fool.The self-satisfied academic d-bag: This class was A LOT of work and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone without a strong background in coding and cs. It will take a lot of time so I wouldn't take it if you are carrying 5 credits. That being said, this class was extremely gratifying and educational. The assignments really help you build your programming chops and expose you to real world coding problems - like building a command shell or a file compressor. Any self-respecting cs student needs to take this class.The burnout\/faux-burnout: Fuck this class. There are 7 programming assignments. 3 were in perland took about 8 hours each. The rest easily take between 30 and 40 hours each. The workload is ridiculous and every week a pset is do will be completely ruined by this class. Actual class time is a snorefest btw.The thinks-he's-to-clever-for-his-own-good tool: See above.",
    "323 is hard, but you wouldn't be reading here without not already knowing that. Let's put it this way: Professor Eisenstat seeks to have approximately 100 hours of programming time spread across the course. That's not reading time, planning time, class time, or study-session time; that's programming time. Assignments can easily take up to 20 hours, and if you're trying to put that all in a single week, well, I think you know what happens. And no, you're not special. It really is going to take you 100 hours of programming time to finish the coursework, most likely more.That being said, this course is not impossible, as many would make it seem. If you start early and put in your time, you can get an A. If you like programming, by all means, take this, even if you're not a computer science major. It's not going to ruin your life, and if you're prepared, you can do it.",
    "Highly recommended, especially if you are a computer science major. This course gives you a very solid foundation in computer organization and C programing. The workload is indeed heavy, but definitely manageable if you start early.",
    "Good introduction to a variety of topics. You get very very familiar with C, and how computers work (on a purely conceptual level). The C programming assignments, though conceptually straightforward, were challenging. They were a reflection of not only your programming skills, but also how well you can plan ahead and organize. AvoidFollow the Professor's advice at the start of the year: start your problem sets early",
    "It's a required class for CS, you either have take it or you don't. As most other people will mention, it is A LOT of time. The in-class portion and exams are fairly easy and just require that you go to class and pay attention, but the programming assignments are LONG. In total, I believe people spent about 100-105 hours across the semester, which is why it's a lot more work than other classes. Enjoy taking this class!",
    "323 is difficult, but totally doable--if you actually start assignments early\/in time, then you'll be fine, and it leaves time to ask questions (which you should!). However, make sure you have a solid grounding in programming in general, and C in particular, first--i.e. by taking 223 the previous spring! There's a lot of assumed base knowledge here.If you're interested in 'hardcore' programming it's well worth taking--you learn a lot on the systems side, and it does wonders for how you approach, let alone do, programming. Prof. Eisenstat is a great lecturer and _always_ there for you."
