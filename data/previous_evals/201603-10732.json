    "I discovered an interest in poetry and drama that I didn't realize I had. More importantly, I developed my ability to pick apart and analyze my own writing more effectively.",
    "This course taught me how to write poetry and helped me discover both my strengths and my weaknesses in creative writing.",
    "-Understanding of how to make my writing sharper\/clear\/overall better -More focus on poetry writing than short story\/drama",
    "how to extricate one's interpretation of the text from how the author is actually creating the text & what techniques they are using etc. introspective insight. creating images in poetry. characterization. etc.",
    "In this class I feel that I earned the right to call myself a writer. By reading abundant works by accomplished authors in each of the course's focal genres and hearing from successful Yale affiliates directly in a series of talks I gained a sense of what it takes to write well and where the necessary material can come from. I learned more about the functions of three separate genres of creative writing: fiction, poetry and literature, and I had the opportunity to experiment with each and to begin to find a voice within them. Professor Deming's genius was one of the best resources I have found at Yale, and his feedback in class and on written work both helped to fix problematic spots in my writing and empowered me to believe in my stories.",

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this course and appreciate that it made me write consistently. I also liked that we explored so many different types of creative writing. Sometimes, however, I felt unprepared for the assignments. I also feel that the course presumes you know some things about creative writing and its genres already, which was difficult for me at times. For example, we would be told to write an epistolary poem for homework, but would not talk about what an epistolary poem was in class. While instructions were posted on Canvas, I wish we had been able to discuss the assignments and ask questions before having to turn them in. I also wish we had been given more prompts for assignments, as having to come up with a premise or pick a prompt from some other source and write a piece in only a few days was difficult sometimes. I was also surprised by the amount of reading we had to do some days and wished that instead of reading longer texts, we could read only short excerpts and write more instead.",
    "The guest lectures were fantastic. Workshopping was very useful and helpful. I only wish the fiction unit and drama unit were longer, because it feels like we rush through them-- the semester is short, though.",
    "Strengths: great feedback from Professor Deming, who is a wonderful, kind, and smart man Weaknesses: class discussion was not always engaging, perhaps because of the texts that we read... I think we could have read more \"great works\" in addition to the contemporary material",
    "This course does a superb job of introducing creative writing, with a survey of brilliant works, insightful class discussions, and quality guest visits from great writers. It definitely helps you discover your own unique strengths and weaknesses as a writer, and class discussion at its best was amazing. One thing that can be improved is how the assignment deadlines align with the readings. Sometimes we'd have an assignment for a particular type of work due before we even discussed that kind of work in class, which can be frustrating because then there's a lack of guidance for that particular assignment.",
    "Strengths: I had an INCREDIBLE teacher. Deming is by far the best, and I wouldn't take it without him Weaknesses: The occasional lectures weren't really that helpful, and honestly more class time\/workshopping with Deming would've been much better",
    "amazing course tbh.",
    "For me this course was all strengths, aside from minor logistical restrictions that are unfortunately unavoidable in a semester long survey course. The largest strength of the course is the faculty that runs it. I was lucky enough to take this class with Richard Deming, who aside from his brilliance, is obviously dedicated to the art of creative writing as well as his students. It was consistently clear that Professor Deming was available throughout the semester to discuss work and help push his students to move toward full potential. I also appreciated that I was able to try all three genres myself. This made it clear to me the purposes each form serves and where I could most effectively find expression. I only wish I had more time to really delve into each genre and improve each piece, but I feel I have been given an exciting launch toward doing this.",
    "It seemed as though in the second half of the semester, we spent most of our time workshopping other students rather than learning about literary forms, which was sometimes frustrating. However, the course does a very good job of introducing students to creative writing by forcing them to engage in it, and revise their work.",
    "Strengths - Pushes us to write in different forms of writing. Students evaluate each others' works. Weaknesses - no major weaknesses",
    "Personalized grading bc small class",
    "strength in the close analysis of the materials, the exercises and constant feedbacks. however, wish there was more of such teachings than the workshops. really learned a lot through reading and discussing."

    "Absolutely take this class with Deming. Not a question. Do it. He is extraordinarily helpful and will challenge you and your writing. He also fosters an atmosphere of community within the class that is welcoming and makes you want to be there even more. He grades pretty tough, and sometimes the different units feel rushed, but overall this course is wonderful. Also, the guest lectures are truly fantastic and give you a great flavor of what Yale has to offer.",
    "I think this would be a good 5th or 6th course to take. It is a pretty laid-back class, though you will want to devote enough time to writing. Otherwise why would you take it? If you work hard on the assignments, you will definitely improve in your creative writing, but if you don't, this class is not worth it.",
    "If you have any interest whatsoever in streamlining your writing ability while also expanding your breadth of abilities as a creative writer, take this course. It won't put too much of a dent in your weekly worklaod, while providing you with an abundance of opportunities to move forward as a writer. The reading materials are all interesting and well-integrated without being excessive, and the assignments are worthwhile.",
    "This is a fantastic course taught by a wonderful professor. Professor Deming is funny, friendly, and brilliantly insightful. He's a master at facilitating class discussion and getting us where he wants to go without dominating it. He is demanding and has high expectations, but he'll do everything in his power to make sure that you succeed. Make sure to go to his office hours, which he holds several times a week and in which he will give you priceless advice about how to improve your writing. This is a seminar, so its quality is highly dependent on the quality of class discussion, which is highly dependent on the students themselves. Fortunately my class had a great group that had plenty of lively discussions, and it was clear that most people were engaged most of the time, which class both entertaining and informative. Most of the readings are great, and the guest speakers that come in range from very good to genuinely genius. The class tries to cover three units (short story, poetry, drama) in one semester, so some depth is sacrificed in favor of breadth. You won't emerge from the class as a sudden master writer, but if this your first time doing any of these mode of creative writing, you'll learn a ton and get the privilege of receiving feedback from a brilliant professor all semester, which will make a difference in your writing. Even if you have done some stuff before (I'd been writing stories for years before I came in), the class will help you identify crucial strengths and weaknesses in your writing that will be invaluable if you intend to pursue creative writing further. So, bottom line, fantastic course, not to be missed. Highly recommended!",
    "YES do it. But only with Deming-- the others aren't worth it (at least this year) from what I hear. He articulates so well what you need to improve in your writing, and he doesn't BS you. Also he's just so funny and cool and wonderful. But it's slightly poetry heavy (4 poems vs 1 short story and 1 play), so consider that too.",
    "absolutely. take it with deming especially. office hours are golden hours. especially since he's sits in front of the window and there's a golden halo over his head.",
    "Yes. YES. If you can take this class with Professor Deming, do it. Into Creative Writing was among my favorite Yale classes and one where I walked out feeling I had really learned and that I would carry these new skills forward with me. If you have any interest in creative writing, this class will give you room to write what you want to write and push you try something you hadn't thought about yet. If you do not have any interest in creative writing, this class will make you interested and provide you a new creative outlet conveniently located in your course schedule.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student who has broad interests in creative writing. The workload is very reasonable, and the readings are interesting. Also, I found the guest speakers to be largely engaging.",
    "Great way to explore a talent in writing and be introduced to the writing world. Challenging and fun.",
    "Yes I liked it a lot u will like it too if seminar format is your style of learning",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys writing and wants to improve.",
    "definitely, for those that have always wanted to try creative writing. it introduces each medium just enough for you to start to understand its complexity."
