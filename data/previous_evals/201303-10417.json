   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course-- a surface survey of Chinese culture and history which is a great preparation for taking other Anthro\/China-centric courses.",
    "Take the course to learn some unique analytical perspectives to look at some of the issues concerning modern China. If you put in time to do the readings, you will actually learn a lot.",
    "No, I would not recommend it to another student. If you wish to learn about Chinese history, there are probably much better classes to take.",
    "This course is wonderful. Professor Siu is the best lecturer I have had at Yale. Her lectures are clear and dynamic. She covers an astonishing amount of information with insight and nuance. I went into this class already having studied Chinese history fairly extensively, but I definitely feel like I gained a new level of understanding regarding major events in modern History. The course is also very accessible to someone without a background in China.",
    "There is a lot of reading for this class, but it is interesting. The class is divided into three sections: imperial\/ancient China, Mao years, and current\/reform era stuff. The lectures are early in the morning, and sometimes I found myself fighting to stay awake. Coffee.",
    "a survey class to understand Chinese history, a focus on Mao and post Mao era",
    "Yes. This is a survey course covering a wide range of topics such as religion, lineage, modern consumption, and social protest. But don't worry, Professor Siu has organized these topics in a very good order. The reading is very interesting too!",
    "I would recommend it as a good introduction to anthropological study.",
    "Yes, good class with a great professor.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in China, the Chinese language, or Chinese history! Take the course if you are willing to do the readings or else you dont get the same out of it. The lectures are still interesting but the readings really enhance the classroom experience.",
    "An overview of Chinese culture and society. I would deemphasize the history in the course title, although history and anthropology are hard to tease apart. Take it for the readings, not necessarily for the lectures, although the lectures give you a lot of background material and synthesis of the readings.",
    "ANTH 170 is a great introduction to anthropology. It isn't a ton of work, but make sure you are really interested in Chinese society and culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially to those interested in China specifically. It is a survey course, but balances very well covering a variety of material and many hundreds of years and going into detail on specific topics.",
    "It's a good introduction to students who are interested in China. And it is also helpful for those who want to specialized in one aspect of chinese culture.",
    "Fairly easy survey course on China. Helen Siu is excellent and the grading\/workload is very reasonable. Came in knowing nothing about China and feel that I now know a fair bit.Class is split roughly in 3 sections - imperial china, republican china and then mao\/post mao.Class does get a bit behind so you may have to watch the last few films on your own time. But other than that, 2 5 page papers and a final that you are given a week before you have to sit it.",
    "If you have any interest in China, take this class. This is a very broad overview, but Professor Siu has done a lot of research in the field and especially towards the end of the class she teaches from her own experience -- fascinating. Lectures could be a little dry (especially when we were stuck back in ancient China) and 9:25 is not a great time, but despite that the material is relevant and interesting, and I do recommend this class. Siu is a great teacher and cares a lot about the material and her students."
