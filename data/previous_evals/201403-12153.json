   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to other students if and only if they are classics majors or feel confident about their Latin abilities. Otherwise, I would say that some of the lower down Latin courses might be more appropriate. That said, it was definitely a very interesting course, though perhaps a bit beyond my level.",
    "I would recommend this class to others. The translations are a bit heavy, but if you truly enjoy Latin and a deeper analysis of the texts you read you will love this class.",
    "This class was run like a graduate seminar--each class was a presentation by a different student. For that reason, it lacked continuity from class to class and I can't really say what it is that I learned from this class, other than random specific knowledge from random secondary sources. It was not a great class for those of us who did not already have extensive knowledge of Livy and historiography. I did improve my Latin quite a bit, though.",
    "I loved getting more familiar with good ol' Titus this semester. The syllabus was really well-chosen and the class discussions were great, both on the text and the articles. Although sometimes the class discussions were a bit out there for me, I still enjoyed them, and I've come to really appreciate and enjoy Livy's style. The amount of Latin is definitely manageable, but a step up from what I've done in the past to be adjusted to. Definitely worth it though.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any other student interested in the classics. It may not be the best for a freshman's first attempt at college Latin, but Professor Kraus is very fair in her grading and obviously very knowledgeable.",
    "Anyone who likes Latin should consider taking this course: a combination of a deep author with a great professor."
