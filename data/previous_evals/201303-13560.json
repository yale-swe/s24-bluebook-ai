Aspects of the class structured around the conference and client-based work were very useful. However, the great variety of guest lecturers on international environmental law and policy, negotiation, and NGOs were also fascinating and probably equally useful to my career development."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Classes ran out of steam towards the end of the semester.",
    "The administrative aspect of handling reimbursements. If the travel of the students is suppose to be secured with supporting funds, then there shouldn't be any reimbursement after the travel necessary. It seems that there is that possibility of costs not being covered even while students have already signified the organization they intend to work with. Granted that students may have exceeded in the budget presented, there should be guiding rules on how much the budget should be given limitations of the funds and not the other way around. Considering that reimbursement in Yale University is such a tedious process, comparable to how government probably handles such procedures, and given how some students depend on scholarship to make it through, the money that needs be reimbursed, affects the available funds a student may need at any given time. I hope that is recognized.",
    "There was a discrepancy between the project\/field trip and the course information. At times the course\/lectures felt irrelevant to our project. Perhaps having more continuity between the specific projects and the lectures. (Though I know this year was experimental with the variety of field trips.)",
    "The class had way too much going on at all times. It was both an academic class, with weekly readings and assigned written responses, as well as a client-based \"clinic\" involving a substantial client-based project and several class assignments to report on the client work. Additionally, there were a number of required out-of-class activities, including a two-day negotiation exercise (on a weekend). Furthermore, each group was responsible for planning their own trip and making all conference arrangements, which was very time consuming. As a result of spending so much time on all of the non-client aspects of the class, I do not feel that I contributed enough work and hours to the stakeholder organization.In addition to having more in-class and out-of-class time to work on the client project, the class would have benefited from a better application process. The application process was not successful at weeding out people who were not serious about doing stakeholder work. It was demoralizing to see other members of my group spend so little effort and time on the stakeholder projects. I think that the description of the stakeholder projects presented before students apply should include themajor deliverables that will be expected so that students have a clear idea of the work involved before they apply for the class.This was probably the most valuable class that I took this semester because of the \"real world\" component, but other elements should be scaled back."

He has a broad knowledge of the various topics on the course and was able to contribute to the discussion through the questions he himself raised, as well as his incites on many topics.He was able to give a sense of organization to the different topics as well even if some topics were seemingly handled on the fly. At some point in the curse, students were asked what other topics they felt were relevant, which I felt shouldn't have been necessary since this was not a course that was being given for the first time. However, Rob was able to present the matter in such a way that made the opportunity very useful to expand beyond what was already being offered in the class.Rob accounted for himself very well in the course.",

This class is a lot of work, especially if you devote the appropriate amount of time to the stakeholder project and conference planning. Also, make sure you are enthusiastic about the stakeholder you are working with and that your group members are equally enthusiastic.
