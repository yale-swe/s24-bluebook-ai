    "Research, independent motivation, working in small teams as part of a bigger group, foreign learning, field work. What more could one ask for?",
    "This class was truly a cornerstone of my engineering education. I wish that every engineer could take a class like this.",
    "Skills: Problem-solving skills, independent research skills, how to work together as a team towards a common goal, how to creatively engineering solutions. Insights: Environmental engineering is relevant and important. It's often something taken for granted in the US because we have relatively good air and water quality. However, in developing nations like India, it is extremely important. This class made me value my education so much more because I can now see it's practical applications. It was also very valuable to get out of the Yale bubble and push myself out of my comfort zone in a foreign country.",
    "I learned some about how to make and refine an experimental method. I also learned how to better analyze data and better deal with results not working out as they should."

   "comments": [
    "It seems that the level of work that is required of students in the class is set based on who in the class wants to do the most work. My only suggestion is that there should be more of a standard expectation for the workload of this class. Otherwise, I think that everything about this course is stellar.",
    "This class is an amazing way for engineers to get real-world experience, and understand the truly profound implications of the work that we are learning to do. Bravo, Dr. Kim, for bringing this class to Yale.",
    "Strengths were problem-based learning and field trip to India (of course). I cannot speak highly enough of this class. I cannot believe how much I learned from Dr. Kim NOT lecturing. He let the students take charge and come up with solutions on our own and then gave feedback. This way we learned so much and were motivated not by our grades but by our desire to come up with good solutions. The field trip to India was incredible to say the least! We did a lot of work but also had a lot of fun. It was all of our first time in India and we were able see so much and learn so much not only in the lab but also in doing our work in the field. Weaknesses was that the team was too small. We could have benefitted from having several more hands on deck while working on these projects. The team could have tackled our problems better had we had more students in the class to do the work.",
    "This course was very good at letting students choose their own path and have hands on learning about experiments. The course was very rigorous and took almost too much time out of my weeks. While it was mentioned that we could spend as much time as we wanted on our projects, we were pushed by Professor Kim to follow certain experimental paths and do a certain number of experiments in a specific time frame. This was helpful in showing us where to go in our experiments, but meant that I spent more time that was ideal on the course. Additionally, I wish there had been a bit more effort put in by the TAs to explain how to do things when data was not working out. I found out that most of my data was unnecessary at the end of the course as it could not be compared to other data. It would have been good to know this earlier in the course. While having lots of data was very helpful for drawing conclusions, if I had known that my data did not make a lot of sense at the beginning, I would have changed my experimental protocol and put more time into data analysis instead of simply running more tests. Overall, the course was extremely well taught, but I wish I had been more assertive in asking the TAs for help early in the course."

    "This course should be how many more engineering classes are designed. Though having not a single lecture throughout the entire semester, I walk away from this class with more insight and knowledge than any other class experience in my four years at the university. To obtain hands-on, problem-based learning in this type of classroom environment, I feel prepared to enter graduate school and the workforce in environmental engineering. Additionally, such an experience has given me confidence in my own abilities to become a professional rather than just a student. With the international experience working overseas to the endless nights of working in the CEID, I have never not only worked harder but wanted to work so hard in any academic class. Words cannot express the importance of this course for an environmental engineering major that no student should have to be turned away from.",
    "I think that other students, especially in ENVE, would quite frankly be dumb if they didn't take this class. It is a one-of-a-kind learning experience. Also, this was my only class with Professor Kim, and I would have been incredibly sad if I hadn't gotten the opportunity to take a class with him. He is a true gem in the ENVE, SEAS, and Yale community.",
    "There is a reason that Dr. Kim recently won the Ackerman award for teaching. Dr. Kim is truly dedicated to helping his students learn not only about engineering, but about the profound implications of what you can do with it. This class was without a doubt the cornerstone of my engineering experience at Yale - I am so grateful to have had this opportunity. If there's any way you can, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Kim is the absolute best. You will learn so much from him without sitting through a lecture. He cares so much about his students on a personal level and really wants to see us succeed and make a difference in the world. Not to mention this class is so so fun! You have so much autonomy around what you can do. You come up with your own solutions to a problem statement presented in the beginning of class and you have the power to bring it to life. Obviously, the FREE TRIP TO INDIA was a HUGE plus. We got a lot of work done during that one week and we all had the time of our lives. This is definitely a bucket list class for anyone at Yale, but ESPECIALLY if you're an environmental engineer because you'll have a much higher chance of getting in!",
    "This course was absolutely amazing. You will learn a lot about how to run meaningful experiments and have more insight into what you can do to better the world. This course was extremely intellectually stimulating. However, it should be noted that it is a lot of work. Be prepared to put lots of effort into the course simply for the sake of the course and for fulfilling a desire to do as well as possible for Professor Kim. Professor Kim is one of the best teachers I have encountered at Yale and gives very useful feedback about what and how to do work in the course. He is also the teacher I have had who cares the most about his students. He is a joy to be taught by and I would take the course solely to be taught by him, even if it had not been a good course in its own right. On the other hand, he can have slightly high expectations, so be prepared to put in work to meet those expectations."
