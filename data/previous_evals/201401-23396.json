    "I thought it was a really good ENGL 127 section and I would recommend it.",
    "Engl. 127 is a great survey course of American Literature, spanning a breadth of time periods, styles of writing, poetry, and prose. Reading Moby Dick and Ellison's Invisible Man are undertakings that are definitely worthwhile. The class offered a nice mix of poetry, longer books, and short stories. In terms of workload: very manageable. My section consisted of three 3-5 page papers, one final 5-8 page paper, and several more creative writing pieces. I recommend this class for anyone with an interest in different strains of thought throughout the past 250 years of American thought, or with interests in some of the issues commonly addressed such as the questions of identity, vocation, and gender\/race.",
    "A good intro course that has a lot of non majors as well. Great for a WR credit. The reading is usually very interesting, though Autobiography is a little dry. For non majors, it may be difficult to manage all the readings, though I recommend treating the readings as a \"break\" from other work.",
    "I loved English 127 and would definitely recommend it. The readings were really interesting and manageable.",
    "This section for English 127 was really wonderful - Professor Baricz did a great job leading class discussion throughout the semester, so that class was always full of different ideas. The readings we discussed were usually really interesting. Outside of class discussions\/readings, all assignments were writing assignments (three short essays, one long final essay, and three shorter creative pieces), which I feel really strengthened my writing and thinking skills. Professor Baricz also met with us throughout the semester to talk about the class, the readings, and our writing process, which was incredibly helpful. I really enjoyed this class! Pro-tip: keep up with the readings and you will really enjoy the class!",
    "If you have any interest in reading some great works of American Literature, or need to find some excuse to read Moby Dick, then absolutely take this class."
