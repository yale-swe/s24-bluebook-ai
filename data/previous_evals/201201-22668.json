   "comments": [
    "Ame Cividanes is great. She's very engaging and nice. Plus, she's a very fair grader. Spanish 140 basically dives into conditional clauses and kind of finishes off Spanish grammar. I have no regrets about taking this class.",
    "If you're really interested in improving your spanish, this definitely would do it for you.",
    "I would recommend this class as key to the solidification of the knowledge learned in Spanish 130. It is five days a week and somewhat tedious, but worth it for improving one's Spanish.",
    "Go for it, you finally break the spanish barrier!",
    "Yes. Overall not terribly difficult, but leads to lots of improvement.",
    "SPAN 140 is very similar to SPAN 130. I would recommend taking it if you took SPAN 130 and want to continue studying Spanish. Most of the class is spent doing oral activities, so your speaking skills improve a lot over the course of the semester. Apart from the daily activities, you have two presentations, a short one and a long one, and both are very manageable. You also watch a movie and read a book at the end of the semester, which is interesting.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140 for a students looking to improve their Spanish skills, however if students are just looking for an grade, this probably isn't the right course.",
    "Reading stories and a novel, improving speaking abilities through projects\/presentations in front of the class, lots of discussion. I highly recommend the class because most students care about the language and actively participate in improving through the course. I also really enjoyed the material, and Sra. Cividanes was an amazing teacher.",
    "It's pretty simple. The class is a slightly more intensive L3. If this sounds appealing or necessary to you, take the class. If it doesn't -- don't."
