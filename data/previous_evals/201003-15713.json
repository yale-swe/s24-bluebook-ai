   "comments": [
    "This is a really interesting course if you like math and want to continue beyond math 115. Doing multivariable calculus really takes your logical thinking to another step, which I found really enjoyable.If you're thinking of doing an engineering degree however, I think it might be a better idea to take the ENAS course, as there are very few examples of real-world applications for the different theorems provided in this course.",
    "The course is exactly what the name says. It's generally an easy course at the beginning, but do not let that fool you. It gets tougher toward the end, especially if you decide not to spend the right amount of time making sure you actually grasp concepts and do the problem sets the night before they're due. You'll get more out of the class if you actually get what's going on, and I'm sure you'll do much better.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 120, but not this section. I believe that multivariable calculus can be engaging and interesting if taught in the right way, and I didn't find this class to be particularly helpful for really learning the material.",
    "Take Math 120 after Calc BC, especially if you plan on doing engineering.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in an Economics major (it's a pre-requisite) or a Math major. Otherwise, don't take it for fun, like I did. You won't be amused.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you absolutely have to take it.",
    "After taking BC in high school, this class was a perfect continuation of the material.",
    "Math 120 is a good math course, especially if you are a freshman. Many freshmen take the course so you can always find someone to work with on problem sets. I had to take the course for my major but I think the course is reasonable for a person not majoring in math or science.",
    "Math 120 is Multivariable Calc. I would recommend it to students who love math and are good at it and willing to put in the time.",
    "Math 120 is a standard course in calculus. I disliked the book because it was HORRIBLE about showing examples in some sections viz. there were only 2 examples for stokes theorem and there should have been at least 5. My particular semester was problematic because it was oversubscribed because of the lastminute cancelation of ENAS 151a sothere were 10 sections and I was ejected from a section I liked into a section taught by a grad student because there were too many people in my section because it kept gaining people who dropped math 230 because it met at the same time. In general though it is a great course, p. sets due once a week with 7-11 problems each time ~2-3 hours work max (on average). If I had been able to stay in the section I was originally in (Lauer) I would have liked it. It seems to be easier than 115.",
    "My experience in Math 120 was adequate, but not deeply interesting or inspiring. This may be different for different professors. Also, it gets a lot harder from the first midterm to the second. When I first cameinto the class in the fourth week it seemed incredibly easy, but by the second midterm I had almost no idea what I was doing. My experience was that online MIT lectures were quite helpful in filling in what I missed, although I missed this class a lot around the middle of the semester, which was a really bad idea. So, don't be fooled by how easy it is at the beginning."
