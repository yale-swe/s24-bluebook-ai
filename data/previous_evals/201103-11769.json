    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Definitely. To be proficient in any language, you have to do the dirty dirty: grammar. It won't be fun, but if you actually do your homework, you'll find yourself improving in leaps and bounds. Hubert was a first year teacher, so I think he'll get better. He's always willing to help, but he doesn't check his email that regularly, so if you have last minute questions...good luck. Take French 140 to continue in your path, but just make sure to stay on top of the homework, otherwise it'll suck catching up right before the exams. Also, one of your exam scores gets dropped :)",
    "I would recommend the course for someone who is serious about French but not quite comfortable with the advanced study that French 150 entails. See Question 1 for explanations."
