    "it's the senior thesis so my recommendations probably don't matter, but if you're looking at this because you're on the fence about the major, know this: the WGSS senior thesis is one of the most comprehensive and best supported at Yale. it really is an opportunity to do original work that you care a lot about while supported by an amazing faculty. it's hard, sometimes, sure, but it was without a doubt one of my (many) favorite things about this department. the best advice I can give to someone about to take this class:just write, even if it seems terrible, even if you don't know what you're talking about. having something on the page makes it so much easier, and the more you work steadily, the easier it will be. you can do it! woooo!"
