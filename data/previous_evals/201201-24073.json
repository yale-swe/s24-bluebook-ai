   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course as it is very rewarding as well as being a wonderful opportunity to explore many aspects of the topic of cancer in a unique way.",
    "A comprehensive introduction into the biology and treatment of cancer, with some coverage of the social issues of cancer (which you might not get in a Bio class)",
    "Great way to really to bring perspectives on cancer together.",
    "Super fun class! Dr. Blair is so awesome! She is so sweet and enthusiastic. This class had a good mixture of science and non-science majors, which I thought brought a lot to our discussions. However, as a science major, I sometimes felt like the science was very dumbed-down and simplified. I was eager to learn more details about the science behind cancer, but instead our discussion was often focused on social issues (which was of course interesting too!). I really feel like I can talk comfortably about the numerous issues surrounding cancer after this course. I definitely recommend taking it, if you can get in!",
    "THIS CLASS ROCKS! Take it. It's not hard, you learn a lot, Dr. Blair is the man, and it only meets once a week. The reading is manageable to a point where I did 100% of it (what?!) and I actually enjoyed working on all of the assignments. Take this guy.",
    "Take it! The workload is super manageable and the class has great discussion. The readings are light and very interesting. If you get into the seminar, you probably have a good reason for wanting to take it, in which case I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",
    "YES I would recommend this to any student interested in learning about cancer, not just as a biological disease, but as a social phenomenon that has had a great impact on our culture. You will definitely enjoy in this class and take so much out of it.",
    "Probably my favorite class at Yale - it's low stress and the work is totally manageable and actually enjoyable! At the same time you will take away SO much from this class, and you may not even realize how much you're learning until the end. The midterm was actually really fun, and the final was not bad at all (this coming from a person who hates writing). Dr. Blair is one of the coolest, best professors I've ever had. Not only is she a great teacher, she's such an awesome person to get know and goes out of her way to support her students. I wish all my classes were like this.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in or who had been affected by cancer. It is a great introduction to the topic and perfect for non science majors.",
    "This is a fantastic class. The subject material is interesting, the professor is really nice, and the book that you read is SO easy to get through. I actually did all of the reading for this class (which is CRAZY!!!) because the topics were so interesting. HIghly recommended!!!!",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "YES. TAKE THIS CLASS. you'll learn a lot without doing an insane amount of work.",
    "dr. blair is so sweet, and lots of really interesting material is covered"
