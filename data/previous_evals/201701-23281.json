    "Great survey of the British Romantic tradition",
    "I definitely developed a greater appreciation for romantic poetry and visual art. It was a small class, but an amazing opportunity to spend a lot of time with Professor Fry. The class helped me develop my visual analysis and close reading skills, and it was interesting to compare the two."

   "comments": [
    "The focus on Turner, Constable, Byron, and Wordsworth might be tedious if you don't particularly like them, but I enjoyed going more in-depth with these works in a small class setting. The visits to the BAC were wonderful--this is a great resource that we have at Yale and this class gives you a chance to use it! You do need to keep up with the reading, which can vary a lot in length from week to week, but it's never unmanageable."

    "Great class. Fry knows so much about the subject material and really cares about improving your writing and thinking. Be aware that the 2 hour seminar will often be lecturing from him, but it's great lecturing. Not too much reading. You get to look at lots of cool paintings in the BAC. One of the better classes I've taken at Yale, I'd give it an A-.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I would love to see more courses like this be taught at Yale, bridging art and literature. It is a fascinating and important kind of study, and this particular material--while sometimes a bit dry--can also be astonishingly beautiful. It made me love Wordsworth. The reading is not overwhelming, and Professor Fry (who is great, and a library of information about this material) often treats the course more as a lecture than a seminar, so it feels manageable. I loved the fact too that we could take regular trips to the YCBA and see the works of artists we had just studied in class--a rare and perfect opportunity.",
    "YES! If you're into art history\/criticism and poetry, then definitely take it!",
    "Yes! This is a great opportunity to spend a lot of time with Professor Fry in a small class setting. You get to visit the BAC and the reading list is great. There are three short essays (unless you're doing this as a senior seminar), and as long as you're thoughtful about picking your topic it can be really fun. Come to class prepared and you'll really enjoy it."
