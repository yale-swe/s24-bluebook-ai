   "comments": [
    "This is a good introductory course, though many non-science majors take the class, so the depth of material presented on any one topic is limited by the (presumed, though possibly not actual) low scientific literacy of the class. That said, you will definitely learn to be scientifically literate by the end of the class.You read a chapter of the textbook and answer relevant questions before each class meeting, and you explicate ~5 papers to the class during the course of the seminar. PLUS, you'll write one short and one long paper on topics of choice. You learn to navigate through scientific literature like a boss.",
    "Definitely a good class for a Sc requirement - it's pretty interesting and you actually learn stuff that's useful. It is, though, a lot of work. Most of it is relatively mindless: you read a chapter for each class, answer some questions, and then repeat the questions in class. I probably spent an hour and a half doing that for each class. Then there are five presentations on scientific articles that take a fair amount of preparation. And the midterm paper and the final (LONG LONG LONG) paper. But overall, I was very happy to be in a seminar as opposed to a lecture where I had to cram all the material in at the end. As a humanities person, I think it was a good fit.",
    "If you have interest in geology, then definitely take this class. But if you don't you might get exhausted talking about earth's processes. I think Professor Park makes this class worth it, the work isn't too intense, but it'll definitely be easier if you're engaged with it.",
    "Straightforward course. Read the textbook, answer the discussion questions, write two papers. The questions do get a bit tedious as the semester goes on. Overall, I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about the basics of geology at a time when this stuff was really relevant (earthquake in Japan).",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, take this class. It's not too hard, and you do get to learn about some cool stuff like earthquakes and volcanoes. It can be pretty fun too, if you're not asleep because it's 9 am.",
    "If you don't mind getting up early to attend a 9am seminar...",
    "yes take this as a science class. Very great section discussion format and the prof is wonderful.",
    "Perfect for non-science majors - definitely take! Be prepared, however, that the papers will take you a considerable amount of time if you wish to do well and are not familiar with science articles.",
    "Earth Systems Science was an intro geology course in seminar format; we covered the whole of the textbook Dynamic Earth, and got some insights into current geoscience research. I found it very enjoyable, and you will too if you can get up and be willing to participate at 9 AM on Monday and Wednesday mornings. Basically, how each class meeting works is you come to class having read the chapter and answered the 10 questions Professor Park sent out after the last section. You then spend the first 45 minutes discussing the answers to the questions (in your seat or drawing on the chalkboard) and asking your own. The final half hour is spent on partner presentations of 2 short geology journal articles (no PowerPoint\u0085just you and the chalk). Professor Park is knowledgeable, approachable, and very funny \u0096 you will learn a lot if you approach this class with the right attitude, whether you\u0092re a geology major or simply looking for a Sc credit. Learning about the Earth will be a great experience no matter your field of study.",
    "G&G 200 is essentially Intro Geology in seminar format. If you are interested in geology and earth sciences, from the usual rocks and plate tectonics to surface processes and phenomena like rivers, glaciers and atmospheric circulation, then consider this class.Prof Park is great - entertaining, friendly, accessible and knowledgeable, always sharing interesting facts and stories, and more than happy to guide you through the workwhenever you're unsure.The workload is fine, a short paper and a normal paper + presentation, plus class participation, the last of which seems like a fair amount of work at first but isn't really.As for the format, if you're used to getting your scientific knowledge in the usual lecture format, then take the standard Intro Geology class instead. However, if lectures scare you and you like classes with active participation, take this one. Oh, and if you're scared of exams, too. That's really about it.",
    "People seem to take this as a science credit, and EVST majors for some seminar requirement. I took it because I was interested in geology. Frankly, it did not make geology seem that interesting, even though it could have, based on the book. Professor Park is a great guy, as you will probably read in the other reviews, but his approach to a seminar is to assign a chapter (20-30 pages) of the textbook for each class meeting and ask questions about it -- as opposed to directly teaching the material, which probably would be better. (You also have to present papers from scientific journals about 5 times total, and write a 5-7 and a 15-20 page paper.)",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone. You dont need to be a science major to take it either",
    "This was a very fun class. Most of the work is class participation and student presentations, which for me were more fun than work. Professor Park, while a little weird sometimes, definitely spiced things up and kept class interesting. Your grade for the course is a little unclear (still don't know what to expect once I finish this evaluation), but overall this class was a great way to learn some earth sciency stuff without stress and best of all with NO CALCULATIONS! If you're a serious geophysicist this class may bore you, but if you want a relaxed and fun way to learn about plate tectonics you should take this class."
