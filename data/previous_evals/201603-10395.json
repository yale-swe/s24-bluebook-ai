   "comments": [
    "I had never taken art before, and I was able to see the world with a new lens. But this course is very much \"you get what you give.\" If you work at it, it is extremely rewarding.",
    "I learned so much by taking this course. Not only did I learn a lot of new drawing techniques, but I also learned a lot of about my own drawing style and what works and doesn't work. This is because Pedro has us try to many different thing during the semester that you get to practice and work on for a week or more and even bring into the next drawings.",
    "Art 114 really increased my abilities in and appreciation for art. I learned to look at objects in new ways and translate what I see to the paper. I also have a better understanding of how to critique art.",
    "The first part of the class was done largely with line, and the second half with full shading. We learned how to use the basic tools of the craft: vine charcoal, hard charcoal, erasers, shammies, conte crayons, hard and soft pencils. We saw examples of art created by the old masters, as well as more recent art that breaks rules in a beautiful way. In a way, we also learned how to see. We learned how to draw the contours of things, finding lines in places where edges hide in real life. We learned how to draw the colors of things, touching one tone to another. We learned how to criticize each other's work in a constructive way and how to turn the same critical eye to our own drawings. We learned how to walk around campus with a giant portfolio in one hand and a shoebox full of tools in the other, looking for interesting corners of life to put down on paper.",
    "Definitely became a much better artist, both mechanistically and through composition and design.",
    "Skills in line, tone, texture, and surface. The ability to really study objects in an effort to draw them. Perspective was especially useful in this sense. Clocking angles, measuring, and finding the perfect composition.",
    "I learned the basic foundations for drawing, and have approached different tasks and problems not just for the class, but art in general, thanks to the multiple perspectives of my classmates and professors.",
    "a systematic method of observing and drawing. starting from line to value, and observance to creative construction.",
    "I obviously became a much better drawer. I was hoping to be able to notice more things about the world around me, but that didn't happen unfortunately. The biggest outcome, which was actually really important, was that I appreciate and derive more emotional value from all art forms after taking this class.",
    "Dramatically improved drawing skills and abilities to use new materials. Improved ability to critically analyze my own artwork."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course as a whole is very strong. I saw the improvement in myself and all my classmates. Pedro does such an amazing job at teaching and at critiquing our work to keep us confident and learning. The fact that we got to try out so many new techniques is a huge strength. I didn't find any weaknesses.",
    "This course really made me a much better artist. The main weakness is that other than a brief conversation during the midterm review, students have no way of gauging their grade in the class until after its over.",
    "The course was very well done. The workload was largely dependent on previous experience in art. I often spent far more that 4 hours on an assignment and still did not have the most successful drawings in class, but you have to be okay with that if you are really there to learn. Critiques were very useful for this as well.",
    "The course is taught at a steady pace, and the material is taught in such a way that the previous lesson helps you fully understand the next. Though critiques can be quite long and sometimes excessive, they are always beneficial and get the student excited for the next task.",
    "very interactive course. using critiques to observe each other's progress.",
    "Great for anyone who wants to improve their technical drawing abilities. Assignments are time consuming and could be made less intimidating."

    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is fun and you learn so much! It is also so interesting to see what your classmates bring in each week. Pedro is also so nice and funny and makes the class so entertaining and interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I had very little previous experience with art, but found my skills improved a lot over the course of the semester.",
    "Absolutely. 4 out of 5 dentists recommend Basic Drawing as their favorite brand of toothpaste. Just kidding. But in all seriousness, this is an incredible course and if you decide not to take it, you'll end up missing out. Maybe you think you already know how to draw. Maybe you think you'll never be able to draw. Either way, your views will change after you take this class.",
    "If you are interested in art, of course! You will get out of it as much effort as you put in.",
    "recommend to students without prior experience.",
    "Yes! I never drew before, and I became much more confident in my drawing skills, enjoyed drawing a lot more, and now enjoy viewing art a lot more.",
    "Assignments were well planned and the course is well structured to address different aspects of drawing. Make sure you have enough time every week to do the assignments. May be a bit frustrating at times if you don't have much experience with drawing."
