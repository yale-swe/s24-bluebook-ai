   "comments": [
    "This \"course\" is actually more of a total blank slate. With the right research mentor and project it can be a wonderful experience, but without the support of members of your lab and a lot of individual drive, it can be an unstructured struggle. Ideally, by the time you take this \"class\", you will already be established in a lab and can use the MCDB 486 assignments to strengthen your existing research experience.",
    "This is a great opportunity to do in depth research in an area of interest. Schedule and involvement is mostly determined between you and the individual PI. It provides a really important perspective on what it means to study science distinct from classroom learning.",
    "Look EARLY for a research lab, and be sure you're clear about your project and expectations. It can be a great experience if you choose well and communicate well. Be aware of deadlines for the class requirements.",
    "It was a great way to end and tie up my biology career and studies here.",
    "Make sure you do your final lab research project with a group of people you like and respect. No matter how amazing the project (Biomedical Engineering does some AWESOME work!), the most important thing to consider is the people you will be spending so much time with.",
    "I worked in Dr. Pollard's lab with Irene Tebbs, and she was amazing. Highly recommend trying to work with her if she's still around.I definitely learned a lot in this course. My only complaint is that there were a lot of various things to do at a time when seniors are already really busy. Working 10-12 hours a week, writing a grant proposal, a paper, presenting both a board and powerpoint (both of which take a long time to put together), and attending 6 powerpoint sessions all add together to make a very large project when you're already doing a paper and the research in the lab.",
    "Research is a great experience! Go for it.",
    "Independent Research In Biology. The title says it all. This is a good way to get credit for research you may already be doing with a professor, just make sure you pay attention to all the due dates and the various reports you have to submit. If not they creep up on you in a big way.",
    "Senior research is a great experience. In the end, the grant proposal, project proposal, final paper, poster, and presentation are really satisfying. If you have never really synthesized your research, then this is a great opportunity to do so. It makes you realize how far you've come as a scientist and if this is the last research you do, you end up feeling really proud of your work. With that said, there lots of long nights in lab and real intellectual effort as well. I would recommend it!",
    "The quality of the experience entirely depends on your PI. If you can find someone who you will enjoy working with and who will give you intellectual license over your experiments along with a lot of support, it is definitely worth doing research during the school year (and nice to get credit for it). Ten hours per week is actually significant, so make sure you have the kind of schedule that allows for it. It's also hard to get a lot done in that amount of time, so be realistic about your goals. First semester, you only have to turn in a research proposal at the beginning of the semester and a mock grant proposal at the end, which isn't bad. Second semester ends with a presentation, a poster session, and a scientific paper, which is a little over the top and redundant but doable. The poster session, this year, was on Spring Fling--you should ask early for the date to not be the Tuesday of reading week, because we weren't able to get it changed when we asked a couple weeks before.Overall, I definitely enjoyed the research and am glad I took the course, which lent some structure, offered credit, and gave an opportunity to present the results and see what other students had been working on."
