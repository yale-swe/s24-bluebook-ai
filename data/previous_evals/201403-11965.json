   "comments": [
    "If you are looking for a technical writing class to improve your writing skills then this is the class for you. We get some literature, but this course focuses on writing essays and working together in groups to peer review essays.",
    "I would explain that it's more writing than I've ever done in a Spanish class. I would recommend it for students who are proficient with grammar but maybe haven't had much experience writing full essays.",
    "It's a very useful class. Work is a bit difficult but it pays off in the end.",
    "You write 4 approximately 1000 word essays throughout the semester and finish with one 10-15 page essay. All are in Spanish, but all are graded purely on grammar. All of the non-essay assignments were graded very leniently, and the essays weren't too bad.",
    "This class is essential for academic writing in Spanish. I liken it to the Spanish version of a cross between English 114 and English 120. You have to produce an academic paper yet craft well an essay - in Spanish. Prof. Poole was straightforward throughout the semester regarding expectations for essays and in-class material. Our class was relatively large, so the class functioned as a cross between a seminar and a lecture. Because you are writing so much, the class truly functions as a super-advanced technical grammar study. Take it to improve your writing in Spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to those who are a little bit more serious about Spanish. It's a substantial amount of work, especially compared to other Spanish classes, but it's absolutely worthwhile if you're interested in improving your writing.",
    "It's a good class, but the end of the semester got boring and can be hard to stay awake since it's a 9-10:15 class. The workload isn't bad (just essays and some take home assignments), and grading isn't harsh). The essays during the semester were written about readings (they were all good except 1), and the final paper is a research paper on any topic you want.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're looking for a good introduction to L5 spanish classes, you want to learn how to write academically in Spanish, or you just love the language and want a fun class! It's a well-taught, interactive class the size of a large seminar. The assignments are appropriate and the grading is very fair. It's not too much work at all. Kevin Poole is a great professor. I would recommend this class to anyone. For me, it was worth waking up early for this 9 am class.",
    "If you want to maintain your spanish or give writing in the language a try then this class is great. The workload isn't too bad and your writing really will become more fluent and natural. Prof Poole is very nice and his understanding of the language is very impressive.",
    "Good course if you want to get better at writing in spanish. Poole cares a lot. The papers are not easy but are manageable. Always get to class on time or Poole will make fun of you.",
    "Good L5 class, and Poole is a great professor. He's pretty lenient with his grading, so as long as you show up to class, participate every once in a while, and do the assignments, you'll be fine. I took this class Cr\/D as a fifth credit, and I'm glad I did. I put forth the effort for the first four 1000-word essays and the other shorter assignments, but by the time I got to the 10-15 page research paper, I was drowning in other assignments for other classes, so I didn't get as much out of what could have been a great assignment as I should have. But this was a class I was willing to get up at 9am for.",
    "Read four short stories, write four essays, edit other students' essays. The class was fairly basic. I don't feel that I learned much about how to write an academic essay well in Spanish. It was frustrating wanting to write strong literary analysis, but having to dumb down my grammar because I was too afraid of having the wrong grammar, and thus being marked down. Content isn't valued much, and although you're told that, it's really frustrating to have grammar matter more than ideas. Professor Poole is a good instructor and explains things well. The class was fine, but I wouldn't take it unless you're taking it as a prerequisite for the major.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is looking to improve their Spanish writing skills. SPAN 250 is a helpful class in providing a forum for students to practice their writing and learn the higher-level nuances and mechanics of the language. Be aware that this class is not useful for improving Spanish speaking skills or learning about Spanish or Latin American history and culture. The essays are based off short stories and articles with no connecting theme.",
    "The course delivered what it promised in terms of helping improve Spanish writing, as the major focus of the class was writing and peer editing papers. I don't think I learned too much grammar wise, because there was no major revision of grammatical concepts, but there were small things you picked up on from doing the peer review, because Prof. Poole would go over common errors after all of the papers and give us sheets with the pertinent info. The only other thing I would say about the class is that it was a little boring, but all in all it was a good experience. I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "I started this class thinking it would be challenging given my limited background in Spanish because I had only started learning Spanish a year before. However, this class turned out to be very low-stress. As long as you write the essays and attend the classes, you will be fine.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a peer, and I have already! The course is informative and enjoyable, and Profe Poole was excited to teach it. Yes, it is a work-heavy and writing-intensive course that will stretch you linguistically, but it has incredible payoff for hardworking students.",
    "A great class that reinforces advanced grammar skills through writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Spanish major or anyone who has a good grasp on the Spanish language but seeks to improve his\/her writing skills.",
    "SPAN 250 is a course about how to write long essays in Spanish. The course does not focus on rhetoric, structure, or form but instead grammar, orthography, and usage. It is a tolerable Spanish class to fulfill a distributional requirement, but not a particularly good one to take otherwise.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is really looking to improve their Spanish. It does have a pretty intensive workload due to the amount of writing, but it greatly improves your ability to write in Spanish and the class gives you a lot of freedom with what you can write about."
