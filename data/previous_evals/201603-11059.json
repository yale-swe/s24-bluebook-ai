    "I became a more thoughtful and diligent writer, learned a lot about memory theory, read fascinating articles and books, have emerged a better person.",
    "I've become a stronger writer, a more precise thinker, a better reader, and honestly somewhat of an expert in memory studies. I couldn't have asked for better skills from a history class. This was what a history class -- or even a Yale class -- should be.",
    "This course fundamentally altered the way I viewed the relationship between history and memory, in such a way that I would highly recommend it to all other history majors. This course will continue to affect the way I view history.",
    "Both a grounding in frameworks of memory and knowledge about various instances of memory and commemoration. I think I approach history more critically and with much greater attention to its writers. I also pay more attention to writing clearly.",
    "This class emphasizes the writing skills needed to write history. We read monographs and philosophical works that present memory and history in different voices and through different lenses and literary styles, but focus on concision and clarity in our own writing. The class is an incredible exploration of history through memory, and memory through history, widening students' understanding of how the past is shaped through different media, individuals, and nations. The class delves into topics of agency, power, decolonization, justice, and responsibility.",
    "this is an incredible class. demands a rigorous new perspective on memory and monument culture, and invites a completely new way to consider and conceptualize modern europe and modern nationalism through the lens of remembrance and nostalgia. the readings are great; seminar was a littlte flat at times.",
    "This course is unlike any other I have taken at Yale. While most history course I have taken at Yale delve into the substance of history, few interrogate what constitutes history, and what constitutes memory. This is seminar that both teaches you how to efficiently and critically read huge amounts of reading per week, and how to do primary source research. Furthermore, Professor Allen provides detailed feedback on your writing, the level of which is almost unheard of in other Yale courses.",
    "By taking this seminar, I gained a comprehensive understanding of both the theories of memory proposed in modern Western discourse and a substantial corpus of knowledge about many of the major European (particularly German) sites of memory (museums, monuments, etc.) I also think my writing improved somewhat."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Allen is a very tough grader. She claims that she wants to hone our prose so that they can convey our ideas better, but sometimes the grading just felt unfair. Although my writing improved over the semester, I am now a far less confident writer. It takes me 5 times as long to write a 2-page paper as it did at the beginning of the semester, and even then I am extremely self-conscious of my work, knowing that Professor Allen will find a number of things that are still wrong with it. That being said, her honesty is refreshing. This was the first class I've taken at Yale where I did not receive a single pure A. Professor Allen does not want you to rest on your laurels; she wants you to constantly strive for improvement. Although I take issue with her only giving As to \"perfect\" assignments, I appreciate the sentiment of her knowing (or at least thinking?) that we can do better. Grading aside, this was probably the best class I've taken at Yale. I don't remember the last time I was so engaged with my course material, such that I was actively sad after the last class. Professor Allen can facilitate discussion like no other, and somehow manages to pull something brilliant out of mundane class comments. The other students were also extremely engaged, which made the whole semester incredibly worthwhile and enlightening. The point being, this class is 500% worth taking even if you get an A-.",
    "The biggest strength was certainly the pedagogy behind it. Having to write 2-page assignments for most of the first few weeks meant that everyone was really engaged with the material every week. That's incredible and rarely happens in seminars. Beyond that, it meant that we could really improve over the semester. I also loved that the course was set up with theory vs history (1st half vs 2nd half). Professor Allen's extensive feedback was also definitely a strength of the class. Further, I loved that we were able to build on what we had read each week because every reading was so closely tied together. The only weaknesses I could think of were that I didn't love a few of the texts (1968 France, especially) or it felt like people didn't totally engage with some of the texts later in the course. Also, I didn't like that the paper was due DURING Thanksgiving break. I would have preferred it to be due the Friday before Thanksgiving, and I would have preferred a prospectus due much earlier -- I felt in a huge time crunch.",
    "The reading load is pretty heavy, but if you do most of the reading, you will get a lot out of the course.",
    "The class is incredibly well organized and well thought out, the material is fascinating, and the assignments are very challenging and interesting. My only criticism of the course is that the Monday 9pm deadlines for short essays in the beginning of the course are very difficult to meet. Especially because most other history seminars also meet on Mondays and Tuesdays, finishing the reading by 9pm on Monday is very difficult. Turning in a paper by then on top of that is quite tough, and the quality of those papers definitely suffered because of the timing of the deadline.",
    "professor allen rarely let seminar discussions run freely. she kept them tightly controlled, and the nine students in class ended up presenting ideas to her rather than sharing them together. the most memorable moments from class absolutely came when discussion flowed between students, and i'd encourage professor allen to allow that to move forward.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is its syllabus. I found the assigned essays and books incredibly thought-provoking. Many dealt with issues that I grapple with in my daily life about memory, archiving, and history. I also think the course material tied into and connected to many other things I had learned as as a European history major, which I found fascinating. By far the biggest weakness of the course was its assigned workload. The workload was simply overwhelming - I think I completed all the assigned reading only one week the entire semester. And it was really a shame too because I couldn't ever really enjoy the reading for the seminar because I was desperately trying to rush through the opening pages in order to get to later pages, which most of the time I didn't reach anyway. The amount of work really hurt my enjoyment of the course, which is a shame because the course content was fascinating. I think the assigned reading should realistically be cut in about half so that the students can actually read and wrap their minds around all the reading. I also think the syllabus could be tweaked to eliminate some of the more heavily theoretical essays and books, which were so difficult that I got relatively out of them. At least the course should be cross-listed as a philosophy class if the syllabus isn't adjusted. I also found the grading to be on the harsh side."

    "Absolutely",
    "Absolutely. This is the best class I've taken at Yale. It's a ton of work, but it's definitely worth it. Professor Allen has high expectations, but she crafts this class impeccably. It's crafted especially toward the students becoming better writers, thinkers, and readers. It's everything I could've asked for intellectually, especially because it's very challenging but the texts aren't so dense or philosophical that they're impenetrable. It's such a rewarding class, and it's also one of the best-organized seminar discussions I've ever had -- you do NOT get off-track in this class. I was truly sad to turn in my final assignment for it because it meant this amazing semester with Professor Allen was over! Recommend to history majors and non-history majors alike, but honestly a history major would do a disservice to herself by not taking it. I'm so glad I took it while I have 3 semesters left at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was one of the most challenging courses I have taken, but by far the most excellent course I have taken.",
    "This is perhaps the best and the hardest class I've taken at Yale. Professor Allen has very high standards for her students' work, and gives the best and most extensive feedback on writing I've ever gotten, and is also one of the best professors I've had. You will come away with a grounding in both theoretical frameworks of memory and also in various applications and case studies in Europe (mostly Germany, but some in France). The class never ceases to be fascinating, and never ceases to be challenging. I highly, highly recommend it.",
    "This is one of the best, if not the best, history seminars a student could take. It is challenging, intellectually powerful, and rewarding. The seminar is intimate, the readings are diverse and interesting, and discussions are incredibly led and wonderfully insightful. You will gain a new consciousness about writing, especially historical writing, and historical analysis.",
    "this is an incredible class. demands a rigorous new perspective on memory and monument culture, and invites a completely new way to consider and conceptualize modern europe and modern nationalism through the lens of remembrance and nostalgia. the readings are great; seminar was a littlte flat at times.",
    "Though the workload of this course is definitely intense, I would 100% recommend this class. From a practical perspective, Professor Allen is excellent at teaching you how to read a lot quickly, how to do your own research and craft your own arguments around your sources, and how to improve your writing. From an intellectual perspective, this course asked questions that I have rarely encountered in other history classes at Yale. Anyone interested in pursuing history in the future or taking the study of history to a more advanced level, should take this class.",
    "I hesitate to recommend this course to another student. The content is fascinating but difficult, the workload is overwhelming, and the grading is unforgiving. However, if you are incredibly fascinated by European intellectual history, the concept of memory, and the philosophy of history generally, it might be worth your while to struggle through this course. Despite focusing on diplomatic and military history within the European History major, I am interested in these issues, so I'm glad I struggled through what admittedly was a very challenging course."
