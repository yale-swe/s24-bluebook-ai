    "This is a great class if you want to challenge yourself with discussing topics like racism, immigration, youth movements, philosophical ideas, and analyzing themes of texts at a high level of German. I definitely felt my reading, writing, and speaking skills improve as well as my critical thinking and argumentative skills, which is pretty unique for a foreign language class. Professor Gehlker is very helpful and encouraging while at the same time pushing you to expand your own abilities, and she takes everybody's input into account to help craft a class that will engage all of the students at a high level.",
    "Professor Gehlker takes a very loose approach to this class, which could be a good or bad thing depending on who you are and what mood you're in. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who likes having a well-defined schedule or will have a busy semester.",
    "If you want to move from the L4 level to taking advanced L5 courses, this is a good bridge course, though you will not learn much new grammar (the emphasis is definitely on the topics, like German immigration and such, listed on the syllabus) and it's really to give you more practice using the language in various contexts (reading articles written in German, reading a little German lit, watching some German movies) and practice\/refreshers using German in conversation in class."
