    "Yeah it's great.",
    "Do not take this course. Thought it might be interesting but I didn't learn much. Brad is actually super competent and knows his stuff but he just tries too hard. He brings cupcakes to class which is nice, but he also jokes around way too much and never stays on topic. Would not recommend.",
    "An out of this world teacher whose passion shines in front of a class. HIs unique style of teaching makes for one of the best and most memorable classes I have ever taken at Yale. Just make sure you like his personality since its a main component to enjoying the class.",
    "Take it if you like the Professor Brad. I did, and because of that I loved the content and the way we learned.",
    "One of the best (and without a doubt, the most fun) classes I've taken. Brad loves teaching and will make it worthwhile. Don't take this class if you're uncomfortable participating in a small lecture setting, if you're unwilling to do the readings, or if all you want are cupcakes, youtube videos or an easy grade (although you'll get all 3).",
    "I would really recommend this class if you're at all curious about how law and technology intersect and all the issues that arise from that intersection. The class isn't too demanding, so it's great if you want to just go to lecture and listen to or participate in heated discussion about the readings and how laws should govern the internet.",
    "CPSC 183 is a pretty awesome course to look into if you are (a) getting somewhat tired of the traditional type of courses (i.e., you will know what I mean when you go to the first few classes during shopping period) or (b) interested in how law and technology (mainly the Internet) has interacted over the past years. I highly recommend the course.",
    "The topics discussed are very interesting and recent, it is an easy class if you are comfortable with the loose format.",
    "Would definitely recommend. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and the material even though it did feel a bit scattered at times. Especially after the midterm I thought the assignments that were left were not elaborated on enough in terms of what was expected of us. Overall though I felt like the material and discussion covered in class was well done and I left the class knowing a lot more about law, technology, and culture, than I did before. It's just a good time in the class and you learn a lot.",
    "The course material is very interesting and extremely relevant to contemporary issues. The class is taught quite differently from any other course I've taken at Yale, and I think many other course evaluations will try to explain these differences. I would recommend anyone who is interested to shop the class and thereafter decide whether you like Brad Rosen's teaching style or not.",
    "Take this class if you're ready for a wild ride. NOT A CONVENTIONAL CLASS. DONT TAKE IF YOU ARE SHY AND PREFER PROPER LECTURES. #cupcakes",
    "I absolutely loved this class, and I highly recommend it! Brad is self-proclaimed crazy in the best possible way, and he talks to the class like he's chatting with a group of equals and friends. His class is a reminder that learning doesn't have to be pretentious and serious in order to be significant. You won't get as much out of the class if you don't do the readings, but there isn't a lot of accountability. You get as much out of the class as you put into it, but it's so worthwhile. Plus Brad brings cupcakes to class.",
    "If you can put up with Brad, absolutely take this class. Do the work for it too, it's a lot more enjoyable that way.",
    "Don't take this class if you aren't planning on showing up for lectures. The lectures are INCREDIBLE and you learn so much from this class. The midterm sounds scarier than it actually is and the projects are very flexible. I absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Take this class! Definitely one of my favorites at Yale so far. Brad tries to be really scary but he's actually really awesome. All of the reading was interesting, which means a lot. And I learned things! Class project was annoying but worth it because overall the workload really wasn't that bad.",
    "I loved CPSC 183 because I learned a lot about an interesting and relevant subject without having to put very much effort in myself. Maybe I feel this way because I was interested in the subject matter, but the readings were easy to do and the lectures were by far the most engaging and entertaining ones of any class I've ever taken at Yale. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, unless you are someone who needs very clear-cut assignments and expectations. You'll never feel like you know exactly what's happening in this class, but I promise, you'll come out having learned a ton.",
    "This was an absolutely incredible class. Brad is a one of a kind professor that makes you look forward to coming to class each day. If you have any interest in law or pop culture, take this class! Really fun and really entertaining, plus you learn a ton.",
    "Brad Rosen is hilariously vulgar and profound. Not much work and most of the work is fun. Take this class, you'll regret it if you don't.",
    "Brad Rosen walks up in front of the class every Monday and Wednesday and leads brilliant, insightful discussion about the law as it relates to the contemporary technological world. He does so in the manner of a crazy person at times, and that's why the course is so brilliant. This semester I had classes straight from 9:15AM to 6:00PM on Mondays & Wednesdays, and Brad's was the last course that I took. In the class before Brad's I always struggled to stay awake because the material was dull and I was tired. In Brad's class, I was always engaged, and I had an absurd amount of fun. Additionally, Brad is happy to go to dinner after class with any students who want to come with him. I suggest that you try to go to those dinners as often as possible. Brad Rosen is a interesting, brilliant man and definitely someone who you want to meet and get to know during your time at Yale.",
    "Definitely shop this class before you leave Yale, no matter what major you are. It's not for everyone, but definitely try it out and see if it's for you. It's so much fun, you don't need to be a computer science major at all, and seriously- shop it. Do it.",
    "Shop it first!",
    "I very much enjoyed this course, and appreciated that the flexible class structure (take-home midterm, final project) made for less stressful exam periods. I found the class to be unique among large lectures in its high level of student discussion. The workload was manageable, and I was usually able to complete all of the readings, except that I had to skim a few court cases instead of studying them in depth to finish preparing for a particular class in a reasonable amount of time (= 4 hours). Brad is a wonderful and engaging teacher, capable of making the most unexpected and entertaining readings\/videos\/etc. perfectly relevant to the course material. He encourages class discussion and debate, and only presses a student if his\/her point of view proves inconsistent. He may sometimes use more colorful language than I would like, but generally anything objectionable came not from him, but from sobering examples of online idiocy that we had to sift through, e.g., for the classes on defamation, which of course were unavoidable. Also, he certainly mellowed a bit after the first few classes, which he says is an intentional effort to 'scare off' those students who wouldn't fit in with the lively, open class format. One caution: try not to miss class if you can help it. It can be hard to take notes, especially since Brad sort of discourages it, so catching up on what you missed (except for the assigned readings) isn't really an option. In short, each class is different and often unpredictable, so you pretty much have to be there to 'absorb' it. (Not to mention there's a participation grade.) Also, a little advice about the reading responses: if you actually start them early in the semester, you'll be much happier than if you cram them all in near the end. And don't be afraid to try 'unconventional' reading responses like comics! :) My responses got better grades when I worked out something creative than when I used the traditional written format.",
    "I wold recommend this course to another student; it was fun, entertaining, challenging, and really got the students thinking about the material. The class was a refreshing lecture experience that allowed for a huge level of connection with the material.",
    "Great class, a slightly large amount of reading, but they all aren't required necessarily. Brad is a wonderful professor and person, but you have to be able to handle his personality and teaching style too.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. This is the class that I think everyone at Yale should be required to take. You will learn material that is relevant to our day to day lives by Yale's best professor. Take this class. Do it. You will not regret it.",
    "This is a great class that explores the intersection between law and technology. Brad is a great lecturer who makes sure that the content is very much relevant to today's society. This is a lecture, but it is expected that you participate. This environment can seem intimidating, but you will find that your peers have a lot of interesting insight and you gain more from participating.",
    "Absolutely take it.",
    "This course is an excellent course. It is extremely interesting and does not require too much work. Absolutely zero knowledge of computer science is required and the material has little to do with computer science. It is essentially a discussion based law class. I have enjoyed this class more than any other I have taken so far at Yale and have learned a lot.",
    "Need an SO? Need a credit? Feel like taking a good class? Look no further. Do the readings and think critically, and you should be fine. Brad is a great instructor unlike any other I've ever had, and he'll make you think about issues in ways you haven't before.",
    "Take this class it's fun and easy!",
    "TAKE IT!!! Law, tech & culture is one of the best classes you will take at Yale. The material is incredibly interesting and a lot of it is actually very useful to know in real life. I've learned more in this class than I have in many of my other classes combined and it's all because of Brad and his teaching style. Brad, who is THE MAN by the way, makes every lecture into seminar-like discussions, which is awesome because the resulting class discussions truly engage your understanding of the (always interesting) readings. The option to put together group projects instead of taking a final was also very cool and they were fun to produce. Oh, and cupcakes. All day, err day. Bottom line: take it, this is easily one of the best classes offered at Yale. You will not regret it.",
    "I would recommend this class as I thought it was very interesting and different from my other classes."
