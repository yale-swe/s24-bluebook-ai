   "comments": [
    "This is hands down the best class I've ever taken at Yale. It's the kind of class where 2 hours was never enough time to finish our discussions. I think every socially conscious Yalie should take this class - there was not one topic I didn't find fascinating and important to learn about. Prof. Grieger is super smart and accessible and his passion for the subject comes through in every class. TAKE IT.",
    "Take it take it take it!! Professor Grieger, in addition to just being one of the nicest professors I've met at Yale, is incredibly knowledgable leads great discussions. Take this class if you're interested at all in American poverty. Ultimately, the class was more public policy-focused than most I've taken at Yale, which was actually a relief for me from some of the more theoretical stuff. But if policy isn't what you're interested in, definitely take a look at the syllabus before you commit. The workload is average: pretty normal reading load, plus 6 reading responses, two times leading seminar, and a manageable paper at the end. I really can't recommend this enough!",
    "I'd highly recommend this class. This is a great course if you're at all interested in American welfare - especially the historical background starting with LBJ's Great Society and the transition to Reagan's \"Welfare Queen.\" Plus, Professor Lloyd Grieger is incredible and you should take a class with him.",
    "Take it if you're interestd in the course material!",
    "This is a really great course --- a broad overview of poverty and social welfare policy, with a heavier emphasis on explaining the problem of poverty in the U.S. I highly recommend it to other students interested in the subject or in policy-making in general.",
    "Absolutely take it if you care or care to learn more about urban poverty and why US policy is lacking to fix the problem. Lloyd makes sure the discussion is always provocative. Class really makes you think and naturally, attracts socially conscious people which makes class interesting. Make sure you do like\/don't mind learning about policy though.",
    "Take this class! The course is exactly what it says in the name. You will discuss the realities of living in poverty in the United States as well as the social science and policy created to analyze and alleviate it, and it's a good mix of quantitative and qualitative work. Don't be afraid if you don't have any quantitative background -- you will have to be able to decipher some data-based academic papers, but the majority of the work that you do will be qualitative critique.",
    "It's a great discussion course about why people are poor and how we determine who gets help. I would recommend anyone take it but especially if you are wanting to learn more about how to make sense of poverty policy and what the benefits and drawbacks are to how American perceives of poor people."
