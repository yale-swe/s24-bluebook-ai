    "Each section varies in the type of work you will be doing and what is expected of you. Section 711 is a lot more work than the other PSYC 495 classes.",
    "This is a not a traditional course and so individual experiences will vary. I enjoyed doing research, but everyone's experience will be different.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in anxiety and mental disorders amongst younger populations",
    "I would recommend the course. I think they are already planning on changing it in the spring, and it sounds like its going to be great!",
    "An extremely worthwhile experience for every psych student. I haven't taken research methods yet, but I'm sure you can't really get this type of experience and knowledge from research methods.",
    "Great learning experience.",
    "Do it! Lab experience is very valuable if you are looking to stay in the field of psychology.",
    "Child Dev + Social Policy was really cool this semester. Erika is really knowledgable, happy to help, and worked to create a sense of community in the group. 12-15 p paper was annoying for a .5 credit but doable.",
    "This is a great opportunity to dip into psych research without when you're still exploring different labs and disciplines, but still receive credit.",
    "Survey course in child development. Interesting but a lot of work for only a half credit",
    "Would recommend if you like prof and research and have time.",
    "I had a great experience in this lab! Really like the topic and want to pursue more research in it in the future. We discussed great articles. Also a very warm atmosphere which made meetings enjoyable."
