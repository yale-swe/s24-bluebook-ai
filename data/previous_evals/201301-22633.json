    "Verse Writing is great, but take it with these things in mind: Professor McClatchy is super blunt about his opinions about your writing, you will probably struggle to figure out exactly what's \"good\" and what's not and that will be discouraging for a while, and not everyone in the class takes it as seriously as you might want to. Take it if you get in because you WILL write better poetry, but definitely take it with a grain of salt.",
    "This is a great class for improving your poetry. Professor McClatchy gives good advice and has excellent taste."
