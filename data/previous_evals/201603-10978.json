    "I have gain practical knowledge and research skills from this amazing capstone project class. This course offered me a chance to work on a very humbling project that shaped the way I understand development work. From interacting with people, brainstorming, to wording in writing the report, every step was very educational.",
    "Teamwork, how to work with a real-life client, and qualitative and quantitative research skills. I learned so much about the challenges to medical education in Liberia and it feels amazing that we might be able to make even a small difference in medical students' lives and hopefully in improving the country's health system."

   "comments": [
    "The team-based structure of the capstone course is really important for the amount of work that we need to get done, and it increases the potential impact of the work that we can do. If it were individual, there is no way we could have done so much research and analysis and produce such a comprehensive report. Our group was really lucky to have such an amazing professor to guide us without being too overbearing, and a team where everyone was invested in the work. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses besides those that are unavoidable in a group project, where sometimes it can be hard to coordinate and has its ups and downs in terms of workload. I still think those are strengths in the end though because they prepare us for working in teams in the real world."

    "You can't take the capstone with anybody but KTS. She is truly a queen, and one of the most transformative professors I have ever had in my life. If she teaches it again, TAKE IT regardless of the topic.",
    "If you get a chance to work on a project with Prof. KTS, take it!!",
    "This was a wonderful capstone class, lead by an amazing, deeply knowledgeable instructor. Honestly, it was one of the highlights of my time at Yale.",
    "Challenges to Medical Education in Liberia with Prof. Talbert-Slagle was an amazing capstone. If you ever have a chance to work with her as your professor, DO IT!! She cares SO much about the work and about helping others. She is truly committed, so much so that some of us are still working on the capstone report to build on what we wrote after we get client feedback next semester. This isn't required or anything, but we all just became so committed to the work throughout the semester that some of us wanted to continue. I know the projects change every year, but if there is another project related to Liberia and health, I would recommend it 100% because there is so much work to be done there (they have the lowest doctor to population ratio in the world!) and the work is really meaningful. I can honestly say that this capstone has been one of the most important classes of my time at Yale, and I'm really grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of it."
