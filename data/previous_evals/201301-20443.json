   "comments": [
    "A great class that examines the linkages between literature,\"visual culture\" and the representation of the black female body. Were a student interested in visual culture and looking at a wide variety of texts that would rarely be put in dialogue with one another I would unquestionably recommend this course.",
    "It's fantastic. I suppose it might vary if there were different artists visiting, but it's a really wonderful course. It's not a survey at all, but it provokes very useful discussion and is an excellent model for how to think interdisciplinarily.It's a lot of reading\/writing, sometimes too much of the former, but all of the assigned works are terrific."

    "It introduced me to new creative works and new questions. It enabled me to engage my dissertation project in new ways."
