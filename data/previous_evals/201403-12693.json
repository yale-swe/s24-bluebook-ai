   "comments": [
    "If you're mechanical engineering, you have to take it. Even at 9am, it isn't awful. In fact, Smooke is definitely one of the better engineering professors at Yale.",
    "A solid course for engineers. Very well taught and very applicable in future careers.",
    "Only take if you have to. That being said, it was a decent class with Smooke - take advantage of office hours.",
    "A poorly run class. Smooke in my opinion wasted valuable class time showing us a bunch of interesting, but ultimately unnecessary Youtube videos. His teaching style preferred writing down countless calculations and numbers to the umpteenth decimal place over mathematical-like clarity. His teaching style wasn't the most efficient. He definitely explained his procedure during a simplification well, but I wish he would just step back from the board for a minute and give a broader context of why we were doing what we were doing. The overarching, bigger picture of the equations we were studying was missing from his lectures. Couple incomplete-feeling lectures and homework assignments with a lack of posted solutions to problem sets, practice midterms, and actual midterms (!!!), and you have MENG 361 circa Fall 2014: a class that butchers the super-interesting topic of fluid mechanics. My recommendation: don't take this class with Smooke, that'll be a mistake.",
    "Great overview of fluid mechanics. Professor Smooke is clear and focused in his teaching (not something you see everyday!) and makes sure that you really understand the material. I definitely recommend the class if you're interested in fluid mechanics (whether for MechE or BME).",
    "A really great class overall! If you're reading this, you probably have to take it at some point, so take it now while Smooke is teaching it! Smooke is great! He can be a little math-y with his lectures, but it's worth it in the end because you understand the derivation and the origin of almost every equation. I really really enjoyed the entire class and I'm actually a little sad that it's over. Pro-tip: pay really close attention in class and listen for the little factoids that Smooke tells you because sometimes he puts them as extra credit on the exam, and a few extra points never hurt anyone! Speaking of points, Smooke seems like a really fair grader and all the exams were reasonable.",
    "If you're considering this as one of your engineering electives, it's an alright choice. Workload was easy, psets were usually pretty short (although difficult) and only two midterms + final. Textbook sucks though, so going to class is really useful.",
    "As a BME major I took this class as an elective. If you are good at physics and math it is not a bad elective to take. However, there are most likely easier electives that are more related to BME to take instead. There is some overlap with BENG 351, but not enough to justify taking the class if you have no interest in Fluid mechanics. Smooke taught the class well, but used a terrible textbook.",
    "If Smooke teaches this class, then YES YES YES. Fluids can be notoriously difficult, but Professor Smooke actually taught it so so well. I learned so much and I really feel like I actually understand the material and it will stick with me because Smooke uses such fun and awesome real-world examples. Lectures can be really entertaining with pictures and short movie clips or demonstrations. Also, lots of in class problem solving which is great.",
    "I would recommend this class. Rather than solving a million of one type of problem, you cover a lot of material and learn the derivations related to the formulas you use. Smooke also likes to break up the lectures by giving a real world example or talking about history of famous fluid mechanics people. It's not a fun class, but it is very satisfying once you lean and understand the material.",
    "Good.",
    "If you are MechE, you have to take it, but I would not be nearly as apprehensive as you probably are. Professor Smooke does a great job explaining the concepts and realizing what is a reasonable work load for students. Also, buy the book from White - much better than Potter and only cost me 75 cents on Amazon. Oh and look up Lake Peigneur cause that shit is crazy.",
    "I loved this class. I was really nervous for it because I am not at all a physics person. I took physics 180 at yale, and the professor was horrible; the course was horrible. Nothing was taught to me and nothing made sense. This class was actually amazing in that it covered cool topics, but specifically because Smooke is amazing. He is a great teacher. Fluids is a hard topic so things don't always make sense the first time in lecture, but when you go back and review your notes before doing hw or studying (which you will have to do), you will see everything he teaches has a place logically in the class. He teaches class so interestingly, with great flow. He ends many of the lectures with 10 minute videos or example problems that show exactly how the theory and formulas we learn relate to the real world. No other physics or science professors do this, but he is really amazing.",
    "This class was actually really interesting; I thoroughly enjoyed all the material covered and it helped me get a better understanding of the ways in which fluids are integral parts of everyday life. Professor Smooke was great, always providing clear notes and relevant real world example problems and videos that made the material a lot more interesting, even when the concepts were being discussed in theoretical terms. The exams were very fair and intended to just test your knowledge of the general concepts.",
    "Good, well organized, fundamental lecture with psets. You know what you're getting with this one. Smooke does a good job of motivating the math with applications (though in fluids, they're mostly aero, racecars, military, etc.). He's well organized, and everything worked. Office hours were helpful for doing the psets. The tests were fair.",
    "Fairly easy MechE course.",
    "It was as enjoyable as this kind of class could be. Smooke is good, and I highly highly recommend the homework sessions. It was where I learned a lot of the material.",
    "I would recommend MENG 361 to another student, even if they don't have to take it. The material is very interesting and it isn't as difficult as you would think if you pay attention in class.",
    "Absolutely not, unless you're really interested in the course material. ME 361 covers fantastic and interesting material and a disappointingly poor manner. Here are a couple SIMPLE things that would serve to greatly improve the class: 1) Posting homework solutions after the homework is turned in 2) Posting midterm solutions after the midterms 3) Posting practice problems for the midterms more than 12 hours before the exam 4) Writing midterms that do not have significantly flawed problems, which would save students stress and cause them not to waste their exam time trying to solve effectively unsolvable problems. 5) Covering material on the current problem set more than two days ahead of the due date (thus enabling students to start the psets earlier in the week) 6) Choosing a textbook that is intelligible and pedagogically effective. 7) Following the textbook in lecture (or assigning relevant sections of the textbook to follow the lecture layout) so that the lectures are useful when solving the problem sets (which come directly from the book) 8) Hiring TA's who have background in fluids, NOT just some other STEM field, so that they can do more than simply look at the solution key. 9) Learning how to use a projector so that we don't waste 10-15 minutes per week on trying to display slides. I have been excited for this class for the past year, and I am still incredibly interested in the topic. However, I'd be stunned if students who weren't predisposed to like the class came away with a newfound interest in fluids. What a shame. Professor Smooke is a friendly guy but somewhere between meh and inadequate as a teacher. The class was poorly organized- lectures often didn't match the textbook (which was absolutely awful, by the way) and he wasted a SIGNIFICANT amount of time every week trying to get the projector to work. Amazingly, Smooke based his lectures off a second fluids textbook which he didn't advertise to us. This resulted in our provided textbook being irrelevant and obtuse, and once some students stumbled on to the textbook that Smooke himself used, much of the class converted to that book. What a sleazy way to get out of having to design lectures for a class. Although I got the impression that Smooke genuinely cared about his students, I felt that he wasn't as responsive to feedback as he could have been. The textbook's poor quality, which was identified as an issue early on in the semester, was never addressed, and Smooke refused to write us new problems for the problem sets even though the book's problems were poorly worded and required non-intuitive assumptions. Although the solutions to the midterms were released ~1 day before the final exam, the overwhelming lack of feedback\/resources during the actual semester was inexcusable; any good STEM class provides solutions keys to all the midterms and homeworks (which were never provided) or provides compelling reasons not to. I have every reason to believe that Professor Smooke is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about both fluid mechanics and teaching. That I cannot give him a good review despite me being fascinated with the topic at hand is disappointing.",
    "You'll take it if you have to. Try to take it with the other Prof (not Smooke), if you can. The textbook sucks and Smooke is monotone, though the information he disseminates is super useful. He just doesn't convey it well enough to hold the attention. You'll probably stop showing up to class half way through the semester. Just work on problem sets with your friends and piece together everything from the textbook. Hopefully, Smooke will actually release the homework solutions and such when you take the course. Tests are fair.",
    "If you are interested in fluid mechanics, I would recommend this class. The material can be relatively dry as it really is an entire semester calculating how fluid flows but the class does a solid job of presenting this material. Professor Smooke is clear and organized and he takes the time to make sure the students are engaged by relating the material to real world applications or stories. In addition, professor Smooke checked in with students to make sure that the class was going alright. Finally, the workload was very manageable and the tests were fair.",
    "If you have taken Thermodynamics and Differential Equations, this course should be no problem. Fluid Dynamics with Smooke is a well-taught and well-organized course. There are weekly p-sets, two midterms, and one final. The material you are tested on is presented in lecture and doesn't directly correspond to the book. Go to lecture and you will survive.",
    "Only if you are really interested in the material or need to take it for your major!",
    "This class was good in some ways. I learned a lot about fluid mechanics for sure. The textbook is really bad... it seems like the homework isn't hard because the math or material is actually hard, but because the textbook is so bad that it's really hard to actually figure out what is going on in the question. I would honestly say that I hope that you can figure out a way to get the textbook second hand because I don't think that the textbook deserves to generate income for its authors. Maybe capitalism works on textbooks.",
    "Good class that pulls from other engineering classes. The first midterm is the easiest and it is best to do well on the first exam. The class gets much more difficult as it goes, make sure to not put the problem sets aside.",
    "Pretty good course. For me the first half was better than the second, simply because it was deriving equations that we then applied to everything rather than being supplied with numbers and cases and told to take them for granted. It also got a bit rushed at the end, which was sad because the last few topics were really cool. My biggest complaint is that the textbook problems were often confusing (when in doubt, go to the TA office hours). Overall, solid, would recommend for anyone who has the interest.",
    "It's not a great course. I'm a physics major taking this out of interest, and wasn't overly thrilled. 9am is a terrible, brutal, time slot. Midterms and final were fairly straightforward though. The textbook sucks beyond belief, and psets are moronic searches for random equations you plug numbers into. To study I went 99% off his practice problems.",
    "Lectures are wonderful, tests are super straightforward and fair, and it's just generally a great class. You definitely should go to lecture simply because it's actually helpful and enjoyable, but you can probably get by without it if waking up at 9 am doesn't happen every day.",
    "Not a terrible class as engineering requirements go. Workload is reasonable in the scope of an engineering class.",
    "This was a fine, largely well-taught class that I thoroughly enjoyed despite the difficult material. It really gives you a full understanding of the material (and Smooke -- who is very excited about cars and planes -- gives you an appreciation for it). I fully recommend this class, though it will be helpful if you find a pset-checking group, as some of the problems can be very tricky and the subject matter itself is complex.",
    "Definitely a doable class. It's the kind of class where you understand the concept and then look up the equation in the book, they're not the kind of equations you'll just memorize. But be warned, the book is absolutely terrible. It has typos and does not do a good job of preparing you for the questions on the problem sets.",
    "Obviously you have to take it, but it should be one of the more pleasant Mech E experiences overall.",
    "Although the information is difficult this class is very interesting. I would definitely suggest it to any MechE if professor Smooke is teaching it. Recognize this as one of your more difficult classes and it will take some extra time to understand. The problem sets are reasonable and the exams are too but significant time will be needed.",
    "This is a tough class and Smooke is a good teacher but inconsistent with the book and sometimes goes too quickly. The tests are kinda random and don't seem to focus on the material we focused on in the homeworks.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take the class with Professor Smooke, do so! He makes it interesting and it's enjoyable to see practical application of what we are learning. You probably have to take it, so just keep up with material and you will be fine!",
    "This class was really helpful and well taught - I really like Professor Smooke. This class not only taught me how to understand Fluid Mechanics, but also Differential Equations. Going to the TAs' sections really helped me understand things and do well on the homework so I definitely recommend that. The exams were hard, but fair - definitely go over Your work because I found a lot of little things that changed my answers the second time I looked at everything. This class is more work than average but I found it really rewarding.",
    "The course is a comprehensive class looking at several methods analyzing various fluid mechanic situations. Highly recommend for any mechanical engineers or students interested in the essentials of flow and fluid properties.",
    "One of the most important classes for engineers as the derivations and equations will be applicable to many design problems. Prof. Smooke provides numerous examples of each concept and makes the class exciting. The material itself is quite difficult.",
    "Even if you don't have to take it, Fluids could make an interesting elective if you are interested in QR courses. Professor Smooke structures the class so that if you put in the time, you should do well. Be warned though, he curves the average to a B- (although he said he won't curve down).",
    "I think this class deals with a challenging subject without an overwhelming workload. Difficulty picks up a lot in the second half of the semester, but there are plenty of TA sessions and opportunities to learn. Smooke is a clear and organized lecturer. He keeps things interesting with real world examples and frequent video clips.",
    "Little connection btwn lectures and the psets which was difficult but I think will be improved in the future. I didn't hate this class.",
    "This was an awesome class. Professor Smooke made 9am class not only tolerable, but enjoyable to attend. Problem sets were pretty straightforward and tests were fair. I loved the class and I definitely recommend it.",
    "Hardest class I've taken.",
    "This is a fine class, and Prof. Smooke does a good job teaching fluid mechanics clearly without imposing an enormous workload. Class organization, though, isn't great. The book, the problem sets, and the formula sheets seem haphazard and error-prone, making learning a little bit more difficult than it should be.",
    ". This is a terrible, terrible class. While the material itself is somewhat interesting, the way it is taught and the structure of the course just makes learning it an excruciating process. In no particular order, here are some of the things that make this course terrible. Prof. Smooke posts sample exams before the midterms and final and then no solutions to the samples. How are students supposed to learn without the solutions? Prof. Smooke does not post homework solutions. How are students supposed to know if their homework was graded unfairly? How are students supposed to know what they did wrong on their homework when there are no comments on their errors and just an x saying its wrong? Prof. Smooke posts midterm solutions months after the midterm, instead of when he hands back the midterms. Prof. Smooke assigns homework to be due the day of the midterm. And the day before the final. Prof. Smooke failed to take his own midterms to find a glaring error that greatly affected a large portion of the class as it rendered a problem unsolvable. Prof. Smooke is astonished at the concept of writing his own homework questions. He was incredulous when students suggested that the book was terrible, the books practice problems were terrible, and that the homework wouldnt have so many issues if he wrote the problems himself. Prof. Smookes homework often covers material not covered in class, and sometimes never talks about that material in future lectures. Youre probably required to take this class. Im sorry. Good luck.",
    "Breathe. Prepare. This should be your hardest class for the semester, otherwise there's something wrong with your life."
