    "This course fosters invaluable professional skills and provides a broad, foundational introduction to many historiographic methods. It was a joy to spend time together with two entire cohorts.",
    "I learned more about early American cinema than I'd ever expected to know. I also learned a lot of valuable information about the field, and academia at large.",
    "Over the course of the semester, I developed a deep understanding of American cinema between the late nineteenth century and the mid-1920s. Additionally, I have learned a great deal about historiographic trends in the study of American film. In addition, I feel that the course, more than any I have taken so far, really helped me develop professional skills and historical research methods."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course might benefit from a non-chronological arrangement, so that students begin to speak of key conceptual frameworks (such as \"gender\" or \"race\" cinema) well before the conclusion of the course. The section on materiality and the film archive is terrific. It should be less of a time commitment, though.",
    "Strengths: Mostly great readings. A few very good screenings. Very informal yet stimulating class atmosphere. Sense of cooperation between students, not competition. Very conducive to friendly debate. The focus on professional development was invaluable. I also loved having Dan Streible and Jane Gaines visit class. Weaknesses: Too much reading. Two or three articles a week, or half of a book would have been more reasonable, especially given the screenings and the extra assignments. Honestly, the class felt like a class and a half, a silent cinema seminar with a historical methods focus. I would have liked less discussion of silent cinema and more focus on research methodology. Even by the end of the course, I didn't feel entirely comfortable doing historical research.",
    "I really appreciated the structure of this course (screening one night followed by class and an \"after-seminar\" focused on professional development and research methods the next day). I found the structure to be very helpful. The assignments allowed us to pursue our own interests while learning new skills. In this way, the assignments always seemed relevant and useful."

   "comments": [
    "There is no need for me to recommend this course... it is mandatory!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to film students for three reasons: 1. having a grounding in early cinema is essential for anyone working in the field; 2. the readings were good and not TOO hampered by bad theory; 3. Charlie is a model teacher and scholar.",
    "Yes- I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about the history of American cinema or in learning how to do historical research in film."
