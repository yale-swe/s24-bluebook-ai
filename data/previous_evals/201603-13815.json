    "I think I developed better communication and teamwork skills, and I definitely learned more how to work for a client and try to anticipate their needs. I also learned a lot about impact investing and the media space in Africa, and I also learned how to go about researching an area I'd never engaged with before.",
    "Good real world application of some of skills\/insights developed in the major. Nice way to see how non-profit consulting works and the types of challenges real organisations face and how to apply some of what is learned in the major to such \"real\" problems.",
    "This was a great capstone and lived up to my expectations. The most valuable skill I learnt was really understanding the framework and country analysis needed for proper investment due diligence; also learnt a lot about how media is an important tool in shaping a country's political system",
    "Capstone projects is extremely relevant for obtaining group working skills.",
    "This course was an incredible practical learning experience. I felt that I could use my policy analysis skills and learned a lot about investing and social impact investment funds.",
    "I learned a lot about working in a group and how to structure long term work. I also learned about impact investing and non profit work.",
    "I learned a lot about working with a team and defining my\/our own project given a vague objective."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: allows for real world problem solving, you know your project is actually going to a real company that might do something with it, and there's a ton of room for creativity. It's also a really strong team building experience, and it sounds great in interviews. Weaknesses: if your client isn't that interesting or doesn't know what they want, it can really derail your project. Some people had clients that didn't interact with them all that much or gave them unclear assignments, and it made everything a lot harder. Also, the team aspect is good in some ways, but can also lead to an uneven distribution of work. Improvements: I think clients should have to submit proposals with a very clear deliverables section, and Jackson should consider that highly (it would be really cool if the kids could also have some hand in choosing clients, but I don't know if that would be possible). Also, Jackson should abandon the idea of choosing projects from the same continent. We should choose the best clients regardless of where they're from, and we didn't really get anything out of all having done the same continent.",
    "Not very structured, which can be nice at times but makes it feel less impactful and at times somewhat frustrating to lack the typical sense of direction in most classes.",
    "The course lacked a syllabus.",
    "I really enjoyed feeling like I was making an impact and learning skills that will help me next year, however working with the group was a challenge especially because I think that some people worked a lot more than others I also wish we had structured the class to finish everything before reading week began because I think that we could have accomplished that.",
    "This could be improved with more structure, more rigorous assignments, and more initial buy-in."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know that it matters whether I would recommend it, since it's essentially the global affairs thesis, but I do think it was a good experience and I'm glad I did it. It's great to get to have such a practical experience, and I was lucky because my client was able to give us clear deliverables. The capstone can be either a great or really frustrating experience based on what your client wants and how your team works together.",
    "Of course!",
    "Bo is an excellent capstone leader. But only choose this project if you are invested in it."
