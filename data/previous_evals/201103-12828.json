   "comments": [
    "It is a great course for those interested in learning Chinese. Liu laoshi is fantastic. While it was not a hard class for me, it may be a hard class if you are a true heritage beginner.",
    "Chinese 112 is a great course for native speakers. The course is entirely in Chinese but at a comfortable level, and we really focus on the things that native speakers have trouble with, like grammar and writing. Students in the class have many different levels of fluency, and it sometimes is frustrating when oral presentations come more easily to some students. I would definitely recommend Chinese 112 to any heritage speaker who can understand some conversational Chinese but doesn't know any characters or is not entirely comfortable speaking it.",
    "If you have spoken Chinese at home and have a minor vocabulary, then take this course. The class would be very difficult for one who has no reading or writing experience, even one who speaks fluently. Overall, the class greatly strengthens speaking, reading, and writing skills in Chinese.",
    "For any one who is serious about improving the quality of their Chinese, I would highly recommend this course. If you are disciplined, the workload is manageable. As a non-Chinese 'native' speaker, it allowed me to progress faster than if I had taken 110. If you have relatively strong comprehension and speaking skills, definitely consider 112.",
    "A fast-paced (If you're lucky, only 1 hour of work a night) language class alongside many other American-born Chinese kids with mild identity crises.",
    "If you area heritage speaker (that is, aurally and somewhat orally proficient) and forgot all the Chinese you learned, this is the class to take! You will definitely learn a lot and feel yourself learning a lot, too.",
    "I would say that taking this courses is perhaps more rigorous than some other languages may be. However, I believe that this class and the Chinese department overall is very good at instructing and building language skills. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Chinese 112 01 is a good introduction to Chinese for heritage speakers. You should already be fluent verbally if you plan to take this course. Chinese 112 01 focuses on learning characters and grammar structures. There are daily quizzes and about 2 hours of homework every night, so it's an intensive course.",
    "Yes, this is the only way to learn Chinese.",
    "Good introductory class for heritage speakers.",
    "I recommend the class! Liu Laoshi is great, kind, and patient. She is a phenomenal teacher. The workout is daily and seems alot, but it helps you improve."
