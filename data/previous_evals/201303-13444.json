   "comments": [
    "Ya - you'll get to write a bunch of fun pieces. You won't see your writing improve by leaps and bounds, but you will have a good time.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who is interested in journalism or wants to experiment with his or her writing.",
    "I would summarize it as a class which takes students of different abilities and helps them with their writing. It is a collaborative environment, so everyone reads everyone else's work. This was a bit weird at first, but I quickly got adjusted to it. There is a lot of reading.",
    "CPSC 290 was a lot of work, but I got a ton out of it. You basically have a ~1,000 word essay due every week, but with each assignment comes a whole new adventure. The class was great because it gave me the opportunity to go outside my comfort zone and have experiences that I would otherwise never have had. I got to talk to a bunch of fascinating people as I wrote my stories and honed my writing skills. You're given a lot of creative freedom, so the class is really what you make of it. I feel like I grew a lot not only as a writer, but also as a person. Patti is a seasoned New York Times reporter and has a lot of great advice. Her small stature is deceiving; she's done her fair share of crazy things. If you get into the class, definitely take it!",
    "I enjoyed the amount of practice and wide variety of different styles of journalism covered in the course. I would say this was most helpful. I do however think that the course would have benefitted from more structure. Critiquing all students' work every week was simply too much and as a result, I did not feel like we paid the attention necessary to the work. In addition, I think more structured discussion of the readings assigned would have been helpful, though sometimes the readings were too much to accomplish in a week. Professor Brown was great and supportive professor, very accessible and easy to talk to and always offered helpful advice. I would only suggest she be a little more critical in our feedback for the assignments. I would recommend taking this course to try your hand at journalism if you are interested.",
    "It's a fun opportunity to write a piece almost every week, and you have a ton of freedom in determining what style of piece you want to write (from true journalism to more of a personal essay). I would recommend it to students who really want a chance to write.",
    "Take it! Great writing course!!",
    "A quick fire series of assignments that span many different styles and tones of journalistic writing."
