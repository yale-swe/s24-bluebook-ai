   "comments": [
    "A great class, especially for freshman. Professor Strebeigh pushes each student with comprehensive comments on each essay and draft (5 throughout the semester) and leads purposeful discussions on relevant essays by great writers.",
    "Take this class! The lessons you learn will improve your writing for everything -- campus publications, history classes, science reports, you name it. You read amazing nonfiction authors and essays, but you should really only take this class if you want to become an all-around better writer.",
    "ENG120 is such a great class. It's for students who don't really know what they're doing in an english class. It's also for students who do know how to hold a pencil and write words that make sense together. It's for everyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student at Yale. Whether you are a humanities major or a STEM major, the skills acquired through this course are applicable to a variety of fields. I would recommend Professor's Strebeigh section because I think that he has a creative teaching approach that engages student in the writing process in ways that courses in my high school never did. He is a dedicated teacher who provides ample comments to improve the quality of his students' writing.",
    "This was a really tough class for me. I'd always struggled with my writing coming in, and I really had a hard time at first. As the semester progressed, I definitely began to feel more confident in my writing and could feel myself progressing. I really hated the class for most of the semester but by the end I enjoyed it and am definitely glad I enrolled. I think everyone should try to take this or some other intro writing class while at Yale. Definitely very useful.",
    "Great course to improve your writing. Take it!",
    "English 120 01 is a dynamic, interesting class brought to life by a truly engaging professor. I heard so much praise about Professor Strebeigh before coming into this class, and I was not disappointed. You'll learn so much about writing creative nonfiction effectively. Essay prompts are interesting and span from personal essays to vivid portraits of people and places to cultural criticism and even satire. The grades are hard fought for, and you might go the whole semester without getting an A, so you'll have to be in the right mindset before taking the class. Don't take the class with a grade as your endgoal--but take it for your own personal improvement. It'll be a lot more rewarding that way.",
    "Great Course, Strebeigh is amazing! take it f you can!",
    "English 120 is an unbelievable course that will take your writing to a new level. I had no experience with creative nonfiction prior to this course, but the 5 essays left me feeling prepared to write about any topic with a wide variety of tools. Professor Strebeigh's teaching method is fast, intimidating, and brilliant, and each class will leave you exhilarated and a little nervous. Don't worry though, the system of drafts and revisions is well-designed to help you improve your writing. The class isn't too heavy on reading either, and almost everything that was required was an interesting or funny essay that was fun to read. I have no regrets from English 120, and would recommend it, especially with Professor Strebeigh, to anyone who wants to write better and read some really good essays.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone wanting to know how to write, and how to write well. The examples we read are so helpful and open you up to a bunch of other texts you would have never expected to be interested in.",
    "English 120 was an amazing course. It was difficult but really helped me as a writer. I would recommend this to any student who wants to improve their writing. The workload was a lot but was spread out enough to make it manageable. Take this course!",
    "English 120 is a writing intensive class that promises to teach you invaluable techniques to transform your writing and introduce you to a more complex manner of interpreting essays. The class delivers on that promise, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to whoever wishes to substantially improve their writing. This is an especially valuable course because it is almost guaranteed to stick with you long after you complete it, as you will continue to make use of the knowledge you have acquired in future writing classes and endeavors. Just be aware that the professor is demanding and that you will be expected to push yourself to produce the best work that you can. This is ultimately rewarding, but it can get tough at times."
