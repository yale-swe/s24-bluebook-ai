    "This course starts off making you think it's like the Calc BC you took in high school. This is not true. This is not your momma's calc class. A lot of the material is difficult to follow and the professors can be confusing and difficult to understand.",
    "The integrals portion of the course is relatively easy, but be prepared for some difficulty with series. Shom is a nice guy and always willing to help, but frankly I would pick a different instructor. He doesn't explain very well and often made errors or further confused us.",
    "ONLY take this if you have to. It is taught poorly and will not be enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class for any student who wants a quick review of BC calculus and might be a little worried about diving into new material.",
    "Unless you are truly interested in math or need it for your major, I would not recommend this class.",
    "Only do it for your major.",
    "I only took it because I had to",
