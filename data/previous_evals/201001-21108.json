   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was overall a really nice music course that engaged with things outside of music and that's refreshing.",
    "A historical and critical examination of acousmatic sound. Would recommend highly (especially in later years, as the course structure gets worked out more clearly).",
    "If you're into the philosophy of aesthetics, language, the senses, or metaphysics, then, yes. However, this course rarely pertained to music.",
    "An interesting introduction to the concept of acousmaticity and how various manifestations of it may be balanced against the 'classic' interpretation of the term. Some understanding of the history of sound conceptualisation would give students a great advantage in having something especial to contribute to the class. Recommended especially for students with some background in Continental philosophy, as they are likely to get the most out of both the material and the professor's understanding of the niceties of it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for every musician."

   "comments": [
    "Got me into some really interesting philosophical questions on sound and the voice that I wouldn't have thought about otherwise.",
    "This course strengthened my awareness of the difficulty in communicating ideas about sound and music. It enhanced my desire to refine our language, with regards to music and sound, in order to incorporate ideas outside of the norm.",
    "Interesting to get an idea of how far you can stretch musicology into the realms of music philosophy... Not immediately relevant to my research interests, but a useful source of information not likely to come from elsewhere as the field is only just developing.",
    "This class opened my mind to so many new ideas and conceptual frameworks. I wish there were 13other classes like this during my coursework!"
