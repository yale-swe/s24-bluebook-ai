   "comments": [
    "This class is great. Difficult subject matter, manageable problem sets. No tests (including no final). You will code in either C or Fortran, so make sure you know one or can teach yourself. You don't use structures and it's pretty straightforward.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed this course. We covered a huge range of material, from numerical linear algebra to interpolation, integration, solutions of differential equations, etc. Be warned however that Professor Rokhlin moves quickly - I might have been a bit unprepared mathematically compared to some other students in the class, but I often missed details during lectures. This is definitely a course where its sometimes worth just listening, jotting down key terms, and reviewing the material presented after class. The professor also makes himself very available to students and is willing to sit down and work through a problem until you really understand. Additionally, the books he suggests at the beginning of the term can be found online and are very good, so they're worth having. Overall I appreciated the breadth of the course - its good to know what techniques are out there and you can always go back and learn the details when you need to. The problem sets were well written and the TA was usually very helpful. The first 3 were coding assignments - we implemented some useful linear algebra algorithms. The final one was a bit more open ended, requiring code and a short report. In general the work load was light for a CS elective. Finally, Professor Rokhlin is hilarious, if a bit politically incorrect. His lectures and stories are never a bore.",
    "It's interesting if like the topic. The professor is very knowledgeable if hard to follow at times. He also has many weird stories.",
    "If you had to suck at a class, don't look towards anything other than numerical computation. It doesn't require much, but rewards the overachiever with glorious bounties. Although nonetheless however forthwith notwithstanding albeit difficult, it was interesting and a worthwhile endeavor that trolled like a troll in the marsh of Trollland.",
    "if you're a computer science major and have taken cs223 before and want a class with very little work and no stress, take this class. if youre looking for a class that is taught well and will teach you a lot, look elsewhere.",
    "Do you know linear algebra up and down, front and back? If so, take this class for an easy CS credit. If not, run away.",
    "Course is alright. Lecture can be confusing, but the problem sets are really useful and not too hard."
