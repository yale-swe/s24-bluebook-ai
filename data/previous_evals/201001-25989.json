    "I would always recommend DS",
    "If you want a broad, but also somewhat in-depth overview of Western philosophy since the seventeenth century, you must take this class. It is excellent!",
    "DS Philosophy second semester was one of the best experiences so far in my short time at Yale. This course has got me considering philosophy as a major. First semester, I had a less than stellar professor, but Dr. Possen more than made up for that in the second semester. He is one of the best teachers at this university. Not only is he brilliant, but he is approachable and works hard to make sure everyone in the class understands the material. He will even meet with you at any time outside of class if you have extra concerns. Dr. Possen taught me how to write a philosophy paper, a skill I will have forever. If you can take this course with him, do so. I am not kidding when I say it will change your life.",
    "Best class\/semester of DS. Awesome books and by the end you'll really feel like you've mastered a tradition. Essays are, IMO, the easiest out of the three classes. Kant's Critique of Pure Reason will still make no sense by the time you're done but that's okay--nobody really gets it. Try to get Possen or Ganssle.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking the second semester of DS, partially because you can't learn just half the canon, and partially because the works are much more interesting. Plato seems even cooler when you see authors from the 18th century still responding to his thoughts. I found the papers for the second semester to be more difficult, but that was because I challenged myself to take on a very different topic every time, and the arguments are sometimes less logical. One should not be worried at all about the final if one tries the rest of the year - it involves short answer questions testing your direct knowledge of the arguments and one essay (in all, it was actually quite fun to see how much I'd learned). My only recommendation: do all the reading! It's worth it!",
    "This is the DS class where office hours become essential. A great class, but the reading is often, no hyperbole here, incomprehensible. Having professors supplement what I read with comprehensible summaries of the text I read was responsible for the majority of what I learned this semester.",
    "Second semester philosophy is difficult in a number of ways. Besides a LOT of Kant, there are several other thinkers that can be difficult to understand if not pondered carefully. That being said, there are also thinkers (some of which are those that were difficult) that are immensely rewarding to get through and comprehend",
    "I would highly recommend Directed Studies. There is no other philosophy course that provides such a good introduction to the greatest minds that ever were. Discussion section helps make dense texts understandable, something you can't get from reading these texts by yourself. David Possen is so helpful and really cares about his students. You will have a great understanding of the texts but will reach it yourself, not from your professor.",
    "DS Philosophy provides a basic understanding of post-Descartes Western philosophy. I would certainly recommend it.",
    "4. Directed Studies will re-teach you how to read, write, analyze, discuss, and \u0096 above all else \u0096 think better than any other freshman course or program at Yale. I know it sounds cocky, but I\u0092m finding myself better prepared as a rising sophomore than my peers who didn\u0092t take the course \u0096 even those who came from far more rigorous high school backgrounds. It\u0092s intense, though, and you have to want the immersion in the Western canon to enjoy the course. It\u0092s not worth it if you just want the kudos. I\u0092d take it again, though, without a second thought."
