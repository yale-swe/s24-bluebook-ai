   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned different concepts about lying that I hadn't considered before through reading interesting texts and having discussions about them.",
    "I learned how to closely analyze and text and do more than just summarize what I've read but actually prove claims and make points using the language in the readings and not just the content. I also gained insight on how to improve my technical writing skills with the help of my classmates and teacher.",
    "My close reading and analysis skills improved and I learned to be more critical as a reader. I also developed greater writing skills. The course helped me gain a more organized approach to essay writing, and especially helped me with formulating theses and writing introduction and conclusions.",
    "I learned how to argue well.There was a large emphasis on crafting a nuanced argument, which I think will serve me well in all my future classes at Yale.",
    "I gained more experience in literary analysis and essay writing.",
    "In this course, I really began to focus much more on the structure and language of my essays. While interesting points were important, how I shared those points on the page was equally important, As a result, I worked harder on drafts, and I learned how to edit my papers more efficiently.",
    "I learned to write essays at a college level, and to analyze texts by going deeper than finding general meanings in the work's theme. I learned to close-read texts and derive meaning from the pattern of the words themselves (for example).",
    "My skills with close reading and writing different styles of papers were greatly developed over the course of the semester, from close analysis of a text to writing a research paper.",
    "This English 115 course allowed me to develop my literary analysis skills at a higher collegiate level. Rereading texts that I had previously read in high school and analyzing them through this course's guidance gave me a new perspective on them. I now analyze any text with a more critical and experienced eye than I had before this semester. This course also taught me how to analyze new texts in relation to other relevant \"lens\" texts. But most importantly, this course allowed me to develop my writing skills at a detailed level. I improved my overall essay organization but I also improved my sentence structure and sentence organization. Taking English 115 showed me that an essay should bring forth a compelling and nuanced argument and, that it should have a distinctive style to match the argument.",
    "I developed skills in close-reading and integrating multiple works into one essay. I improved the fluency and clarity of my writing, as well as worked on my skills to suggest improvements in the writing of others (during our in class workshops)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this class were the discussions we had which I really enjoyed, but I thought there could be more help for our essays or more time to be able to go to the writing center.",
    "The strengths are definitely the teacher's involvement and dedication to the class, the enthusiasm of the students, and the class size. Another huge strength was the interesting content we read and the diverse mix of books, plays, essays and articles we went through over the course of the semester. The only thing I would change in the interest of improving would be to do more short, in-class writing assignments and to give time to allow students to discuss and give feedback to their peers on topics chosen for essays before they write the paper.",
    "The small class size facilitates a very dynamic and collaborative environment, which helps students benefit from each other's ideas and insights. The workshop process (reading and commenting on peers' essays) is initially daunting but is very helpful for both the essay-writer and the rest of the class. The reading load could be more evenly distributed as it is very high some weeks and much lower others.",
    "I loved all the reading, although the quantity was tough to handle at times. I liked how the writing assignments shifted lenses. We wrote to meet different purposes on each assignment.",
    "The subject matter was very interesting and the assignments and discussions were engaging. I especially liked when we studied forgeries at Beinecke Library. I think it could be improved if we studied fewer texts and spent more time on each one.",
    "The strength of the class are its workshops and close editing of your papers, specifically working on your form. However, I wish we could have developed more cohesive analyses of the books themselves. I felt like in class, most points were interesting but not push further every time.",
    "The course was a fantastic introductory English course because it engaged freshman with college level writing while keeping the topic of our writing and analyses (lying) interesting and pertinent.",
    "Taking a literature seminar was great because it was a smaller group of people, and the class was based around conversational, discussion-based learning.",
    "A strong strength of this course is the classmate and professor intimacy. There were less than 15 students and this small number allowed for students to get to know each other and their writing styles. A small classroom setting allowed us to learn from each other as well as to properly make critiques and suggestions to improve our writing. The small number of students also allowed for Gina to become familiar with each of our writing styles so that improving our writing was a long-term project that was built upon over the course of the semester. Another strength would be the occasional workshops and peer reviewing of essays. Again, this allowed for us to learn from each other's writing styles and to apply it in our own writing. I suppose the only weakness of this course was that we would often get too deep in analyzing the texts. I really did enjoy analyzing texts for their hidden meanings. But perhaps it would have been better suited to focus more on analyzing the style of writing rather than the content of the writing. Having done the former this past semester, I found that a large portion of improving my writing was done outside of the classroom.",
    "One strength of this course is in its subject matter. The central focus of \"lying\" was extremely interesting, and I liked the balance of short stories and full length works. I also liked the in-class workshops for the opportunity they provided to hear from peers. One way I think the course could be improved is to reduce in-class brainstorming or small group activities, and instead focus on class discussions. I found this class discussions interesting and engaging, and would have liked them to have a more significant spotlight. I also would encourage Gina to have more one-on-one meetings with students, as she was very helpful whenever I was able to speak with her about our readings or my essays one-on-one."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. It was a really fun class, and I do think I learned more things. It was an eye-opening class as well.",
    "Yes, it's a great way to improve your writing skills and in my opinion, more fun because you're reading more literature as opposed to an English 114 class where its mostly research-based.",
    "I would definitely recommend 115. It's a good way to develop reading and writing skills, which are important in almost every class and every major. It's great for people who want to develop these skills but also read and analyze literature and the fact that all papers are based on analyzing and engaging with literary texts is helpful for people who can never think of paper topics.",
    "Yes! This was a great class. Gina really engaged with the students and her enthusiasm fueled mine.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with a passing interest in psychology, since it deals with interesting questions about different kinds of lies and why we tell them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. However, I would just make them aware that the stress of the class is on the language of essay writing, and not necessarily the points.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it makes you think more about the motivations of characters' deceptions as they appear in the literature.",
    "Of course! If you're looking for an introductory college english course that's also extremely interesting (in terms of the works you read and seminar discussions you engage in), this is the class for you!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - I was really given the opportunity to learn about good writing and it was great to be able to establish a real connection with the professor and the rest of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, regardless of their major or future career. This english course is perfect for those looking to not only fulfill the writing requirement, but to also improve on their writing and analyzing skills. Gina created a very friendly and intellectually stimulating environment so that I would actually look forward to english. The class discussions are very thought compelling and the arguments brought up are very unique. Overall, there was a great class dynamic that was apparent as we looks at the lies authors created and at the lies in literature. All of these things made english 115 my favorite course for my first semester at Yale despite the fact that I am a STEM person; I consider this course to be a hidden gem that all majors will enjoy. As for the actual writing in this course, there is ample time between deadlines to work on essays. Gina had several office hours to help students with essays and she would even email back and forth if that was more convenient. Her comments on essays were very helpful and specific. Gina was also very understanding if the entire class was struggling with deadlines. That said, improving our writing was mostly a self-driven task that no one could make us do. You really had to make a serious attempt at writing the best rough draft possible so that your writing could be improved that much further. You also had to carefully listen to critiques of your writing and actually apply the suggestions for there to be any improvement. But overall, the course was extremely compelling and it was my favorite course for this semester. A must take for any undergraduate.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The readings were interesting, the workload was manageable, and the small class size facilitated interesting discussions in which it was easy to give your opinion and become involved in the discussion."
