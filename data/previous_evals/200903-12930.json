   "comments": [
    "DS Lit is basically reading, reading, reading, but don't worry: it's all manageable, even with extra-curriculars. DS Lit was the most emotionally engaging of the three sections, and I really appreciated it. Schirmeister is a really intelligent woman whose voice moderates section well. It's a great course! DO NOT DROP DS. You will regret it.",
    "DS Lit is an intense, fast paced course. Students are dedicated and somewhat competitive, and the class is definitely not for everyone. It can be extremely beneficial if it is right for you and offers incredible opportunities to expose yourself to famous literature and to improve your writing skills.",
    "I would recommend it for someone with a strong interest in all the humanities. DS Lit is basically a survey of clasical verse (dead white men).",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that an interest in the development of Western culture. The knowledge is very fulfilling. Just be prepared to read many chapters.",
    "Taking DS was absolutely the right idea for me. In Lit, I got to read great works that I had never before had the chance to pick up, discuss them with a group of brilliant and highly motivated peers, and challenge myself with essays about the material. The workload was often heavy but well worth the time I put into it. I would absolutely recommend DS to a student looking for a challenge, some direction, and with an interest in the humanities.",
    "If you would like a broad understanding of Great Books, yes take the class. It is a great background for any type of major. You may not know the specifics of each book, but you will come out with a general understanding of the works.",
    "Highly recommended section. Prof. Schirmeister isn't one of the better-known DS Lit professors but her class was engaging, challenging and almost always very enjoyable. If you are planning to slack off or want a professor who will wander off on tangents during class, this section probably isn't for you. As for the DS Lit curriculum, it's challenging in terms of volume but rewarding for the same reason. The most important thing you'll take away will be the development and direction of the Western cannon through the whole semester.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is a good class. I liked all of the readings and thought that they were worthwhile things to know about. However, I think I would have liked it more if I had been taking it by itself, not with the rest of Directed Studies--constantly going to similarly structured DS sections and lectures in all 3 subjects can get tedious by the end of the semester, unless that is the type of class structure that you really love.Professor Shirmeister is a good professor. She is good at running class discussions and is always willing to meet with you outside of class to help you with your writing. She seems to sincerely want to help you improve your writing skills. She is also very intelligent and clearly knows a lot about what she is talking about.",
    "Any student who has the opportunity to take Directed Studies should do so. Although the reading list appears to be daunting, the work load is distributed evenly and in coordination with the other courses, which makes it quite manageable."
