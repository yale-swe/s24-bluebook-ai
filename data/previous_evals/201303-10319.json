   "comments": [
    "If you are a freshman who has never been to New York, as I was, you should definitely take this class, if for no other reason than the free trip to the city.I liked that the class was super interdisciplinary, drawing on science, public health, politics, religious studies, history, and philosophy. Some people would have preferred that it went more into the science of epidemics, but I felt the class kept a good balance, looking at sickness in a more comprehensive, complete way.The readings were fascinating, and I honestly might read the ones I had to skim\/didn't read over break. They are sometimes a lot though, so make sure you read them ahead of time so you're not attempting to read a 500 page book in a day. Do read them though or at least part of them so you can add to discussion for your participation credit!Bill is super chill and is very knowledgeable in both science and the humanities. He has very strong opinions, but don't be afraid to speak up if your opinions differ from his! I did think differently than him many times, and as a conservative, you will feel challenged in his class, but I think in a good, this is what you were expecting coming to Yale way. He generally won't discount you for thinking differently. Also, discussions of sex came into the class more than you might expect, so be prepared for that lol. It was interesting.Overall very fascinating, if occasionally morbid class. And great class bonding.",
    "Great class. Take it.",
    "I would, as long as the student knows what they are in for. If a student is happy to be in a discussion seminar with a chill teacher and really interesting course material that isn't rigorously analyzed, then this is the course for you. But if you want a critical look at plagues and all different types of responses to them then this class will likely frustrate you.",
    "HUM 076 was a nice way to balance the course load first semester freshman year, but not worth it for someone who is seriously interested in HSHM. I would recommend taking it only if one's other courses are really intense.",
    "It's exactly what it sounds like the course description, but don't expect a clean cut summarization of global epidemics. We read novels and speculated, which some people didn't enjoy, but I thought it leant a further insight into the perspectives people take on disease and death. I would recommend this class to anyone who's interested in the topic for sure.",
    "A great class, fine if you do about two thirds of the readings.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who want to major in science but miss the humanities. I would also say you shouldn't take this if you like heavily organized classes, because this class is a bit more free form.",
    "Epidemics in a Global Perspective was my favorite course this semester. The discussions were insightful and fun. We tackled topics like government responsibility, homophobia, the evolving role of the medical profession and the effectiveness of public health measures. Most of class time was spent discussing the readings \/ documentaries \/ reports etc. openly. Prof Bill Summers knows a lot about epidemics - you can practically ask him anything. There's also a free New York trip as an added incentive, during which we visited the Tenement Museum.",
    "Take it! Lots of reading, but it's interesting! Topics are engaging, and overall, the class is very low stress.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot from our readings and the other students in the class. I can honestly say that I feel quite well-versed on several epidemics and on biological warfare. It was a good freshman seminar to take, and the workload (though it consisted of a fair amount of reading) wasn't horrible."
