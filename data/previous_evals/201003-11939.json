    "THIS COURSE IS AMAZING. What MacKay has done with Close Analysis is truly remarkable. The canon of films he has selected is incredibly interesting (make sure to keep Sunrise, Rocco and the Ms for next year!), and his formatting of the course really fulfills the goal of \"you get what you give.\" It's apparent that he's the leader of the program, and with good reason - his passion for film is infectious, and his lectures are refreshing and informative.Each week, the class is \"led\" by a pair of students that discuss the film - this got out of control. These presentations should be limited in time (20-30 mins), because near the end of the semester it felt like we were listening more to students (most who prepared hours before class), and less to MacKay (who we really wanted to listen to). The forums are a great idea, along with the two papers.Don't turn off the lights in class - engage everyone! The environment allows for someone to skate by without paying attention very easily.HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - EVEN TO NON-MAJORS.",
    "This class was excellent and Professor Mackay was incredibly enthusiastic. I would recommend it to anyone interested in film studies.",
    "For any film student in either the the Theory or Production track, or even anyone who's even tangentially interested in film, this course is great introduction to close analysis and an overview of notable films from many diverse decades and movements. Although the material (I'm thinking of a few readings in particular) might sometimes border on pseudo-intellectual bullshit, the forum responses are a great way to combat this, and the films and the lectures by John MacKay make everything worthwhile.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who has a very strong interest in film. The key to enjoying this class I think would be making sure that you're really interested in studying the films in the syllabus. The class focuses less on close analysis in general and instead zeroes in on the films screened in class... if you're not intrigued by the films on the syllabus you might not get as much out of the class.",
    "Take it",
    "I would recommend this class as a great way to learn how to analyze a film on multiple layers. It is truly a very academic class grounded in film theory, so students should be prepared. It is definitely not the class for everyone, but if you are interested in either writing academically about film or even producing, this allows you to develop the eyes and the vocabulary to better articulate your vision.",
    "Close Analysis is a well-represented title for the class. It really is a CLOSE analysis of the films on the syllabus. I would only recommend this class for people really interested in film. I feel like other students would find this class a bit too intense or overly thorough. If someone is interested in film, I would definitely recommend this course to them.",
    "Close analysis is a survey of great films with attention to detail. I cannot say whether I would recommend or not recommend the class for certain; its on the edge in such a way that I wouldn't do either definitely.",
    "Close Analysis is what it claims to be. Me being the film studies major looking into Production more so than theory put me in a sort of ansgty position as this class is required for the major. But... I shouldn't have been. Professor MacKay is truly passionate about this class and really knows his stuff. I wish I would have started the class with a better attitude, but by the end it was probably one of my favorites.",
    "If you're not a film studies major you better be a cinephile or film buff of some sort. You'll understand films on a totally different level but you need to be able to sustain that interest. For film studies majors, this is a wonderful fresh look at the details of a film."
