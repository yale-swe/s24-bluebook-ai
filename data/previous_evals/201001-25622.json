    "This class is incredibly illuminating for forestry studies and all MFs without sufficient fieldwork\/practical experience should be required to take it. Foci on professionalism and practicality are invaluable. I dropped Managing Resources for this class, and it was well worth it. this is the closest thing to hands on real life learning that FES has to offer.",
    "Excellent course--the most practical course I expect to take at FES.",
    "This was the most practical course I took at FES. I think it should be developed into a full course--3cr, with an optional 4th credit for taking the southern field trip.",
    "Written reports may overwhelm students, especially at the end of the semester.There's a need for a clearer schedule. Things moved aroud quite a bit and this could've caused confusion.The TA sometimes was slow to respond to students' questions \/ inquiries about the class. A couple of times I did not receive a response.THis is a 2-credit class&sometimes it felt like a 3-credit class.",
    "7, 9 Field trips were great fun and educational, well organized. Jason was the most professional TA I have ever had. Mike and Jason were very helpful."

    "I would have appreciated more forays into some quantitative aspects of forest operations. The instructor made great effort on field trips (especially the southern U.S. field trip) to introduce us to figures on such things as prices, how much a truck can haul, what an average worker operating a harvester can cut, etc, but it would have been useful to have some section of lecture dedicated to such figures. Perhaps some exercises of some kind, creating operational budgets for some of the harvests we saw.",
    "Clarity and organization in the logistics of the course.",
