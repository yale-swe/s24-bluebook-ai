This is fine if the expectations are laid out accordingly from the beginning.",

Think about how you want to use Remote Sensing in the future and use your project to explore something that interests you--prepare to spend a lot of time on it.",

    "It's worthwhile course (you can take GIS anywhere, but not remote sensing), although the instructor next year will be different...",
