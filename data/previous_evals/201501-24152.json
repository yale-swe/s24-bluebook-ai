    "SOCY 629 is a good class--it's theoretically rigorous but also very accessible and and interesting. I highly recommend the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any undergraduate. The course provides a really great introduction and overview of the field. The readings are compelling and it is a great (and safe) space to explore the complexity of what people often find to be \"objective\" or \"natural\" concepts. However, I would not recommend the course to graduate students. Too much of the course is structured for undergraduates such as orientation towards grades, class time spent in introductions to basic concepts, and not enough graduate students to have in depth discussion."

   "comments": [
    "This class definitely sharpened my sociology thinking. It gave a strong framework to my understanding of gender, health, and medicine.",
    "This course was somewhat helpful for deepening my knowledge of my discipline\/profession. The survey\/overview style of the course (reading a lot of different readings on a variety of related topics) was very helpful for getting a sense of the scholarship in the field. However, the course as a whole did not provide me with any particular strategies, theories, ways of thinking, methodologies that I didn't already know about for my dissertation\/research."
