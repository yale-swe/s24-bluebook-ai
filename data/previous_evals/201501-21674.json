    "Only take this is it is required of you.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "It's mandatory. But don't expect too much unless the lab changes a lot over the next few years. Hopefully, it will be more organized later.",
    "I think Professor Fahmy was teaching this class Cr\/D\/Fail, and to be generous I would give him a D+. By far the worst class I've taken at Yale (if you can even call it a class). Like literally nobody knew what was going on. Its pretty hilarious till the final.",
    "This would be great if it was like a continuation of BENG 355L. However, it's much more disorganized, and the TFs don't really understand what's going on either since they were recruited really late to TF for the course. Prof Fan was really organized for 355L but 356L is super disorganized. You're probably taking this because you have to. It's not too horrible, but you'll spend a lot of time confused, as will your TFs.",
    "Pretty disorganized this year since it's Prof. Fahmy's first time with the course, but I'm sure it'll improve greatly for next year. The labs are pretty cool at least, especially if you've never done this stuff before: ultrasound, NMR, microparticles, microfluidics.",
    "Unless the course undergoes significant reform, I wouldn't recommend it to a non BME student. It's a required course with a lot of potential.",
    "Overall, a snippet of interesting fields in BME, but quite disorganized. Prof. Fahmy is pretty accommodating of student needs (for example, switching a section time to allow more students to take the course). The topics this semester (Ultrasound, NMR, Biomaterials, and Microfluidics) are each important developments, and the labs themselves were well-designed (for the most part). However, it seems that poor organization and preparation made it difficult \/ impossible for some lab groups to complete the labs as they were originally written. Also, once the kinks are worked out, I can imagine that this lab could play out much better.",
    "Relaxed but disorganized class",
    "This isn't a bad course, but Fahmy is intolerable. The labs are really cool, but be prepared for lots of confusion and miscommunication. Overall not a heavy workload and the TAs were pretty chill. I 3 Iva",
    "This is the most disorganized class I have ever taken in my entire life. You will be confused what is going on in the lab and what is expected as you as far as the lab writes up and the final. The procedure for the lab writes up changed halfway through the semester which was a mess. The class could be much better if it was more organized.",
    "It was terribly organized my year because Fahmy taught it, so if he doesn't teach it again, it should be better. All of the TFs were really helpful or chill and sometimes both, and they really saved the class.",
    "required but still good"
