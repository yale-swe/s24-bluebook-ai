    "If you want a sweeping intro to Islam, here's your course. Be forewarned, though: it can sometimes focus on the most orthodox and traditional opinions, so keep in mind that there is more complexity to the religion than what you might hear in a lecture.",
    "This is a good introduction to the history of Islam up to the modern day. It doesn't focus on politics, or the Middle East, so if that's what you want don't take this. If you want to know where Islam comes from, this is the course. Bowering and the TF's really know what they're talking about. Readings are decent...a couple books are good and theres just one that's truly awful but a fantastic sleep aid. They also assign some recommended option reading which is just adorable. The only thing is, some of the Arabic terms are hard to remember and will be tested, but if you can keep track of and memorize those the exams aren't that bad. Also, there's a final paper that's 15 pages which is a struggle but the TFs are super helpful.",
    "If you really want to learn the material, I think you could do so from a book. The professor is brilliant, experienced, and knowledgeable, but he doesn't quite get everything across in a very organized way to the students. If you're really interested in Islam itself from the beginning, it may be worth it. If you're really only interested in the more recent movements, like Jihad, Wahhabism, etc, take Griffel's Jihad and Fundamentalism instead. I was just expecting a bit more, particularly from the second half of the class. The first half, on the basics of Islam, was good, but the discussion of the later movements didn't keep up.",
    "relevant material. knowledgeable teachers. could be more focused",
    "The class will help you understand the religion of Islam, as it is intended to do. However, it will not always do so in the most efficient or organized manner. I do recommend the course, but it is not a strong recommendation. Certainly if you are on the fence as to whether you are planning to stay in the course after the shopping period, it is not going to get suddenly better at any point in the course. Shopping period is fairly representative of how the class will be structured.",
    "So Gerhard Bowering is actually an ordained Jesuit priest teaching the religion of Islam like it was his own. He's impressive...ly boring. The TAs were a bit snarky. To be fair, I only took this because it's good stuff to know as an educated person of the world (I found myself explaining the cultural significance of the Eid banquet to Muslims), but mostly because it was an easy 5th credit. As much as those GPA-buffers are needed, DON'T CAVE IN. You will suffer, and this class is deceptively hard. Think a dictionary-full of random Arabic words thrown (mumbled incoherently) your way as you struggle not to fall asleep twice a week.",
    "I would recommend it. It's mostly history and solid information about Islam, though looking back, I think an Islamic theology class would have interested me more. But hisotry of Islam is important and I don't regret learning it.",
    "Take this class if and only if you are interested in the material. The lecture and section are both pretty dull, but I am glad to have taken the class because I felt like it gave me a good grounding in the basics of Islam. That made it worth it for me.",
    "A great class and very relevant. You can't leave Yale without knowing the info presented here. Know that although the lecture material is easy to follow, you need to go to class. The Professor doesn't use PowerPoints. But, don't let this discourage you. The only extra work outside class you'll need to complete is a 12 page paper, a midterm, and final. For the midterm and final, you will be given about 15-20 terms and will need to write two essays on general concepts. For each essay, you will be given a choice of two, so if you aren't really clear on one concept, you can take the other option. Seriously, take this class, but if you take it, go and take notes on your computer.",
    "The class is very interesting, but you really have to have an interest in Islam going in. Bowering is smart, but his lectures aren't always cohesive, and he doesn't always make clear what the key terms are. Also, be prepared to learn a lot of terms with Arabic roots- a basic knowledge of the language would have made this class a lot easier.",
    "This was a good survey class - a lot of broad topics related to Islam were covered in class, including history, philosophy, sectarianism and modernism. I liked Prof Bowering's lectures - granted they were a bit dry in the middle, but he is very knowledgeable and the lectures cover a lot of interesting material, more than what was covered on the exams. The two exams were comprehensive and long (for example: 20 ID questions and three essay questions for the final), but the TAs had very helpful exam preps - so don't worry if you find yourself with huge notes and lots of information to study from (the readings are looooong but not that important for the exams): the TAs will help focus the exam study for you a few days before the exam. The TA sessions became very interesting as the semester progressed, especially the ones about Islam in modern times: we had interesting discussions about world events and recent history, and it was quite enlightening. I also loved the freedom I had with my paper (there is only one required for the class, and you can choose ANY topic related to Islam) - in all, a class well taught and not hard at all."
