   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It's really interesting regardless of your race and background and it forces you to look at the world in grays instead of the black and white (that even courses at Yale) seem to look at the world. I would definitely take it.",
    "I love Prof Pabst.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. The discussions are eye opening and insightful no matter what your racial background. I was fortunate enough to have a number of interracial students in the class which made the experience particularly rewarding because the content of the books was analyzed through the personal narratives of my peers. This course is not at all demanding with only two 3-4 page reading responses and a 10 page paper (in addition to reading a book a week-- the books are fascinating so this isn't really work at all) and you will get a lot out of it. The themes are thought provoking and Professor Pabst invites you to think deeply about constructions and conceptions of race across history, gender, age, and culture. Definitely sign up this semester!",
    "I generally recommend this class. It's pretty chill, although there are a lot of readings (which obviously you can elect not to do, but then you don't get as much out of the class). The interracial focus is on black\/white hybridity, so don't expect to discuss other topics of interraciality, although you have freedom to do so in your final paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend it--it's too bad it's not being offered again.",
    "Absolutely. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Great class. I was worried about taking it because I don't like studying things that \"are myself\" all too often, but the class is the perfect blend of the personal and the objective. Professor Pabst selects great, relevant works from all periods of history and the discussion is intelligent but really casual - you don't have to worry about putting in the correct sociological or race theory buzz words or whatever else, but you'll learn a lot about all of that.Novel a week at least though, so be prepared to keep up.",
    "It has a great reading selection, especially if you are interested\/invested in interracial themes. Class discussions were good but I wish Prof Pabst had given more objective academic analysis in class. It's a lot of reading too, so make sure you can read a novel a week."
