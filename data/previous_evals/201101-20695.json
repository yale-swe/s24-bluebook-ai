    "I probably wouldn't recommend the course for a graduate student. I needed a bit more practical training on how to model a system, and I don't think I really gained it.The workload was variable.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to people who are extremely interested in getting to know modeling.",
    "With a reasonable class load, this class is excellent for providing biologists with a completely different view of biology.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in how different domain of science interact to study one question (applied math, CS, biology, physics). However, I suggest that the student already know the (mathematical) methods that are used in the course, since they are introduced only very briefly.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to any student in a biology-related field (see my response to Question 1)."

    "This course gives a very good overview of current science in systems biology.",
    "I do not yet have a dissertation\/research yet I feel that the skills and knowledge I gained in this course will prove to be very relevant and useful to me (and other PEB students) in the future."
