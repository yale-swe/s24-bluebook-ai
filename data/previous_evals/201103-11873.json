   "comments": [
    "Very dry course if you don't like conceptual and theoretical lab exercises. The final is short and apparently worth a good portion of your grade, so be wary of that. The TAs are very helpful, however, and made the experience more enjoyable.",
    "Take it with Jack Sandweiss. He's very informative, answers questions, and is very patient. Lab was relaxing with him.",
    "Don't bother taking it if you don't have to. If you do have to take it though, at least it's not that bad. It's so much better than general chemistry lab. It is legitimately a half-credit (as opposed to a full credit's worth of work disguised as half a credit). There are no lab reports to write outside of class, and a couple of the experiments are fun. You also will learn some about error propagation, which is useful in the sciences.",
    "This is a pretty chill lab experience. It may not be thrilling week to week, but it goes fairly fast and you won't have to do long lab write-ups. A lot of your experience depends on the TA so it is tough to predict how it will be.",
    "Not too bad. Little HW, straightforward class. If you have your choice of TA, go with Jason - he's helpful and a generous grader (apparently the other TA's enjoy stressing out their undergrads). The class is only supposed to be 3 hours, but it tends to run for 3.5 because some of the labs are too long.",
    "A good lab that will teach you the basics. Also, there are no lab reports, so that's a plus.",
    "It's a good lab course that teaches you the fundamentals of using certain tools and reinforces knowledge of several physics concepts.",
    "Lab for physics. covers basics of physics.",
    "I would not recommend this to another student, the labs are not very engaging and some of them seem to have been made needlessly long. This course alone was enough to put me off being a physics major.",
    "Physics 205 is not so much a tough course as it is a taxing course. The subject matter is surprisingly advanced given what they assume, and I feel that had I not taken Physics C it would have been very tough to understand all the E&M stuff we did. The biggest problem was the length of the labs and the fact that you have to write essentially lab reports while doing the lab. They are way too long and all that writing constantly for 4 hours in a row really drains you.As a result I don't think anyone looked forward to lab, which is really too bad as I have to admit that one does learn a lot, especially about E&M. The lab final is also surprisingly difficult and stressful. Overall I couldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't have to take it for his or her major.",
    "This lab doesn't have much work outside of lab. Some of the labs are unpleasant, and some were enjoyable. AVOID PROFESSOR SANDWEISS.",
    "Go ahead and take this if you need a lab as a premed. Otherwise, there is little appeal if you are not a physics major.",
    "I would not recommend it for someone who did not have to take it. I didn't leave the class with much more understanding of the concepts than when I started.",
    "Yes; intro lab probably necessary for some requirement, but I'm actually just glad to have learned what I have from this course. I hated error analysis to begin with, but it is truly useful and necessary, and seems so much better than learning it in a pure stats course, for example, because it is applied directly. Also, labswritten ENTIRELY IN LAB, meaning no time outside of lab!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this lab if you don't have to take it. The lab always runs over, and the sheer quantity of information in the lab meant that none of the students seemed to fully understand what was going on. On the positive side, aside from some homework assignements related to error analysis in the beginning of the semester and a short weekly quiz based on the lab handouts, there is no outside work (all lab write-ups are done in class).",
    "You gotta do what you gotta do.",
    "I would definitely take this lab. All of the outside work consists of a few easy math problems and reading over the lab before arriving (you don't HAVE to do that, but it makes the lab easier). You turn in your lab notebooks at the end of the lab session, which eliminates the lab report component of most labs.",
    "This is for requirement.",
    "This course is very intensive and the labs are very long and consist of multiple parts that cover a variety of topics in physics such a magnetism and circuits. This semester a TA was largely responsible for the instruction of this course, but since the course is individual or partner based, this set-up worked. I would recommend this class only if you are thinking about going into a field of physics.",
    "There is no reason to take Physics 205L unless you have to. It almost always ran over the allotted time, sometimes by up to an hour. It is also very boring. There's not much outside work, though, which is good.",
    "I would say it's not bad as a lab. Though tedious, it was not very stressful. My only recommendation would be for the student to make sure they need it for a requirement before signing up. Otherwise it wouldn't be fun to take it for half a semester then discover that you didn't need it for a major you've changed your mind to.",
    "Don't expect to get out on time. Lab routinely ran between an hour to an hour and a half late every week. The lab instructions are pretty straightforward, they just take a while, but they're due in class so there's no lab writeup as homework. It's not a hard lab, just time consuming and not particularly exciting.",
    "205 lab is a good one to take. Actually a half-credit's worth of work, and minimal out-of-lab work. The only problem is the grading scheme - pretty much your entire grade is determined by the lab practical during the last week. But its not too difficult, so you should enjoy the lab.",
    "PHYS 205L is still in an experimental phase, so I won't judge it too harshly. It gets really frustrating sometimes. Lab is supposed to last only 3 hours every week, but I hardly ever get out before 4 hours, even if I rush like crazy to finish up. As a result, everyone skips the optional sections of the experiments and speeds through without really understanding much. The final exam was a little confusing and involved precisely the stuff we didn't cover properly in lab. The grading is also very unclear. Everyone in my section pretty much got checks all the time. I can't imagine how they are going to curve us fairly in the end.",
    "The labs are interesting, but usually take over the alotted 3 hours. The course involves pre-lab quizzes and a few data analysis problem sets.",
    "take it if you have to. (only if you have to)",
    "If you're taking PHYS 205, you're likely taking it as a requirement. I can't say I'd recommend it, but it's potentially the least commitment to a lab you could make - no lab reports at only three hours a week - you're grade is based off how well you keep a lab notebook.",
    "It's a good lab with no lab reports so its not too painful except for the long hours. q",
    "It is a good lab since there is almost no outside work, but it is unnecessary if you do not need it for a requirement. Each lab is very long and the grading is harsh, but gets evened out at the end.",
    "If you're required to take physics lab, then take it. If you're really into physics and have an afternoon to spare every week, try it out. If you're looking for a lab course to try a lab course, even though this one has no lab reports, you might want another course.",
    "For a lab, PHYS205 is the least amount of work for a lab credit at Yale (compared to Chem and Bio labs). It's still 3 hours of constant working in a lab, but the workload is manageable. Just 4 basic statistics-related problem sets and weekly quizzes. It is definitely better if youhave a solid E&M background going into this lab. Or else, expect to read supplementary textbook pages to understand the physics behind the E&M labs. Surprisingly, PHYS205 does not complement the material taught in any of the first semester Physics courses. Also note that you'll be lucky to leave on time (most of the time, you'll leave after the 3 hours are up).",
    "It's a low stress lab- take it. And try to make your friends be in your section. Makes it a pretty fun lab!",
    "Even though some experiments are more interesting than others, overall, Physics 205L is a good lab class.Note that there are a lot of labs dealing with electricity (which are seen in second semester of intro physics) - if you have not studied this topic before, do not worry - the handouts did a pretty good job at explaining key concepts that you might not be familiar with(I took it at the same time as first semester physics)"
