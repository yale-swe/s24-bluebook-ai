   "comments": [
    "strengths: great topics were discussed. the papers chosen were excellent.weakness: lecture can be dull and boring.",
    "This was most definitely the worst class I have taken at Yale or anywhere else. The readings and class discussions are all entirely one-sided. I was really hoping to be able to learn both sides of the argument, and have some discussions about how religion interacts with health care in both positive and negative ways. However, the entire semester was devoted to efforts to convince students of a real connection between religion and improvement of health. The class, if held in the future, should devote equal time to discussions of ways in which religion improves health and harms health.",
    "I don't think that this topic should merit a whole class. There just isn't that much convincing epidemiological data on religion and health -- the findings could be summed up in two class meetings. Additionally, the class was not run as a seminar. It was taught as a two-hour lecture. Professor Van Ness was not able to facilitate discussions -- any attempt at soliciting input from students led to monologues from Van Ness. I regretted not being able to engage with my peers in this class -- their perspective on the material could have been really valuable!",
    "I really liked that this was a small course with only 12-13 students in it, but I don't think we adequately utilized the seminar style of the class for meaningful discussion. There was way too much lecture and way too much teaching about basic epidemiologic principles and not nearly enough debate about the role of religion in health and how this area of study should be approached and applied.",
    "A good seminar class. It increased my knowledge of the field of religious studies, which I found interesting and helpful.",
    "While this course was VERY different than I expected it to be, I really enjoyed getting to take a seminar class. I was somewhat bothered by two factors. First, the seeming insistence that only quantitative research is important and viable (especially as a student interested in qualitative research and health education), and second, what seemed like Dr. Van Ness' entrenched belief that religion should have a protective health impact. Not only did this make me uncomfortable as a non-religious person, but I also felt that these convictions were poorly supported by data, which undermined the earlier point.",
    "I enjoyed this course--the subject was interesting and rarely addressed in other public health discussions. But I would suggest more opportunities for discussion of the content of the articles. I was more interested in the implications of the studies than in their methodology. Since most of the students are from the public health school, we have all taken epidemiology and biostatistics already. The course often acted as an introductory epi course, which was redundant for most of the students and didn't allow for a deeper exploration of the rich subject matter.",
    "Great use of primary material to emphasis the basics of epidemiology. A little more teaching of the nuts and bolts of epidemiology would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: course structure (discussion based, organization of topics in syllabus, assignments), critical perspectiveWeakness: same weaknesses mentioned in evals from past years-- the discussion could be better facilitated*, too focused on epi theory\/research methods (should be more balanced with content\/subject)*while it is great that each class begins with a mini-lecture from the professor on some topic or history of epi, the discussion of the articles themselves could be more open to students and less of the professor's lecturing",
    "I thought the course was interesting, but didn't reach its full potential. The topic is important in our modern society, and could be of great use for interventionist if properly utilized."

    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0strengths: instructor has great knowledge on the subject matterweakness: does not give students the chance to truly participate in class. instructor dominated the majority of class discussion.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Dr. VanNess was not sensitive to students' needs, excessively promoted his own research, and devoted the entirety of class time to discussions of religiosity and health based on his own beliefs. He devoted no time at all to discussions of society and health or religion and society, despite the inclusion of \"society\" in the title of the class. All class discussions were biased by Dr. Van Ness's own beliefs about religion and health, and he did not create a class environment in which it felt safe to express alternate viewpoints.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Van Ness is not skilled at leading discussions. He conducts seminar as if it were a lecture. He failed to support conversation among the students, and was condescending in his responses to our comments. This class could have been wonderful had there been more opportunity for discussion.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Dr. Van Ness is a nice person, but I didn't really like the structure of the class. I think he needed to let the students talk and discuss more and he needed to lecture a lot less. I also felt like he didn't respond very well to questions from the students and I often felt that when I asked a question, he would just repeat what he said instead of directly answering my question. The other students in the class have really interesting opinions and perspectives on this topic and I don't think Dr. Van Ness gave ample opportunities for us to discuss those opinions.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Dr. Van Ness's knowledge of epidemiologic concepts was very helpful to me. I enjoyed his teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Dr. Van Ness is nice, but kind of awkward. I'm not sure he likes working with students who don't share his interests in statistics or epi.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Van Ness was a great lecturer and was clearly committed to the subject. However, I would have preferred less epidemiology (which I knew already) and greater focus on the implications of the research.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Great instructor, very helpful and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0It is a good course. The topic is important, and the professor is very knowledgeable. The course would benefit from a more interactive seminar style. Students need to engage for this to be possible, of course, but I believe the professor could focus his remarks more intentionally on eliciting discussion. He could ask questions that would encourage use and demonstration of the critical skills we were to develop in class. These questions could be as simple as \"What was surprising about this article,\" \"Would you be proud to have produced this research, why or why not,\" and \"What would a follow-up study to this one look like?\" The professor can think of better questions than I, of course.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0the instructor led mini-lectures well, but took over discussion of the article in such a way that there was little room\/direction for students to speak",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Dr Van Ness has great intentions and if a wealth of knowledge. I enjoyed how he lead the class in a seminar style, but felt more open discussion could have been fostered. Maybe by allowing students to talk more and not jumping in right away to offer his opinion, the discussion would have been more interesting."

    "this class was pretty good, and has the potential to be great. if students were given the chance to participate more, it'd be more interesting.",
    "I would definitely NOT recommend this class to any student, unless the student is very religious and wants to take a class in which their views will not be challenged at all. The discussions are so one-sided, it almost feels like proselytism. It's definitely the worst class I've ever taken, at Yale or anywhere else.",
    "This class is really about the methodology of religion and health epidemiology. It's intensively focused on epidemiology. Processor Van Ness conducts seminar like a lecture -- there is little opportunity for discussion or conversation. I would not recommend this class.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this to other students. I wasn't very convinced during the course of the reason to study relgion and health and without much discussion in class, I sometimes felt like it was not a good use of time.",
    "Great epidemiology course.",
    "This course examines the public health implications of religion in its diversity of forms and in a variety of contexts.",
    "a discussion-based course; BROAD overview of religion's intersection with health.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in the topic because the readings are very interesting and the subject is not discussed or utilized enough in current studies. I think that due to the high percentage of people who claim allegiance to a religion, our health services could foster these relationships further and promote more inclusive and abundant prevention programs. This class definitely makes you think about religion differently, even if you aren't religious, and it is what you make of it."
