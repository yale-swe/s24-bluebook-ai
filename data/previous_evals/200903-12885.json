   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course. It seems better than the conversation class (which required a lot of reading from my floormate). I learned so much grammar, and found out the answers to so many things I had questioned or thought about in my Spanish career but had never looked up answers to. Terry Seymour is also a great professor, who is a master of grammar.",
    "Good course. LOTS of work outside class. Be prepared to keep up with the work if you want to succeed in class.",
    "A great overview of Spanish grammar. I liked it much better than Advanced Conversational Spanish, and Sra. Seymour is great. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their grammar and fluency in Spanish.",
    "if you feel you already have a firm grasp of grammar (subjunctive, ser\/estar, imperfect\/preterite, etc.), then i would not recommend this course. focus on reading\/writing\/speaking instead. however, grammar is a fundamental necessity so if you don't feel comfortable in those areas then this is a good course",
    "This class is somewhat dull and has a fair amount of busy work, but it provides a good overview of Spanish grammar and fills in gaps from high school. The emphasis in this class is on grammar, not speaking, and unlike other Spanish classes there are no oral exams, so if you are more comfortable with writing than speaking I would recommend this course."
