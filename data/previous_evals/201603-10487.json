    "I learned a lot about synthesis from a different perspective. I thought as someone who is interested in organic chemistry, it would be easier for me to work my way through the class but I was mistaken. I definitely have never worked so hard for a course. It was very different from the intro organometallics class taught by Professor Crabtree. A lot of material was covered and sometimes due to that I didn't have the chance to synthesize and connect all of the information.",
    "Significant mechanistic understanding of Organometallic chemistry. Modern applications of organometallic chemistry. Practice at mechanistic determination and prediction. Experimental techniques for investigating organometallic chemistry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "VERY fast paced. But I do understand that this is a grad level course and hence, had to be that way.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, effective problem sets & examinations Weaknesses: Sometimes it was unclear whether something being discussed in class was a hypothesis or a proven & observed effect.",
    "I appreciated that this class included a lot of information taken from contemporary chemical research as opposed to working strictly with a text. It was helpful for me to learn how to learn from published papers.",
    "Strengths: As a thorough yet broad introduction to organometallic chemistry, this class provides a very strong introduction. Lectures often provided practical insights into various topics and did an amazing job of connecting the material from class to research done in the lab. Problem sets were very challenging, but very much based on material learned in class and not impossibly difficult. Problems were often very interesting as they were based on data from the primary literature. Weaknesses: It would be very helpful if the class notes were posted online. Limited board space (and a fast writing pace) meant that boards were often covered\/erased before I could finish writing, and I didn't want to hold up the class."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe. I have never worked so hard for a course at Yale. A lot of material was covered at a very fast pace. You are expected to keep up with the work regularly. The psets are hard and take up a considerable amount of time. You are expected to have basic knowledge about many things and that often put me at a disadvantage. However, Professor Hazari is always available to help. If you decide to take this course, do make sure you reach out to him to understand concepts.",
    "You'll learn to interpret mechanistic studies and come up with mechanisms for reactions which is petty cool. A pset is due every two weeks and it's fairly short though thought provoking (and not that easy). There is a term paper that requires you to do a lot of research and forced you to read scientific literature which is good practice. And Nilay tells great stories. Don't miss it.",
    "Absolutely! It's very cool about a rather underappreciated topic in modern Chemsitry.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Nilay is an excellent professor who presents the information in a clear manner. After building up base skills in organometallics, he brings in neat information from contemporary research that presents future opportunities in this field.",
    "Strongly recommend! Problem sets will train you to think like an organometallic scientist in terms of experimental design\/logic, and you'll get a very good introduction to organometallics."
