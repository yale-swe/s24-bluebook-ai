    "I recommend it. I think all architecture majors need to take this course to learn the fundamentals about materials. However, non-architecture majors learn much from how to plan, study, and implement models.",
    "Yes if you are in the major looking to experiment w new fabrication methods. No if otherwise.",
    "If you don't take this class you are for the worse of it. Not only is it boatloads of fun (the labs rock) but the workload is pretty light so other than the final project, which may take some time, there is nothing else. Tim is a great instructor and passionate about the class.",
    "Take it! Every class puts you in a great mood.",
    "Yes, absolutely, even for non-majors. Pretty chill and interesting materials. Only one big project that you are supposed to work on through out the semester. By that, really, don't start on the last week before it's due.",
    "Absolutely this course is the best",
    "If you're at all interested, you should absolutely take this class. It's like the fun stress free time of your week. The labs are super enjoyable and seem like you're learning practical skills (framing a house, learning how to notch windows, pouring foundations, welding). Start your precedent project early - it's fun, yes, but it's hard to do in a short period of time. Pick a good project that you'll learn things from.",
    "Great class to take as you start architecture",
    "TAKE IT."
