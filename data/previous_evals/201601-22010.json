   "comments": [
    "The History of World History fundamentally is a course about thinking critically. It's very accessible and really isn't about cramming facts. Professor Hansen is amazing.",
    "DO IT!",
    "If you're looking to take a Freshman Seminar and are not allergic to history, this is a great one. The texts come from all over the world so there's something for everyone and the amount of reading and writing is very manageable.",
    "It's amazing, but know what you're getting into. This is a class that provokes you to think about why history unfolded the way it did, and also why historians considered history the way they did throughout history. Yes, it's a little bit meta, but it's also really cool. If you care about primary texts and are excited to read about the founding scholars of history in major world regions, you'll love this class. The workload is incredibly reasonable - a decent amount of reading, for which Professor Hansen actually teaches us techniques to selectively read, and four papers. The papers are all very different and give you the opportunity to try out a lot of creative ways of writing. Professor Hansen believes in the freshman seminar, and she wants this class to be a history course while still having entertaining other elements like those in the papers. We do a debate, a book review, and rewrite the history of one scholar from another's perspective. All along, Professor Hansen provides very specific and helpful feedback on each paper to give you tangible ways of improving. I really learned a lot about myself in this class - it was what inspired me to become a history major because I discovered how much I love primary texts and old works. But I know that lots of kids in the class didn't have the same experience, which could be because they didn't do the reading or didn't find it as interesting as I did. TL;DR: If you like reading great historians, you'll love this class. Don't take this class otherwise, because that's literally what this class is about.",
    "you'll know from the first day whether you love Professor Hansen or don't. If you don't, stay away from the class. If you do, absolutely take it. It was my favorite class of freshman year and I am so glad I got into it :-)",
    "HIST 072 is a great class that will give you a thorough sense of the different ways historians have approached history through the ages. The workload is very reasonable. My favorite part of the course was reading Sima Qian and al-Tabari's histories because it's a way of writing that is just so different from what you are used to reading in the West. Professor Hansen teaches you how to read smartly and critically, to write with punch, and also to present with confidence; these are invaluable skills to learn as a freshman! I would heavily recommend this course!",
    "I think that as an expansive history course, that spans most of the world, and several centuries, HIST072 does a good job of tackling this large subject. I really liked the readings from the class; especially Herodotus and Marx. Section was a bit dull at times, but you can make it as engaging as you want it ti be. Professor Hansen was great; a bit abrasive, but a solid professor overall. Her paper feedback is invaluable, and if nothing else, your writing will improve immensely. I would recommend this class to any freshman, regardless of potential major.",
    "To gain a grasp of the great world historians, take this class. The debate part of the class was a blast too.",
    "Take this course if you want to improve your writing while reading the works of some of the world's first historians. Professor Hansen is great! She works hard to help you improve your writing and gives great advice (that is especially helpful to freshmen) about how to efficiently tackle a college level workload. The class consists of papers and no exams.",
    "You should really like history if you're taking this class-I know that should go without saying, but it's true. It's not too much writing for a writing credit, and you get a lot of feedback. A lot of reading though, and I found much of it uninterestig. I think the class just wasn't what I thought it would be."
