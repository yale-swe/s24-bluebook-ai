    "English 460 is a poetry seminar with one poem and one prose response to a collection of poetry per week. I really enjoyed the course and would highly recommend it. I thought taking it the year after I took Professor Gluck's introductory class worked well. She is an amazing teacher, and I think both my writing and my talking about writing have improved.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course for those who care about poetry and enjoy writing it, but also take it seriously enough to want to improve. If you get in, definitely take it.",
    "The class is a writing workshop--that is, class time is devoted to reading and commenting on your fellow students' work. I would recommend it if you want to write and think about writing a lot. It's very preoccupying.",
    "Louise Gl\u00c3\u00bcck's poetry courses provide a workshop setting in which a small group of students focuses on three poems each week. Everyone writes a poem a week and three are selected for group review. Louise Gl\u00c3\u00bcck is an honest instructor, with high standards. She has an incredible instinct for poetry, and a compassionate understanding of students' poetic ideas and attempts, so she provides excellent feedback. The classdoes depend, to a certain extent, on the other students in the class, because of the workshop setting. I highly recommend this course, if you are admitted to it. You will grow as a poet, and as a reader of poetry, throughout the semester.",
    "Louise is Louise is Louise. If you're considering taking this class, you probably took her intro verse writing class. Take this class if you liked that class. This class is the same set-up except in addition to writing a poem every week you also write a short review of a book of poetry that you read that week.Edit by Louise: For the most part, the language of this course review is approximate, however where it achieves something luminous is where it drops the pretense of being a review and begins to revel in the sensuousness of its own language: \"take this class if you liked that class.\" is brilliant. Also, excise the \"Edit by Louise\" section. Glib is the only word I can use here. Also, self-satisfied.",
    "A spectacular course. Professor Gl\u00c3\u00bcck is an ingenious poet and an ingenious teacher. The amount of attention she gives to each student is truly staggering. Though some of her advice may grate a little at first, it all turns out to be right\u00e2\u0080\u0094absolutely right\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the end. She has enormous respect for her students and her students have enormous respect for her in turn. If you are admitted to this course, take it.",
    "Studying with Louise Gl\u00c3\u00bcck is one of the best things that can befall you at Yale. If you have the opportunity, take it."
