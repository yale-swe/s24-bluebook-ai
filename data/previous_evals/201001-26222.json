   "comments": [
    "This is by far the best course I have taken at Yale. It was incredibly challenging and time-consuming but very rewarding.My only comment would be that I wish I had taken it earlier in the program. For example I took Community Health Planning and Evaluation before this class, but a more logical order might have been: Trace's class (the planning), Community Health (the execution) and then Evaluation (the follow-up).",
    "This course is totally amazing and perhaps the most useful course I took at YSPH in terms of actual job skills and preparing me for the work that I plan to do after graduation. It was also the hardest course I took at YSPH by a lot. It should be worth 2 credits, because its almost as much work as a thesis! It was a great experience, however, and I don't think anyone at YSPH should miss it.",
    "Excellent!I like when we use the class' projects as examples during the lectures. It helps to bring the message home.Maybe allow students to do more policy-level implementations. I think the option was theoretically open to use, but the way the course is structured made those types of interventions seem less feasible (in terms of passing the course).",
    "Great course, the best that I've taken at YSPH.",
    "Out of all the courses I've taken at EPH, this course has made me work the hardest. That said, it's a great, hands-on, practical class that really makes one think about the nitty gritty of working on a public-health project in a real-world setting.",
    "I think this was an incredible course. Very interesting and useful. Great introduction to intervention design.",
    "The course was an excellent crash course in intervention design.Strengths: The interventions were methodologically rigorous and detailed enough to be implemented right away. Nothing was left in realm of the hypothetical. Everything that the intervention required (up to and including recruitment fliers) were generated.Weaknesses: The time commitment was tremendous. While certainly an important fact to consider, I would not consider this a true weakness of the class.",
    "it was helpful.",
    "Strengths-- provides useful skills.Weakness--very time-consuming.",
    "This course is ideal for those interested in intervention design and implementation. Although a lot of work outside the classroom, the course is very practical and discussion-oriented. Some may consider the substantial amount of work a negative - I don't; it's part of what makes the course so valuable.",
    "Siiiigh.This class was the 100,000,000,000 pound monkey on my back.I really loved the lectures -- going to class itself was great. The project on the other hand...ugh, I could feel my blood pressure rise every time I thought about it. It was just too much, and by the end of the semester, I really felt resentful of my topic because I was so frustrated and tired of it.",
    "Great course.The classes were extremely interactive and all the information learned was very practical and we got to apply it during the project.",
    "The course was excellent overall. I learned a great deal and enjoyed working within a group setting. Lots of hard work paid off in the end.",
    "Decent course. Should be optional because it's a lot of focus on only one thing.",
    "Overall, this was one of the most useful courses I took during my time at yale. Learning to implement and design an evaluation is critical for any public health professional. Additionally, the instructor was extremely comprehensive and engaging, so I felt like I really got and retained all of the important info.I now feel very comfortable with designing health promotion programs and interventions."

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Oh Trace. You tried to kill us but you only made us stronger.Great support, great feedback, high expectations!",

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was great. He was available and willing to work with students.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace expects a lot, but is great!",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was a fabulous instructor- not only did he provide support and great feedback as we designed our interventions- he also set up the course so we students could help each other.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace kershaw is engaging, dynamic, and above all funny. He's wonderfully approachable and receptive and truly seems to be interested in his students' welfare. Does a great job of integrating his work into lectures. One of the best professors I've ever had at EPH.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Professor Kershaw is an energetic teacher who is clearly passionate about his work and about working with students. His feedback is thorough and usually right on. I don't have any specific recommendations for improvement because I think he did an amazing job with the course.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was awesome in pretty much every way.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was very engaged and accessible.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Very knowledgeable. Very helpful. Makes time for students.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is a great professor: knowledgeable, humorous, receptive to all sorts of questions. He's a great individual as well, which adds to his excellence as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is FABULOUS!!!!I have to admit that I was a bit apprehensive about having Trace as a professor; I'd heard him give some talks before and I found him a little bit more scattered than I prefer (I like very, very straightforward \"here are the facts\" lectures), so I was concerned that class would be a little bit hard to follow. After two classes, I think (maybe three), every fear I had was totally gone. Class always stayed on the points we needed to talk about based on the slides, and he was great at engaging us. I don't know if it's like this every year, but I think our group of classmates really enjoyed the class. Some friends in the Health Policy capstone, which met in the room next to ours during Tuesday's class, commented multiple times about how they could hear us laughing and we sounded like we were having so much fun (I don't think they felt the same way, but I can't speak for them).Trace was incredibly helpful to meet with comments and meeting to discuss any concerns or pieces of the project we didn't understand. He was also very tactful and I never worried that something I said would leave the room -- there are definitely professors that I wouldn't that comfortable with or trust that much.His grading, however, was totally all over the place. I really couldn't ever get an idea about what his comments on past sections were supposed to do with any of the other sections. And all the comments were -- not unexpected, I guess -- but I didn't learn anything from them that I could use to strengthen other work for the class.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Best instructor ever, really. Very approachable, funny and REALLY knows what he is doing. You really get a sense of his love for public health and teaching. He creates an amazing learning environment. He is one of the best professors I have ever had. I still can't believe that he is able to read all of our projects so quickly and give such detailed comments. I learned sooo much in the class.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is a great prof. Fun, very knowledgeable and opening to questions",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0The instructor was great. Very responsive to student needs.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Good.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Professor Kershaw did an excellent, excellent job. He was always available to answer any questions or meet outside of class. His comments were clear, fair, and extremely helpful. While his standards are high, his directions and expectations are very clear and straightforward, so his students know what they need to put into a project.Professor Kershaw's teaching style in the classroom is also excellent. I was very tired and overworked this semester, and admittedly, came to class at times just wanting to sit through it. However, Professor Kershaw was so engaging that I found myself raising my hand and contributing, even on days when I didn't think I would. He's a great prof! Wish I had him sooner.Additionally, Professor Kershaw has been extremely supportive of my career goals and connected me with other faculty and public health grads who would be helpful in my career pursuits.I would highly recommend all public health students to take a course with Professor Kershaw."

    "Challenging but rewarding.",
    "How to actually implement an intervention. Alternatively, how to prepare yourself for the stress involved in actually implementing an intervention.I would recommend it any student who wants to do community level interventions. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest taking it.",
    "If you are interested in learning how to implement and evaluate a program- this is the go-to course. I have to be honest with you- it is too much work. If you add this class- make sure the rest of your semester is light. Otherwise, you will go crazy.",
    "One of the best and most practical courses I've taken at EPH. Yes, there's a TON of work involved, but it's all got a purpose and in the end, is fulfilling. Fully recommend to anyone interested in developing health interventions in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in intervention design. It is a ton of work but worth what you get out of it.",
    "This is a course that will teach you how to build an intervention program from scratch. It is very practical and very hands-on. If you survive the insane work load, you will walk away with an awesome finished product and a clear understanding of the intervention design process.",
    "This is a requirement for a lot of people but certainly not one that you should dread. This course is much more skills based than many of the others that we take at EPH and I would recommend it for anyone who will be designing, implementing or evaluating programs in any form. certainly helpful to have thought through these problems ahead of time.",
    "Yes. If ur workload isn't too hectic already.",
    "If you would like to pursue a career in intervention design and\/or implementation (or anything related to health interventions), this course is a must.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's because you have to. You'd be out of your mind to take this on otherwise! Yes, there really is as much work as you've heard. Don't plan to take another class or two that have really heavy loads -- you won't be able to do it. Don't leave work for the last minute thinking that it'll be fine, since you do it in other classes. It won't work for this one. Don't choose a project with a topic you don't know anything about. You won't be able to catch up. More importantly, though, if you choose to work with someone, you'd better be 10000000000% sure that it will be a functional working relationship. If you have any doubts about working with someone, don't do it. If forced to choose between a totally novel topic or a partner you're uncomfortable with, go with the new topic. No question.",
    "Best class at YSPH. You don't even realize you are working as hard as you are. Reminded me of why I chose to get my MPH. Everybody at YSPH should be required to take it, so take it!",
    "This class is about designing an intervention from beginning to end. This entails creating a manual about how the intervention is goingto work as well as a manual to train the interventionists involved in the project, doing extensive literature searches, and developing a theoretical framework for the intervention.",
    "Fantastic if you're interested in health interventions.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but I would also say to be prepared to do a lot of work. I would tell students to be sure to work with other students (as many as possible!) on the final project and to pick a topic that they are extremely passionate about, since they will be devoting a lot of time to it.I would also tell students that they will learn EVERYTHING about interventions-from background to activities to evaluation. While it would be helpful to have background on interventions and evaluation in general, it is not necessary.I would also tell students to attempt to power through frustrating moments, since at the end of the semester they will have a product that they will be very proud of."
