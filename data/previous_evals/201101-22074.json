   "comments": [
    "It's a \"must take\" for anyone interested in cosmology and universe as a whole. I recommend this course to anyone wanting a science credit or just curious about the universe we live in. Good choice for a fifth class.",
    "Yes",
    "Take it no matter what you are majoring in- the course material is really just amazing. Note that you might need quite some QR basis to handle the Psets though.",
    "Astro 170 is very interesting and you learn a lot from a really great professor who is engaging and genuinely excited by his subject. The p-sets are hard, very hard. But there's only 5 for the whole semester and if you have the recommended maths and physics background (I didn't) then they should at least be manageable.I would recommend this course if you want an interesting and informative QR and already have a good maths and physics background.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!I think one quote from Professor van den Bosch himself sums it up best: \"Beautiful things are often crazy: just look at me!\"Frank van den Bosch is a cursing, arms-flailing, crazy Dutchman of a professor. The class covers everything you should always have wanted to know: black holes, the expansion of the universe, history of galaxies, dark matter, the works. And the professor is a really energetic, passionate, hilarious, engaging lecturer. I had this class at 4 p.m. and was still wide awake for every minute. He's also very approachable: I kept him from dinner for an hour after class on multiple occasions to talk about ridiculous cosmological concepts, quantum theory, whatever. This was his first year at Yale, and we're lucky to have him.The class doesn't have too much work, though the problem sets and exams can definitely be challenging. It does get math-y at some points, though I have to say that I enjoyed this aspect since it allowed me to understand the concepts behind the cosmology. (NOTE: \"cosmology\" sounds a lot like \"astrology,\" but really it just means, \"big-picture astronomy.\")",
    "Definitely take this course if you have had some sort of Physics in high school but don't intend on majoring in anything sciencey. Having taken AP Physics, this class seemed quite easy and was enjoyable. The professor was great, the material was interesting, and the workload was very doable.",
    "Great class for anyone interested in astronomy, but some background in math and physics required, but not much, pretty basic.",
    "Yes, the professor is extremely engaging. However, beware of tough problem sets and exams.",
    "One of the more difficult QR\/SC credits geared at non-science majors -- but definitely manageable. Professor van den Bosch is an entertaining and engaging lecturer.",
    "I would summarize it as a fun science class with a great teacher.",
    "Great class! If you are interested in the \"big questions\" about the Universe then this class is for you! That said, the math\/physics for this course is not terribly difficult, but it does require some work. If you are taking this as a person who hasn't touched math or physics in years this might be a difficult class. However, Professor van den Bosch is amazing; he has a great sense of humor and clearly explains concepts in class. His powerpoints are all you really need to study from for the test. Only 5 problem sets, a midterm and a final. Book is completely unnecessary. Decent curve.",
    "Yes, an interesting class. But not as light as expected.",
    "I would recommend this course but if you only need a science credit, you should really do what you can to take an easier course. The QR component is easy, but if you're not really big on the science part, you'll need to focus your energies there. I found the course challenging as a fifth course.",
    "This class will teach you the basics of the Universe. Inflation, dark matter, and dark energy receive a good deal of focus. If you want to learn more about the Universe and aren't afraid of a little math (it's really not bad) you should absolutely take this class. This was my favorite class of the semester and all I was looking for was a QR\/Sc credit.",
    "Take it. One of the most fun course taught at Yale",
    "If you need a science credit and like physics, this class isn't bad. It's not great either. Professor van den Bosch did a great job of trying to keep the class interested, but an afternoon class where the lights are turned off and there's a slideshow of pictures of space can be hard to stay awake in.",
    "Franciscus van den Bosch is the kind of guy who you would want to grab a beer with.",
    "This was an interesting science course, and if you've taken high school Physics, you will have all the requisite math and much of the requisite science knowledge. The textbook, for me, was next to useless.",
    "Not worth it. Pretty boring presentation of material, more Comic Sans in the lecture slides than a sane person could tolerate, and it didn't add up to much. There are better ways to fulfill your distributional requirements.",
    "Problem sets can be deceptively difficult. Talk to your TA if you have ANY questions.",
    "If you're interested in the material, take the class. The math is not very challenging, and the material is very interesting.",
    "This is the coolest science class at Yale! Take it!",
    "Very interesting material. The new professor (just came on this year) transformed this class into something WAY more difficult than it's been known to be in the past years, but it's ALMOST worth it for how cool this class is.. The professor's a great lecturer and supplements his lectures with lots of really trippy images and videos.The best part: you leave the class really feeling like you understand the way the Universe came to be. Really puts things into perspective.",
    "I would recommend Astro 170 to others, except only if they've had another Astro class\/some astronomy experience under their belts. The reason is that the subjects that are discussed in this class can be somewhat confusing, and I just think that a student would be better prepared if they had some prior exposure of these subjects. Also, DO NOT take Astro 170 as your first class in the astro sequence; do yourself a favor and take Astro 110 or something first. Your GPA will thank you.",
    "Take it if you're comfortable with numbers (the problem sets and exams are a bit difficult) and if Frank is teaching again-- he's hilarious and makes the material accessible and even more interesting.",
    "This class is really really interesting but ended up being very difficult because in lecture you kind of just learn beautiful facts and theories and then all of a sudden outside of class you have to do lots and lots of math and that threw a lot of us for a loop, I think. Lots.",
    "Fun class, interesting material, pretty easy workload. I'd recommend it. The first while is a bit of history of science and then a review of basic physics, but I found that mostly interesting too. The actually cosmology stuff is generally cool, and van den Bosch is a great lecturer.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you are interested in the material and confident in your math skills, definitely take it",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. Cosmology is absolutely fascinating!",
    "Sure. This is a great class to fulfill the Sc requirement. Two mid-terms and five problem sets. Frank has a good sense of humor, and the material can be very interesting as well if you Are interested in astronomy and have had some high school physics before.",
    "Fun, interesting course--great if you need an Sc credit",
    "This is a class worth taking. I'm a biology major, and this material was never covered in any of my other classes. It was a fun course and I looked forward to coming to class each day. Highly recommend. + the Professor is a great lecturer and exams are fair.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The class is well taught, and the professor has a really engaging lecture style. If you're at all curious about the universe, you'll enjoy what you learn - it's really cool.Class is a bit harder than I initially expected, so don't stop going to class after the first few lectures. Mathematically it's not that bad (so don't be scared away if you aren't a math person and you're looking for a QR), but you should still expect to study.",
    "It's a fun course and enlightening if you want to know more about the expansion of our universe. I found the math extremely difficult and frustrating at times, but overall it's manageable if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "If you are interested in Astronomy and have a GOOD background in physics and chemistry, take this. However, if you are just looking for an easy SC credit, look into Astr 120 first!",
    "Pretty chill, few problem sets. Just prepare for tests and you'll be a'ight.",
    "Pretty cool overview of the Universe; its formation, how light travels, how stars and galaxies interact with each other. Problem sets and tests were pretty tough, I wouldn't say this is a gut science class, but if you're looking for a SC and a challenge, this might be it.",
    "I would recommend this class if, like me, you've had a long-standing curiosity about astronomy, physics, and how the universe works. It's a coherent, systematic progression through a lot of big, challenging, fascinating concepts. It's not dumbed down just because it's not for math\/science majors, which I really appreciated, but the problem sets are very challenging, so be prepared! But Professor van den Bosch is a very personable and helpful professor and an engaging lecturer, so avail yourself of the assistance available and you should be fine, provided you're committed to rising to the worthwhile challenge this class presents.",
    "Much more physics than I thought there would be. Don't be fooled by the initial QR test; I did well on that and still had an increasingly difficult time with the problem sets and exams. At one time I could do this stuff easily... but that would have been after high school physics. Not having taken any physics or engineering-- let alone math-- courses at Yale, I soon found myself in over my head. Don't take this if you're a non-math\/sciences major looking for a natural science credit unless you're willing to work harder to remember the mathematical operations you've probably mostly forgotten.",
    "I took this class for a QR credit, not for the material, and didn't find it engaging. The expectations are clear, though, and if your math is not very strong the exams have a lot of fact-based questions. However, it's not a gut, and I am sure there are more interesting QRs.",
    "Take this course! You will really enjoy Prof. van den Bosch's teaching - he really made the course for me! I have a new-found interest in cosmology. The topics are very interesting and the math is not too difficult. There are only 5 problem sets, so it is fairly easy to work hard on them and get a good grade.",
    "A good, fun course for an introduction to astronomy. Highly recommended if you have any interest in the subject.",
    "Not a gut, but a fair, good class if you have the time to put work into it. Don't fall behind. A strong background in physics isn't a joke, even though it's in LC.",
    "I would recommend it. It's the best science course for a non-science major that I've taken yet.",
    "Really good course, and a nice QR and science for non-science majors. If you took one high school physics course, the first half might be a bit of review. However, its a really cool overview of big bang cosmology and a little particle physics. Also, no required reading.",
    "Really interesting course, and a great Sc credit (or Qr, if that's what you're looking for, though the Sc material is much more engaging than the Qr applications on p-sets and exams). Readings and sections are optional - go if you have time, but if not, the lectures are very well organized and all materials are accessible online for easy studying. Don't skip lectures though - prof is a great lecturer, engaging and explains things well. You'll learn a lot about the universe!"
