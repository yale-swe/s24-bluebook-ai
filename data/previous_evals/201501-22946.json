    "Take this class if you want to develop a studio practice.",
    "Ugh. Don't take this class if you don't need to. Morale was low and professor was so arbitrary in who he liked and what he wanted from his students. Will is a nice guy overall but not a great professor. Could be reflective of overall Yale art class teaching style but if you're looking for a chill class this is NOT it. Also you will spend an absurd amount of money. I probably racked up 1k in material fees. Felt like your performance in class was contingent on how well you could defend your work and not the work itself. Also quantity was far preferred over quality of paintings, which resulted in rushing through a bunch of subpar paintings to make the quota.",
    "Will is knowledgable about painting and the industry. However, he can make crude assumptions on people's characters and can be difficult to be taught by.",
    "Lots of work but very rewarding"
