   "comments": [
    "YES!!!!!!!!!!! Esp. if you've never danced before! This is a great introduction!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. NOW. You dance 3\/4 of the time and discuss the readings\/general concepts of dance for 1\/4 of the time. We had one writing assignment and then the final paper (which is a personal experience paper so very low stress). Coulibaly is a fantastic teacher and one of the most incredible dancers I've ever had the luck to work with. My only regret about taking this class is that I can't take it again!",
    "I definitely recommend this class. If you don't make it in during the first day of auditions, go back the second day and you'll most likely get in.",
    "In THST335 you spend the course 3\/4 dancing and 1\/4 lecture. African dance is a lot of fun. You spend a portion of the class learning traditional African pieces, contemporary pieces, and then integrating the two in your own choreography. It's really low key. There are a couple of papers and reading. You can get by in the class without reading but they definitely supplement your experience. Lacina Coulibaly is a great instructor.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is a wonderful break from the overly intellectual world of Yale. You have to learn with your body which is seriously overlooked by most of Yale's curriculum. It really is wonderful and just a great break from the norm and is taught by a professor unlike any others here.",
    "Take this class. You will not regret it.",
    "Take this class. Even if you don't consider yourself a dancer, take this class. Dancing for three hours every week is a welcome break from the typical Yale class and allows you tap into a physically that most people don't get to experience as apart of their academic schedule. Take advantage of this opportunity. The work is extremely manageable and largely optional. You're technically supposed to do the weekly readings, but few people actually do, as class discussions rarely stick to the text. You'll get a lot out of this class, but it won't be a huge time investment, which can be very important in an otherwise heavy course load.",
    "You have to take this class. It's fun, but also helps you connect to yourself twice a week.",
    "This class was one of the best classes I took this term. It requires a lot of you - especially if you are not a dancer, but the most important thing is that it is possible to take this course if you have interest, no matter what background you have. I have not met an instructor more helpful or caring than Professor Coulibaly, and he is a wonder to watch dance. This course is a MUST TAKE for every major at Yale, you may never again get a chance like this in your life.",
    "YES YES YES! Take this class. You will exercise both your body and your mind. As a dancer, I found so many new issues to grapple with by exploring this new form. While doing the readings is not always enforced, they are really fascinating so I recommend that you do them. Don't worry if you don't have a dance background; you will be moving and choreographing with confidence very quickly!",
    "I would FULLY recommend this course. It's a great change of pace from any other course offered at Yale and really fun.",
    "Definitely take this class! This was the highlight of my week.",
    "Take this class! Took it as a senior and it was the best decision ever. Most people in the class come from a dance background, however. It is not necessary to be a dancer, but Lacina does have you audition to get into the class the first day, and he does not take everyone because more people audition than he is allowed to take. You dance three hours out of the four every week, and the other hour you have a discussion with Lacina. The discussions are not based on the readings but more on Lacina's personal ideas about dance. This class is more of a time commitment than any other seminar because it meets twice a week for two hours, but you do not have to do any of the readings. Just show up to class and dance. Lacina as a professor is amazing. Such a great dancer and so patient with his students. He makes sure you always understand the choreography and dancing next to him is a privilege.",
    "There is nothing better than learning skills. In this class, learn to feel your body, learn to carry yourself, learn to hear music through your spine, and learn to delight in class. It changes everything."
