    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0Zhemin made himself available when we had problem sets, however not before the final exam. His open TF hours were useful, but in general he is quiet and this made him slightly unapproachable.",
    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0Office hours, especially before problem sets, were very good. However, it might be nice to reach out before exams to offer more help to students, and to note issues that multiple students ran into on the previous exam.",
    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0Zhemin was very friendly, approachable and helpful, but it was difficult to find him for office hours or to pick up graded problem sets.",
    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0He did a good job. He knew the material and was accessible.",
    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0Great attitude and helpful, but somewhat bad timing and slow to grade problem sets\/ midterms.",
    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0Zhemin was very helpful in office hours.",
    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0He was a great resource when doing the homework assignments. He came to section prepared and was able to answer all of my questions thoroughly.",
    "Instructor: Zhemin Xuan \u00a0We did not interact heavily with the teaching assistant in this course, but he seemed competent. One issue was that he did not make an effort to complete grading our first homework assignment before the first exam - we were told we could pick up this assignment on the day of the exam, only a few hours before it was administered"

   "comments": [
    "The text book Biogeochemistry of Forested Ecosystems was very useful, other readings, less so. More frequent problem sets would have aided learning more of the material. Field trips organization would be improved by setting a time and date in advance, rather than with 1 day of notice (or less in some cases).",
    "Class pace was too fast. Concepts were not always clearly explained.",
    "The field trips were so disorganized, often announced just a day or two before we had to go. It made scheduling for the class terrible--a lot of us have other classes and jobs that we can't just cancel for a field trip where we probably won't really be learning anything useful anyway. This disorganization carried over into our schedule for exams. They were often announced a week or so in advance, which is not really enough time to study for a class where so much material is covered. And for the second exam Gabe cancelled it TWO HOURS before we were supposed to take it. Completely disrespectful. All of us students have the common decency to show up for your class (to which you come disorganized) and study hours for your exam, only to be told 2 hours before that we're going on a field trip instead. Lectures were hard to follow, as Gabe would jump from concept to concept, without much explanation in between, only to return to previous concepts. He comes to class with notes, but still can't seem to keep a linear trajectory for his lectures.",
    "Instructor for this course was highly disorganized and presented the material in a fragmentary way, without making an effort to construct an understandable narrative. The actual information content of the course as a whole was relatively average, but the scattered approach to presenting this material made it harder to learn than it should be. For the first half of the course, the instructor presented material at a breakneck speed, often not giving students time to successfully write notes from his primarily verbal descriptions of diagrams or construct questions. At times the instructor simply did not notice that students had questions, and had to be asked to back up and explain topics. Instructor often seemed to be unaware of the time, frantically checking the clock, out of breadth as he paused momentarily. After rushing through the first half of the course, and exclaiming about how far ahead we were, the instructor got sick for two complete weeks, which placed us exactly back on the usual schedule of the course. The course had only a single homework assignment that was required to turn in, and was not organized in a timely manner that would make it useful as study feedback for the midterm. This assignment was handed back on the day of the first midterm. The 2nd homework assignment was DUE on the day of the 2nd midterm, again reducing its utility as a learning tool. Overall, the subject matter of the course is very interesting, but the presentation was very disappointing to myself and also many other students. The purpose of taking a course is for an instructor to convey information in a structured way. If the learning done in a course could happen by students simply doing independent readings, attending the course itself becomes a waste of time. Professor Benoit is a highly intelligent man who has a lot to offer to his students. However to make his courses worthwhile uses of his student's time and money, he needs to put more effort into conceptualizing his course material in a well structured format.",
    "13-16 Gabe is very accessible in class. He is more than happy to stop and answer questions when students ask them, and usually his responses really do help clarify. However, the format of the class was difficult to follow. Gabe would provide packets of the powerpoint slides, but these were almost always out of order with slides missing, so it was hard to find the slide he was talking about in class. He kept jumping between slides and the whiteboard, and it took a while to figure out what I should be looking at. I started to get the hang of his teaching style towards the end of the semester which made things run a bit smoother. I'd say a lot of the concepts covered in the course I had already learned in other classes here, but it was helpful for me to take this class to tie everything together and to really solidify my grasp of the concepts."

    "The (waste)water treatment section of the class was too disjointed. I don't feel that I have a broad understanding of treatment technologies.",
    "More structure in the lectures\/lecture slides would have been very helpful. For instance, slide or figure titles and some written commentary on the slides would have helped me follow the lectures better. I learned more from the problem sets than the bibliography assignment and although it would have been more work, I would have preferred an extra problem set over the bibliography assignment.",
    "Delivery of information in course could be better organized.",
    "scheduling.",
    "Structuring material into a narrative. Instructor relies far to heavily on powerpoint slides. Instructor needs to construct quality homework assignments that function as an aid to learning, and reinforce the material he is presenting in the lectures. These homework assignments should also show reasonable match with the exams. For instance, if the final exam is going to include evaluating an environmental assessment, create a homework assignment that is similar. This helps students tune the conceptual tools they are developing and become experienced in doing this sort of analysis.",
    "The presentation of material could use a lot of work. It felt a bit disjointed (see previous comment).",
    "Field trips need to be shared with students at least a week in advance. Several field trips were announced the day before resulting some students needing to change previous commitments in order to attend the trip. Though I understood how the lectures on quality control and lab procedures tying into to the overall course at the end, the actual lectures did not seem relevant at the time since the course did not have a lab component and seemed more appropriate for a methods course as they were general best practices."
