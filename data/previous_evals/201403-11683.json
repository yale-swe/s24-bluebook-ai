    "Very fun and very chill. Do the readings, it will help you get a lot more out of class. Judge Garfinkel is the sweetest thing and also a hoot. He also does a great job of bringing current events into the discussion. If you get in, you should take it. If you really want it, be persistent!",
    "What a wonderful class this was. Professor Garfinkel is probably the nicest professor I've ever had - and the best one too. He engages very well with his students, and genuinely cares about them. He organizes seminar dinners several times throughout the semester, and really gets to know each and every one of his students. I was surprised by the number of times he remembered what me and my classmates were studying and involved in outside of class. The speakers he invites to class are also incredible. Take this class if you get in. It's a total of 25 written pages, no midterm, no final exam, and he lets you divide this up however you want. You can do one 25 page paper, two 12.5 page papers, 25 one-pagers, you name it, as long as the page count adds up to 25 by the end. You turn them in whenever you want - there's no exact due date. He also gets them back the very next class after you submit them. In preparation for every class, you read several controversial cases and discuss them. That's it, but it's really quite fun and incredible if you're into law. If you enjoy debating the Constitution and reading about intriguing cases but don't want to be bogged down by a class like Constitutional Law, definitely take this class. An amazing course and the best, most intriguing I've taken at Yale on the law. I thoroughly looked forward to going to class each week.",
    "Great course, definitely take it if you get in!",
    "Child, Family, and State investigates how the courts currently handle issues involving children at virtually every level. We discuss custody, education, medical issues, birth control, juveniles' first amendment rights, and much more. I would definitely recommend this course. Whether you plan to pursue a career that involves children or not, it is important that you understand how the state views children and where the Constitution's rights extend and where they do not.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! While there was a lot of reading, the workload is completely manageable and the class discussions are engaging. I do think that it would have been helpful to have a stronger legal background, as I sometimes was lost in the more technical aspects of the course, but Professor Garfinkel's emphasis on critical thinking and our own opinions made this less of an issue.",
    "I would recommend! This class covers a great range of legal issues that involve children. Judge Garfinkel is very experienced and the guest lectures he invites are truly fascinating! Cases are actually interesting to read (who knew?). You are able to \"skate by\" if need be. My semester was quite busy and I only wish I was able to read everything that I needed to.",
    "Child, Family, and State is a course that examines child and family issues in the legal system, from foster care to surrogacy. The topics we discussed were extremely interesting. That said, the class is very legal, and I think I would have enjoyed discussing the issues more from social or political perspectives. Professor Garfinkel sent relevant articles each week and I started to read these more than the reading in the legal casebook. Garfinkel is an extremely kind and understanding professor, and is so passionate about the subject. I would recommend this course to students interested in children or law.",
    "YES. This course is awesome--IF you're interested in the material and prepared to do a lot of reading. The guests and discussions are fantastic, but only if everyone is engaged and prepared. Beware the Thursday night slot.",
    "a must take such a wonderful class. professor garfinkel truly wants you to learn and think about these extremely relevant issues in the law and it shows. he is helpful in class, imbuing discussions with his incredibly insight and humor. he occasionally holds casual class dinners and brought his dog in once!",
    "I would definitely recommend Child, Family, and State to another student! It is a great course if you are interested in any topics relating to child law, education, or pediatric healthcare. We discussed a range of issues -- from cases involving child abuse to first amendment rights in schools -- and it gave me a new perspective about the intersection between government and family life. Definitely a great class to take!",
    "Fairly easy course that gives you a practical insight into the fields here. Basically a lite version of Dufresne's class.",
    "Interesting readings, not well structured. You have to write 25 pages all semester, which is a light workload, but there are basically no due dates (until before the end of exam period), so it catches up to you. Garfinkel is smart and knows a lot, but talks a bit more than would be preferable in a seminar.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Its such a cool interdisciplinary mix of medicine, law, education, etc. You leave every class working on an ethical puzzle. Plus Judge Garfinkel is really nice and the guest speakers are totally worth the time.",
    "Amazing professor, such a sweetheart. Levelheaded discussion leader, though could sometimes dominate a session with his own ideas. Still, learned so much. Some of the speakers were kind of meh, but the doctor was fantastic. Take it if you can. Not as legally rigorous as some would hope, but still decent coverage of the material. If you've ever taken a single class involving reading legal cases, you might find it a bit elementary. I still enjoyed it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in law, education, policy making or anyone who works with children."
