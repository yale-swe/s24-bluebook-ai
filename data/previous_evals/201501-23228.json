   "comments": [
    "Awesome course if you are even remotely interested in public health or anthropology! Definitely consider taking it - you'll find yourself amazed by what discussions can bring out of all of you as a class and as an individual student. I'd just say that pick your book for discussion leading after you've checked syllabi for other classes.",
    "Global health book club--so great!!",
    "It's like a global health\/ medical anthropology book club. You read a variety of ethnographies and then discuss. It's a very interesting survey of global medical anthropology.",
    "A MUST-TAKE class for anyone interested in global health, especially if you have mainly had a policy-oriented perspective in the past. The class was so engaging, and I learned SO much about anthropological perspectives on global health and why these perspectives are critical to designing policy interventions. The class is like a book club, where you read a different ethnography every week and discuss it in class. The reading list is excellent, and I anticipate reading and re-reading these ethnographies after graduation. Take this class!!!!",
    "ANTH 462 is a book club where students read ethnographies related to global health. I highly recommend ANTH 462 to other students who are interested in anthropology or global health, even if they don't have experience in either fields.",
    "Recommend to students of any discipline interested in health generally and global health\/development more specifically. Excellent introduction to medical anthropology."
