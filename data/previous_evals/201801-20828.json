    "I learned a lot about Latin America's from historical, economic, and policy-making perspectives.",
    "I learned a huge amount about Latin American history and economics, and got a really strong understanding of the region.",
    "This course taught me how to approach economics from a policy perspective and consider the impacts of history and the role that they play in determining the current economic environment. centerpiece question of the course was understanding the divergence tendencies of Latin America in relation to the developed world.",
    "This is largely an economic history of Latin America, so I learned a lot about that and how to apply it to other regions\/the future of Latin America. You learn a LOT! Prof. Zedillo is obviously incredibly knowledgable so you learn a ton just from his anecdotes.",
    "A deeper insight about how the Latin American region has developed. The class taught us to analyze and think critically",
    "Very interesting course. Good to get a grasp of Latin American history and the different economic trends in the region as well as specific case studies.",
    "I thoroughly learned about Latin America's economic history dating back to colonial periods. From then, I learned about the changes in the economies in the region overall and in specific countries. We also touched on political economies. Basically, it was an economic history course that analyzed the performances of Latin American countries and allowed us to conclude whether Latin America is forever destined to underperform."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Zedillo is definitely a strong advantage for this class because as an economist and the former president of Mexico, he has fabulous first-hand insights of the evolvement of Latin American economies. However, the discussion among students could be better structured.",
    "The class was excellent overall, with very interesting discussions and presentations. One thing for improvement would be to have less time spent on presentations and more on discussion\/debate, but overall I had an awesome time.",
    "This course is very driven by students and is filled with insights from Professor Zedillo. The readings were interesting and useful. I wish we had received more feedback on our assignments.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Zedillo is wonderful, and I learned a great deal that I feel is applicable to my study of economics in general. Smart, thoughtful group of students that can speak intelligently about the topics. Weaknesses: There basically wasn't any feedback given.",
    "The classes could be made more dynamic and TF presence better",
    "Every lecture was very interesting. However, feedback to the reading responses was not provided and would have been helpful.",
    "Every class a group of students presents on the readings\/topics of the week. However, these presentations were often long and took up the majority of the class, instead of allowing for class discussion. The class was not very conducive to discussions."

   "comments": [
    "I will if the student is interested in economics in developing countries. While economics as a subject has a lot of shared insights across regions, the specific focus on Latin America brings a special developing country perspective that is not common in other classes.",
    "You will learn so much from this course. The syllabus is great both in design and in content. Zedillo has a clear idea of what he wants students to take away from the class and that's exactly what I feel like I learned: a big picture understanding of the economic history of the region, understanding the social and political developments in order to have a more complete picture of the region and the skills to better understand its present and future. The class was very presentation heavy and that wasn't great, but that could have been more a function of our class and not necessarily the design. They were too long so there weren't really many chances to discuss or engage with the material in class. This was disappointing because it seemed like it would have been a good class with good peers to really talk about and debate the material. Overall, it was a class I really enjoyed, the vibe was good, and I learned a lot of IMPORTANT information, often neglected and understudied within the econ major.",
    "Absolutely - I learned a huge amount and had a lot of fun.",
    "Recommend this course for anyone who is interested in political science, economics, and\/or Latin America. Take note, however, that this course is a lot of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. In my opinion, Prof. Zedillo is one of the best professors in the econ department, and his personal experience makes the class even better.",
    "Yes! Profesor Zedillo is heavenly as a teacher",
    "Yes, if you are interested in economics and in Latin America.",
    "Definitely recommend. While there are a lot of readings and (despite being an Econ major) many are hard to understand, it is a great opportunity to dive into a region that is often forgotten. Besides, who better to teach this course than expert Professor Zedillo. While I struggled at first to keep up with the course, I left with so much knowledge and a refined ability to look at economic readings and to write my own paper on the topic."
