   "comments": [
    "I liked English 125 better than 126 -- the reading is much more interesting. If you can take it with Wendy Lee, take it take it take it!!",
    "Take it! Please. It is so much fun. You learn a lot. Spenser is the best.",
    "If you're taking 125, you're probably required to. You'll have a great time if you're into these poets.",
    "great class to take if you want to understand some major themes in english writing in the middle of the second millenia AD",
    "Take English 125 with Professor Lee! She helps you through the daunting task of reading Chaucer in Middle English (and makes it much easier than you think it will be!) and animates the material with interesting discussions. You will have a great class environment focused on truly learning and developing your literary skills, and Professor Lee challenged me to improve my writing in a very constructive and supportive manner. Finding a good professor for this class can be tough, but you won't go wrong with Professor Lee!",
    "This course delved into selected texts of four well-known English authors and emphasized close reading and critical writing regarding these passages. I would absolutely recommend this course to all regardless of your selected major or eventual area of interest. The skills learned in this class are invaluable in learning how to look at things around and wonder about their deeper meaning, as well as giving a greater ability to extract learning from everything around you. I learned to look at my surroundings in a new light during this class, and Professor Lee was very approachable and willing to work with you individually with any questions. Overall, a fantastic course."
