    "Readings from many authors in the Western tradition. Many of the reasons for some of the social movements in modern times.",
    "Writing, analysis, reading long books in short periods of times, how to present ideas in a discussion.",
    "The ability to analyze all things revolving a society and the individual. The big theme this semester was the individual versus the society. Many different authors in Historical and political forced us to consider various and conflicting perspectives between these individuals. This class helped me pick out and analyze the nuances of those arguments.",
    "My writing skills and critical reading improved tremendously."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class studies some fascinating texts, all of which I am happy to have read, but there is a lack of cohesion in the syllabus. I would appreciate a slightly better introduction to the H&P course in general in the fall (this would also be helpful in the philosophy track) because sometimes it felt a bit wandering.",
    "Given recent political events people were prone to relating the material to current events, which was fine and probably needed to some extent, but we did it too much. It took away from analyzing the text and its role in the time period it was created in. Yes the books are \"relevant\" but that is far from the coolest thing about them. Still a fantastic course though.",
    "The course was perfect in nearly every single way except for the allotted time. I mentioned this in my DRST Literature Course Evaluation. I believe that if the students had more time to read all of the books, we could understand them better and have more enlightened discussions.",
    "This is a great course if you're interested in learning about Western historical and political thought in the last five hundred years. What's especially encouraging is that the instructors of DS are becoming more and more aware of the need for diversity, and the syllabus is constantly changing. I found this course to be very engaging and informative."

    "Would definitely recommend second semester!",
    "Absolutely, the DS program is an incredible intellectual experience, and H&P is a wonderful part of that. Be prepared to have very heavy required readings, especially in H&P.",
    "Yes.",
    "Of course I would for the same reasons mentioned in my other DRST Course Evaluation- the books are good brain food and the classes themselves forces students to think.",
    "This course provides a great overview of global historical and political thought from Montaigne to Arendt. That being said, you're expected to cover a large amount of text in a small amount of time. I would not recommend this class if you're not up to doing that; if you are, it can be very rewarding.",
    "Yes. It is a great component of the DS syllabus."
