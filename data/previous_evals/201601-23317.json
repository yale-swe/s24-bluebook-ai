    "The course provided an interesting overview of the global economy through readings from a variety of authors that focused on different geographical areas. I also enjoyed class discussions very much, allowing us to consider how the material applied to broader concepts and current events that are relevant.",
    "Great class discussion, fascinating readings, interesting and illuminating lectures",
    "I really liked the weekly thesis statement exercises, which helped me get a lot out of my readings and think clearly. I also enjoyed Carol's weekly lectures and the class discussions.",
    "I like the fact that class readings covered different geographic regions. I was also happy with how the writing of the term paper was organized. for example, there was a deadline for submitting abstracts, and presenting the paper's outline. It makes you get things done on time. Compared to other term paper from other classes, this was the most organized term paper I wrote; just because it was well guided. The professor also spelled out clearly what she wanted in the paper and that helped during writing.",
    "The reading materials and lectures fit extremely well together. Clearly a well thought-through class. Because of this the class discussions were thorough and vigorous and helped me learn the course concepts more deeply. Also the suggested reading list is excellent!"
