   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class 200% to another student. It's not only a class about African American Poetry, but about life and the world. The poets in this class gave us language to tackle hard topics and discuss issues on a level that only poetry and literature can access. You learn about an incredibly amount of important black history and in this way can see current events within important context. You're exposed to an amazing myriad of voices that are underrepresented in most of our lives. As a young college student, especially a black student, discussions around identity in class don't only allow you to explore the literature but explore yourself.",
    "A fast overview of African American poets that will make you want to know more.",
    "This class was an irreplaceable experience. Professor Alexander taught us so much in breadth and depth of African American poetry and also created links with other art forms, making it a really artistic class. The classroom atmosphere was extremely encouraging and Professor Alexander showed us how much the content we were learning mattered. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have the chance! This course is provides an exposure or new appreciation for the power of words and literacy and the intersections between art and oppression. This course, while very specific, with the right mindset, has very broad implications. And the seminar environment, especially when taught by Professor Alexander, is invaluable.",
    "I'll quote what I said above: This was an amazing class that taught be so much about a subject I thought was interesting but had no idea just how much I would grow to care about. African American culture is a necessary part of any education and should be considered core curriculum. Professor Alexander came to class every day prepared and enthusiastic. She introduced perspective-altering ideas each class and though she was undeniably an expert in the topics we were discussing, she was always receptive to new ideas. Her respect for each of her students and the profound respect we each had for her in return was a huge part of what made this class so incredibly extraordinary. Also, I would absolutely recommend this class. You learn about the bloodline of African American poets from poets who arrived on slave ships to poets you meet and have conversations with in the flesh-- it's truly an incredible, unparalleled course.",
    "If you are interested at all in poetry, you need to take this class. The professor, the readings, and the applications will change your life. Along the way, you will get to meet famous poets and attend poetry readings at different colleges.",
    "If you have the opportunity, take this class. It is life-changing, and you will learn much more than African American poetry.",
    "AFAM Poetry was a life changing experience. It was more than simply a course or seminar at Yale. In this class I learned about writers who are not as popular to many, but deserved more than just my attention or side interest. This was a class where I learned to express myself and where I formed a family with peers who not only provided a support system through the first semester but also built a sturdy foundation of values that will guide my Yale journey. Professor Alexander is inspirational, perhaps the only person I have ever actually idolized. She cares about her students and she truly makes an effort to get to know them on a deeper level and show them what a wealth of knowledge is available for them to treasure. I don't just recommend this class, but I feel it is vital to make your Yale experience the best it can be.",
    "Take it!!!! If only to bask in Professor Alexander's brilliance. But more than that to engage deeply with a tradition that has been neglected for so long but has a lot to say about the fabric of not only African American life or American life but human life.",
    "I recommend African-American poetry to students who are prepared to write, read, learn, grow, and change. You'll learn about an important, beautiful, and intersectional segment of Black history and culture as what it truly is, globally pertinent and unrelentingly necessary--the center of attention in this classroom, which is rare. Professor Alexander is one of the most amazing people you will ever encounter, so be ready to present your best self and soak in all of the wisdom that rests in her every word."
