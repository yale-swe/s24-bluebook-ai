    "Yes, this is a really excellent class to just develop your general prose style, unencumbered by a specific genre or series of assignments.",
    "YES.You write 6 essays, and the 6th is a revision of one of the first 5. You read essays that Zarin chooses, as well as essays from an anthology, each week. Then you workshop each other's pieces. Discussion is interesting (Zarin will call on you whether or not you're raising your hand), group feedback is helpful if unnecessarily skewed toward the negative, and learning to write to a word count is a useful (marketable?) skill. I took it for a grade, but many people took it pass\/fail. This was the first year of the course, so Zarin is still figuring it out\u0097but that's cool. Zarin's feedback is amazingly helpful. I know I became a better writer in her class.Zarin's been the \"quirky girl\" since before Zooey Deschanel was born. She's not warm-and-fuzzy right away, but she's brilliant and wonderful and secretly hilarious. She loves Diet Coke. Bring her Diet Coke.",
    "with prof Zarin, yes. otherwise, yes, if you really want to force yourself to write. also, all english majors which can be either annoying or hilarious and sometimes refreshing",
    "Yes, it's a good course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Yes! The readings and the assignments are great and Cynthia is wonderful.",
    "I think this is an excellent course. My essay writing improved, and I appreciated the chance to explore in terms of style and topics. The readings were interesting, although I do feel like they varied a bit in quality.",
    "I can't really recommend it. The course had almost no structure, and I'm not sure how much my writing improved this term (although I do know much more about the things I don't do well).",
    "Yes. Particularly if you are interested in developing your own creative nonfiction writing voice."
