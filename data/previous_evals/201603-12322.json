    "I'm still not really clear what the goals of this course are. The formal presentation provides an opportunity for students to practice public speaking, but we are also graded on participation and I don't think the current format is very conducive to promoting scientific discussion. A less formal presentation setting where students go over the papers together (i.e. one leader to guide discussion, with students volunteering to explain what is being done in each figure and what the results mean) would allow for increased participation. The structure of having each student explain their research proposal does provide an opportunity for each student to participate, but is also anxiety producing and doesn't really promote discussion among students. I also struggled with the writing assignments each week. Are they supposed to be \"Specific Aims\" pages or more like the \"Research Strategy\" section of a grant? The instructors have sold the assignments as \"Specific Aims\" pages but seem to be looking for more detail than aims pages usually involve in terms of experimental methodology, etc. What I end up writing each week seems like a hybrid between the two, and I'm never sure what the appropriate balance is between overview and detail. It was also unclear whether we should summarize\/reference the paper we read each week in the assignment (with different professors giving conflicting ideas), and how closely related the aims pages should be to the paper we read. In the future, please include examples of excellent papers from prior years to demonstrate exactly what type of content you are looking for. Finally, I think the workload of this course is too high. I would have appreciated having a few opt-out weeks (i.e. require students to submit aims for 10 of the 12 class sessions -- this would still give students ample writing experience but would allow more flexibility). Other department seminars are much less writing intensive. For example, the Genetics seminar meets every few weeks and involves only presentations and discussions. The INP seminar similarly requires a writing assignment every week, but is only a semester long. I strongly support the idea of giving students the opportunity to practice scientific writing, but I don't think that writing a paper a week for a whole year is necessary to get this experience. Furthermore, the Pathology department requires a class on scientific writing as part of the qualifying process, and so many students will gain writing experience outside of this course. This course involves writing proposals directly related to students' research, which I believe is more valuable than writing proposals on random topics. This class is also available to students in Pharmacology and Physiology.",
    "Strengths: Good introduction to science thinking and writing with multiple viewpoints.",
    "Strengthened my ability to write a specifics aim page. Would like to write a full specific aims in the future, such as multiple aims, instead of the details of one aim. That seemed to work well for the first semester but could be improved for the second.",
    "The strength of this course is that the idea of why we take this course is a good one. It is important for us as scientists to read scientific papers and to learn how to write grant proposals. The weaknesses of this course reside in its execution. The workload is vast and the topics random which leads to disinterest among the students. At the start of the semester, it was manageable and somewhat interesting as it was new. As the semester progressed, it became clearer and clearer that the course was primarily busy work which took up a great deal of time for essentially no benefit to the student--the specific aims page and paper from previous weeks totally forgotten. This course could be improved by modifying the execution. Either allowing students to choose the papers so they would maintain interest, or simply making the course every other week as opposed to every week. I already feel like I have completed the full year's worth of material for this course and yet am only half way through. I find it hard to imagine that the second semester will do anything but continue this downward trend. Increasing the interval between sessions will increase the interest with each paper, as students will have had two weeks to think about the paper and write a thoughtful aims page instead of throwing something together week after week simply to get it done.",
    "I appreciate that the course incorporates a writing component in an effort to prepare PhD students for writing the grants that will be necessary to further our careers. However, I have suggestions for improving the structure. Before students write a specific aims page, examples of well-written and sub-par specific aims pages should be discussed in class. Ideally these examples would be based off the first or second weeks' reading. This will allow students to familiarize themselves with the qualities necessary for a good grant proposal. In turn, this should allow students to start writing the mock specific aims at a higher level.",
    "There are lots of interesting topics."

I feel that the price is far too high for what you get in return in this course, and would find it more beneficial to not take the course at all than to take it for a full year.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it helps build an important skill, grant writing, that the student will need for their future academic career.",
