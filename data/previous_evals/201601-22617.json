   "comments": [
    "There is a reason that this course is as competitive as it is. This is one of the most formative classes I've taken at Yale, and Chris and Stan do a fantastic job of not only building leaders, but also modeling what leadership should look like. Over the course of the semester you carefully consider what it takes to be a leader, what different styles and strategies are, and how you can build your own skills to be a stronger team lead. You also have very honest conversations with 20 other smart, driven people, and you end up leaving the class as part of a tight knit, trusting team. Highly recommend. On a separate note, the readings for this class are fantastic -- I don't study military\/American diplomatic history, and I was still very positively surprised by how engaging and applicable the readings were.",
    "If you are accepted into this course, I highly recommend it. The course is based on a series of case studies from all aspects of life (government, business, etc) where we can examine the key aspects of leadership and evaluate how they apply to our own lives. The class is also about team-building and learning from peers. I met an incredible group of Yale students through this class that I otherwise would have never met, and I think I am much better off for having done so.",
    "Absolutely hands down recommend as a 'flagship' class the Jackson Institute offers. You will learn a lot about leadership and yourself.",
    "This is an unconventional course as leadership is a difficult skill to teach. The readings provide excellent case studies of different aspects of leadership, and class discussion allows you to learn from your classmates. The paper topics were fantastic and taught me a great deal about leadership. Highly recommend.",
    "DEFINITELY take this class if you get a chance - this class is different from any other class I have taken at Yale and is a unique opportunity. Professores McChrystal and Fussell are incredible at helping built an environment of camaraderie, partnership and solidarity in the class. This means that by the end of the course you have truly become a \"team\" and feel very connected to your classmates. Having this environment in a classroom is an incredible opportunity to learn from others and their experiences, since everyone was often so willing to share. This is a class where you will learn as much from the great reading list, as from the interactions that you have with other students in the class and the experiences that are shared.",
    "Yes, its a good primer on leadership.",
    "Absolutely, I would recommend the course to a fellow student. The class discussions are fast-paced and will involve all students in the conversation. The readings are interesting and address a range of issues that are related to leadership.",
    "This was the deepest and most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. Gen. McChrystal and Chris are a wealth of leadership experience, knowledge, and reflection. That being said, their guidance in the class doesn't account for the tremendous caliber of students that are hand picked to take the class. So many different backgrounds and experiences that add to the value of the learning. Workload is high - when you come to class, come prepared. Reading is long and sometimes dense. It is necessary to get something out of the class. Simply... If you get in - take it. It will change your life.",
    "Yes",
    "The best course I've ever taken. If you get the chance to be a part of this class, don't pass it up for absolutely anything.",
    "Good course that will make you think about why you do what you do when you are in leadership positions. I would recommend it. I think it's a great way to step back from your own work experience, hear about what others have to say, and reflect on how you could have been more or less effective. Given a better course assistant, the class would have been amazing. The fact is, we were always working under artificial deadlines because Mela couldn't be bothered to post things on a timely basis.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who ever thinks they will lead, which should be anyone!",
    "Extraordinary class, you will learn things you cannot learn at any other classroom at Yale, and meet wonderful people on the way."

   "comments": [
    "This isn't something that developed content area expertise for me, but the interpersonal skills learned will stick with me for a long time. Thank you, Stan and Chris!",
    "Leadership is a key component to all disciplines and fields. But in addition to teaching me leadership, by examining case studies across different sectors, I learned more to help me be just a more well-rounded citizen in general.",
    "Leadership is a difficult skill to teach. The case studies provided in-depth insights and discussion into different aspects of leadership. The four essays throughout the semester helped me to examine different leadership styles in different professional areas.",
    "This course teaches students essential leadership skills that will be helpful in all types of careers after Yale. It is more of a practical course, but the theoretical content was also deep and the course deepens students' knowledge of history.",
    "As a student of leadership, there are not many offerings on leadership theory and application at Yale. At the same time, there are not many people who are qualified to teach a course like this. This class forced me to widen my scope of thought about all aspects of leadership.",
    "I'm going to use a lot of what I learned and what I thought about when I get back out of grad school. I think that the readings were useful and made me think about effective leadership in all sorts of manners - not just in the military.",
    "The course taught me how to become a thoughtful leader, when to question myself, when to rely on my team."
