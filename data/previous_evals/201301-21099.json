    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It provided an excellent overview to important works of the 1530s by Rabelais, Marguerite de Navarre, and Cl\u00c3\u00a9ment Marot as well as in-depth analysis of the individual work themselves. The chronology traced in the course allowed for a more general understanding of how literature reflected and responded to religious and political issues of the time.",
    "The subject is not the easiest. Reading Moyen Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais is required, but it becomes easier after a few weeks. However it is worth taking the course, to expand one's knowledge of 16th century literature. The course is interesting and an enjoyable challenge."
