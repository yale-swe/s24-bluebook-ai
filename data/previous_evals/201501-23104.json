   "comments": [
    "Great class. Very interesting reading, and Prof. Brantley has a knack for leading discussion that many tenured professors here could take notes from. It was a fun class, but it also made me think about the American alcohol industry and consumer culture in a completely different light.",
    "I would absolutely recommend HIST 128J to other students. This class offers information on a subject that you can't find anywhere else at Yale. The class examines the development of beer and liquor's role in America, both socially and politically.",
    "Yes take this class",
    "Hist 128J is a great class for someone looking for an alternative history seminar. It is not the history of beer, but the role of alcohol and taverns in American history.",
    "This is a unique history course that takes a popular pastime, drinking beer, and analyzes it through an academic perspective. Additionally, one begins to realize how prevalent beer is American history. I enjoyed the course. The only weakness is that there is little relevant research on beer because few people have considered the subject of academic importance.",
    "This class is an excellent look at American history through the lens of a particularly morally and politically fraught consumer good. Friends laughed at my senioritis when I told them I was taking this course, but in truth it was a legitimate (but, of course, fun!) history class that took seriously something that we often dismiss as a depraved and pleasurable part of life. I understand Prohibition and temperance movements with more nuance now, as well as the formative role beer and liquor played in American sports history. The workload is not small a 3-5 page book review and a 15-20 page research paper but the subject matter makes this easy enough to endure. It's easy for a class like this, with such a (seemingly) specific topic, to start to feel repetitive, but Ally took pains to keep things interesting and comprehensive, even when it meant less traditional approaches like pop history books or a visit to the Yale Farm to learn about hops farming. If this or any class like it is offered again, absolutely take it!",
    "Yes, definitely. This class is unlike any other at Yale and was one of my favorites in my Yale career."
