   "comments": [
    "Easy but boring history credit. You have to study for the final.",
    "It's a good fifth credit, provided that you put in some work. I would recommend it only if you're willing to do the readings and take lecture notes.",
    "Take it if you need a humanities gut and have too much other classes on your plate. Otherwise, you should probably take something more enriching.",
    "If you want a history credit that is not too taxing. Make sure you do the readings for the final quiz. Everything leading up to the quiz is very easy to do well on if you actually study.",
    "Some neat stuff, but there are better (albeit slightlllyyyy harder) history lectures out there.",
    "There's always something you can learn in this course. Skipping classes is not a good idea though because the lectures are useful and informative.",
    "Yale gut with a hard quiz at the end. Boring with lots of reading but not bad if you break it up with a group of people.",
    "Great class to learn about Vikings in a revealing light",
    "It is easy to skate through Vikings the entire semester with minimal effort and see decent results. Unfortunately for most, the final exam rewards those who consistently attend lectures and do the course readings. The general atmosphere of apathy is difficult to overcome and the lectures can be very dull. Minimal effort is not good enough for this GUT course, significant studying at the end of the semester is required.",
    "Take it. One of the best courses I've taken here at Yale.",
    "Vikings was probably one of the best classes I'll ever take at Yale. You really get out what you put in with regards to learning. Overall, the course material was diverse and interesting. It was really nice to be able to learn so much about such a little known period of history from one of the best in his field. Winroth is an amazing professor!",
    "Recommend it if you don't completely slack off. You do have to put in some work.",
    "Not too much work, interesting humanities credit.",
    "Hist 228 01 was a very interesting course. I would recommend it to others because it was very interesting and different from other courses at Yale.",
    "If you want to take a class that is SUCH a joke that even faculty members and your residential college dean will judge you and scoff for taking, sign up for \"Vikings!\" This class is the difficulty of a 3rd grade spelling test, with an added twist of pointy weapons and barbarians. I would not recommend it to any self-respecting student, unless Professor Winroth decides to take himself seriously as an academic or Yale administration decides to hold him accountable and makes him create a course with some level of scholarship required.",
    "Great class. Recommend taking it",
    "It seems like it isn't a lot of work, but by the time it comes to the final, there are so many sources that you need to be able to recognize that it actually requires a lot more work than people give it credit for.",
    "Really cool class, Vikings are cool.",
    "don't take it.",
    "Fun class. Gut. Take it if you need a humanities. I enjoyed it.",
    "This is not an easy class, the assignments require a lot of work and thought.",
    "It's a gut. Even the quiz at the end is pretty easy if you give it an hour or two to study for. It sucked though because so many people cheated, so we don't know how the curve is going to be. The TFs also knew about the cheating and didn't do anything to correct it, so take that as you will. It's pretty good for a 5th class since the work is minimal.",
    "Take it if you are genuinely interested in Vikings History; students tend to overestimate how much they would like to dig deep down into the subject.",
    "This class is designed to provide a rudimentary and easy introduction to history and humanities classes. It is brutally easy, and I would recommend if you are looking for an easy class that requires little effort. Since history is my major, this is not really what I would have wanted in hindsight, but it is an interesting class.",
    "One of the most boring classes i have taken at Yale. Take it if you want a class with least amount of work and still a decent chance at getting A for the effort you put into studying for it.",
    "No longer a gut course",
    "I would because any student would enjoy it.",
    "If you're interested in learning about vikings in a not too intense setting, take this class. Interesting assignments, engaging professor, and fascinating topics. Good history credit.",
    "If you've ever been curious about Scandinavian literature (ex. Beowulf), Vikings, European history, or geography, I highly recommend. However, as a word of caution: the class is easier in the sense that the workload may be lighter than other courses. Please don't mistake that for the grading to necessarily be incredibly easy.",
    "Easy enough to do very well in this class with minimum work. Unfortunately there's not a lot of content and I quickly became bored with this subject. However this is an easy way to get a preindustrial credit for history majors.",
    "Take this class if you can. Very relaxed and you learn a lot if you put in some effort.",
    "A lot of people take this class as a gut, however I was drawn to it for the material. I thought it was super interesting stuff, but was a bit bummed by the lack of enthusiasm from the other 390 students enrolled in the course. Professor Winroth is great and I'd definitely recommend taking a class with him however!",
    "Take it. It's easy.",
    "Easy course with no work until the last couple of weeks.",
    "Please take this class, and take it for a grade. Like come on, it has an exclamation point in the title.",
    "Surprisingly challenging final exam, but overall a very doable 5th course.",
    "Not unless they change the final exam.",
    "I guess it did end up being the gut that had been predicted, but don't go into it thinking you won't need to do any work. The final exam is extremely difficult to study for, and if you have a tough TA, you will need to do at least some of the reading every week in order to write reading responses. Map quiz is a joke, though, and the essay wasn't bad at all.",
    "A good fifth class, or if you're interested about Viking culture.",
    "I would tell everyone to take this class. I truly enjoyed going to section and the lecture.",
    "Don't take this class unless you're actually interested Viking poetry. I didn't learn anything about Vikings except for about their poetry. Lecture was boring and very hard to go to because it had nothing to do with the test or paper or any of the grades. It was relatively little work, but the assignments were annoying to do and took some thought. I took it thinking it was going to be gutty and I don't really know if it was worth it.",
    "Definitely take it!! Not a bad class at all, and very interesting!",
    "What a stupid course. An easy A, but you won't feel good about it. No themes, lecture is a total waste of time, bleh.",
    "Great class. Do the reading.",
    "gut that isn't a gut don't take it",
    "If you want to learn something interesting, take Vikings!",
    "Intriguing class, mostly about Viking folklore.",
    "Easy class. I would definitely recommend it",
    "Yes. Interesting subject and good teachers",
    "Generally super easy -- I never went to class. But if you don't want to be steamrolled by the final,maybe class is a good idea. Either way, great 5th class.",
    "Great insight into the Viking Age and how it fits in with the history of its time. Useful information on how the Viking Age still affects our everyday life nowadays.",
    "Don't treat it like a gut, because it isn't. But definitely take the class if you can!",
    "Yes, recommend",
    "Disproves some misconceptions about vikings and you read some interesting stories",
    "Take it if you have a hard semester otherwise and\/or are looking for a pre-industrial credit",
    "Total gut, take it. But, it turns out to be harder than you'd think.",
    "This class is very poorly organized and arbitrary. Don't be fooled, the final exam is difficult. Shop TAs for a better experience",
    "Not much work, but it's not clear what you need to do. Shop ta's well, and don't be afraid to switch sections if your at is incompetent",
    "Take the class, definitely if your other classes are a little overwhelming. Though the course is not especially rigorous, it is very engaging. You would be surprised how important Vikings are in western history. Not to mention, Professor Winroth is great!",
    "Not a good class. Professor Winroth is a poor lecturer. Lectures were not well organized and I never really understood what the point of each lecture was. The class was very focused on the readings so I would focus on doing those as there really isn't much other work to be done for this class.",
    "I would recommend this class only if the student needs a class with little to no work requirement, apart from the few assessments. However, I will warn that it is a very dull class, and there is a reason attendance quickly dropped in lecture.",
    "Fun, not academically rigorous. Some incredible lectures; some less incredible topics as well.",
    "I would recommend Vikings, but not as a traditional gut. There is a lot of reading and it's pretty important that you actually do it.",
    "Fun class for non- history majors",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It is not very interesting and i would have rather taken a class that i learned something in even if it was a little harder. the reading was very boring and the assignments didnt help us learn anything they were just tedious memorization. dont take this class if you like to learn.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless you are truly interested in learning about the Vikings. Don't take it if you are looking for a gut-- you will end up not attending lecture, and then the exam will be unnecessarily stressful for you. It would be better to take a course with a heavier workload that you will actually get something out of.",
    "Definitely recommend taking this course. You learn a lot of cool stuff about Vikings from a world-class history professor. Just make sure to actually do the readings, they don't take as long as you'd think and the course is so much better that way.",
    "I took this course because I needed an easy credit. Vikings fulfilled that requirement. I stopped going to lecture a few weeks before spring break after I realized that I got absolutely nothing by going to lecture. If you don't go to lecture and do the readings, you will do just fine. This class is only somewhat interesting. I took this class to graduate. There are many others like me in this lecture.",
    "Worthwhile class if you are interested in the content and do not want a very high workload.",
    "A survey course about Scandinavia n history, including raiding, the gift giving economy, sagas, and poetry. Lots if primary sources particularly sagas which are challenging but interesting. Lectures were entertaining. Certainly not a gut in any sense of the word. As a history major this was a nice change of pace--the geography quiz is doable, the papers are very different from the standard mold, and at times it feels more like a literature class. It was not easy but it is less stressful than other classes. You should do the reading both because it helps you get something from the course and because it helps prepare you for the final",
    "Very chill class, and super cool if you've ever wanted to learn about Vikings. Workload not a problem at all.",
    "Took this class credit\/d as a senior. kinda of wished i had changed it to a grade. lot's of little things to do throughout the semester so easy to keep up with the class. optional attendance.",
    "Vikings is an outstanding course which covers the fascinating topic of the Viking Age. This period of history, which was so important to the development of Europe and even the U.S., is both intriguing and somewhat mysterious. It is well-taught, the workload is manageable, and it's also a lot of fun. I have enjoyed every minute of this course.",
    "I would not recommend another student to take it letter grade.",
    "I thought it was a good course, but not some easy class without any work. If you do the readings and go to class, it is very enjoyable. I recommend it!",
    "This class was interesting. I'm not quite sure if it's relevant to anything today except if you were wondering something like \"hey I wonder why this is called x,\" in which case you could read a few outlandish Viking stories and say \"oh, there was this thing that the Scandinavians used to do, or at least according to a professional poetic entertainer who got his facts from hearsay.\" Still, I'm glad I took it.",
    "Meh. Not worth it if you're not a history major. The class has no work except you MUST keep up with your readings and then the final papers are LONG and HARD so really, don't just take it because you hear its a gut, take it because you need a pre-industrial credit toward your major.",
    "If you're taking it for a gut beware that it all depends on your TA.",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "Good course if you want to learn about Vikings",
    "The class is pretty good. Winroth is a very funny professor and, if you actually go to class (which most people don't because you can totally get away with not going to class), you will enjoy it. The class is not as gutty as a lot of people think it is; there is a fairly long writing assignment mid semester and the final requires a lot of studying for if you want to pass",
    "Pretty much what you would expect. Lectures are somewhat boring and lacking in real information. Assignments are good and not too intensive. Final was on all the readings. Maybe try to get a group together to study for that",
    "Honestly, it was a pretty good course! Professor Winroth's lectures are engaging (unfortunately half the class never bothered to show up), and he is a very eloquent lecturer. The workload is fairly easy--a map quiz, a short written assignment, a final paper, and a final QUIZ. The final quiz is somewhat easy to study for--even if you skim the readings, you should be fine. Heck, if you even paid half-attention during the lectures, you should still be fine. But many people still elected to slack off for the final quiz, and never do any of the readings, so it came back to bite them in the behind. Pro-tips to do well: keep up with the readings (even Sparknoting\/Wikipediaing the long-ish sagas will help you tremendously), and attend lecture. It really is a gut if you just put in some effort (this may or may not be oxymoron). I felt like I came out of the course knowing much more about Viking culture (and by extension, Norse culture), and it was worth my time--never did I feel like I was burning money by attending class (unlike other guts at Yale). Some guts are a complete waste of your time (bad lecturer, bad preparation, etc.), but Vikings was different. I recommend it! Justine Walden was a fantastic TF (but I don't think she'll be TF'ing next semester).",
    "You can get through the entire course with perfect scores by just attending section and spending ~30h on the assignments, until the final quiz on all the readings. However, since nobody else has done the readings either, the curve should work to your advantage. As for actual content, the lectures are at times incoherent, yet the readings interesting.",
    "Solid class, not great. Good 5th class, but a lot of work at the end of the semester when you realize you have to read a bunch of stuff.",
    "I can basically summarize this question as follows: take Vikings if you want an easy, boring class full of people who could care less about the course material; do not take Vikings if you are actually looking for a history class where you can learn a lot of new information about a civilization that you may know little about - because you certainly do not come out with a semester's worth of knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, now however that the final quiz is a bit tricky. Overall though it's a fun class.",
    "I regret taking it.",
    "Hist 228 is fairly subpar. It barely manages to cover any information through the entire semester, and the assignments are a joke. If you're looking for an easy humanities requirement, then I suppose this suffices, but if you're looking to learn about the Vikings, I'd recommend that you just read the assigned sagas on your own.",
    "This class was a pretty easy and interesting history course for someone looking for a low intensity humanities course. The world of the vikings is a big and fascinating one, and if one puts in the time to do most of the readings, the class can really help someone understand the medieval world a good bit. I would recommend this course for someone who is looking for a low pressure history course that also involves a big literature component. If you don't want to reading translations of Norse sagas or hear about them, this class is not for you though.",
    "To be honest, this was kind of a hectic course. I wish it were more focused on the history of the Vikings and a little less on analyzing sagas to extrapolate what that history might be. I didn't feel like I learned that much about the Vikings and what I did came in the form of scattered facts, many of which were interesting, but lacked a cohesive narrative. Having gone to every lecture, I later found out that the Normans were Scandinavians who settled there and later conquered England. Before, I assumed they were Franks or some other French tribe. I was horrified when I realized that we were never taught that and other things like it. All this said, Prof. Winroth was quirky and funny as a lecturer, so I usually enjoyed lectures. The final exam was really stupid. Quote identifications should never be the way to go for history since it just forces you to memorize authors and not really think about history. I happened to have a rockstar TF in Nazanin Sullivan. If she ever teaches again, definitely be in her section!"
