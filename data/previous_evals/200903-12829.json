    "This is a solid intro-level language class. You'll get through a lot of material relatively painlessly, and by the end, you'll actually be able to carry on a conversation in Italian. I certainly feel like I can. Iacovella's a very nice person and a good teacher, and I never felt intimidated by the language or by the prospect of speaking up in class.",
    "Italian is a beautiful language and 110 is a good, well-planned and -paced introduction. Professoressa Iacovella is a great teacher, very available and good at explaining the more difficult areas of the language. Italian is not a difficult language for English-speakers, but do not expect it to be a walk in the park, either. I would recommend it to anyone who really wants to learn about the language and Italian culture.",
    "AWESOME! She is always open and ready to answer questions. She reviews grammar in detail and has such a beautiful accent. She prepares us well for the exams and just is a lot of fun!",
    "Yes, nice alternative to spanish. Helps if you already know some italian, but still not too hard to learn. Get a good instructor, it will matter quite a lot.",
    "I would strongly recommend it. I had no previous italian knowledge and while I struggled more than some of the kids that did, it was not too hard.",
    "Yes , I did. The best class and the most beautiful language in the world !",
    "Yes, very easy if you keep up with the work. Fun class environment.",
    "Take Italian! The italian department is very caring and close, which is fun. They love Italian and it makes it infectious. Iacovella is great too! Take it! Down with Spanish!More work makes a better grade."
