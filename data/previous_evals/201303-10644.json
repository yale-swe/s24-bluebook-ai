   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend Britain's Empire. The workload is very reasonable, coming in at under 100 pages a week (mostly primary sources), with weekly reading responses and midterm\/paper\/final. Semmel is an interesting lecturer, and is good at tying diverse topics together. If you've ever had any interest in the British Empire or colonialism in general, it's a good class to take.",
    "A good class. Semmel makes British History interesting by posing it in many different lights throughout the semester. Your basic history class. I enjoyed it a lot. Lectures might be improved if Semmel went on less tangents but readings were relevant and section was good",
    "Great class, really interesting subject matter and readings. Lectures were good but did involve lots of note taking.",
    "A great class about British History - lectures are interesting and the material covers a wide range of topics, so if you dislike one week's theme, it changes over fast. Not too much reading, and only one term paper, a midterm, and a final.",
    "If all you are looking for is a history class that is not too difficult and gives you an overview of an important subject matter, take this class. Otherwise I would not recommend this class - lectures tend to be boring and don't really make any historical arguments, and you will find yourself frequently feeling extremely dissatisfied with the lectures. Also the paper is NOT a history paper (essentially summarizing arguments for 10 pages) and it is horribly boring to write. Overall a fairly easy class, but not a great one.",
    "I would recommend it because its essential to our understanding of American history too",
    "This is a fun, not particularly strenuous introduction to an incredibly fascinating subject. Lectures were always interesting, and the reading offered fascinating perspectives. They focused on primary sources rather than more academic postcolonial analyses and such (although we got some of both, to be sure). Semmel is a little disorganized in lecture, and you're going to walk out each day wondering what you just learned, but once you mull it over a little everything fits together nicely. Section was kind of a drag, but it might be better if they give them another TF and shrink sections. There are definitely more inspired history lectures, but take it if you have an extra slot!",
    "I would recommend this course if you want an overview of the British Empire, with particular emphasis on India and new school of historical approach. Should really have the option to count it as a ROW if you write your paper on the colonies. A lot on focus on the colonies themselves.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, take it.",
    "A fascinating class with an excellent professor! The class goes very briefly over colonization of the Americas but mostly deals with the Empire that followed the American Revolution, up through decolonization. The amount of reading was very reasonable, and the reading was valuable. Keep in mind that there is a reason it is \"Britain's Empire\" not \"The British Empire\" - there is a focus on the relationship between Britain and its Empire, how they affected each other, how Britons thought about their Empire. I was surprised at how interesting this aspect of the class was. You're still going to learn a lot about India, for instance, but you're going to learn much more about Britain than Kenya or Malaya or places like that.",
    "Britain's Empire is an engaging, well lectured course bathe subject is one of the most important you can study and Professor Semmel is a fantastic speaker. There is too much reading in the second half of the course. The heavy load takes away from the class as time goes on. But I'd still absolutely recommend the class.",
    "A survey course of the British Empire that introduces students in an in-depth, historically-rooted way to the links between gender and race in imperialism. It will help you understand the world you live in today, and it will be fun. Definitely take it.",
    "I regret wasting one of my 36 credits on this class. The syllabus teases you in but the course is a dud. The readings and lecture material is obvious and absolutely no perspective is gained. The course is mostly just Semmel mumbling about how broad and immense the \"Empire\" was.",
    "A great survey course. I took it because I wanted to take one history course that would cover as much relevant material as possible, and it definitely fit the bill.",
    "Having taken Professor Pincus' excellent class on the Origins of the British Empire the semester before, I thought this would be a natural progression. Unfortunately the material and style of teaching was totally different. It is more of a survey class, with no real historical argument, although the material is interesting, lecture could be made more stimulating with the wealth of information available on the topic",
    "I really enjoyed this course and Prof. Semmel's teaching! That being said, I wonder if I might have gotten far more out of the course material in a seminar structure by nature of how broad and far-reaching the history of the British Empire is.",
    "Lectures were very good if sometimes disjointed, section was generally well run, and the workload was fair. The material is fascinating and you get to engage with some great primary and secondary sources. I would recommend it.",
    "A good class. Grades are a little random and the lectures can feel slightly disorganized, but you will leave knowing a considerable amount about the Empire.",
    "Good history course, probably more worthwhile if you're particularly interested in Britain.",
    "Yes, I would. The course helps you begin to appreciate, if not during the semester but later on as the information you learnt simmers in your head, the number of ways in which the empire shapes things today. The readings do get longer as the semester goes on.",
    "Other than Professor Semmel's interpretation and analysis of the imperial themes present in Skyfall, I took very little from this class. It's unfortunate because I thought this class would offer a more comprehensive look at the British empire but often lectures just fell short of delivering any concise idea. I wouldn't recommend this class, especially not to advanced history majors as is just was not up to par to other history courses at Yale."
