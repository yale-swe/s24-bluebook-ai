    "yeah, highly recommended. a very good course to learn the practical aspects of biophysics",

    "It is a good class and a must-take for a biochemist\/biophysicist. It is not easy, but it is not too hard either.",
    "recommend.",
    "This course would be very helpful for biochemical\/biophysics students and demands firm foundation in biophsyics. Its helpfulness would be limited for students who study mainly biology."
