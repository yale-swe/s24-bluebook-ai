    "I would recommend it overall. See summary in question 1, but I think it's worth taking if you like watching and analyzing excellent films. But your enjoyment\/participation in the class will no doubt be determined by the other people in it, so--beware, as always.",
    "The course is a lot of fun, with absolutely wonderful movies. Professors Grimstad and Trachtenberg have amazing perspective on the movies and push you to think about it in new ways. Because it's a senior seminar, people can have strong opinions, which aren't necessarily always so grounded in the material. But that's true of most classes. Especially for English or literature majors, this class is a great way to start thinking critically about film.",
    "A really fun course on really interesting material with a great professor. Take it.",
    "Amazing class. take it with Grimstad\u2014you will learn a ton about these films, and more than that, how to think about interpretation.",
    "The Private Eye is a wonderful introduction to film noir, taught by incredibly capable and impressive professors. Whether or not you think you like film noir (which you certainly will by the end of the course), the quality of discussion alone makes this seminar absolutely worthwhile.",
    "This is a fun class, not very rigorous, so take it as a fifth. You watch a movie once a week, discuss it, and give a presentation. No reading responses. A final paper, and a short two page paper mid-semester. I'd take it if you like film noir. Grimstad is a great guy to get to know before you leave Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. I was exposed to materials that I had never examined in any other course, which was a pleasure. I learned about the history of hollywood a bit, and as a non film major, enjoyed the experience of taking my first film class without the added pressure of not understanding film-lingo. As a senior English major who needed something a bit different to complete the senior seminar requirement, I felt as though I'd won the jackpot with this class."
