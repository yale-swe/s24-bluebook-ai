    "The weekly reading and response papers result in a heavy workload, but also ensure that you engage with the material every week. I did not enjoy writing the papers, but I would have been much less prepared for discussion every week and gotten much less out of the class had I not done them.",
    "I took the class partly because I was interesting in the topic but also partly to fill a bin. This wasn't the topic of my Master thesis.",
    "Amity and Lauren did a great job in running this course. It was an extremely valuable part of my experience this year. They both have a great knowledge of EJ issues, is different areas, and they were both very helpful. The lectures were good, but even better were the readings. I think Amity did a great job in selecting readings that were relevant to the different areas of EJ. The weekly reading responses were actually pretty valuable, as they gave me a chance to express my thoughts in writing, instead of stressing about saying all my points in the discussions. I really liked reading everyone's responses, but I'm not sure that everyone else often read others' responses.",
    "Qu 4: the weekly reading responses interfered with my ability to balance readings (or alternate priorities) with required readings in other classes.",

    "The lectures and discussion.",
    "It provides an amazing insight into the social aspects of environmental issues and it's a class that really has no other equivalent in the curriculum. The discussions allowed everyone to share their different backgrounds and points of view and made the classes a very enjoyable and informative experience.",
    "I enjoyed the discussions that we had in class.",
    "Some of the readings were interesting.",
    "Overview of the history and current state of environmental justice debates.",
    "The final presentations were awesome. I loved getting to here about the passions and work done by other colleagues. I thought that the topics that used practical research were some of the best.",
    "It's relevance! The concepts&understanding is so critical.",

   "comments": [
    "Tie a little more some of the readings to the lectures. More discussion of case studies.",
    "The 2 hour discussion sections were way too long and got really slow at some points. 1.5 hrs of lecture and 1.5 of discussion would have been a better balance, or possibly at 2 hour seminar class.",
    "I wish we had had more readings from non-academic sources - from people actually waging environmental justice campaigns. The readings were basically an academic description of the EJ movement, rather than providing a tool-kit of how one might go about leading one...",
    "There were a lot of readings every week.",
    "It does not need improvement.",
    "The class should be structured better. I feel like more emphasis should be on the final papers then there was throughout the course.",
    "I felt the class ran out of material after spring break - by then I was already familiar with the EJ concepts and it felt like the last few topics were just filler providing more examples of EJ without enhancing my understanding of the topic. Despite having student discussion leaders, the 2-hr long discussions each class were too unstructured. I would leave each week wondering what I had actually gotten out of it. A field trip would have been nice, or more multimedia. Peer-reviewed literature provides only one facet of this rich topic.",
    "Better class structure. Having a longer lecture and more input from Professor Doolittle would be preferable to having a 2-hr long student led discussion. While we can learn from each other this was too long and I would have appreciated hearing more from Professor Doolittle's expertise.",
    "I think the reading and writing responses were a very large weekly commitment. I am hesitant to suggest paring it down, since they were valuable to class discussion. If there is a way to prioritize readings in, that may be helpful.",
    "The readings were a lot of theory. It would have been nice to see some things from people that were affected by environmental justice issues in their communities."

I was impressed with the thoroughness of her comments on my response papers. She clearly read each paper every week and took the time to comment on each person's ideas.",
    "Very good - the TA lead some really good discussions.",
    "They were both very approachable and helpful, and tried to be as available to us as possible.",
    "Both were available and helpful.",
    "Amity was great for meeting outside of class. Sometimes I would drop by and she would make time to chat with me. Despite her extremely busy schedule, she was responsive to conversation by email and after class.Lauren was an awesome TA. Although she can seem soft spoken at times, she is very knowledgeable about the subject. She really took time out to have discussions about the class, the course, the material and current events related to course work. She made time to meet with me personally on several occasions. I really appreciate all of the time that she took to make the course work relevant to me and also just sharing her mutual enthusiasm for learning.",

The 2 weeks you lead discussion and don't have to write the paper are the easiest. If you are interested in the class but have a lot of other work on your plate, this would be a great class to audit, though you probably won't get as much out of it.",
    "It's quite a bit of work but interesting.",
    "I would advise anyone at FES to take this class because it provides crucial knowledge about a very important field in environmental studies that we generally ignore, and the instructor is great at integrating different issues. Overall a great course that everyone should take.",
    "Start your final paper early.",
    "Readings are interesting, ask Professor Doolittle questions during lectures to hear more about her thoughts on EJ - in the international and national settings, as well as the conflicts in New Haven and within Yale and FES.",
    "Figure out what it is about environmental justice that is relevant and interesting to you and your professional focus.",
