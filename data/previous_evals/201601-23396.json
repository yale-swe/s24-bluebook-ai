    "I loved this class. It looked at topics that were first presented in BIS 540 in more depth. Its strengths are in its instructor and the excellent textbook. I can think of no real weaknesses, except that the final was worth 60% and we did not really know what to expect (no practice tests, etc.). However, it turned out to be very fair and similar to homework. Also, I do not think inviting the lecturer from Takeda was necessary. At the end of the day, I did not feel it was a good use of our time and I would have much rather had Dr. Peduzzi do another lecture. My suggestion is to make the Takeda talk optional, after gauging student interest. I feel like I learned a lot in the course.",
    "I really liked this course. I especially appreciated how professor Peduzzi integrated theory with real world applications.",
    "I learned a lot in this course and enjoyed the professor. The material was more clearly presented than in other \"biostats for clinical trials\" courses I've taken.",
    "Outstanding course and I would not recommend any changes.",
    "Really well-paced, interesting course that sought for depth in understanding, rather than rushing through the material. I actually feel like I learned the material we went over, unlike my other BIS courses. Perhaps would be better as a year-long course (i.e. offer part I and part II). Given the fact that \"case studies\" is in the title, I was hoping for more options for discussion\/small group work, but there were almost too many students for this to really have functioned well (and I don't think the classroom was set up for this).",
    "Course material is fantastic for anyone interested in the design, analysis, and conduct of clinical trials. It's actually very similar to the course offered in the fall, fundamentals of clinical trials, but much more structured... Could consider combining the courses...",
    "I felt this course really highlighted and expanded on the important aspects of clinical trials that were briefly introduced by Epi II. The amount of work in relation to how much information I feel like I've gained was very reasonable."

    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi was a very likeable and interesting lecturer who focused more on student understanding than on \"getting through\" material.The slides provided were excellent, as was the textbook. In addition, I appreciated that Dr. Peduzzi went over the homework with us to make sure we understood material. He made it a point to learn everyone's name, and was one of the best professors I have had. I would only suggest one improvement-- make use of the classesv2 system to upload grades and announcements about due dates, date of the exam, etc., especially since we changed the schedule so much.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Professor Peduzzi was great. I really appreciated how he didn't rush through the material but took his time and made sure we absorbed it. It helped me to get a lot more out of the class.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0I thought the instructor was well prepared and understanding.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi is an outstanding teacher. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience of working with clinical trials, which he graciously shares with future generations of students.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Absolutely fabulous. Really knowledgeable and approachable; teaching style\/pedagogy is a good fit for the course and for graduate level.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Wonderful instructor. Loves interacting with students. Smart, funny",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0He's a brilliant professor. Wrote an amazing book. Course is somewhat dry because it follows said book pretty closely. But the book is great, so I guess can't really complain.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0I really liked Peter's teaching style. He spent a lot of time making sure we understand the most relevant details and his slides were easy to follow and informative. I would have liked a little more feedback on our homework."

   "comments": [
    "This class expanded on topics of multicenter clinical trials, more concepts based (designs, types of tests, etc.) than numerical. It was a great course, I feel like I learned a lot, and I would definitely recommend taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course (I already have) to anyone who is considering working on clinical trials. It's a non-intimidating introduction.",
    "Outstanding course which provides a comprehensive and \"real life\" review of clinical trials and many of the intricacies in the design, conduct, regulation, and analysis.",
    "A \"must take\" if looking to do CTs in the future and a great option if you actually want to learn some of the applied BIS that you might have been introduced to in prior courses. Pete really makes the course what you want\/need it to be and is a great, clear instructor.",
    "Good class!",
    "Would recommend to anyone who is interested in design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials.",
    "This course gives a solid overview of the most important considerations in designing clinical trials."
