    "Take it only if you're in desperate need of an easy CS elective. It is probably the least work of any CS classes. There were only three C\/Fortran coding problem sets which altogether took less time than a single CS323 problem set! There are no exams and no other work besides the problems sets. I only went to lectures so that I could get a nice seat for my next class that met in the same room right after numerical. Do not take it if you don't want to throw away your credit or want to get something out of a class. The only positive thing about the class were the TAs who were super helpful for the problem sets since most students did not attend lectures and even those who did found it hard to follow them for more than 10 minutes.",
    "I would not.",
    "3 easy psets no finals. Easy CS credit.",
    "This is the strangest course I've ever taken, but I feel like I learned a lot from the problem sets.",
    "Rather disorganized class on a series of numerical methods, graded entirely on three problem sets that were reverse curved. Rokhlin is brilliant and the TA's clearly know what they're talking about, and the material was very interesting, but being a little less punitive against minor mistakes in code would make the class even better. I would definitely recommend it though to the quantitatively oriented student who has taken linear algebra.",
    "Easy class, don't have to go, only 3 assignments. But you won't learn much and Rohklin is insane.",
    "This is as close to a gut in CS electives as can be. You write some lines of C code to do numerical computations for each of the problem sets. There aren't that many problem sets in total. I definitely recommend taking this as a senior or as a supplement to fill out a heavy workload.",
    "This a class requiring very little of your time. You learn a few cool techniques in the homework assignments, but that's about it. If your goal is to maximize learning, you can skip on this class. If your goal is to maximize GPA with as little effort as possible, this could be an option for you.",
    "This class was very little work - only three programming assignments. I never went to class (as the problem sets did not relate to what was taught in class, and the professor is impossible to understand), so if you're looking for an easy CS class, take it. I don't think I learned very much even though Rokhlin is a genius. Also, he tells a lot of crazy stories.",
    "An extremely easy course with no midterm or final. There were just three psets that one could learn how to do online."
