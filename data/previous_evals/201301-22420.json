   "comments": [
    "Difficult.",
    "its a hard class material wise. if you're not strong in math take math 112 first to get a strong foundation.",
    "Math. Weekly homework, 2 midterms, 1 final exam.",
    "I would recommend this class to every Yalie since it is essential to get a basic understanding of calculus before one finishes his or her college career.",
    "If you can take this class with Miriam Logan, do it. She is the best. Just a really fantastic, kind, generous person and teacher. The class was still very difficult, but Miriam is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale.",
    "Take this class if you like math or have to. Otherwise, it's a pretty hard class.",
    "It's tough to keep up if you're coming from having only done AB and you're a slow learner like me. If you have the opportunity to take it with Miriam Logan, do it because she is the most helpful teacher I have had here at Yale so far. Workload is manageable in terms of size but the material gets pretty challenging at times.",
    "Don't take it. Its like calculus BC on steroids.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to! It is not structured like an introductory math course at all. Most of the department isn't very good at teaching the material either. The best TF just left this semester so good luck with that.",
    "Math 115 is a challenging yet manageable course. I would recommend it to another student if that student needed it for advancement in their major or program.",
    "it's a good math class. you learn a lot. i recommend taking 112 beforehand as a refresher if you haven't taken math in a while.",
    "Math 115 is everything you think a calculus class would be. Take it if you need a calculus base for other majors or if you just like math.",
    "Take it if integral calculus (and other such things) interest you. The exams (two midterms and one final) and problem sets (weekly, sometimes twice a week) are all fair, but the material is pretty challenging. Also, be sure to choose a good instructor! My experience with Miriam Logan was wonderful \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she made the class manageable and interesting. The challenges of Math 115, while very much there, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem unfair - because of her fantastic teaching. She is able to teach the complex material with immense ease, and is incredibly accommodating and devoted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 making countless worksheets, quizzes, and review sheets, and holding office hours in accordance with her students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs. I loved this class, and I would recommend that you take it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and take it with Miriam if you can!",
    "Solid introduction to integrals and series. Miriam is the best.",
    "It was very well organized and really helped me understand the concepts taught fully which will definitely help me in the future. I took IB Math HL however, I had not learned the second half of it very well like series and this class definitely helped me understand and review these concepts fully.Miriam is THE BEST MATH TEACHER EVER. She is so incredibly helpful and sweet and just everything you would want in one human being. I came into this class right before the drop deadline from a higher math class and she let me in her class and gave me time to catch up and prepare before making up the first exam. She helped me a lot over spring break and quickly responded to my emails with math questions by either giving me a hint or scanning a page with her own solutions to it to give me a good sense of what I wasn't understanding. She is just amazing.",
    "Math 115 is a class you should take only by necessity. for a major, or for a departmental program requirement, etc. Not a fun class by any means, its hard!",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "I would recommend this class if it's required for you or if you want to learn more calculus. It's pretty much exactly what you would expect.",
    "If you really want to take it or if it's required for your major then go ahead, but the subject matter isn't anything special.",
    "It is an intense continuation of Math 112 however doable!",
    "Miriam is a fantastic teacher and I would highly recommend if possible to take this course with her.",
    "Hard."
