    "Take it if you want an social\/cultural anthropological approach to understanding Iran. This is not a political science or foreign policy class, but you will come away with a good understanding of life in Iran during the 20th century. Lots of interesting material that will change your perspective on Iran.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you want to get some exposure to the discourse on modern Iran.",
    "How Iran is represented in culture--cinema, literature, media, politics, etc. Really interesting. take it!",
    "Highly recommend. Class was a great way to look at a highly politicized subject from a different lens",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class. Its been my favorite class at yale so far. It gives an extremely detailed insight into Iranian life and people from present day politics, to culture and history through film and literature. Professor Erami is SO nice and the workload is really not that bad if you can manage to stay on top of your readings.",
    "Representing Iran is a great way to get a broad picture of modern Iran, incorporating many different personal, ideological, and methodological perspectives. Those with more focused interests, or those unused to some of the theoretical approaches of anthropology, might occasionally get frustrated with certain aspects of the class, but those prepared for or interested in such angles will get a lot from the course. Be prepared to discuss in class, though - otherwise the seminar can drag a bit!"
