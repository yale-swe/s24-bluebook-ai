   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn to conduct original research, go for it! The readings and projects reflect scholarship without dense theory but require a high level of creativity, intuition, and imagination.",
    "A class where you do 3 projects. You choose a public behavior to study (and you can literally choose anything) and then conduct an experiment. This is the only thing you do. They are extremely time consuming. I would not take this class again.",
    "visual sociology class -- really interesting topics. prof Smith and Jin Su were great and fun. The assignments are research study based, which is fun but can also sometimes make you feel like your grasping for nothing and faking results",
    "Take it, it's interesting!",
    "A very interesting and fun seminar that explores different aspects of behavioral and visual sociology. Workload became a little rushed toward end of semester, but overall a great course and the projects allow you to explore aspects of reading you like in detail. Two-professor system was great.",
    "I found this class towards the very end of shopping period and was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The topics were fascinating and we had a lot of personal freedom with how we approached each paper, since the prompts were pretty vague and you were really able to explore something that interested you. The readings ranged in level of interest\/relevance to the class but I thought our class discussions always helped break them down and relate them to our focus of the week. The seminar could definitely use some more structure but I think that will probably come with time, as this was the first time it was taught. Overall, I'm glad I took this class-- it wasn't too too much work and I now pick up on a lot of interesting stuff in social settings that I wouldn't have noticed before!"
