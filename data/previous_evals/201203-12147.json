    "It's senior research, and you gotta do it. Plan ahead.",
    "It's worth taking if you're going to spend a lot of time conducting your own original research.",
    "I would definitely recommend doing EEB475 for anyone who's serious about research. You don't have to wait until senior year to do it - I think that it's better to learn what research is really like earlier than later. But make sure you are invested in it and have thought about some ideas independently beforehand, if you want to get the most out of it. If not, wait until senior year.",
    "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 475 was a very good course. You pick a lab that you are interested in and then proceed to write a proposal, conduct your research, and finally write a final paper. It is extremely good practice for a future in science due to the writing and research experience one collects. In addition, the techniques learned in lab are often spoken about theoretically in courses. The synergy between theory and practice helps to solidify the concepts.Take it if you have any plans to go into a scientific field.",
    "Research.",
    "Take it if you want to do research. Make sure you have a good adviser and that you work on your project consistently throughout the semester."
