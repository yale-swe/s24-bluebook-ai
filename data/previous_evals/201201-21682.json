   "comments": [
    "professor sharma is reason enough to take this class. also you read a lot of great books. definitely be prepared to do a lot of reading but work is spread throughout the semester so its very manageable",
    "Vivek is brilliant, entertaining, and knows how to lead discussion while still being relatable to his students. I would without a doubt take any other class he teaches, and would encourage fellow students to do likewise. His teaching style is excellent; my retention rate of material will probably exceed any class I have taken at Yale thus far in terms of long-term learning. There is a substantially large amount of reading, but if you like reading to learn and discuss, this class is excellent. It mainly covers history of warfare throughout time; if you take the class, you should (or will learn to) enjoy military history.",
    "Great class, would definitely take it.",
    "Anyone interested in military history and balance of power theory should consider Sharma's class. This course was extraordinary and I would recommend it to ANYONE.",
    "It is very dry material, unless you are really interested in the subject matter. It was not the course for me, but if you are really interested in learning about war and society (especially in ancient societies) then I would take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend War and Society for a fellow student. Professor Sharma is great and makes the class very interesting, both in discussion and by choosing an intriguing selection of books. Reading a book a week was a decent amount of work, but also rewarding and fun. Plan ahead about how much work you have in other times in the semester to make sure you can do the reading.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who are not satisfied by quantitative approaches to political science, or regression analyses of the variables that lead to war. The course does not seek to explain the emergence of all wars, ever, but rather, actually points out some of what we, as humans, cannot understand, and as such is a bit less \"heady\" than your typical political science course."
