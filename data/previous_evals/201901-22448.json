    "Basic knowledge about the photochemistry and electric chemical, nanomaterials",

    "Electrochemistry, photoelectrochemistry, photovoltaics, nanotechnologies",
    "Learned a lot about electronic structures, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis.",
    "I gained great amounts of knowledge on the fundamentals of electrochemistry, fuel cells, photovoltaics, semiconductors, and other nanotechnology.",

    "I think that Prof. Hu is a very knowledgeable lecturer and gave lectures that were decently clear and engaging. I think he was a little disorganized on the course assignments, not giving very clear feedback and prescribing homework on top of essays instead of spreading them out -- but on the other hand, he was very understanding with deadlines, so it evened out. I think Prof. Hu should spend a little more time on fundamentals and should definitely give a little more attention to sign conventions. The course covers a number of sub-fields, each of which has its own conventions. They tended to bleed together a little in lecture.",
    "The strength is that many topics are covered but the weakness is that the course is a little hard to catch everything up.",
    "This course gave a well-organized introduction about the photochemistry and new energy especially the solar cell.",
    "The strength is that professor hu knows these fields very well. The weakness is that it covers materials too fast",
    "This course was very well organized. The contents were highly relevant and helpful.",
    "It went a bit too fast and could be hard to follow. Going slower, through fewer topics, and having more review would be extremely helpful. Also, more homework would be helpful for learning how to use the material.",
    "The course was well structured and covered each topic thoroughly and at a good pace. The course could be improved by having more on-board examples and derivations.",
    "Strengths include thorough presentation of class material, as well as good flow. A lot of material on some of the electronic processes involved in photochemical methods, semiconductors, electrochemical cells, and energy evaluation methods. No significant weaknesses, just sometimes a lot of material all at once"

    "It's a decently good course. I learned a lot. It could be taught more clearly. As a teacher, Prof. Hu was quite fair but disorganized.",
    "Yes! Necessary for chemical engineering student who wants to work with battery,PEC,nanomaterials",
    "Yes. I learned a lot of useful knowledge and got great instruction for my experiments.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. The contents are highly optimized and organized and very useful.",
    "Yes if it's applicable to your research somehow.",
    "Yes, it will provide great background for nanotechnology and electrochemistry if relevant to your research.",
    "Yes, Shu is really passionate on the subject and you will learn a lot. There are a lot of supplemental sources with the class that he helps with for further information (especially for background concepts)"
