    "It's directed research, so it is what you make it. Mine was incredible!",
    "Directed Research is a fantastic opportunity that provides the structure to begin hands-on research in Cognitive Science. Definitely enroll in the course if you are starting research for the first time with a Yale professor!",
    "Directed research on a team regarding a topic you are personally interested.",
    "If you are seriously considering graduate school in cognitive science, there is no better preparation than this course. Good things to have are an independent drive and *genuine* interest in the subject. Research can be all-consuming, but if it's your passion, then this course could be the most rewarding you take.",
    "Definitely do research for credit if your senior project involves empirical work. It's work that you would have to do for your thesis anyway, so might as well get credit for it. I wrote a literature review for my directed research project, but this was incorporated to my thesis. So it's really no extra work."
