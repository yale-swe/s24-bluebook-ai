    "Prof Cividanes teaches v well and is v kind and generous",
    "I would recommend L4 to another student. It's a lot of work, but structured well and Cividanes is a very clear instructor. Plus, I made a friend out of the presentations and speaking activities. Finally, if you take this course and find you don't like the book, Las batallas en el desierto, learn to like it.",
    "SPAN 140 is a great course if you feel somewhat comfortable in written and conversational Spanish but need to continue working on grammar and fluency. The class is not hugely demanding, but meeting daily and having regular homework assignments means you make a lot of progress over the course of the semester. If you're interested in making progress in your Spanish, I would definitely recommend taking the course with Professor Cividanes. She's engaging, effective, and enthusiastic. She supports students who are far from fluency, engages students with already strong language skills, and focuses her attention on developing language skills that you'll actually implement in the Spanish-speaking world.",
    "A difficult but very worthwhile conclusion to the normal Spanish classes. Really good at developing your grammatical, listening, and speaking abilities in a small class setting. Workload is not really made up of huge papers but tends to be fairly constant through the semester, and daily class is always difficult to deal with although it is important for learning the language. Overall I wouldn't recommend the class if you're not all that interested in improving your Spanish, but if you need to take it for distributional requirements or have a strong desire to get better at speaking and understanding the language Spanish 140 will definitely help you a lot. While you might not enjoy the work, you will definitely enjoy the class environment and experience.",
    "Standard L4 Spanish class. Take it if it is a requirement.",
    "I would say to another student that if you're interested in Spanish and are at the L4 level, then you should certainly take it. It might drag a bit in the first quarter, but overall it is certainly an enjoyable class and, if you invest yourself in it, will help you improve your Spanish speaking comprehension, and writing greatly.",
    "L4 Spanish is a good language class. There is not a lot of work - I could usually finish a weeks worth of homework in about an hour. The material itself is interesting and it is fun to be in a class where you actually have the ability to carry out conversations with other students in class.",
    "Continue with this class if you want to improve your fluency (especially if you don't plan to study abroad, though I also recommend studying abroad)!"
