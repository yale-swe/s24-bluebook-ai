   "comments": [
    "I learned how to separate chemicals by filtration and distillation, and I learned how to identify chemicals based on TLC and IR, as well as how to analyze MP. I gained experience in the synthesis of liquid and solid products as well.",
    "How to run proper organic chemistry reactions",
    "Honestly I feel competent and capable in an organic chemistry lab now. Dr. DiMeglio is so much more iconic than Dr. G it's sad. I'm generally not a fan of labs (because of Gen Chem Lab) but honestly I went from being ambivalent about 222L to looking forward to it each week. It was so casual, and Dr. DiMeglio is so encouraging that I came out of this class actually understanding topics and lab techniques.",
    "This course helped me to cement techniques I'd first encountered in CHEM 134L\/136L, and also exposed me to new techniques and chemical processes. I developed a newfound comfort with many lab techniques, as well as a stronger sense of intuition regarding the mechanisms of certain chemical processes. I've applied some of this intuition to other classes and lab experiences, and I feel like a better lab scientist after taking this course.",
    "about as much I could've learned by myself in ten hours",
    "I got a very good insight into the laboratory processes and techniques used in organic chemistry.",
    "I gained exposure to synthetic chemistry labs and learned how to work with acids, bases and organic compounds in a more advanced fashion.",
    "This is a great introductory lab course. You learn the fundamentals in chemistry lab techniques.",
    "Learned a lot about different techniques to separate and synthesize organic substances.",
    "Principles of purification including recrystallization, distillation, filtration etc. Practiced some of the reactions learned in class.",
    "Basic skills of chemistry lab."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The labs were very easy and manageable as long as a sufficiently comprehensive EP was prepared beforehand. The TA for the course was helpful in explaining theoretical concepts and in helping with the lab techniques. The independence students have in running the experiments can be stressful at times, but overall it helped me gain confidence in my work in a lab.",
    "weakness = arbitrary grading, becomes a points game, long standing hours *It would help to reduce the emphasis on grades. It is so easy to lose points in assignments for this course. strengths = good instructors, helpful staff, good\/fun environment",
    "This was an all around good class, and could potentially be improved by letting us work in partners for more than ~1 lab. I understand the reason for making us work individually, but even when we worked with partners, we did equally the amount of work and wanted to understand the theory behind the lab as much as we would if we were working individually.",
    "This course is mountains better than general chemistry lab and there was a much more relaxed atmosphere. I generally wouldn't change anything, the assignments and the procedures had plenty of support and guidance and I never felt overwhelmed or unsure of what I was doing. The only weakness was the one day we had to do two labs in the one sitting due to the snow week, that was pretty disorganized and confusing, but I understand that it was necessary.",
    "The course is very accommodating and does a good job of instilling various topics crucial to work as a chemist.",
    "Least annoying lab Ive taken at Yale. Weird rules to get used to at first, but then its fine. Its nice that there were only 2 lenghtier lab reports unlike other lab classes!",
    "I loved this class!! It was really fun to learn about the material in lecture and then see it on the bench. The final could have been better in matching the rest of the course in difficulty. (The final was absurdly difficult in comparison)",
    "Provide an answer key to the exam questions at the end of each experiment. That may make the course not require enough work from the student, though.",
    "Well organized. TA is chill. Best delivery of this content possible.",
    "Reasonable amount of work for .5 credit class. The class environment is very positive and relaxed. I learned a ton! I wish that an emphasis on theoretical understanding of what we were doing throughout the class and not just during the final. Before then, it felt like cookbook chemistry but it all really came together in the end Sometimes the grading was nit picky and took points off for very specific structural things"

    "You should take this course if you want to learn some essential lab skills in a relatively stress-free environment.",

    "nope",
    "Yes! I mean, anyone who is a Chem\/Chem Eng\/Bio\/Pre-med major will have to, but it is certainly not an unpleasant course, especially if you suffered through a year of gen chem.",
    "I would indeed. The course is great for anyone that might consider scientific research in the future.",
    "Take it if you need to but no need to stress about it, unlike labs like gen chem lab",
    "I would absolutely recommend. This is best when taken with the second half of organic chemistry (221).",
    "Definitely, if you want to learn different techniques used in a chemistry lab. This is a very good introductory course for it.",
    "Take if you're premed.",
    "Yes, best lab there is."
