    "How to analyze papers",
    "Learned about the experimental design and logic behind some of molecular biology's most fundamental discoveries. Also improved my ability to critically understand literature and engage in productive discussion each week.",
    "Learned to read & critique primary literature.",
    "At the broadest level, this class taught me about the history of molecular biology and the cross-talk between methods and logic. Sure, we also read 20+ landmark papers, studied important techniques in mol bio, and learned the difference between density and velocity centrifugation; but I think what will really stick with me is the history and the importance of the overlap between methods and logic. It's vital, when reading a paper and trying to understand their logic, to understand their methods. What is being purified, what conditions are being used, what technology do the researchers have available to them, how do they work around their constraints, etc. If the logic involves in-vitro selection, what is the method that allows them to achieve that? If the method is radiolabeling, what types of biological logical inference can you do with that seemingly-simple method? I feel like I can read a biology paper and, instead of being intimidated by the methods and results sections, read through the entire paper and understand how the different parts are working together."

   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot of old papers but not any new ones",
    "Great course that uses a lot of the knowledge that you learn from 301 and applies it to understanding landmark papers in molecular biology. You also get to interact with incredible faculty who are all enthusiastic about the course and love to work with the students both in discussion or outside of class - rare opportunity to say the least.",
    "Strengths: selection of papers, variety & interest of professors. Weaknesses: it sort of felt like instead of explaining good strategies to read a paper we were just told to \"discuss it on our own on Tuesday\" and then on Thursday we had a graded discussion that sometimes included aspects of the paper we hadn't known to cover on our own. For that and for the research proposal, it would've been nice to have more examples up front.",
    "This course was at its best when the students in the class read the two papers thoroughly before each class, and when the professors led the discussion in a decently ordered way. Students meet alone on Tuesdays to discuss the papers, and these sessions sometimes suffered during heavy midterm season. But for the first ~six weeks, and in later weeks where the majority of us read the papers well, Tuesdays were a lot of fun. It's nice to have two hours to spend on minutiae of controls, methods, and conclusions, all of which and more are often squeezed into a thirty-minute discussion section in a larger class. On Thursdays, the class operated best, for me, when professors struck a balance between leading a discussion, asking questions, and discussing our questions with us. We almost always had lingering questions from Tuesday, and often those questions would take 15 minutes of discussion to resolve. The professors often had a few questions prepared to ask us, not to purposely stump us, but to push our understanding further eg \"Why this type of column, why these salt conditions, where did this extract come from,\" etc. It was also fun to hear the history of the field from the professors. Occasionally, in weeks with papers that were lighter on methods and\/or logic, we sort of would run out of things to discuss. If the professors know that a certain paper coming up is on the shorter side, it might be good to have specific \"further questions \/ discussion topics\" prepared for when the class exhausts the two figures and half a page of results (for example the yeast two-hybrid paper). Final project, a chalk-talk, was fun and good experience."

    "Yes! Great class!",
    "Absolutely would recommend to any MB&B major. The paper at the end of the course really challenges you to reflect on the experimental logic presented throughout the semester and by the end of it all, you will feel like you have learned so much.",
    "If you're looking for an MBB elective, go for it! 2 papers a week of reading (not so bad), heavy class participation grades, and a research proposal paper-and-presentation-combo for a final project. Everyone kind of bonds because of the weird timing, and the professors really seem to enjoy themselves. You get lots of namedropping and science-is-a-small-world anecdotes. If you're new to reading primary literature, it might be a little intimidating because both the profs and some of the students seem really good at understanding the papers and how they're good & where their flaws are. The final project is less chill than it sounds (make your presentation really good bc the profs ask some critical questions!!), but still doable and less work than a core MBB class like biochem.",
    "Absolutely take this course if: -you're into molecular biology or biochemistry. -you want to learn about the history of mol bio research. -you hate it when you're intimidated by methods and\/or results sections of high-level scientific papers. Trust me, after 22 landmark papers, you won't be :) -you want to have small weekly discussion sections with professors! Don't take this course if: -you're not willing to read two lengthy papers, each at least twice, before class (but no psets, so hour\/week-wise it's not so bad) -you want to study modern methods really in-depth (This class generally stays in the 20th century with one or two exceptions. If you want modern, consider taking the lab class, or a comp bio class, or just wait until grad school)."
