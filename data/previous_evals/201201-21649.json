    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it, though the class is entirely dependent on who the professor is. Joan's class was great, a pretty easy credit, and a lot of fun.",
    "Do take it! So much better than 210. 210 has no real curriculum but 211 lets you do real scene work and is a very practical acting class. Joan is really a great teacher in this class. She wasn't given much to work with in 210 but here, in her own element, she is so helpful. She gives a real pure acting perspective and is super attune to your personal needs. If you tell her you are looking to improve in an area she really will try to focus in on that and help you. If you were disappointed by 210, this class will be a wonderful change that actually helps you learn acting on the practical level. This is one of the few classes that lets you do that.",
    "Very dependent on the Professor. Joan Macintosh is wonderful and great and she will push you. There is no work besides scene work. Sometimes the class feels slow, but in general it is fun and engaging.",
    "Yes. Much better than 210.",
    "If you're looking for an incredibly in-depth acting class, I'm not sure this is the best one. You will definitely be given scenes in which you must make choices and that might be outside your comfort zone, but you can only work them so much in class due to time restrictions. It's a good class, and the community is excellent, but it's not a must-take.",
    "We did monologue and scenework, learning to work alone and in groups to complete detailed character work. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if he or she has not decided to pursue acting. It has been a wonderful learning experience and given me the opportunity to work on scenes from several different periods with different scene partners while learning from Joan's feedback and being pushed to challenge myself. Definitely take it."
