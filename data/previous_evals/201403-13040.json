    "This is a fantastic course that builds on HLTH 230. Whereas 230 focuses mostly on providing a basis for understanding the global health architecture, 330 assumes the student has that knowledge and instead focuses on specific cases (i.e. polio, malaria, etc.), countries, and current global health problems. The course moves from a more historical component where you focus on disease campaigns, to a component on health systems, and finally to a component on health disparities. You will present in class at least twice, which is very valuable for students who haven't had opportunities to hone their public speaking skills. Additionally, the last third of the class is structured as group presentations, so you very quickly will learn how to make a point concisely and with a time constraint. Overall, a truly incredible course for anyone interested in global health, but one that you must come into ready to work because it is difficult to get through without doing the readings. Your grade is comprised of three policy briefs and in-class participation -- no midterm or final. This past semester Professor Skolnik selected students for the seminar based on seniority, which I think he will probably continue doing in the future.",
    "read materials about disease eradication \/ health systems \/ equality and then synthesize them into policy recommendations",
    "HLTH 330 is the in-depth follow up to HLTH 230 and uses the basic framework established in 230 to study eradication campaigns, health system reform, and health equity. If you are interested in global health, and are willing to put in the work to do all the readings, then you will get a lot out of this class. Be ready to think on your feet because there are a lot of presentations that you have 30 minutes to prepare for in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! Three units: disease control\/eradication, health systems, and health equity. All critical pillars of global health, and the main control knobs that must be turned to improve health in the world. Each session is different, and there is a large emphasis on presentation and writing skills. That way you learn not just facts and a way of thinking\/analyzing data, but also skills for presenting these analyses. TAKE IT you will learn so much!",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in global health. One of the most helpful parts was the requirement to make presentations about a certain country or disease. It helped with my public speaking skills and made me learn a lot about a certain topic. Professor Skolnik is very knowledgable. I learned a lot about diseases, health systems, and health equity. I also learned a little more about how the world works and how we can actually get things done.",
    "Yes. I learned so much",
    "Really great class. Unlike HLTH 230, this is a discussion-based seminar that digs deeper into each of the issues included. It's divided into three units: eradication and control of infectious disease, health systems, and health inequity. The first two units were great, while the third was pretty repetitive. There's a lot of reading, but it's most essential in the first unit, and pretty useless in the third. 3 policy briefs, a couple presentations, no exam. There is a large emphasis on speaking, with students giving formal, planned presentations and more impromptu, but still formal presentations in class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. The class equips you with frameworks to consider the three major topics of the class: infectious diseases (control, elimination, and elimination efforts), health system reform, and health equity issues in developing countries. The class will also help you grow in your public speaking and presentations skills. The readings for each class are interesting but sometimes did not cover much of the information that you needed for class discussions so be be prepared to conduct extensive outside research is required to be sufficiently prepared.",
    "This is definitely a good class to take after the intro global health class. However it is what you put in it -- if you do all the readings and participate in class and think actively about the class, then you will learn something from it. I thought the first module on epidemics was very rewarding, but did not feel the same about health systems or inequity module. The bare minimum work is pretty minimal - 3 policy briefs, no finals or midterms that are graded a little harder than the intro class. However to get the most out of the class you have to do the reading. Be aware of who is in the class as well, it's easy to be overshadowed.",
    "An absolute highlight of my time at Yale, and of my global health coursework here. Professor Skolnik is an enormous asset to the global health program and cares more about his students than almost any other professor. I am extremely lucky to have been one of the 18 students chosen for this class. Professor Skolnik taught me how to think clearly, write linearly, and present with confidence -- skills that you will need for the rest of your life. I would compare this course favorably with its introductory lecture counterpart HLTH 230. Even though the lecture was a superb class, this seminar is an even more in-depth, intimate, and thought-provoking course. Overall beyond highly recommended. It is one of, if not THE cornerstone of global health education for Yale undergraduates.",
    "This class presents a thorough and informative introduction to three issues: the unfinished agenda in global health (namely, the remaining burden of communicable diseases), health system reform, and health disparities and inequities. The class is well taught, and provides a useful glance at multiple diseases, health systems, and inequities. The curriculum moves fast, so much so that it can be difficult to fully absorb the material. The readings, certainly, are impossible to keep up with, and are often not particularly helpful without a guide or an overview to accompany them. The assignments are very helpful: they will hone your research, writing, and presentation skills. If you are interested in global health, take this course.",
    "Skolnik is a global health guru. This seminar is effective, but you must be engaged.Be prepared for every session or else you're going to feel very uncomfortable\/anxious that you will get called on and have no answer."
