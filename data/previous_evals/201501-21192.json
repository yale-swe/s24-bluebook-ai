    "A very nice course that is really helpful to your qualifying exams and research.",
    "Highly recommend the course - the most valuable class I've taken so far.",
    "The course is a good overview of techniques and limitations for studying macro interactions, both in isolation and in networks. Most of the class is spent on the individual interactions, and very little is spent on learning about networks and what useful information can be gleaned from it.",
    "Worth taking for the perspective rather than information gained. The course teaches you how to approach data rather than teach you the data.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, I think it was extremely relevant and useful."
