If due dates were organized by week rather than day, students would be afforded more flexibility in completing the same amount of homework but being able to fit it into their schedules."

My main complaint is that the workload, while not huge, is very regularly structured (something substantial due most weeknights) which resulted in a lot of late assignments and a lot of late nights on evenings when I had other commitments and planned to do other work on other nights. Overall, great course!"
