   "comments": [
    "Great class about Latin American travelers in literature. The stories picked for the class are engaging and interesting, and the work load isn't too high if you read the stories. Overall a great L5 class!",
    "Take this course.",
    "This was an awesome course! I definitely recommend it to another student. It was basically just a literature course (but in Spanish, of course) --- all you have to do is read! All of the short stories and novels were great reads and the paper at the end wasn't too bad (as long as you get started on it early).",
    "Travelers in Latin American Fiction was a hard, but rewarding class. I would only recommend it if you are extremely comfortable with doing a lot of reading and writing in Spanish. (For example, reading a 400-page novel in 2 weeks and writing a 15 to 20 page final essay.)",
    "Yes if you are looking for an interesting L5 spanish class that is manageable and interesting this is the course for you!",
    "SPAN 351 is an incredible class and I would recommend it to any student interested in learning more about Latin American literature, specifically having to do with travel. It is a great way to hone reading, writing, and speaking skills. And Professor Gonzales is the absolute best!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone in the Spanish major, or anyone looking for an upper level Spanish course.",
    "Great course. Explores a lot of important themes that relate to what seems like a very specific topic (travelers in Latin American fiction) in a really engaging way. I learned a lot and had the opportunity to read a lot of interesting texts and short stories that I wouldn't have read otherwise. Professor Gonzlez really cares to help out in whatever way he can and his lectures were really engaging and helpful to understanding the stories. It's a small class but run like a lecture mostly. Not too much work until the 15 page paper at the end."
