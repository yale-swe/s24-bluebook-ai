    "Question 6:The pace of the course seemed very fast at the beginning of the class because we had many assignments due, everytime we came to class; These made the class fun because then we got to see what all of our classmates were thinking....but were tricky to time. We always felt rushed after we had spent alot of time preparing for assignments as we would need an extra hour to and hour and a half after each class to really go through everything we were supposed to that day...."

    "the instructor's great insight into and direct experience with the subject matter",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "the scheduling and timing of the classroom sessions - we often ran out of time to cover everything. Might be good to add in a field trip or two",
    "I struggle with the very theoretical nature of the readings. Also, the design experiment is important, but I'm not sure the entire class should revolve around this concept. I think there are many other ways to explore ecological urbanism and the design experiment is only one.",
    "I really appreciated the enthusiasm that went into designing this course. However, I felt like the course was trying to cover too much ground in not enough time-- I wish that instead of rushing through every class period until the very end, the activities that we were required to participate in (esp student presentations) had been better managed time-wise. Furthermore, I felt like a lot of the required assignments for the course were unnecessary. The last group project was the essential part of the class, yet it was postponed until the very end of the course-- I felt rushed to complete it and also felt like I didn't gain very much from it because it ended up being a matter of just trying to get it done. Since the purpose of this class is to develop an interdisciplinary discussion between architecture and forestry students, it would be better to briefly introduce the concepts of experimentation at the very beginning of the course-- then dive right into the designed experiment, at the beginning of the semester when the architecture students aren't as consumed with studio.Finally, I really appreciated the fact that Alex brought in a lot of guest speakers to try and create a rich discussion. However, i felt like a lot of these guests gave fairly superficial lectures on their subject matter... i.e. I had heard Karen Seto's lecture twice before... and I felt like Marian Chertow could have maybe stepped it up in terms of the depth of material covered...Overall, I really appreciated the thought that went into the course, but I think in the future it needs to be tailored to be more focused on designed experiments and not try to start from the overarching view of architecture and its relationship to the environment.",
    "Slightly better organization of class time so that we get through everything we need to... although many of the conversations that we had were totally worth the time delay!",
    "Following my answer from question 12: unfortunately because we had sooooo many little presentations every day, we often had to cut off discussion to get through more presentations which was a bummer. Perhaps not every student should present each of the earlier assignments in order to save time....just a select few to get the discussion going and then really let the discussion happen in class and not feel rushed.Also, more time after the final project presentations to discuss as a group how the projects went would be good. It seemed like discussing the feedback we got from the judges would be helpful as many of us had never been through a review before and weren't sure what it all meant....and what the professor thought of our projects and how well they fulfilled the parameters."

Time was tight on all sides, but I always knew that I could find some time to meet up and that I would get my questions answered adequately."

   "question_text": "If yes, what were the advantages and disadvantages of the group work?",
   "comments": [
    "Many solid opportunities for collaboration between FES and ARCH students; was very necessary and had both good and bad points",
    "It was a good exercise to partner us up across schools. I learned a good deal about terminology and practices that we take for granted at the Forestry School that everyone knows.",
    "This was a spectacular opportunity to work with someone who had knowledge far outside my particular area of expertise. I went into the experience hesitantly, but all my expectations were totally turned on their head and exceeded. What came out of it was an amazing sharing and learning experience where I got to collaborate with someone who has training and a way of thinking that is totally different from my own. It was interesting to see where we had areas of agreement, and areas of misunderstanding, and then approach these challenges with creative solutions. What emerged was a creative project that I am very proud of, and also a new mindset that will help me to effectively work with designers and planners throughout my career.",
    "This was interesting because groups were made up of two different schools. It was very difficult to work the scheduling between foresters and architects because both schools have very different timelines for work. The advantage was having to explain things that you usually don't have to explain to others in your own field. It opens up your eyes to things that you wouldn't have examined with a group where everyone has the same assumptions. This is a very helpful thing to experience teaching\/explaining to someone in a completely different field what you mean."

    "It's good, Alex runs relaxed and open discussions which fosters a good environment for the exchange of ideas. That being said, it's very focused on the concept of design experiments and could broaden its scope to talk more practically about issues facing urban ecology and practical ways to address some of these issues.",
