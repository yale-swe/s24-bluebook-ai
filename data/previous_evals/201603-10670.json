   "comments": [
    "I learned how to analyze circuits, as well as experimentally test the information learned in class.",
    "The course was very effective in teaching me about different circuit elements. I now feel comfortable constructing most basic circuits. The lab component of the course was especially helpful with this.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of how circuits work, from simple DC setups to more complex non-linear and time-varying ones. I also had a good refresher on how to work with complex numbers and trigonometric functions.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about electronic circuity. In some areas, it strengthened existing knowledge I already had, in others it was new. Either way, it was certainly helpful for moving forward in the engineering world.",
    "I learned a lot about electrical engineering in terms of information about electrical components and techniques for analyzing circuits, and I learned how to do labs and write lab reports.",
    "Good intro to electronics\/electrical engineering.",
    "Through this course I learned how to think more critically about the techniques involved in circuit analysis. As this was my first class in circuitry (even taken before PHYS 181), I had a large gap in material that I filled in. This class showed me the loop method, nodal analysis, and the several applications of them. Because of this class, I can now think more critically about how to analyze circuits.",
    "I learned all about electrical circuits and how to analyze them as well as the theory behind what makes them work. Having taken PHYS 181 beforehand was very helpful.",
    "I had a fair amount of self-taught EE knowledge prior to taking this class but to be honest I didn't really know what I was doing. EE200 really fixed this. It was a great introduction that covered a very wide gamut of electronics (i.e. everything).",
    "gained a much better understanding of circuits and their components and electrical systems\/application.",
    "I developed an understanding of how to design and analyze different types of electronic circuits. I would describe the knowledge gained as beginner-intermediate electrical engineering.",
    "As far an intro course for electrical engineering goes, this is it. Comprehensive overview of a variety of circuits, components, and a interesting look into their ramifications for larger systems. The lab sections allow a growing hands-on understanding of concepts learnt in class, and the reports\/write-ups develop peripheral skills like good organisation of only the necessary information. The format of the course is conducive to deeper understanding of the course material.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to circuit building blocks, circuit elements (active and passive), circuit construction and modern electronics technology. For students who have already taken a physics course in E&M, learning about, for instance, induced electromotive forces, this is a great course to zoom out- understanding how circuits themselves operate and their applications.",
    "This class helped to familiarize students with basic linear and non-linear circuit elements and to establish a foundation for electrical engineering.",
    "Learned all about circuit elements and analyzing voltage and current within circuits. In the scheme of electrical engineering, this class focuses on the low-level: V = IR, resistors, diodes, transistors, and the like stuff you'll find in wiring.",
    "Basic circuit analysis",
    "I learned basic knowledge of circuits and their applications.",
    "I learned about the basic components of electronics, and how to construct and evaluate circuits. I also learned how to write formal lab reports.",
    "Building circuits and analyzing them",
    "Through this course I learned how to analyze basic electronic circuits with elements including, resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors and MOSFETs. I was also introduced to CMOS logic. I now feel that I have the skills to execute some very basic circuit design.",
    "I feel like a gained a good feel for the different types of circuit components and their effects. My ability to distill the purpose of a circuit on sight was definitely improved.",
    "All the important things to know from an intro electronics course! I thought this class was very comprehensive",
    "I learned a lot from this class because of the large amount of work assigned. Some of the lab reports can be very time consuming, but whn you finish, you know a ton about circuitry.",
    "I learned a lot about circuitry and how basic digital logic is made.",
    "I had taken classes which had covered basic linear circuit elements, so initially I wasn't sure how much I was going to learn, but I found the discussions of nonlinear circuit elements to be extremely interesting and enlightening, and feel I have a much stronger understanding of the concepts behind common circuit elements than I had had before.",
    "This course allowed me to further my understanding in electronics and electronic components, especially as I had next-to-no experience with them in the first place. The course made me comfortable with using a breadboard since it had been a while since I had used one, and the combination of the practical aspect with the theoretical one really allowed me to understand what was going on.",
    "Basic understanding of circuit components and how they operate in conjunction with another to serve a specific purpose. A good introductory course.",
    "This class taught me introductory circuit elements and a basic intuition to the physics of circuits. I learned skills that would be need to design circuits and skills that would allow me to break down complicated circuits.",
    "Developed basic electrical engineering analysis skills and gained the knowledge to begin exploring practical design more deeply.",
    "Basic knowledge of electronics, really helpful. Diodes and transistors stuff is cool to understand.",
    "Learnt about different circuit components and circuit analysis techniques.",
    "This course helped to finally solidify a lot of the basic electronics\/circuitry concepts you learn in PHYS 181, and also expanded into cooler, more applicable topics. I feel like I have a better intuitive understanding of basic circuits and circuit components after taking this class.",
    "It's all about circuits, various circuit elements and their behavior, and having had minimal experience with circuits in person or on paper, this was a lot of new stuff for me. I found the class difficult but interesting, and I think I gained a pretty good understanding of it's contents"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The amount of work in this class is good for understanding the material. Writing the lab reports helped me better understand the material and the problem sets were reasonable.",
    "Labs aren't very helpful for understanding the topics.",
    "The requirements for the lab reports were consistently unclear. Points were taken off for things that I wasn't aware I should include in my report. I think a list of concepts to cover in teach report would be necessary, as it allows the TAs to see if students really have an understanding of material.",
    "A note: While the material is presented so as to be easy to understand and digest, it is sometimes more complicated than it appears due to simplifications. These simplifications, designed make the material easier to teach, just end up causing confusion when they no longer apply. Overall, I think the course delivered on its goals in terms of content. However, there was a large disparity between the work for the lab and the work for the course. The former required considerably more time and energy than the latter, often yielding worse grades on assignments and less understanding of the material. In other words, the lab sunk a lot of my time and effort, but I still felt as if I learned more from doing the regular coursework despite spending maybe 20% of the time on it. This disparity needs to be addressed.",
    "This course's greatest strength is likely that it is comprehensive. It really does do a good job at introducing many different fields, so even as a mechanical engineering major, I believe that most of the skills I have learned will be useful later. I do believe, however, that it could benefit from slightly clearer instructions\/expectations for labs. On some labs, it was difficult to determine how they wanted us to take the data, or all students would struggle with the same issue and the TAs might not be able to resolve it. Moreover, for the reports, no clear guidelines were ever given in terms of length\/depth\/formality. Thus, I believe that on many of them I may have spent more time than was necessary in certain areas of the writing, while not enough in others.",
    "A strength of this course was the balance between p-sets, lecture, and exams. I thought they all complemented each other well, and I never felt like the psets were impossible, just challenging (same with exams). One MAJOR weakness of the course was that the final exam was held in-class. I felt like this was very unfair because we had a p-set and two labs due in the week before, so it was hard to start studying until two days before the exam. Because the exam was cumulative and long, it makes much more sense for it to be held during reading period ( when I signed up for the course, it did have a final exam slot and I assumed the final would be held during that exam slot because my other classes that didn't have finals during finals period did not have a finals period exam slot indicated). I felt like I was rushing to study and rushing to finish the exam, so it didn't accurately reflect how much I learned. Finals during finals period means you get a week to just study and the exam has more time (including a grace period). Another big weakness of the course was the labs. The labs did not match up with course material in terms of the level of difficulty, and they were very disorganized. The first lab was incredibly rough because no one knew what they were doing and the TAs were unprepared to deal with that. There was no fixed lab schedule, and it also took a big extra chunk of time out of the week without any additional credit. Lecture should have been shrunk down to 50 minutes twice a week to allow for lab time, or it should be like a 1.25 credit class.",
    "Lecture and problem sets are fairly straightforward, with no real challenges so long as one pays attention in every lecture. There are, however, six labs to be completed in this course that offer little to nothing to be gained, yet collectively take more time than the rest of the class's work combined.",
    "Fascinating course. As someone with not a ton of background in electrical engineering, but still wanting to pursue it, this is a tough but fair course. Lots of material to learn, and lots of smart people around you doing better than you. Prepare to get less than stellar grades on lab reports and exams - labs are brutal!",
    "Make the lab an additional half credit. Its ridiculous that this is equivalent to a class like race and gender was last semester when this was about 5x more work.",
    "This class had a very solid and knowledgeable instructor. Mark Reed was clearly more than proficient in understanding the processes, and in explaining them to us. Additionally, I know some other circuit analysis courses do a broad overview of everything, so I appreciate this class's ability to go in depth into several important aspects of circuitry. Moreover, between three TFs and the course instructor, there were a variety of office hours at many different times throughout the week. My only suggestion is that I'd like to see office hours on Wednesdays the next time the course is run, since PSETs are due on Thursdays. The labs in this class were shaky at best... I wouldn't say they were poorly designed, but I know that there are less confusing (and therefore less time consuming) labs that could have been created to reflect the course's content. Also, I had Friday lab, and while Zak did a great job helping us, there were simply too many people with questions for one TF. In the future, especially with the complicated labs, I would consider adding a second TF to the busier lab sections. Additionally, the \"review\" for the final was not a review; it was a run-through. I would've rather seen the review focus on half the concepts covered in the course but go twice as in-depth with them. The TFs were way too rushed, and rather than lecturing a lot of vital information, they lectured almost nothing about everything.",
    "This course has WAY too much work to be a single credit. Weekly problem sets and bi weekly lab reports are not okay, especially when the lab is an additional three hours that week. This is one and a half credits of work.",
    "Mark Reed is great. However, the material was very complex and a lot of people were very confused. What is really unfair, however, is the labs. It's a 2-3 hour lab about every other week, and the lab reports can take anywhere from 4-10 hours. BUT YOU DON'T GET AN EXTRA HALF CREDIT. So basically you'll be taking this class, which is good, has a reasonable amount of work, and taking a lab without getting credit for it. This needs to change-- I did the work for at least 1.5 courses by taking this class.",
    "This course was AMAZING! I enjoyed it so much and learned so much. Professor Reed is a wonderful TA and the TAs were extremely helpful and really wanted the students to enjoy what we were learning. It was slightly challenging in that it is accompanied by a lab in addition to the classwork, however, the TAs and Professor Reed were always willing to help and answer questions which made the workload very manageable.",
    "Strengths: Mark is a great teacher and was very excited about the material. I think this transferred to his students, who also became excited about the field. Weaknesses: I know a lot of people found the class very tricky. This could just be new-class-pains, as I believe this was Mark's first time teaching EE200. In addition, lab sections were slightly disorganized, which impeded our execution and understanding of these labs. Again, admittedly, this was likely a side effect of it being the first year with new teaching staff.",
    "labs were tedious sometimes (especially the write-ups) but manageable",
    "It's a very difficult course, but it's handled excellently and I wouldn't change it.",
    "Both the instructor and the TAs made themselves available and were incredibly helpful and approachable. The course material was comprehensive and walked those like myself who had little to no familiarity with circuits through the most basic concepts until reaching the realms of digital logic and MOSFET control without suddenly becoming incomprehensible. I had huge issues with writing the lab reports, so more structured guidance could have been made available there in terms of representing data, but the lab itself was a huge asset to the class.",
    "The lectures were incredibly instructive, and the lecture notes were not only always available for students but comprehensive and thorough, full of sample problems and formulae. I greatly appreciated the inclusion of a lab portion (6 labs) in the course, while sometimes disorganized, as it helped me to better understand the limitations of 'ideal' approximations and thereby the nuances of circuit operation.",
    "The only issue with this class was that towards the end of the semester we went through some complex circuits very quickly and it was difficult to keep up with the material at the end.",
    "Strengths: efficient lectures, appropriate problem sets and exams. Weaknesses: labs were very hackneyed at times late to go up, hard to work through (no instruction at all in what was supposed to be an intro to lab equipment, e.g.), little guidance on what makes a good lab report. Which is to say: the TAs had very good guidelines but if I had not had prior experience writing formal lab reports I would have struggled greatly to adjust and match standards that I was unsure about.",
    "The professor is very nice but disorganized. Lectures attempted to cover too much material, forcing students to learn from the textbook and problem sets. Labs were sometimes posted at 7:00 a.m. for a lab session that afternoon.",
    "Weaknesses: 1) The labs were not well explained and students were kind of thrown into them. Some of the components were confusing enough that there was a lot of disagreements between TAs, especially when it came time to grading. Additionally, the labs were enough work that they really should have warranted another half credit. 2) The powerpoint layout of the class sometimes made it hard to pay attention\/easy to get distracting. I think that if there had been more examples we worked out in class\/more done on the board it would have helped engage the class more. Strengths: The course was very linear and the lessons followed each other in a logical fashion. Professor Reed explained things in a clear manner and kept his lectures short and to the point",
    "The course is a solid introduction to circuit analysis. It could be made more exciting by stressing more on the countless real-world applications of circuit technology.",
    "Material was very dry.",
    "The homeworks were fair and the class was paced well. The classes however were at times hard to follow and the labs weren't allways explained well.",
    "The labs are very time intensive and are graded harshly, which can decrease motivation.",
    "Lab can be done a LOT better",
    "A strength of this course was that the Professor was extremely nice and wanted his students to really learn the material. The TA's were also very helpful, and a good resource to use if you didn't understand something. In lecture, however, the professor did a lot of reading of the slides without much extra to engage the students. I think it might have been nice to do a little more work with on the chalk board, especially when learning the processes for analyzing a certain type of circuit.",
    "The lectures were well given and better documented, so that we could review it afterwards for tests and labs. The lab sections were decent in the time actually spent in the lab space, but the reports took a very long time and were graded very differently based on which section you were in. Professor Reed was very accommodating and helpful with any issues I had, and the psets were fair.",
    "Thought Prof. Reed was very nice and a great teacher, but his lecture slides were disorganized and hard to follow",
    "I think this course should count for a credit and a half because of the additional three hour lab every other week.",
    "The strengths are in the professor's ability to teach and the amazing TFs. The weaknesses are the labs; the material covered in the labs was more advanced than what we did in class, so we were often lost in our labs.",
    "The class was unnecessarily strict on lab reports.",
    "The class has a great pace, and places an excellent emphasis on explaining concepts rather than simply problem-solving. I think labs could be improved by having better clarification of expectations and grading rubrics for written lab reports.",
    "The information is provided in a really clear manner, and thus makes it really easy to follow what Mark was trying to convey, even if the concepts seemed daunting early on. Even though it is taught in a lecture-style manner, the room is small enough to permit questions, which was especially nice when the concepts that he was exposing were non-intuitive.",
    "The lab was very problematic; we ran into issues so easily and it took too much trouble shooting and time to solve the issues. The lab was a bit of a hassle. The lecture was better but still a bit dry.",
    "The value of this course is imperative, but it was difficult to fully understand and comprehend the material with a textbook that is so old. The professor was very involved with the students but the labs involved topics that were far beyond the reaches of this course. They took much longer than the allotted 3 hours to complete and the write up were often graded sporadically.",
    "Very good course.",
    "Has a lab component which is a solid amount of time but not terrible, once every other week about, reasonable lab reports.",
    "Useful material and great Professor."

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't discourage someone from taking the course, but I would warn them that while the first half of the semester is relatively straight forward, the second half is much more difficult.",
    "I would only recommend that someone take this class if it is required for his or her major.",
    "If you just want an introduction to electronics and circuitry, perhaps search for a course that's not a requirement for an engineering major. The material can get quite confusing if you're not taking the course to prepare for your major in a STEM field. Additionally, there is a lab component (which gives no credit) that represents about 50-80% of the work you will do (in my experience), but only perhaps 10-20% of your learning (again, my experience), so be prepared to spend a lot of time and frustration over it when you sign up. Other than that, Mark is great at making you feel confident as you learn the material, and also at presenting the subject in a way that (while perhaps sometimes too much so) is very simple. You'll get a broad overview of many subjects in circuitry and electronics and learn a lot, if you hold yourself accountable and try.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing a technical field, in any form. That said, if you don't intend to use the material included, I would probably not recommend it, simply because there are probably other, more interesting courses to take. That said, it was a very solid class, and even though I had to take it for my major (MechE), I still believe I would have taken it regardless, since I think it will be useful for my future plans in engineering.",
    "I would recommend EE200 simply because it is a nice introduction to the field of electrical engineering, and you are most likely taking it to get a feel for the major. The psets and exams are very reasonable, but be warned that lab is rough. There aren't many labs, just 6 for us, but they were very annoying and unexpectedly difficult in comparison to what we learned in lecture. Also, the final was in class which was terrible (watch out if you have other finals during the last week of class because we also had things due and it was just hard to find the time to study and prepare properly).",
    "EENG 200 is not a challenging course so long as one attends lecture, and will teach everything one needs to know to navigate basic circuits. Both the midterm and final are not challenging. Under Mark Reed, the labs for the class do take some time to do and write up, however the problem sets typically are not challenging and can be completed in one sitting.",
    "Would recommend this to anyone considering the EE major.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but maybe not to a freshman. There were few freshmen in the class, so while it can be a great day to advance your learning, I would think about holding off on this course until sophomore year (after I had PHYS 181), since Prof Reed makes many references to the course, and there are very few other freshmen enrolled in the class. Overall, it was very enjoyable, with PSETs that take below-average work, but do not discredit the labs. Every other lab requires a formal writeup, and those were consistently pains. They are graded harshly, but the class is curved.",
    "Only recommend if it's required for your major. Would not take as an elective.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you need it for your major, or are very interested in electronics. I had a lot of fun in this class, don't get me wrong, and I'm a huge fan of Mark Reed (he's the greatest). However, if you've got a mild interest in electronics, it's way too much of a time commitment.",
    "I would highly recommend this course taught by Professor Reed to another student. It has been one of my favorite courses at Yale so far and made me absolutely LOVE electrical engineering despite the fact the I'm a Mechanical Engineering major. It has made me want to try to fit more electrical engineering classes into my schedule in the future.",
    "If you have any interest in electronics, absolutely take this class. You will emerge with not only a good theoretical understanding of circuits, but also a general practical understanding about how to design and build your own circuits. Mark is a fantastic professor and he makes the class very fun most days. He is very fair and receptive to student needs and concerns about the class.",
    "It is definitely not one of the easier courses you could take here at Yale, but if you are genuinely interested in the material and are willing to work for the grade, you should be fine.",
    "Well it's an engineering course, so unless you want to study electronic circuits I wouldn't take it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. As a requirement for many majors, I expected the class to be rote and dull, but found it to be both interesting and well-taught.",
    "For any student interested in circuitry basics, this course will teach you all you need to know- including how to build circuits yourself!",
    "I would, but I would also advise them to be aware of the lab component of this class (it's a great class but its basically two classes for 1 credit with the lab and lecture).",
    "In the scheme of electrical engineering, this class focuses on the low-level: V = IR, resistors, diodes, transistors, and the like stuff you'll find in wiring. Problem sets are appropriate but, being a physics-based class, take time. Read the textbook, it helps. Mark Reed is an efficient lecturer and has clear explanations and examples, but has a lot on his plate (he is DUS at this time) and could not dedicate very much time to the class and could get behind on uploading classnotes and the like. Labs are a time-suck: they are not scheduled ahead (expect them approximately every other week but don't stick to that!), they will take the entire three hours (we were initially told they wouldn't but many of us ended up staying over the time), may not work or may be missing important details and instructions that throw off measurements that the TAs will figure out live, and formal reports take a very long time to write to their standards. I took PHYS 181 which was very helpful to circuit analysis and to phasors; if you are weak on trigonometry and imaginary numbers I recommend taking PHYS 181 first.",
    "Don't take this course unless it is required for your major.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably have to, either for EENG or MENG. It's an okay class, not the most exciting thing you'll learn all year, but not terrible. If you're a ME major, you probably won't get things as intuitively as the EE kids and you might have to work a little harder to keep up. PSETs don't take that long and the exams are pretty fair (but have high averages so watch out). The one thing to keep in mind is this class has a lab every other week OUTSIDE of regular class time, and this is the most annoying part of the class. Labs can be confusing, don't count for a half credit, and the reports can be upwards of 15 pages and take 10+ hours to complete.",
    "Take it if it's required for your major. I wouldn't really recommend it otherwise, unless you're very curious about electronics.",
    "The labs are brutal.",
    "Sure. Lots of work and difficult content but professor does a pretty good job in lecture",
    "I would only recommend this course to those who have to take it anyways.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if they are majoring in STEM.",
    "Only if you have to",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to be able to implement capacitors, inductors, transistors and MOSFETs in circuit design. The course is a lot of work, especially with the required lab component, so be prepared to put in a decent amount of time. The more you put into this class the more you get out of it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone planning on working with engineering or physics. Though the lab sections are a bit difficult, the lectures are thorough and the problem sets are in line with the class notes. The tests are fair and review sessions are quite helpful. This gives you a great feel for the functions of circuit of components, and I would recommend it.",
    "Yes! Interesting material",
    "For many people, this is a required class for their major. It is a great intro course if you want to learn more about electronics.",
    "If you like electronics and circuits, this is the class for you! Otherwise, I recommend taking EE201 before this to find out IF you like electronics.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of basic linear circuit elements.",
    "While this course mainly served as a prerequisite to all of the major tracks fort the MechE major, it is also an interesting course if you're interested in electronics. Also, Mark Reed is a fantastic teacher with a lot of energy.",
    "If you are interested in electronics at all, this is a solid, informative course, but be warned, the lab is not fun, and it requires a lot of patience to find out how the lab is actually supposed to function.",
    "Recommended to any engineering or even just any STEM-oriented student. Useful skills.",
    "Yep. Good to help you understand the basics of electric circuits and the building block electric components. Practical applications like amplifiers solar panels computer chips is all included so that's nice to know about how they actually work and to build them in the lab.",
    "Yes. The skills acquired are very useful.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. The pace is reasonable, the homework and tests not overwhelming, and the topics get more interesting as you move further into the class. It is a great continuation of PHYS 181, especially if you didn't enjoy \/ felt you didn't learn that much in that class.
