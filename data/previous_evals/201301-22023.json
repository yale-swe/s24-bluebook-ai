    "Definitely; take it! Its really cool material which is very applicable if you like neuroscience!",
    "First half: medium-level lectures on mainly auditory and visual processing. Second half: students presenting on current research on topics of synaesthesia. Pros: small lecture without too much work and some interesting topics. Cons: I don't remember most of the material we covered and I've also lost all my senses. It's really kind of unfortunate.",
    "This class covers a wide variety of ways in which humans process sensory information. Overall, the material is interesting, especially when you research topics for your presentation or paper.",
    "A good course to take if you're interested in issues surrounding both physiological and higher level sensory processing. If that's you, then it's hard to avoid a course like this."
