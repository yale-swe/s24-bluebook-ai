    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "In Writing Half-Hour TV comedy you will write a script for an original show (your own idea) or for an existing show. You write pitches for both and Professor Stevens chooses which one he wants you to write. I would definitely recommend the class but hope that it focuses more on teaching the fundamentals of script writing in the future.",
    "Yes, but with reservations. This class is a lot of fun, and if you care about and love TV, you'll get something out of it. But there's not a lot of structured learning, and there's also not a lot of effort put into giving you feedback on anything you write beyond one conference and a class workshop - no comments on things you hand in, no opportunity to write and revise drafts of a script. Class time is also not used very efficiently - a lot of it is spent watching TV, which at first glance, sounds great, but is not really that helpful.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it, whether you think this writing would just be fun to try out or you want to pursue it as a career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!! As a student that's not interested in going into the industry, it was just a fun class to take. It was very different from any of my other classes at Yale, and when doing the work for the class, I really didn't feel like I was \"working,\" which is always a huge plus.",
    "If you're interested in the specific subject or want an overall fun and not overly challenging class, I recommend this one."
