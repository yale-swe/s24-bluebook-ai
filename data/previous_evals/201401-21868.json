   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The learning curve for me was very steep despite the course being structured as a panoptic view of meaning in linguistic philosophy. I had to do a fair amount of external research in order to keep up, but it was always worth it. I loved every lecture and was always excited for the next one. Larry Horn and Ben George are an awesome combo, too. They're constantly adding bits of information to one another's lectures and have a great dynamic. You do have to be interested in analytic philosophy otherwise you'd likely be bored to tears, but if you are into this stuff, this class is a must-take.",
    "A pretty chill fifth credit. The only thing is that I have no idea what my grade will be because we've had pretty much no assignments.",
    "I mean, it's a low workload, and an interesting fifth credit, but it gets pretty dry about halfway into the semester. It really isn't very involved--you give one informal presentation and write a final paper, but other than that the professors just talk at you for two hours once a week. I guess some people might prefer that, but I just got pretty bored of it by the end of the semester.",
    "Meaning is a small lecture that functions as an introduction to the philosophy of language. The reading is dense, but the only requirement is one final paper.",
    "This is pretty much a philosophy of language class. You'll be reading almost exclusively philosophy texts and discussing them at length in class. The quality of the seminar is pretty dependent on the other people in the class; my class was really quiet, so it made for some awkward long pauses and long professorial monologues. That said, George and Horn are so obscenely knowledgable about this topic that they could talk for hours and somehow make it interesting. The first half of the class is a bit of a slog: it's 19th century philosophy, so what did you expect? But the second half, especially the discussion of pragmatics, was super interesting to me. All in all, three and a half stars."
