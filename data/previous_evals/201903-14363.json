   "comments": [
    "I learned about the causes and consequences of forced migration, the ethics and law surrounding refugees and internally displaced people, and read many different interesting scholars who were expert on the subjects.",
    "I learned about many different academic approaches and topic areas within forced migration, including root causes, responses, and various theoretical analyses. I also learned more about how to develop and structure a research paper in Political Science.",
    "I learned so much about all things related to refugees, IDPs, asylum-seekers, and more. I feel like I gained valuable skills for debating and making solid arguments, as well as the ability to think critically about theories and texts.",
    "I learned a lot about the relationship between violence-induced displacement and modern politics. The course is well-organized so we learned about the causes and consequences of forced migration, the conceptual\/legal distinctions between different types of displacement, and international responses and solutions to forced displacement. Besides learning a lot about forced displacement, this course also taught me how to write. At the end of most classes, we went over writing techniques that helped us when it came time to writing our final research papers.",
    "This is a wonderfully taught course on a fascinating and pertinent subject. We discussed a host of elements related to forced migration, beginning with macro-level theories from the fields of international relations, political science, anthropology, and more. As the semester progressed we discussed more micro-level issues related to migration, including causes and effects and potential policy solutions. We read a variety of types of literature on the subject, including academic papers and news stories. The readings were always riveting and well-selected for the week's topic.",
    "You will gain a more complex understanding of all of the forces impacting forced migration, ranging from the level of the individual to states and international bodies.",
    "I learned about the different reasons for why displacement occurs, the different ways in which states respond to forced migrations and why, and possible policy solutions for various scenarios of forced migration. I also learned about how difficult it was practically to implement these solutions which we talked about in class, as witnessed through our policy simulation.",
    "We learned about forced migration and the choices and policies that surround it, beginning with how forced migration happens, discussed the real and political significance of forced migration v. other types of migration, and then the process of leaving, sending and recipient countries' policies, etc. Prof. L also was awesome about working with us on academic writing and generally making us better writers. very cognizant of the realities of being a student, but made sure he gave us the opportunity to improve and excel on our papers and in class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was broad but also super in depth. I learned a tonne from the material and was challenged in my beliefs constantly. Not only did the class portray the typical kinds of academic work typically associated with the subject, it also did an amazing job presenting both sides of the argument. In this way it provided a knowledge base that I'm sure would be very applicable to multiple different kinds of academic work. This was apparent in the final papers, where everyone seemed to do completely different subjects, all the while drawing from the information in the class. The discussions were super well led, the seminars had breaks after every 45 minutes after which Professor Lichtenheld changed pace and we worked in different settings. There really weren't any weaknesses of the class; it was one of the best seminars I've had the privilege of taking here.",
    "It is a great course! The readings are really interesting and the course is well organised.",
    "The strengths of this course were the very interesting and timely material, the engaging class discussions, and the helpful instruction on paper-writing. A weakness was that the reading load was consistently pretty heavy and it was sometimes difficult to read and discuss closely in class because we could not reference readings electronically during class and printing is expensive\/a waste of paper.",
    "Strengths - fascinating readings, great professor, great discussions Weaknesses - not really any I can think of!",
    "Professor Lichtenheld was very open to feedback from all of his students and made sure we were engaged in the course along the way. The discussions we had in seminar were thought-provoking and Professor L challenged us to think outside of our comfort zone. Overall a very well taught and organized seminar, one small weakness was that we did not have as many readings about firsthand accounts of people being forced to migrate. There were some first person readings but wish there were a little more.",
    "Overall, this course is very strong and I can think of very few weaknesses. The syllabus is well-organized and the readings cover a lot of material, so I came away from this course knowing a lot more about the drivers and consequences of forced migration.",
    "The course provided a great foundation of knowledge for the subject area. I think the readings and assignments were well-selected and fascinating. I think Professor Lichtenheld led lively conversations and did not interfere too much in the discussion. I do think he could've guided the discussions a little more, as we sometimes strayed from the week's readings. The only substantive improvement I would recommend is that I thought we spent too much time on the IR theories at the beginning of the course, which seemed largely less relevant than the material later in the course.",
    "There are many strengths to this class. The course is well organized into salient sub topics that drive the class's weekly discussions. Professor Lichtenheld helps the class get started by having us briefly review the class readings out loud, but doesn't dwell on them for two long. He helps us transition to relevant discussion questions, and periodically chimes in to help the discussion move in a productive direction.",
    "The course was well organized and the readings gave me a lot of insight on different aspects of forced migration. I felt like I gained a very practical perspective on forced migration as a whole by analyzing the reasons why forced migration persists and why states respond to forced migration differently. I enjoyed all of the readings and the instructor was great at facilitating discussion in the class. I also really appreciated the peer review session in which we gave each other feedbacks on our final papers, as I found that very helpful. Overall, I cannot think of any glaring weakness in the course.",
    "Strengths: Prof. L is a great professor, very approachable, thoughtful, leads very interesting discussions, really cares about his students, and cultivated a great classroom environment; syllabus was very interesting--readings had a lot of substance and were manageable so that we learned a lot; assignments were more than manageable and Prof L walked us through his expectations and would set aside class time to generally work on high-level academic writing skills with everyone. We would get a page of substantive comments as well as line-by-line comments on papers just meant to make us better writers without being penalized. Weaknesses: Honestly none, the class was very thoughtful, you left as both very knowledgeable about migration policies and a far better writer, class was good. Maybe I wish there was one week to the syllabus with a specifically US migration policy focus but that was it."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. Especially if you're interested in participating in the fight to help those most in need. This course will prepare you for any kind of humanitarian refugee work and will inform any public policy career that may involve displaced people. Professor Lichtenheld is amazing and super passionate about what he teaches, not to mention very experienced in the field and academically. There was so much more to the issues brought up in class than I'd realized and I really enjoyed it.",
    "Yes! Really good overview of issues in global migration. We discussed questions such as how refugee crises are created, why people move, why people stay, how these issues become political, and what we can do looking forward. The course is really well organized, and we had a lot of great conversations. Lots of reading, but almost all of it is super interesting.",
    "Yes, take the course! You learn a lot from professor Lichtenheld and the readings. The seminar is engaging and the discussions are interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The topic is so important and I wish there were more classes taught on migration\/refugee studies because there is clearly a lot of student interest. The material we read was very interesting, though mostly academic work and a bit long, so make sure you are prepared for that. I learned a lot about how people approach the topic of forced migration in research and we also discussed the limits of this research and applications to current political issues. The class discussions benefitted a lot from the fact that most students had a background\/work experience in the topic and had unique insights to share.",
    "Yes 100%! This class is fascinating, has super interesting material and discussions, and Professor Lichtenheld is great. It is extremely relevant in todays world, and I feel like such a more educated person after having taken it.",
    "Absolutely! Anyone who is interested in issues of forced migration and immigration more generally should take this course. There are very few Political Science courses that address these issues and this course covers a lot of material. My only warning is that this course is reading heavy, but the readings are very informative so I enjoyed them.",
    "Definitely! If you are interested in the subject matter you will learn a LOT and be very engaged by the discussions and assignments. It's heavy material but the course approaches it with the necessary level of seriousness, while maintaining a welcoming classroom environment. The readings will fascinate and depress you, and you will learn about both the historical and contemporary elements of the refugee regime.",
    "Would highly recommend to anyone seriously invested in the topic of forced migration\/ refugee issues.",
    "Yes, please take this course! It is one of the few courses on migration in the political science department, and possibly the only course on forced migration and displacement. It gives you a comprehensive review of the political and economic factors for why forced migration exists and gives you a very practical perspective on policy solutions. Plus, the instructor does a great job facilitating discussion and making sure the class remains engaging.",
    "Definitely recommend. Take this class. Prof L is a truly awesome professor - cares about subject, really thoughtful and cares about his students. Topic is really interesting and so important - you will leave class with substantive and actionable understanding of a very important topic as well as a better writer. Cultivates a thoughtful classroom environment which meant that discussions were great and all comments contributed to the discussion."
