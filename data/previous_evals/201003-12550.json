    "Get excited for ARCH 450. You've made it through junior year and this is when the real fun begins. It's less work-intensive, much more exciting, and your professors -- if they're Adam and Turner at least -- are FANTASTIC. I loved this course at every moment.",
    "Yes, it was a fun studio...",
    "You have to take it if youre an architecture major, but Turner and Adam are by far the best studio professors that you will have.",
    "It's hard but worth it if you're an architecture major. The professors are great and I think they add to one's understanding of architecture. The projects this semester were pretty interesting.",
    "Architecture 450 is the crown of the undergraduate major studio track. It is well planned, well executed and well taught. Enjoy it while it lasts. Adam and Turner are the best!",
    "You will like this studio! Turner and Adam are thoughtful professors who are really interested in teaching and allowing you to grow as designers. They really want you to be creative, so just let go\u0085which may be hard after previous studios you have taken at Yale. The workload is manageable meaning that you will pull all-nighters maybe twice during the semester. Have fun.",
    "This studio was great. Such a welcome change from junior year - as a senior, you have matured in your design process, and it's great to have longer projects that give you time to think\/develop rather than just produce final work. Turner and Adam are amazing professors - super encouraging, optimistic. I always felt excited by my projects after I spoke with them at desk crits. You will definitely like this course.",
    "Amazing. Best studio I've taken so far. The professors are just amazing, always provide great feedback and are just great professors. Get excited to not work on the grid anymore. The projects are all really interesting. This is the first time that we actually design a building, which is pretty cool. But really this is an awesome class.",
    "This studio is so much better than junior studio.",
    "Good course. It could use a little more structure and can at times be frustrating because you feel like you are not getting enough critique to go off of, but taking initiative serves you well--Turner and Adam are very easy to talk to and always happy to help.",
    "YES. Try whatever you want to with this studio; instructors trust you."
