   "comments": [
    "What a class! Unlike anything I've ever taken. Sometimes the movement exercisesand readings will seem confusing, but let things settle and you'll gain some insight into your body, the politics of movement, and creative practice. The content extends beyond the purview of dance into the social and political considerations surrounding improvisation as a practice. Often left with more (productive) questions.",
    "The class is an enjoyable seminar on Movement Improvisation. It does have a fair amount of reading, and it is a long class in an unfortunate timeslot (friday afternoon), at least as it was this semester. However, if you are interested in the material you will learn a lot, and I think it is worth taking.",
    "The seminar met once a week for three hours. The half was generally devoted to actual dance and movement: we learned a variety of improvisational dance scores, games, and exercises. The second half, we sat down for discussion about theory, while Elise put up slides with excerpts from our readings. I would recommend this class to a student who is very enthusiastic about dance -- if not, this class might be too much, and grow tiring quickly. If you are not a serious dancer, I think you could still gain some new insight and interest perspective from this class, but I would recommend you take it credit\/D\/fail (I wish I had).",
    "By far, Movement Improv was one of the most \"interdisciplinary\" courses I've taken at Yale. It is unified by a common theme of dance improvisation, but over the course of our class meetings we discussed readings in philosophy, civil rights, gender and sexuality, virtual reality and games.The instructor, Elise, is incredibly helpful and supportive in providing feedback and helping students out with readings and classroom advice. She is extremely knowledgeable about dance and an excellent dancer herself, and she brought in numerous guest lecturers who were incredibly talented and led students through exercises in improv and talked about their experiences as artists and dancers.In conclusion, although this is a primarily dance-focused class, the emphasis is on how improvisation can be applied in a wider context. I had no prior experience in dance or improv, and I found this class very helpful in making me realize how my body interacts with the environment around me. I would highly recommend this class if students are interested in learningabout how improvisation can be applied to everyday life and enjoy stimulating discussions about race, gender, politics and philosophy in the context of dance."
