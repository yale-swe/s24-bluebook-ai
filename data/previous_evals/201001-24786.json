    "A class that will introduce you into an entirely new culture and at the same time allow you to competently begin speaking a new language.",
    "Indonesian 110\/120 was the highlight of my year and one of the best classes I have ever taken; it is one of the hidden gems of Yale College. Pak Indriyo is without doubt the most dedicated teacher I have ever met; he genuinely loves teaching, cares for his students, and makes learning the language seem easy. Regardless of whether you have any background whatsoever in Indonesian, this class is for you. It is fun, rewarding, and incredibly effective: if you put the effort in, you will be able to hold basic conversations with native speakers with ease. If you have any doubt about this class, shop it, and you will instantly realize how wonderful it is. This class is awesome.",
    "A fun and easy language course. Pak Indriyo is fantastic and you will learn a lot about Indonesian culture as well as the language."
