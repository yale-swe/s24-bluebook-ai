   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "This course deals with a history of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present. Through examining governments', scientists', and the public deeds and views on the weapons, students can learn contemporary political, military, and social circumstances.I would recommend this course to others because it was so helpful to understand various factors to consider when the weapons are developed, possessed, and used, which are applicable to the current situation.",
    "I'd recommend the class to anyone interested in learning about CBRN weapons development - and policies - over the past century. I think it would be interesting for someone in a related discipline or in another discipline altogether.",
    "Yes I would, because it provided a useful and comprehensive description of an important issue. In addition, the graduate student sessions were particularly enjoyable and engaging.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student that was interested in learning more about how America developed its weapons programs and policies. The emphasis on domestic political factors in our weapons policies was especially interesting."

   "comments": [
    "This course contributed a lot to my study about post-WWII US diplomatic history by providing important background knowledge such as the Cold War arms race.",
    "This was extremely helpful for me in understanding national security issues, which is my focus.",
    "This course helped provide me with the background information that will be very important for my career progression. However, I feel that the historical focus would have provided better analytical practice for someone who was working toward a History Phd.",
    "This course was an important part of my preparation for my work with the US government on weapons proliferation issues. A strong grasp of our own calculus on weapons development and proliferation policies will be exceptionally useful for my situational awareness at work."
