    "AMAZING TAKE THIS CLASS. if you don't get in just go and wait out shopping period. it's an amazing class, so many great speakers and hal just kills it and cares a lot about his class. good reading, fun assignments, you'll just wish you coudl devote more of your energy to it.",
    "Take this! So much fun especially if its with a good group! The final show is an awesome thing to witness!",
    "YES! It's great!",
    "Great class! Hal is awesome, the course is creatively stimulating, and you end the semester with a self-written one person play. I'm psyched to have participated in a course that required us to produce something and fully invest in the process. Over the course of the semester, Hal also introduces you to a bunch of techniques that playwrights and performers use to develop their shows. These exercises are great, though I do wish that we had devoted a bit more class time to playing with them and sharing them with each other. The readings are awesome - you learn that there is a ton of really cool stuff out there. Definitely worth taking!",
    "I would recommend this class in a heartbeat to anyone interested in writing or performing in the theater. It is by far the best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Take it if you want to write a short play and act in it. It is a cool opportunity, and the class dynamic was pretty awesome. Very fun class! Definitely a lot of work, and a lot of writing, so don't take it casually, but go for it if you want a structured enviornment to do some serious cool things. The guest speakers rock too.",
    "If you've ever had a story that you wanted to tell, or ever just wanted to be able to tell a story, this class is for you.",
    "A fun and challenging class with not so much work but many rewards. Take it if inly to meet a whole cast of talented individuals, not the least of them being the one and only Hal brooks!",
    "TAKE IT! It's as simple as that. If you want to be an artist in any sense of the word after Yale, you must take this class.",
    "You should absolutely take this class if you are interested in writing, performing, or just a really amazing class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is lucky enough to get in. Seriously, it was just so so so much fun, and I really felt like I learned a lot about performing, vulnerability, writing, and the styles and lives of my fellow students.",
    "Expanded my view of what is done in the format. We were introduced to diverse stiles and voices. Hal showed us the form at it's most current and alive. Also helpful for building and understanding creative habits and process.Hal is rigorous and understanding. Seemed a little distant at first, but maybe that's how I feel about my superego or people who aren't my mother. Ultimately very helpful, pragmatic, sensitive to how each student can grow most fruitfully. I'm very grateful for the course.The guests were also very helpful and insightful.The workload: There's reading\/watching every week. There is one midterm (5mins) and one final (12mins) performance - that you write and perform. There's a final paper (5-7pages) and a paper (3ish pages) due the second week, both about your creative process\/influences. There are weekly acting\/writing-process-type-exercises that some people have to volunteer to present in class. You're also required to free-write three pages a day (nobody will read them, but you have to do them).",
    "This is a really great course. I enjoyed getting to examine a number of different techniques of one-person plays, both reading and watching them. It would've been nice to workshop our own pieces a little bit more with the group of students--I know it was encouraged, but it never happened, and the dress rehearsal we had where we got to do it for two minutes was actually really helpful. It would be nice if there was more of that, more opportunities for feedback that were built in to the course. The readings and the exercises were great. The guest speakers were a real highlight of the course, getting to have conversations with people who have a lot of experience and knowledge to share.Hal is a fantastic teacher--really approachable and fun in class, has a great amount of wisdom in the genre and gives really great notes and tips. I really enjoyed class time and meeting with him outside of class as well.The main work for the class is writing a 5min and 15min solo play for the midterm and final. You also have a small paper at the beginning and a process paper at the end of the semester. Very manageable readings throughout, plus you have to write 3 pages a day (but not well-written stuff, it never gets read, just an exercise in getting yourself to write.)"
