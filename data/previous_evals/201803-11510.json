   "comments": [
    "I learned about why the concept of free will is clearly an illusion.",
    "I learned to think more critically about the psychological studies we tend to hold as truth, since they can be unreliable! I also learned to think about my own biases and how they might impede my understanding of science.",
    "Awesome dialogue on a subject that is often overlooked yet so fundemental to our lives and institutions.",
    "This course was a very good introduction to the debate - in both philosophy and science - about free will. The readings were great and incredibly interesting. One of the things I appreciated the most was the critical examination of certain experiments such as the Libet experiments. It was valuable to be able to take a scientific result and, instead of just accepting it as evidence, critique it and develop a more nuanced understanding. I also gained the knowledge that I no longer believe in free will! Although, it really would have been good to study compatibilism more... or at all.",
    "I read several influential thinkers who wrote about free will. I learned how skeptics of free will argue for their conclusions."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Brown is dedicated and very open about his views on free will, which really makes the course discussion fascinating! I do wish there were more readings than just the three texts we focused on predominantly!",
    "The readings of the course are fantastic, although I definitely think that something from a compatibilist perspective should be included, perhaps Dan Dennett's Elbow Room or something similar. It didn't make sense to me that compatibilism was almost entirely ignored\/dismissed without us even really understanding what it was. I think one weakness of the course was perhaps the in-seminar discussion. Sometimes it was hard to really get a good discussion off the ground because just as it was getting started, Prof. Brown would move on to the next slide\/video. This definitely got better as the term went on, though.",
    "The course was pretty disorganized. It was centered around three different books which we spent much of class critiquing but Professor Brown seemed to have many problems with these books so I was a bit unsure of why he chose them. Class discussions were somewhat circular and we didnt usually get into the deeper issues. Professor Brown is a really nice guy though and knows a lot about neuroscience. His wife bakes treats for every class.",
    "Strengths: it was a very open and engaging discussion and it covered a wide range of areas in the debate over free will Weaknesses: there were no pro-free will readings"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would, but the weekly reading responses can be a bit much!",
    "Yes! Fundementally changed my perspective",
    "I definitely would, because I think the subject matter is important, and I think the specific point of views the class offers - e.g. considering the debate from a scientific perspective, or a cultural historical p.o.v. as in Ravven - are not really available in other courses. Prof. Brown is also a knowledgeable, kind and funny professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to a self motivated student who wants to learn about free will. Otherwise, not necessarily.",
    "Yes it was a great class, and a great choice for a senior seminar. It is a great way to explore both the philosophical and neuroscientific sides of Psychology. It's fun to delve so deeply into one debate, which is whether or not we have free will."
