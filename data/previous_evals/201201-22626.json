   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking Italian as the language requirement because it is so well structured that, even though it isn't easy, it's not overwhelming because nothing comes as a surprise.",
    "Less about tenses and conjugations, and we move on to grammatical structures and forms of speech. About the same amount of vocab as L1, but more writing.",
    "It is a lot of work but manageable. It really helps you master Italian 110 while learning lots of new verb tenses and sentence structure. I found it challenging and tough at times, but getting through felt good in the end.",
    "It continues where Ital 110 left off, only at a more leisurely pace I felt. You start to become more confident with the language and I liked class a lot more.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "Merely a continuation of ITAL 110, finishes covering all of the basic Italian grammar. Also, delves into more books and films than the first semester.",
    "Italian 120 04 is a chance to continue your Italian language studies while also exploring other aspects of Italian culture, such as literature, holidays, and history.",
    "Awesome! I would definitely recommend it. You still learn grammar and vocal, but it is not nearly as much as the first semester of Italian and you get to focus on more fun things such as the Italian culture. We watched movies, went to the art gallery, and got to talk to each other about our interests and activities.",
    "If you are interested in the beauty of the Italian language or any aspect of Italian culture, I would definitely consider taking this course."
