   "comments": [
    "This course was a great overview class, but, as with all DS classes, there was not enough time to discuss each text in depth.",
    "More guidance as to what exactly each author is trying to say. Sometimes it felt like we danced around their main argument without actually fleshing it out.",
    "The primary strength is, of course, the discussions on so many great works that have passed through the ages. But personally, I wasn't expecting the heavy split between history and politics in terms of when we talked about them; it was all histories except Aristotle (which incidentally went far too fast to actually think about in depth) and then no \"histories\" for the rest of the semester and year. But it's a weakness of design that is somewhat necessary for the course to go temporally.",
    "This course covered each historian or philosopher in a surprising amount of depth. Still, it was a survey course and it was jarring switching from thinker to thinker each week. In addition, we read several writers we also read in the DS philosophy course, but did not gain a dramatically improved understanding of them from the attention they received in two and not one course. I feel I would have grown more from this course if we had read Cicero and Polybius instead of spending a week and a half on Aristotle (since much of the work which inspired the later authors we read in H&P was in the Ethics and not the Politics).",
    "Sometimes it is unclear what this course aims towards. It slips into being like philosophy at times and it can be difficult in some readings to understand the purpose of reading them is in relation to the focus of the course (ex: City of God)",
    "More structured class discussion, more historical background on Athenian democracy and political trajectory of Rome, a clearer relation made between historiography and political philosophy",
    "Large chunks of reading so little depth"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, you'll learn a lot, but be prepared for large amounts of reading and writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was less coherent than the other DS courses, but the benefit of this is that you are better able to take your own conclusions from the course rather than the ones implicit in the ordering and structure of the reading assignments.",
    "Its interesting but not the most rigorous in terms of historical analysis",
    "Yes"
