   "comments": [
    "Even if you dislike the organic chemistry lecture, the lab is fantastic. You can see real life applications of what you are learning in the classroom (such as the synthesis of Dilantin, the seizure drug!). The lab reports (5) are highly structured, so once you understand how the professor and TA want them to be completed, they are long, but doable.",
    "Great to take because it's a painless class that meets premed\/major requirements. Same as Orgo 1 lab but even less stress because you know how to do everything already.",
    "Yes -- great lab course, though if you are taking it it's probably required.",
    "it s a chill half credit, not bad at all.",
    "Take it! It's one of the easiest labs and really chill. All you do is do EP's, make cool stuff, and usually you'll get out early. There's not much work besides EP's, post labs, and studying for the exam.",
    "Fair lab course, one of the few that is truly 1\/2 credit worth of work per week. DiMeglio is awesome, and TAs usually are fair graders. No complains, will actually miss this lab (if you're pre-med, it's likely the last wet-lab, or chem lab, that you'll take!).",
    "Orgo 2 lab is quite an enjoyable lab. It's a reasonable amount of work and with a cool TF like Swick, you will experience minimal suffering for a lab course. If you put in a decent amount of work, getting an A shouldn't be too difficult.",
    "good class. if u took CHEM 221L then it's just more of the same",
    "CHEM 223L is the standard lab course. It goes well with the second semester of orgo and it isn't too much work, especially if you stay on top of it.",
    "Orgo II lab is orgo II lab, much improved because you've mastered all the routines from Orgo I.",
    "If you've taken first semester orgo lab, then you know what you're in for: a well-run, chill atmosphere lab environment with experiments that, while lengthy, are precisely captured in the course packet and work like a charm. Since you learned all the techniques through 222L, this semester focuses on a different synthesis every week; our class actually had a different curriculum because we were the first to use a new lab space, and our experiments were divided into three \"projects\" of related organic concepts. They were, on average, longer than what past years' students have said, and the constant mixing reagents, heating, crystallizing, recrystallizing, filtering, and data taking does get repetitive, but on the plus side you get Dr. DiMeglio, who has built such a culture of geniality and support in her labs that it trickles all the way from the lab staff to the TAs. Prepare to put in some work on the lab reports and study diligently from the study packet for the final!",
    "Lab is lab! Nothing too great, nothing too painful. You have a lab report every other week or so that does take a significant amount of time, but it ends up being okay.",
    "CHEM 223L is a good, straight-forward organic chemistry lab. It is better than first semester orgo lab, in the sense that the experiments carried out overlap more with the material you cover during lecture. It is nice to see things you have been learning in class the past two orgo semesters are applied in the lab. Overall, CHEM 223L is a pretty fun, straight-forward lab where you will continue to learn about organic chemistry and its applications. Also, it is much less redundant than a lot of other labs, which is great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I personally enjoyed it a lot more than the first semester of Organic Chemistry lab, and I think I learned a lot about both organic chemistry and lab procedure through my lab experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs a science lab credit and is comfortable with the concepts of Organic Chemistry.",
    "This course is wonderful. With a great TA, it's actually very fun to attend, because the experiments are engaging, the material coincides well with Organic Chemistry second semester lecture. Professor DiMeglio is very personable and helpful, and you can tell she has put a lot of thought into the experiments she is teaching. The lab reports are manageable, and the final exam is very fair. This is definitely a must-take lab if you plan on taking lab courses at Yale.",
    "When you take this course, take the time to get to know the teaching staff, especially Dr. DiMeglio - they're a great group, and being able to communicate easily with them will help you in the long run.",
    "Nice course.",
    "its not that interesting. if you can motivate yourself to be interested in the writing assignments, youll feel ok. otherwise it will just feel like busy work. take it only if you have have to."
