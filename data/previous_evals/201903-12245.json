    "I learned so much about American silver in every aspect. I can distinguish between Boston and New York styles, recognize the Rococo and the Neo-Classical in silver, and tell you how a silver teapot was fabricated. I understand the timeline of stylistic and technological advances and how they affected and were affected by society. I got practice with close looking at objects and label writing. And I proposed an entire exhibition of American silver, which was really exciting and very complex.",
    "This class develops skills in understanding objects and also provides important insights on aspects of American history.",
    "I learned so much about American history, the importance of silver in the American imagination and its various uses, and the decorative arts. Furthermore, through the assignments I learned how to write labels and exhibition proposals.",
    "Didn't know anything about American Silver before this class and also learned about the analytical skills of evaluating pieces of art within their historical contexts.",
    "I gained a fantastic introduction to the American decorative arts from a unique museum perspective. I also gained strong research skills and learned how to dig deep to explore the history of a specific object.",
    "I learned from YUAGs fascinating collection of American silver (best in the country!) and used them to understand the material culture of the US starting from the colonial period all the way to modern days. I also learned how to write about decorative arts and write labels for exhibitions properly."

   "comments": [
    "I think the structure of the course was really effective. It was amazing to be able to use the YUAG's collection to learn the history of American silver. The assignments were fun and I loved begin able to focus on my object all semester. The final project was really challenging in an exciting way and I was really proud that I could propose an entire exhibition after only one semester of exposure to silver.",
    "The format of the course is excellent it is such a wonderful opportunity to be able to handle and discuss objects in the YUAG's collection on a weekly basis. Professor Gordon is an amazing instructor and makes the course incredibly engaging.",
    "The only weaknesses were that there was so much material to get through every class that sometimes we didn't get to all of it.",
    "Strength: Amazing collection through the YUAG and being able to engage with the material with background knowledge. Weakness: Maybe just a little more instruction on the first writing assignment before it was due but the feedback was super helpful.",
    "I really liked how it was very objects based. The objects that readings covered were available in the YUAGs collection so we were able to interact with them directly, which really enriched my learning process. It did feel very lecture based at times, and there was not much room for discussion.",
    "I really like the object-based instruction model! Engaging with the objects helped my understanding so much better. Sometimes, though, we run out of time so perhaps either fewer objects per class or a better way of rearranging the presentation (as in not every object needs to be passed around the entire class)?"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This course is special because students learn how to handle objects that are at the YUAG which enhances one's learning.",
    "Yes! It is really fun to be able to touch the objects and gives you a new insight into looking at art objects. I never knew silver could be so complex and interesting. It's also a really welcoming environment for non-Art-History majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student working with objects in the YUAG collection every week is an amazing opportunity and Professor Gordon is an excellent instructor.",
    "Yes, it was a great way to learn about the decorative arts and american history.",
    "Absolutely!!! I went in with no art history background and it was easily my favorite class every single week.",
    "I definitely would. Its a very unique art history course that is not dependent on slides but rather on direct tangible interaction with objects. I really enjoyed every session.",
    "Yes, to anyone interested in material culture viewed through decorative arts."
