   "comments": [
    "I deepened my knowledge of early modern ethics.",
    "Received so much great insight from Prof Darwall and the highly capable philosophy PhD students. Great seminar.",
    "This course was a little over my head at first, but I really felt my understanding of such difficult philosophy improve over the term. The final paper was an amazing challenge and I thought Darwall gave excellent feedback on my reading responses to help guide my thinking through each philosopher.",
    "A very nuanced look at moral psychology through the early modern period.",
    "I definitely feel that my ability to read and understand a variety of historical philosophy texts has improved in this class, since we have much to read. The class also gives me a taste of a broad range of ethical theories in early modern philosophy.",
    "Gained knowledge of British sentimentalist moral philosophy. Deepened my knowledge of Kant's moral philosophy. Sharpened skills for close reading and identifying philosophical problems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof Darwall clearly has insights into the material and it was good to hear them. But this class was ostensibly a seminar - discussion should have been student-led, or at least student-driven. Instead the class took the form of a question-and-answer session. There were also far too many students - it should have been capped at 20, at the most.",
    "Strengths -- amazing seminar, in-depth and well-taught. Weaknesses -- felt that there was always too much content to be covered each seminar. Maybe the number of thinkers we read can be reduced.",
    "Every philosopher we read and discussed we did so thoroughly and carefully, which led to interesting remarks and insights yet I believe that we would more often than not focus on details that were uninteresting or that were not particularly central to the claims and ideas these philosophers were presenting in their works. I found it odd that we never got grades for our reading responses, although Prof. Darwall provided very useful feedback and commentary to think about.",
    "Too many people in the class; we did not discuss much of the text at all, spending far too much time on uninteresting details of the text. But the authors on the syllabus are very good reading.",
    "The seminar included a large number of people, which made seminar-type discussion difficult.",
    "Overall, this course was good. An interesting topic, but the 7-9pm course time was brutal. The response papers throughout the semester ensured that you got to do a deeper reading of the course material, but the fact that there were 30 people in the seminar meant that you didn't always necessarily get to talk about the things that you looked at in your paper. The smaller response papers receive comments, but no grades, so it's hard to know how you're doing in the class.",
    "Discussions in the seminar meetings cover the important issues in the readings really well, but the readings sometimes feel a little repetitive -- there is so much similarity between some of the theories that we discuss that the detailed discussion of each seems somewhat superfluous.",
    "The professor is knowledgeable and patient. He always makes himself available for office hours. The organization for the seminar could be improved though. It is a large seminar with cerca 30 students, and the discussions usually only engage a small fraction of the students. The classes could be better structured with some central questions and roadmap for each class.",
    "The greatest weakness was that there were way too many people accepted in the seminar. This led to a lack of engagement of many students. The graduate\/undergraduate student ratio was also off, and undergraduates were not able to take much out of the graduate level discussion that took place the majority of the time."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Possibly. To be honest I mostly came away from the course thinking that Hobbes, Hume, Hutcheson, et al were a lot more boring to read than I anticipated. And if you don't like the readings or hearing about them in detail there's not much reason to take the class: it is a text-centered class on early modern ethics.",
    "Yes! Take it! It's one of the most intellectually stimulating seminars with equally equipped and capable students (mostly PhDs).",
    "A very tough course for those up to the challenge. If you put in the time to read each philosopher carefully, speaking up in class becomes easier and you'll feel more engaged generally. Advice: take this class with a DS friend.",
    "I do recommend this courseit is a good introduction to the history of early modern ethics, and the texts we read are interesting. The discussions however were not very compelling and I would often find myself struggling to stay focused.",
    "I would only recommend the class if two changes were made. Limiting the seminar size to less than 20 and committing to discuss more of the text during each class session.",
    "The class material is really interesting, so if you can deal with the time of the class, the size of the class, and the lack of grading, then I would suggest the class.",
    "It's a good survey of theories of ethics in the early modern period. The readings are not the easiest to digest. The instructor is knowledgeable and kind. I'd recommend it if you are interested in the topics. (Take a glance at some of the readings and maybe prof. Darwall's book British Moralists beforehand and see if you are interested.)"
