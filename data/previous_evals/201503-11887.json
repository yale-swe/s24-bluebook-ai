    "Its a good introductory English class that you don't necessarily have to be a humanities person to enjoy- the reading materials vary quite a bit from one another, which I liked, as other English classes seemed a little more focused on certain things. The reading responses are the biggest work component, but if you do the reading they come fairly easily.",
    "This course covers most of the essentials of American literature in just a few short months, so if a student is dedicated to the readings I would say it is definitely worth taking.",
    "An introductory English class that focuses on American authors. The reading list includes some classics as well as more unknown authors and pieces. Be prepared for 80 pages of reading per class (although you could get away with only doing part of the reading if that work is not the one you are using I write a paper) and multiple research papers.",
    "American Literature was a wonderful course - my favorite English course so far! The literature choice was incredible, and I was so glad we went from Whitman and Melville to Dickinson, Stein, and Nabokov, to modern writers such as Teju Cole and Claudia Rankine. A very new twist on the American Literature canon, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed. What's more, this class is accessible to English and non-English majors alike, so I recommend it to all of my friends. If you can, take the class with Sunny Xiang - she was fantastic: kind, welcoming, and her classes were always excellently taught. Highly, highly recommended!",
    "If you like literature that \/doesn't\/ follow the European tradition--that starts whole new literary movements--that is really, really relevant to the American identity today--then check out this class. You've probably read some of the material in high school, but now you'll realize just how weird, amusing, and\/or important these authors are.",
    "127 is a quickly moving survey of a variety of literature that doesn't feel particularly connected. Each week is fresh and interesting. Even for non-English majors, the class is very manageable. Prof. Xiang is one of the kindest professors I've ever had, and she's very willing to work with students outside of class.",
    "I would not recommend the class to a student who does not enjoy working with archival sources, or to a student who is not capable of reading massive amounts while keeping up other course obligations.",
    "No, I would not recommend the class."
