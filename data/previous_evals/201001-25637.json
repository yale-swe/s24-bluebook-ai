    "It would be nice if the course went a bit more in depth and intensively into the methods.",
    "The course was desgined to be a seminar, but due to the large number of students it changed its format to lecture. This was a mistake. Reading papers and then hearing the professor or PHD students talk about the papers seemed like double work. If the class is kept as lecture, the contents must change. Otherwise please limit the number of students in the class and make it a seminar",
    "Question 5. Instructor was very responsive by changing the class from a seminar to a lecture to include as many students as possible.Question 7. Professor Mendelsohn i a clear leader on this field and an excellent instructor.Question 6. The class was very diverse in background, so the pace was probably fast for students without the economics background though a bit slow for the students with more familiarity with the material.",
    "This could have been an amazing, in-depth class giving practical tools and theoretical concepts on the economic valuation of the environment. It should have stayed a seminar.The fact that a bunch of students who had very little background in economics were taking the class watered down the material very much. I was looking for a rigorous class on environmental economics and that is not what I found.",
    "The instructor is a guru in the field and so you get to enjoy all the nitty gritty of valuation technologies out there. He is available during his hours. Great class as it firmed the little understanding I had about valuation. - you learn which method is good for what kind of valuation, their strenghts and weaknesesses and you learn of some practical examples where they have been used. HOWEVER, if you are a guru in valuation techniques, you may need a more advanced course. I was in elementary stages and loved it. For those really scared of the math, don't worry, I survived. You donot get bombarded with that. As a policy person, or a program manager etc. you need to understand the basic language of valuation and hence the course may be a must take",
    "This course was good. I learned a lot about putting a numerical value on things that are important but the benefits of which are difficult to measure. It certainly would have been better as a smaller conversation, but I appreciate that Professor Mendelsohn didn't prevent anyone from taking it. A more organized presentation of the methods that the course would cover, at the beginning of the course, would have been helpful. Also, some of the lectures by the PhD students got too heavy on the math.",
    "Qu 4: I think I would have benefited more if reading responses were required for atleast 2 readings just so that i could have better articulated and absorbed what I was reading earlier in the semester.",
    "Q 8: this class turned out to be an overview of methods for valuation as opposed to the skills-based class that it was advertised as. If you're looking to acquire the skills to do econ valuation of the environment, you won't get that. You will gain a familiarity with various methods, but unless you have econometrics and a strong stats background there's no way you'll be able to do some of these types of studies.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and took a lot away from it, when Professor Mendelsohn was lecturing - he's an amazing resource, and knows a lot, yet manages to make complicated issues understandable for us without talking down to us. That's a great skill. He's a very engaging speaker and easy to follow, so a lecture-style class is great for him. I was less happy with the presentations given by the PhD students - some of them were good, most of them were not, some were awful or impossible to follow, or not at all in line with what Professor Mendelsohn was trying to teach us (big picture! not equations!) However, for most of these, Professor Mendelsohn gave a short but essential wrap up. Without that, I would have been lost.",
    "Homework assignments would be very helpful: students can practice techniques, and demonstrate that they are aware of the 'grand scheme of things' as they move through the course.",
    "This was a great course. Professor Mendelsohn is magnificent, brilliant. It is amazing how close to reality are the cases we discussed in class.I understand that Prof. and his TA tried on a session to review econometrics concepts but in my view it was not enough to we navigate comfortable through the cases.This was a big class, well diverse, with Phd, masters and even undergrad at the same classroom, therefore I suggest to the coming session to have an optional TA review session on a weekly basis. On these sessions students will have better incentives to make questions, even ones that are not general doubts to a large class!"

    "It is a case based class with a mix of introductory and advanced studies taught by the best in the field.",
    "Prof. Mendelsohn is a good teacher and it is interesting to hear him discuss how the valuation studies were done.Also - preparing for the exam was helpful. The exam was not detail-oriented, but it was broad in scope and covered concepts from each week of the class. Reviewing notes from each week was very helpful. I think many classes at F&ES could learn from this - keep the exam simple. Even if it doesn't delve into too much detail, if it is comprehensive, students will certainly learn a lot from reviewing the course in its entirety.",
    "You determine how much you are going to get out of the course. If you do all of the readings, and pay attention in class, you'll learn a lot. I was very pleased with the amount of information I took from this course.",

    "The instructor, his love of teaching, patience for students, and willingness to engage in discussion. He looks at you kindly, whatever you ask - he cares about you understanding!",
    "The best thing, for me, was how much I learned. This was an entirely new area for me. I consider this subject mater extremely important for all environmental managers, definitely something to have in the tool box. The course was accessible to all levels of economic expertise, which was wonderful.",
    "The comprehensive survey of techniques used to measure environmental values and the detailed assessment of the pros and cons of the techniques as well as specific information about how to complete a study in practical terms.",

   "comments": [
    "It would be nice if the course went a bit more in depth and intensively into the methods.",
    "The class was very big and perhaps that made it difficult to have a cohesive lecture.",
    "3 hours was too long!",
    "the class felt a little unorganized. The instructor followed the syllabus well but I don't think the assignments were very useful. I'd rather have actually done a study. Also, the doctoral student presentations could vastly be improved. I think the course should be limited to people with econometrics.",
    "The course materials were little high level. The sub-materials, especially using the power point slides, was very helpful for me.",
    "Mendelsohn is a great instructor, however I believe this course is better taught as a seminar.",
    "The workload is all at the end. I felt like my paper was rushed because I had a hard time conceptualizing it early on- without having a good idea about all the valuation methods at my disposal.The PHD presentations were too complicated sometimes. May be they should have been given some of the more basic topics and not equation-heavy material.",
    "I suggest having a lecture course with more introduction material to cover the very important valuation methods to a broader group of students and also having the advanced seminar format for the students with an economics focus and background.",
    "Disclaimer: this course was supposed to be a small seminar but became a large lecture in shopping period and Prof. Mendelsohn changed the format of the course (hence, these answers are different than what could have been if the course were done as planned as a smaller one).Some of the PhD students made presentations that should have been better reviewed by Prof. Mendelsohn or Shannon beforehand. Some were extremely technical - which perhaps could have worked in a seminar of other PhDs, but were not effective in the larger group.More organized direction on the final paper would be good. In all, things turned out okay, however a bit more organization would have been good. Take a class early in the semester, lay out dates, expectations of the paper, and discuss the objectives - this would help set the stage later on in the semester. The paper was discussed early on, but details were scant for most of the course.More direction on the exam would have helped too.As with the final paper, we were eventually given some scant information and I believe all turned out okay, however a more defined set of direction for what the exam was going to be would have been helpful.Lastly - on the exam: The test itself was confusing at times b\/c there were various possibile answers for each question - some certainly more right than others, but relatively-correct answers (judgment calls I'd say) for many different ones. It would be interesting to get back our exams with some discussion as to our choices. This isn't necessarily a bad part of the class, but if they are graded without deference to the fact that some answers COULD be correct, then this will be detrimental to the course.",
    "I think the class was too large, and would have benefited from a smaller group.",
    "Mendelsohn's propaganda and the fact that I learned very few concrete things from the class.STATA? Study designs? Problem sets?",
    "It would be great to have problem sets to practice, at least superficially, some valuation techniques.",
    "lectures were not all given by the professor and many of the lectures given by phd students were sub par.the course was not that well planned out in terms of assessment. assignments were a little unclear as were expectations for the final exam.",
    "The TA should come from the econ department. The TA should be knowledgeable on the subject. The fact that you took the class previously doesn't make you a good TA. The TA must have broader knowledge of the subject, beyond what is being taught in class. For economics, these people can be found in econ department.",
    "Some of the doctoral student presentation on course material were unclear. The material for these weeks were sometimes not covered well.",
    "Outlining what are the important elements of each paper: Method (&Definitions), applicability, strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I thought most of the presentations of papers done by Ph.D. students were not that helpful. Many of them simply were not strong presenters and the fact that we had to rely on the poor-acoustics in Bowers to understand them made it very difficult to understand many of the presenters. The whole scenario was a bit frustrating. I enjoyed Prof. Mendelsohn's lectures and got much more out of them.I also think that the course should either have two sections or limited to no more than 25 students. Prof. Mendelsohn did not control the size of the class and as a result we ended up having a huge class with very limited discussion.",
    "Maybe the PhD students could have been forced to stick more to what Professor Mendelsohn thinks is important, and less to what they think is important (calculus?).",
    "Homework assignments would be helpful.",
    "The econometrics is intimidating and overwhelming. I would guess that some students found any discussion of econometrics very difficult and some found the lack of discussion of econometrics frustrating. I would consider making one course that has econometrics as a prerequisite and another that doesn't and does not discuss econometrics at all.",
    "Although it was interesting to have PhD candidates present papers, a few of the presentations were rather econometrics-heavy, leading to some confusion. Perhaps, a clearer understanding of the expectations for paper presenting could be provided.",
    "Making a class that is appropriate for the backgrounds of the people in the class. Also perhaps having some simple outside of class exercises to get a better grasp of the concepts mentioned in papers (if it is to remain a lecture course).",
    "If to continue as a lecture, I suggest one additional TA (two TA would be much better) and they should do review session on weekly basis.",
    "this course was not well designed at all. we read articles and then learned about the techniques through these articles. it would have been more effective if we learned about the techniques and were able to apply them. The classes themselves were organized around these articles which made the classes very boring, and also made it difficult to retain much knowledge about the techniques.3 hours of lecture is also very painful. the initial idea of having this be a seminar also made no sense. The purpose of this class should be to teach these different valuation techniques or be an introduction to econometrics for a student with little or no economics background.The PhD student presentations were pretty much a bad idea. Most of them made absolutely no sense to the 50 master's students in the class. They need to learn to communicate in a lay language.Mendelsohn is a great guy, but this class was way below my expectations. Mendelsohn teaches a great undergrad class, however the way he teaches FES students somehow isn't effective."

The office hours do get a littlecrazy though.The TA is great - very patient, helpful, good at explaining complicated issues, takes great notes and almost always has an answer but will admit when she doesn't know things. Thank you! Should have taken more advantage of her.",
    "The TA was NOT very responsive, or very helpful. Emails were often not responded to. There was only one review session (in spite of plenty of demonstrated need and requests for these), and this particular econometrics review session was performed hastily, with little regard to whether students understood or not. It was not clear why this particular student was the TA, as she did not seem very interested in helping her colleagues. She did seem a bit more responsive on an individual basis.",
    "The availability of the instructor was limited. I would suggest that he plan on holding more office hours in the future.",
    "Excellent availability and quality of help from both the instructor and the TA.",
