While moving through the work of developing and workshopping the prospectus, this course also helped me to become aware of my writing habits. The workshop model facilitated discussion across our cohort that gave me fresh perspective on my work and also generated excitement and support among all of us for our projects."

    "This course provided a great deal of structure and support for beginning the prospectus writing process. The only significant weakness with the course was the timing of it--I wish we could have started the workshop during the second semester of the second year. It felt somewhat jarring to just be starting the conversation about our dissertation's and then to move very quickly towards solidifying our projects. Perhaps in the future, the workshop can meet at least one time in the Spring of second year, to give students a sense that they should be developing a strong sense of their project over the summer, in addition to studying for exams."
