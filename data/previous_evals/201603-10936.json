    "I developed my German speaking and writing abilities and furthered my interest in German studies.",
    "I definitely improved my German, got deep understanding of the German media, and had the opportunity to do a highly personalized final project. The classes were always engaging and intellectually stimulating. The assignments were light, accumulatively very helpful. This class is not just a language class, it is 50% language+ 50% German culture combined with many fun tasks. This being said, this class is very well-organized and diverse enough for everyone to learn something new and helpful.",
    "The class is a discussion class so you focus on improving speaking. There's a final paper at the end but you can choose to design a website instead. I would recommend this class.",
    "I developed my knowledge of media in Germany and German culture. I developed my spontaneous conversational speaking skills and consolidated my higher level grammar skills.",
    "This course provided me with an understanding of contemporary German culture, particularly German media, its forms, and its uses. My German improved substantially and the final project gave me an opportunity to study a specific and more focused idea of my own choosing, which made the course very fulfilling. After this course, I feel as though I could travel to or visit Germany with more confidence due to a greater understanding of German media, news, television, politics, etc.",
    "How to analyze German and American media forms."

   "comments": [
    "The course could have been more well-organized with the writing assignments (it didn't feel like they were connected to the forms of media we were looking at in class) but other than that I really enjoyed it!",
    "Strengths: Gives students a chance to hone conversational skills while discussing modern-day issues in Germany. Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "I wish there could be more speaking tasks so that we could speak more German outside classroom.",
    "Strengths: -it was always varied and kept me engaged -a huge variety of assignments -Theresa is engaging -small class size Weaknesses: -none!",
    "I found the course to be very well organized. The readings were well selected and always prompted interesting discussion in class and the assignments were diversified and allowed for us to be creative to whatever extent we wanted.",
    "I think that the course may benefit from many brief writing assignments and a focus on how to improve these.",
    "Strengths: quite interesting, helped me stay informed on current events Weaknesses: occasionally unclear on the requirements or expectations for assignments or projects."

   "comments": [
    "Good intro L5 course to be taken directly after L4.",
    "I believe that any student who has the L5 language ability necessary would be well suited for this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to someone who has certain level of German proficiency This is important because this class is for students who either have taken L1-L4 or have learned German for relatively a long time. But if you are one of these types, you should definitely take this class because 1. this is the best class offered by German department, and 2. Theresa is awesome.",
    "Definitely, especially if Theresa teaches it as she is fantastic and very approachable. The class teaches you a lot about life in Germany now and you can improve all aspects of your German.",
    "This is an enjoyable class with a low workload. You read German articles, a novel, listen to radio shows, and watch TV and movies. There are no tests but instead several creative assignments throughout the term. That's because this is not, even if it is still named GMAN 150, not a language class extension of GMAN 140. You are expected to come in with a solid German base, and the focus is on refining your communication skills while learning about different forms of German media, not on language acquisition. Overall, I would recommend it. Theresa is one of my favorite teachers that I have had at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It explored contemporary Germany through the analysis of various forms of media. I learned not only a lot about media itself, but a substantial amount about German culture, politics, and society. If you have taken an L5 German class before, this class will be very manageable but your German will definitely still improve. The course also seems practical and applicable for those planning to visit Germany. Definitely take the course with Theresa, she's an unbelievable instructor.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to a student looking to study german at L5 level, interested in Media studies."
