    "Interesting course that allows you to delve really deeply into a concentrated subject of study. And lots of fun.",
    "Very interesting course. Good survey of the Futurism time period. Definitely a good class for the creatively-inclined. Our projects often consisted of drawing, constructing small sculptures, and even cooking! However if you prefer very organized, structured classes, I'm not sure you would like it.",
    "Futurism was a very interesting movement at the beginning of the 21st century, and is key in better understanding the logic to the modern world we live in today. However, this class lacks the rigor to make this possible. Dean Fabbri is a really wonderful professor, but expectations must be raised to make this class worth spending a credit on.",
    "You cook for a class, go to the YUAG for two, beineke for one. Its so much fun! Take this class. I looked forward to it every week",
    "Definitely would recommend it. Thrilling topic in a great seminar format."
