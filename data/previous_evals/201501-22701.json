    "The senior essay in religious studies is a really great process. There is guidance at each step of the way, and it is really a chance to experience what professors actually do besides teaching. Deadlines always feel like they are far in the future -- they're not!! If you pick a topic about which you are passionate, and work slowly and diligently, it will turn out great in the end, and you will grow a great deal as a thinker."
