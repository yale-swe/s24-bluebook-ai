   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "How memory systems work, Hebbian plasticity and LTP, well-known psychologists in the field.",
    "In this class, I learned how to learn. The class itself is heavy on memorization, and being a class about Learning and Memory, you picked up a few tactics on how best to study. I also learned how to synthesize a great deal of information and learn how to study for the specific style of exam Professor Brown gives. It's also a class that teaches you how to be self-driven, since many of the assignments come with very little instruction and it's kind of a you get what you put in type of situation.",
    "This course is great for learning how to better prepare for exams, considering that the topic is about learning and memory. This course will also help you learn how to conduct experiments and write up formal lab reports for psychology. The experiments were really fun to do, and they also help you to synthesize the information that you learned about in lectures.",
    "My path through the psychology department had, until this point, incorporated little to no neuroscience or biology. In this class, I finally got a thorough education in the brain structures involved in psychological processes. I am very glad to have learned about such biological processes through the lens 'learning and memory.' The framework of the class helped me understand how brain structures interact in the context of one set of cognitive processes. This course was also taught in a smaller seminar style, though was delivered in lecture form--an interesting hybrid of course styles that encouraged engagement with material, but also a more individualistic approach to learning.",
    "In this course, I developed the insight into the different kinds of learning and memory that humans, and other animals, have. I think this insight is extremely useful because these processes are applicable to virtually every aspect of life, and I have found myself noticing many things in my own life that relate back to this course.",
    "I really learned a TON, much of which was pretty applicable though challenging at times.",
    "I learned a significant amount of detailed information about the neurobiology and psychology of learning and memory. I enjoyed the integration of small and large scale information (between molecular mechanisms and cognitive or psychological paradigms)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I was very grateful for how receptive Professor Brown was for questions in class. I enjoyed the combination of interesting labs, good discussions, and the straightforwardness of the exams. However, I may have appreciated more guidance in terms of what to study from the PowerPoints.",
    "Weaknesses: lack of communication. The syllabus does not indicate the number of assignments you will be given throughout the semester, nor does it explain how tests, homework, participation, etc. will be weighted in your final grade. Also, the professor goes through slides extremely quickly, so be prepared to be a fast note-taker. Strengths: the course material and textbook align very closely, making studying for exams very straightforward. The material itself is also extremely interesting and applicable to real life. You will learn how to apply the theories of learning and memory to everyday situations.",
    "I really enjoyed the small class size of 20 or less students. This allowed for lively discussion and interaction with my classmates about the course material. The workload seems very fair, with 3 exams, 3 labs, and 1 homework assignment. The exams are hard and fair and leave you feeling that you learned the important aspects of the course. Overall I think the course is designed really well, and i don't see any need for improvement.",
    "I learned a lot about asking for help in this course...especially if science\/rote learning is not your thing. The professor and TA are very kind and willing to help you. Since some people may come in with limited\/no neuro background, maybe consider offering a TA session at the beginning of the semester to go over some basic stuff?",
    "I wish I had been able to engage with the course material more deeply than I did--part of that was my own negligence, but another part of that was the manner in which the course was structured. In the future, students may be encouraged to process subject matter more carefully if the class were more interactive. I did not find sitting a lab and staring at powerpoint slides on a computer screen for an hour and fifteen minutes to be the most conducive to learning. That said, I appreciated the few days when we did labs and engaged with material in a more interactive way.",
    "it'd be great if the tests utilized more critical thinking than rote memorization, especially of names and historical facts.",
    "For me, the major strength of this course was the extremely interesting and relevant material that we covered. I enjoyed each lecture, while also feeling like I had to put forth a fair amount of effort during each lecture to ensure that I was fully understanding each concept. The weakness of the course may be that the tests are extremely detail-oriented to the extent that some of the details tested seemed a bit irrelevant; basically, it's just straight, in-depth memorization with little deeper thinking required. Because of this, the tests were not too challenging as long as you had prepared correctly, but it took a test or two to learn how to best study.",
    "I enjoyed the labs, but not the writeups.",
    "The course is well taught, and presented very well by Professor Brown. I found the material very interesting and engaging. I enjoyed that we had both lectures and in-class activities to reinforce the information. I appreciated that the amount of work was not a burden, that it did a very good job in facilitating learning, and that the assignments were fun and different."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended! Very interesting topics and amazing professor.",
    "Yes absolutely, if you are interested in psychology and cognitive science. It is a relatively stress free course - 3 non-cumulative exams that are basically all memorization (and not that difficult of memorization). You get to do some cool experiments using yourself as the subject, testing your own memory strength.",
    "Learning and Memory is a fine class, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. First of all, the exams (three midterms, no final) are rote memorization of the slides (ironic, I know). Maybe that's good for you grade-wise, maybe that's bad, but either way it doesn't allow for a lot of critical engagement with the material. Second, don't expect to get a whole lot about the neurobiology\/neurophysiology of memory, even though it's Thomas Brown who's teaching. It's definitely a psych course, focused on behavioral processes and brain (read: brain region) substrates. Anyone interested in molecular or cellular-level mechanisms of memory formation will be much better off taking Neurobiology. Finally, despite the cap on the number of students in the course, class time is mostly spent with him reading off the slides, so don't expect anything seminar style. To his credit though, Prof. Brown is always open to spending time after class talking to students. Overall, decent class, but not worth getting super excited about.",
    "Although it might be tough to get in if you are an underclassman, this is a great course to take and I highly recommend taking this course if you are a psychology major. Professor Brown is one of the top experts in the field and he always helped his students to understand the course material. Learning and memory are so fundamental to human behavior and our identity. You will gain a lot from this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was a great introduction to the world of seminar-style psychology classes, and can function either as a reinforcement of or an appetizer for the more neuroscience-related psychology courses offered here.",
    "Dr. Brown provides an in-depth, fascinating overview of all the different memory systems. His lectures are riddled with intermittent tangents that often question the validity of new research and theories. He basically founded the field of neuroscience, so his input is extremely insightful. He's also just a warm, kind man who makes an effort to know his students. I only had issue with the tests. I've never been in a class that relied more upon rote memorization. There is very little critical thinking involved. With that being said, you'll do well as long as you memorize every single nitty gritty detail on the slides.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found the material extremely interesting, because learning and memory obviously apply to many situations in life. The class was small at around 20 people, which was nice, but also lecture-based, meaning there wasn't much participation required, for better or worse. I found each lecture engaging, and the course was organized very well in a way that allowed past concepts to build upon each other. The work is very backloaded, with more assignments in the second half of the semester. The tests are extremely detail-oriented and require a lot of memorization, without much deeper analysis; that being said, I think it is easy to do well as long as you fully prepare for each exam. Professor Brown is very nice and extremely knowledgeable. Overall, this was one of my favorite courses this semester, and I would definitely encourage anyone interested in the subject to take it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in any aspect of learning and memory. I found the information very beneficial to know to understand all basic mental processes, and some of it can even be applied to your own life as a student. The workload is manageable and actually fun, and the lectures are broken up with activities every several weeks."
