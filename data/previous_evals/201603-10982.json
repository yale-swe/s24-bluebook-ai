   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was super helpful in terms of walking us through the process of writing a research proposal",
    "I learned how to write up a research project proposal and present that idea to the class.",
    "I learned a great deal about what it takes to carry out your own research project, how to address the challenges you will face, and more broadly how to make a meaningful project idea into a reality.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and loved the instructor and TAs. However, I felt like I dind't really learn very much from this class. While we did discuss research methods and I learned more about how global health research is conducted, I'm not sure that I needed an entire class dedicated to the subject. It really seemed like the class was trying to substitute direct experience, which I'm not sure was super effective.",
    "Gaining a firm understanding of qualitative and quantitative research methods, how to approach every aspect of a proposal--including cultural context, understanding, and humility, working with and providing feedback to students as a critical skill",
    "I gained a greater awareness of the challenges of health research. I wish a little more time had been spent on ethics",
    "I learned exactly what the course set out to teach: research methods and ethics. We came away with a good grasp of beginning to develop research proposals while thinking critically about questions, methods, limitations, ethics, and logistics.",
    "I learned about different research methodologies, both qualitative and quantitative. I also learned about different aspects of global health research, very practical aspects.",
    "Learned so much on research design and ethical considerations! Employed really important skills such as literature reviews, identifying research gaps, convincing people your research is important, survey instrument design, and more. Awesome class!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the amount of support given to students in terms of writing a proposal and identifying a feasible project for the summer. Weaknesses: It's unfortunate that the timeline doesn't always line up with creating an actual project proposal, so that many people by the end were writing proposals for projects that were either slightly or very different from what they actually plan on doing this summer.",
    "I'm a Global Health Fellow, so I hoped to get my summer research proposal out of the class. However, September was just too soon to decide what the project would entail, and I didn't want to rewrite the intro, so I just wrote up a fake project. I wonder if we could turn our focus more concrete towards November? And focus on skills-building in the earlier weeks. I also felt like I could skip the readings every week and still have a good grasp of the topic. A lot of times there were too many hours of readings for the output they would have provided.",
    "I LOVE the way that the class is set up for large and small discussions. I am someone who much prefers small group discussion and I find that we do this far too rarely in my other classes. I also enjoyed the activities we did like making an interview guide in class.",
    "I know that this class is geared towards helping students design their summer project and while I think it did help some I think to be serious about a summer project the most important thing would be to find a professor at Yale to work under. Therefore, while the class offered some ideas as to developing a project, I certainly didn't feel like it was very necessary. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed going to class every day and I think it offered important connections and insights into the researching world of global health which I appreciated.",
    "This course was excellent in providing very essential skills for students interested in developing proposal. I appreciated that the course did not consist of useless textbook readings simply to have readings, but ALL journal articles and materials were very useful towards the development of the proposal",
    "Strengths - The progression of the course is clear and comfortable. - The workshopping of specific articles and papers was very helpful and allowed us to learn through critique. - It was awesome to come away with a product I can actually use. - The course instructors were all well-versed and immensely helpful. - Integration of real-world examples and even having visitors from the field of global health helps students expand their knowledge. Weakness - It would have been helpful to walk through examples of research proposals in class.",
    "The strengths are the small class size and the attention each student gets for their project. The main weakness is that a lot of what we learn are usually things we have already learned before, I didn't feel like I actually learned a lot of new things.",
    "Strengths: - freedom to design a project on your topic of interest - learn strengths and weaknesses of multiple different types of research - great discussion of ethical issues - discussion of research papers to analyze both their research design as well as how they wrote up their results - really supportive professor and TAs -- so knowledgable! Weaknesses: - the beginning of the class feels very rushed, but then halfway through the semester it slows down a ton -- I feel like the work could be distributed more evenly - would keep more discussion of research papers in the second half of the semester - do more to encourage students to work together for those actually trying to carry out their project -- a team of students make these projects so much more feasible given the very short time frame of a single summer for data collection - more feedback from the TAs on the initial sampling\/methods proposal",
    "I found the workload of readings to be a bit heavy in the beginning of the semester, and wish that class time was spent engaging more with other students in discussions rather than analyzing the readings. Otherwise a great course for Global Health scholars\/fellows. I very much appreciated the amount of feedback received throughout the semester, and believe that feedback played a huge role in my improvement and growth as a student"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! To anyone who is interested in developing a public health research project.",
    "This was a solid research methods course. You may not come out of it with a real-life project proposal if you don't know what you want to do at the start of the course. However, it was still useful to go through the motions and get a feel for writing projects.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Curry is so kind and enthusiastic--she makes it a joy to be in class. I love the way the class is set up for small and large group discussions, which allows students of different types to contribute in their own ways. This class helped me actually understand what it would take to carry out my own research project and convinced me that it is possible.",
    "Yes! I loved this course. Professor and teaching fellows are incredibly engaged and there to help you grow as researchers and future global health practitioners. I really loved this class so much!!!",
    "If you're interested in doing a summer project in global health and have an idea and professor in mind then this class is definitely worthwhile and will help guide you along the process. Otherwise, I'm not sure that it would have too much value.",
    "YES This course is essential to all students interested in global\/public health who may be developing a proposal for implementation over the summer. Professor Curry and the TAs are incredible and provided detailed and helpful feedback after each piece of the proposal--which many other classes fail to achieve. The workload was very manageable, as all assignments are there for the purpose of developing the semester-long proposal",
    "Good class, but a little frustrating, as it seemed to me going in that the project was more realistic than it was; for most people it ended up being a thought experiment.",
    "Take it!",
    "Overall, a great course especially if you will be doing global health research the following summer. I was never bored and perhaps most valuable about the course is the instructors. They are very invested in the student experience and give amazing feedback!",
    "I would recommend this course only to those who wish to design a global health project and need help doing so. Otherwise, global health scholars have to take it.",
    "take this class if you are interested in public health in any capacity, especially if you are interested in research! i acquired many skills and knowledge, and made really great faculty connections that i think will help me for years to come",
    "Yes"
