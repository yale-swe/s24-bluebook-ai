    "It's a great course! Logistically, though, it is very difficult to complete the assigned readings. It might be helpful, if in advance of the 2 weeks of meeting for class, the professors assigned students to post responses to some of the readings on Blackboard. This would help even out the pace of the semester.",

    "The best thing were the Professors. Very nice interaction between them, the different backgrounds were complementary and provided a richness that I saw in few classes at FES.",
    "The opportunity to cover a greatdeal of comparative law in the space of two weeks is a unique opportunity. Profs Robinson and Lee are world class experts in the subject and taught well together.",
    "The time commitment was low. Two weeks and a paper was not too difficult to manage."

    "The pace and the intra-lecture organization. While the 10 lectures were each very well conceptually parsed out, it felt like the instructors just sort of engaged in a bit of an unorganized diatribe for the 3 hour topic each day, particularly Prof. Heng. While her insights on international matters and stories were great, in terms of true academic discourse and organization, the rigor of the lectures was lacking. I felt like Prof. Robinson was often holding back at times. Also, given the expanse of material to cover in such a short time period (yet for so long each day), perhaps better organization within lectures would also be better aided by different tactile teaching methods to change things up a bit and keep students engaged. Lastly, far less room for discussion than I had imagined.",
    "The class could have used some additional focus. While everything discussed in class was interesting, at times we moved to topics that I would consider beyond the scope of environmental law.",
    "If the readings were disseminated in the beginning of the semester, then students would have time to read them closely. During the two weeks it is hard to fit in careful reading of all the material."

Given that, the course didn't live up to my expectations in part because I didn't put in the time, but in part because I realized it just isn't humanly possible to do a 3 hour seminar daily for 2 weeks straight and gain actual, full breadths of knowledge. The lecture material would have been enhanced by the readings the Profs. did succinctly provide, however, the pure logistical time constraints made it such that the course was unable to live up to my academic expectations - I would have loved to have put more in and gotten more out, however, one person juggling other classes and life can only do so much (despite telling yourself \"it's only two weeks...\").",
