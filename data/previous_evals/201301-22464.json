   "comments": [
    "Good intro course covering the major linear PDEs (heat\/diffusion, wave, Laplace) in 1-3 dimensions, Green's functions, and some nonlinear PDEs toward the end. The material can get messy, as most equations don't have closed-form solutions (enter Fourier series, Bessel functions, and Legendre polynomials). Prof. Frenkel's lectures were difficult to follow at times, and homework was sometimes frustrating, but grading on tests was very lenient. I'd probably recommend this course over ODEs, as the material is more interesting (in my opinion).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding the field of PDEs in depth."
