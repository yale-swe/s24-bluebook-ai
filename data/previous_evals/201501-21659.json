   "comments": [
    "Hard QR. Really cool concepts, but you won't get a good grade unless you are an astronomy major.",
    "It is an interesting topic, but you have to be very invested in understanding all of the material. Although it is meant for non-science majors, it is certainly non a gut.",
    "I would recommend it to non-majors as a science credit and to everyone who has never taken astronomy before. The topic itself is fascinating and the workload is manageable.",
    "Don't take it expecting it to be easy or light and don't get lulled by the first couple weeks. Professor Faison is very knowledgable and gives good lectures, but the p-sets get tricky, the material gets challenging, and the book is super dense (but has useful things in it, so it's still important to read, for better or worse). If you've taken upper level physics, you'll find lots of repetition, especially early on, but you do eventually get to fairly cool new things. There's just lots of groundwork to get there, and then final few weeks are quite challenging. You also get assignments back very slowly, which can be frustrating (but is the major reason to stop by at section).",
    "Not a gut, and sometimes throws huuuuge curveballs, but very interesting subject matter for sure.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Lectures are lectures, but Prof. Faison is a good lecturer and tries to make them more fun. The problem sets aren't too bad, but they are a bit tedious and they are easy to make mistakes on when plugging in numbers. Going to OH is super helpful. Tests aren't easy, but they also aren't hard. If you listen in class\/skim read and understand the problem sets, you'll be ok. Learning about space, galaxies, and the universe is quite interesting and thought-provoking. Give it a shot, it's worth it!",
    "Cool SC credit. Go to sections do the problem sets and you'll do fine in the class. Get to look at some sick photos.",
    "Galaxies in the Universe is an outstanding course. Learning about Space, Time, and our Universe has been incredible. Every moment of this course is fascinating, the professor is phenomenal, and the workload is well-balanced. I highly recommend this course to any student.",
    "It's a MUST take. you need to know this stuff, and professor Faison is great.",
    "This class was not what I expected. Even with warnings that it isn't as easy as it is marketed as being, I wasn't ready for it. Lectures are interesting, but the tests require a LOT of knowledge about the concepts, and applying them in different contexts. It's harder than if it was more math-based. So while it can be interesting, be ready to study and learn the material well.",
    "a. This is not a gut. b. This will probably be challenging to non-STEM people. c. If you put in the work, it is an extraordinarily engaging and rewarding class, and definitely a fantastic science\/QR credit.",
    "So. If you're looking at this course, you may be looking for a gut science or science credit to help fulfill the distributional requirement. Be warned: this is no gut. This class will make you learn and make you work. You will have 2 hour PSETs each week, and unless you check the answers with classmates, you will almost certainly get something wrong. The tests are very difficult and require more studying than you would expect. Apart from all that, thought, the class is fascinating in its subject material. If you are brave and have some time, take the class! Otherwise, it is not necessarily a class for the faint of heart.",
    "I would recommend this class to other people who are excited about the stars. I've always loved astronomy, so learning about the way things work up there was very fun. However, my other friends in the class liked it much less than I did, so once again, I recommend that anyone that considers this class have a true interest in the subject.",
    "Would not recommend",
    "Not at all a gut class. I think you just really need to make sure you have the time and energy to devote to this material, which I didn't have. Try to stay organized. The material is exciting and interesting, though, so it's easier to stay invested than other science\/QR courses for non-STEM majors.",
    "Solid intro to astronomy. Good science credit. Math component is not difficult. Most hw and test questions are qualitative not quantitative. Professor Faison is very enthusiastic and a good instructor and TAs were helpful",
    "If you don't have any background in physics, this may turn out to be a harder QR\/SC credit than what you were looking for. If you plan to take it, A) find fellow student study buddies and B) go to the professor's office hours with questions. He's great about that."
