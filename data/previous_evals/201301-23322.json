   "comments": [
    "Dean Karlan is smart and the class isn't very difficult. But it's annoyingly unstructured, working with other people in the class on a silly final project kind of sucked, and the TAs didn't ever seem to know what was going on. Meh.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend this course. If they modify the distribution of graded assignments and the overall idea of the project, I would take it because the material is very interesting and Professor Karlan gives great lectures. The course itself needs a modified structure.",
    "A great class, definitely take it! You go through all of the important studies from the last couple decades. Gives you a broad view of the current landscape of RCTs. That being said, remember that it is at the end of the day a research design class. If you don't know STATA, the group project (worth a significant portion of your overall grade) could be disastrous... some of the groups clearly struggled with this.",
    "All you need to know about RCTs, current research, the complex problem of alliviating poverty, what works and what doesnt.",
    "Good course, not too demanding. Good if you want to learn about how to run experiments in the field to find out if the aid provided is having an impact. Very useful in learning more about how to assess NGOs impact and whether the aid addresses a market failure",
    "Course needs serious restructuring but has potential.",
    "I hope this class will continue to improve with time. As it stands right now, I would not recommend it due to the confusing and sporadic way in which it is taught. This class is best for those with a good understanding of econometrics and experience with Stata.",
    "A surprisingly difficult course. I had excepted it to be somewhat challenging, but it ended up being very time consuming and overwhelming. At the end, I felt like I had actually learned a lot about evaluating NGOs though so it did pay off.",
    "The course is good, but very precise. It is about finding solutions in a very \"Innovations for Poverty Action\" way. You will learn a lot about RCTs, impact evaluation, and criticizing NGOs when you learn about them. I would maybe have wanted to learn other ways if assessung NGOs, and have more guidance in this course.",
    "It's OK. Take it if you're an econ major looking for another credit or are interested in case studies that are focused on health, agriculture, education, and microfinance in the developing countries around the world.",
    "This class is great if you are really interested in learning how to systematically think about problems in the developing world and look at solutions in a critical impact-focused way. But there isn't a lot of structure to the class, and it is very focused on impact evaluation so if you're interested in different aspects of development, this is probably not the class for you.",
    "YES take it.",
    "a This class is probably not really what you expect. Try it out and see if you like it. If you think it's about \"Let's change the world and make it a better place\"... well the fight against poverty might be more ambiguous than that. The class is not as structured as usual econ classes (which can be good or bad), and the individual and group projects make you use your creativity. But there is a lot of behavioral economics, which is great! And Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are awesome.",
    "Take this class and go to office hours. Professor Karlan is a leader in his field and is surprisingly invested in his students.",
    "Instead of taking the class, just remember this: instead of accepting blindly an organization's claims of impact, you should look into how they measure it (and randomized control trials are a good way of doing so). Really not that good of a class, though it's pretty easy. I only kept with it because it counts as research methods for global affairs. Probably would've dropped it otherwise. Karlan goes off on tangents and is very hard to follow in class. I left feeling like I added very little to my education on international development. Frustrating.",
    "Good class about an interesting topic--not much work. Can get a bit repetitive at times. The project's an interesting way to force you to really think about issues to do with poverty and come up with your own solutions.",
    "Take it if you have an interest in experimental economics or development in general!",
    "This is a fair class. If you put the effort, you will do well. If you don't, there is still some hope for you. The exams are very long and some of the TAs are not very well prepared. Professor Karlan is funny and willing to help. He may not be the nicest person you will ever meet, but after you know him and understand his sense of humor, he definitely grows on you. Compared to the other economics class, this was a very easy one. Make sure you know some econometrics. It is not a requirement for the course, but if you know some of it, you will be in great advantage (aka you will probably get an A if you have taken Econometrics 2). No psets, 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 project, and 2 writing assignments. Very low stress class. I would recommend!",
    "It is a very interesting class but there a lot of emphasis on the methods and process.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in the work of Innovations for Poverty Action and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) to study development economics. You get to design your own RCT, which is a bit of fun. Prof. Karlan is an expert, so this is quite an opportunity. He also spices up the lectures with entertaining anecdotes.",
    "Yes, overall I found the course to be interesting. It helped me to relearn and really apply some fundamental economic and econometric concepts. Also, for anyone who's interesting in behavioral economics, this course serves as a good preliminary introduction.",
    "Do not take this class if you are expecting a 100-level Global Affairs class. It is not; it is a 300-level Econ class. If you have the proper economics background, it will probably be an interesting class and fairly doable. The readings are not too long, and the topics are interesting, and the project can be fun, if you don't leave it to the last minute.",
    "Take the class if you want a fairly broad but satisfyingly deep overview of one of the hottest sectors in economics. The class also probably helps teach more econometrics than 131. The curve is wonderful and there isn't too much stress on the quant.",
    "Great class on what poverty alleviation programs exist and how effective they are under scientific evaluation. It's transformed the way I look at NGO's, and has helped my understanding of how difficult poverty alleviation is.I can only half recommend the class because the class definitely needs reworking.I wish we would focus on fewer studies so that we can better analyze them. At times Karlan assumes too much prior knowledge."
