   "comments": [
    "My close reading skills and intertextual analysis skills were greatly increased as a result of this course. I felt a greater appreciation for the historical context of each work in relation to one another.",
    "Participating in vigorous discussion, handling a large reading load, and summarizing my thoughts in essays. The course was a sort but good introduction to the western canon in literature.",
    "Broad overview of foundational works from Homer to Dante. Lets you really see how authors interacted with each other, e.g. how Virgil built off Homer and how Dante built off both. Developed close reading abilities and essay writing abilities.",
    "I learned how to see and analyze different works of literature in terms of their themes. I also learned how to write a good analytical paper and connect literary works to other works.",
    "I learned how to close read more carefully.",
    "My reading and writing skills improved a good amount. But most importantly, I gained a much greater understanding of and appreciation for ancient (and Medieval) Western literature.",
    "I learned how to close read a passage much more effectively, and to write about literature much more eloquently.",
    "Directed Studies literature travels through the first half of the western cannon. It's focus on poetry and the chronological order allows one insight on how literature has adapted and built off of each other. Essays focused on close reading analysis.",
    "I learned a lot about the classics and decided that I wanted to major in them. I also learned how to interpret classical literature. I thought my ability to interpret and analyze literature was left unchanged.",
    "This course hammered into me an appreciation for the interconnectedness of the literature we read. Nearly every author had read the very authors we had read previously. Vergil and Sappho knew their Homer, Dante knew his Vergil, and so on so forth. Seeing the connections greatly helped me with understanding the nuances of the works.",
    "I learned a lot about the ancient world and literature. Lots of writing skills as well.",
    "I developed many skills in close reading which have helped me deepen my understanding and appreciation of literature in general.",
    "I learned a lot about classical literature up through Dante. It was really interesting to read the texts and discuss them in depth in class, and I feel like I gained a very nuanced understanding of each work we read. I also developed my writing skills quite a bit, in particular doing close readings in literary analysis.",
    "In addition to reading seminal works of literature from the classical to medieval eras, I learned valuable skills related to close-reading, literary analysis, and writing.",
    "In taking this course, I have developed a new way of thinking that was once foreign to me. It has encouraged me to be more inquisitive and critical of arguments presented in novels and in seminar settings, which in turn has made me further develop my own ideas in my writing assignments and class discussion."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course takes its strength from the seminar discussions in which the themes and other literary devices of each work are observed and discussed by the class. The lectures are informative and interesting in their interpretation of the works as well. There is quite a heavy reading load, so for some works which I would have liked to spend more time with, we only had the benefit of one discussion.",
    "The course could be improved with a tighter focus on a single theme or thread through a small number of passages rather than trying to teach each book in its entirety. However, the book selection was, for the most part, quite good. While Sappho was a refreshingly different reading experience, it didn't feel like we were able to get into the fragments in the same depth as the other works.",
    "The course does what it promises, and although it would be nice to dive deeper into the works sometimes, I think the course did a good job with both the works selected and how much each was emphasized.",
    "This is an amazing course. You're able to see how all the works you read connect to each other, and discuss themes of justice, grief, love, and concealment. The discussion in class is also one of the strengths of this course, as you're able to share your thoughts on a particular text with your classmates and hear their thoughts. Sometimes, certain students can tend to dominate class discussions while others don't really get their voices in, so this might be a weakness. Overall, though, this is a wonderful, enriching course.",
    "I think this course is very well organized, and really interesting. I only wish that we had more time to read some of the great books, like Ovid or the Inferno.",
    "I thought reading the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Aeneid, and the Divine Comedy (some of it) in sequence was one of the coolest experiences of my life. The course did a fantastic job tracing the development of the epic tradition (and, more generally, the Western literary tradition). I think that the schedule (2 seminars and 1 lecture per week, and 3 papers over the course of the semester ) worked well.",
    "Strengths: Incredible texts. Really thought I wouldn't be very interested in them, but they really surprised me. Weaknesses: It's hard to get very deep into the text b\/c of how much reading there is",
    "The curriculum is wonderful, and I loved pretty much everything about this course.",
    "The class is strongest in its seminar style complimented well by the lectures. It's only weakness is the addition of texts such as the Bible that are rather disjointed from the other text that manage to culminate In a fantastic way.",
    "I think reading Paradiso and Purgatorio in one week is bad for understanding of those texts.",
    "As mentioned above, I particularly enjoyed the course's focus on the interrelation of the texts, which deepened my appreciation for all of them. I think the main weakness of the course was how little time we had to go over each individual text. One class to cover the Bacchae or Orestae is a stretch, to say nothing of the few classes we were left to cover the Odyssey, Iliad, or Aeneid.",
    "It goes through books too fast. Excellent syllabus though.",
    "The course was amazing in so many ways, with the discussions being such an important part of it. Perhaps the people who did starters could have much of a set time to discuss what they looked into.",
    "The Directed Studies program in general is very narrow in focus, and it might have been more interesting to explore slightly less well known texts in the interests of bringing in a variety of voices and perspectives. However, the curriculum chosen did hold together very well, and made the texts we read into a cohesive narrative that deepened our understanding of the works we read and the foundations of Western literature in general. In all, it was fascinating, although some works were more interesting than others.",
    "The course was generally excellent. The books chosen were great, and I wanted to especially note that Sappho, which was new to the Directed Studies syllabus this year, was really wonderful and a fantastic addition. The course was well paced and well structured, and the essays helped me so much to learn to write at a college level. The only weakness I can think of is the lack of female or minority authors, but this issue was discussed, which helped, and Sappho also helped there."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone with interest in the canon of classical Western literature. It gives such a great exposure to essential parts of our culture, even now, and I understand so many more educated allusions and references which I had no idea were rooted in classical literature,",
    "Yes! It is a good introduction to the Western literary tradition. The books and professors in the DS program are excellent and worth experiencing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in exactly what it offers. It won't offer extremely diverse authors, and it won't allow you to get a detailed understanding of a lot of the works. The sections are set up well, and the lectures are usually either informative or engaging. It is, of course, reading-intensive, so that's something to keep in mind.",
    "Absolutely! I loved this course. It only furthered my love for literature and writing.",
    "Definitely take DS literature. You will get a comprehensive overview of classical literature up until Dante. Don't come in expecting to become an expert on classics or to casually do the reading.",
    "Yes, especially if they are interested in the humanities.",
    "Definitely. DS Literature (in the fall) was great. It provided a very solid foundation for the study of Western literature, which is something that I plan on studying. That said, DS Literature was a lot of work and it must be taken in conjunction with DS Philosophy and DS Historical and Political Thought, so it might not be for everyone.",
    "Yes. Wonderful texts, great teacher. Totally worth it",
    "Absolutely, this course definitively changed my intellectual path. The beauty of the literature was transformative, and was made even more so by the cohesiveness of the curriculum.",
    "Yes! It is so interesting and the professor was amazing .",
    "Yes, this is the highlight of the directed studies program.",
    "Yes. It is the most unique DS course.",
    "Like my other responses for DS courses, unequivocally yes. The course broadened my understanding of and appreciation for literature, as well as giving me the opportunity to read several classic works which I otherwise might not have read.",
    "Absolutely. If one loves literature it is the perfect way to immerse oneself in it.",
    "Directed Studies is certainly a worthwhile use of time, and the literature course is especially interesting and eye-opening. Even if you have already read the works on some level, reading them in this setting will give you a much deeper understanding and appreciation for the works.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course and, with it, the Directed Studies program. It is an excellent introduction to the Western cannon and to critical thinking, analysis, and writing skills. Some find Directed Studies to be excessively labor intensive, but I thought that the readings were neither burdensome nor superfluous.",
    "I would recommend this course, alongside the other two Directed Studies courses, only to students who have an interest in intensive reading and who wish to vastly improve their critical thinking and writing skills. Though I ultimately intended to pursue either Electrical Engineering or Architecture, I saw these classes as a chance to see whether or not I would be interested in pursuing any majors related to Humanities. Though it has not changed my mind about what I want to pursue, I see them as worthwhile distributional requirements, ones in which students are given the opportunity to cover some of the most well-known texts in history. I have enjoyed challenging myself in these three courses, and I encourage all students, whether they are interested in Humanities or in Engineering, to consider taking Directed Studies."
