    "Recommended. Just make sure you don't fall behind in the readings, they are hard to catch up on!",
    "A mind-messer-upper!! Really cool class, and not too much of a workload. Really fascinating material that makes you feel smart just thinking about it.",
    "good class, even if you've never taken philosophy before. the professor is more than happy to help with anything you need and keeps the grading very low stress",
    "Not physics. Really interesting.",
    "Yes take if you are interested in the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is far off the beaten path of either physics and philosophy, one of the few courses that manages to incorporate both seamlessly. The professor is friendly, the TAs are great, and the subject matter is very interesting and provocative -- what more could you ask for?",
    "Yeah, definitely an interesting course.",
    "I highly recommend this course to science majors or philosophy majors looking to see how the two fields relate. Math\/philosophy or physics\/philosophy majors may be looking for something more rigorous, but will still enjoy this class.",
    "A fun philosophy class to take. I recommend it if you are interested in metaphysics.",
    "Good overview of the philosophy of space and time. Fun, interesting, course with very low workload. Worth shopping, and Raul is very funny!"
