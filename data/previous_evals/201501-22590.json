    "TAKE IT! This class is fantastic and will bring the U.S. criminal justice system and system of mass incarceration to a whole new light. You will learn everything and anything and really be able to engage in policy recommendations and debates after this class. It will inspire you to go out and change the system",
    "A great professor who is an expert in the field, a passionate class of students, and really important, fundamental readings! A great course, especially for those interested in the topic Definitely recommend, bu just be prepared for very liberal students who are very engaged in social activism-- can be intimidating at first.",
    "Great, fulfilling, relevant course. Only take it if you have time to press into the readings and if you are vocal enough to speak critically about them in class. The class is best when there is a healthy debate going on.",
    "Yes! If you can get into it. The class is very pertinent to issues that occurring in mainstream American but also has a lot of information the general public doesn't really know about. You will learn so much in this course! There's a lot of reading and sometimes you will not get through it all but the seminars are really engaging and thought-provoking. The information you learn in this class will probably change your thinking in a good way.",
    "Race & Politics of Punishment is one of the MOST EXCELLENT courses I've taken at Yale. First of all, everyone should care about the fact that America unfairly targets its minority populations, but the exact mechanisms by which the state enters into the lives of disadvantaged communities and metes out punishment is something to be studied in-depth. The course deals with the historical development as well as the current situation, from many different angles take a look at the syllabus to see what I mean. If you've seen the anti-police riots across the news, you may think of this as a moment in history in which we need to stop police brutality, but what's the large system that causes such brutality to occur? What are the mechanisms that have caused the U.S. prison population to reach over 2 million, whereas several decades ago it was one fifth of that size? The readings for the course were not always the most engaging, but there was enough variety that the discussion every week was fascinating. The class also attracts a fantastic group of students, so TAKE IT if you get in.",
    "Race and the Politics of punishment is one of the best seminars offered in the Political Science department and at Yale because of the rich material that students are able to engage with over the course of the semester. The classes were always thought-provoking and I appreciated learning more about mass incarceration through an interdisciplinary approach.",
    "Maybe. If you have a very strong background in political science and know a lot about the criminal justice system already. This class is best for people who are involved in social justice work outside of class.",
    "Yes! A must take if you're interested in the topic.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to another student",
    "Very good. Would recommend for anyone interested in race or punishment at all."
