   "comments": [
    "I took this course purely to fulfill a language requirement, and picked Latin more or less on a whim. It was thebest decision I made all semester. I am not a Classics enthusiast or even that interested in languages, but somehow learning Latin became really exciting and satisfying over the course of the semester. Definitely looking forward to L2 and L3.",
    "Yes! Latin is such a gratifying language to learn and Sean makes it very easy to grasp. You'll understand the linguistic points of the language and how Latin relates back to English, not just brute force memorization in this class. If you want to have a strong foundation for learning any romantic language in the future, take Latin. The workload is pretty heavy, homework is due everyday, but it is worth it. You learn so much over these 13 weeks, and by the end, you can start reading some classics!",
    "If you have any interest in Latin, you should give it a try. Studying latin is a very cool intellectual pursuit. But be warned, this class starts out at a blazing fast pace. Study really hard in the first few weeks or you will fall behind!",
    "YES. I learned an extraordinary amount in a span of three months. It is difficult at first to get the hang of the verbal system and noun declensions but after that it is such a fun language. Sean is one of the best language teachers I have ever had.",
    "This class focuses primarily on morphology, syntax, and vocabulary of Latin via reading ancient text excerpts and exercises. There is a lot of information that is crammed into this semester and if you want to succeed prepare to dedicate a lot of time to memorization. You definitely get what you put in for this class.",
