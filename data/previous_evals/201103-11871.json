   "comments": [
    "Phys 180 was really hard for me. The lectures were fun but didn't contain alot of information- you really need to do the readings. I struggled, coming from a background of almost no physics, but there really isn't a lower level so that's annoying. Good luck",
    "This class isn't bad to take if you need it, but I wouldn't take it if you could take something else.",
    "Take it! It doesn't matter what your major is; it's good to have a basic knowledge of physics. Even if taking intro physics doesn't change the way you view the world, at least you'll have glimpsed how some physicists view the natural world!",
    "Yes, much better than 170 from what I heard.",
    "I think this class depends very much on the professor who teaches it. The concepts are interesting but it moves way to fast and the homework can be a bit much. There's not a lot of chance to get extra help on concepts (lots of chances for help on homework though) so it helps a lot if you understand most of the stuff already. Really not a class for someone with little to no physics experience I'd say though.",
    "Strengths: A heavy in-class focus on concepts, lots of demos made class lighthearted.Weaknesses: Some demos seemed too simplistic and didn't reveal anything that wasn't intuitive. The lack of worked problems in class made completing the math-based problem sets difficult if the solution methods weren't obvious to you. Awful textbook, it's very high-school-like and all the in-text examples are too simple to be very helpful on the homework.If you take this class, pay attention to vectors. The course rushes through them at the beginning because it assumes familiarity with them, not because they're unimportant. Switching back and forth between problems where vectors were necessary\/expected and problems that assumed vectorless \"simplified\" scenarios really confused me. I don't know what PHYS 200 is like, but if you want a math-based understanding of physics rather than a solely conceptual one, I recommend checking out the higher level course. I'm an engineering major and I don't feel I've learned enough physics math in this class.",
    "Good intro to Physics.",
    "If you have to take a physics class, or are interested in general physics, this is the class for you.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you absolutely have to take it. If you have to take it, avoid taking it with Sean Barrett. Read your book thoroughly, especially sample problems. Try hard on the problem sets, they are worth a lot of your grade. The class is also very fast-paced so stay on top of the readings.",
    "Interesting Physics Class. Demos were great and I really liked the clicker questions every class as they kept me involved",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student solely based on Professor Barrett's teaching style. Lectures are pointless except that he asks clicker questions in which you have to be there or have a friend take your clicker in for you. I would recommend taking physics 200 if you have taken physics before.",
    "For an introductory lecture physics course, PHYS 180 does a great job of keeping it interesting and providing individualized support. The lectures were fun and interactive, and there were plenty of opportunities outside of class to talk to the professor, the TFs, or other students. It moved slightly quickly but I never felt too overwhelmed.",
    "This is a very basic physics course which is perfect for anyone looking for an intro course.",
    "I would recommend Physics 180, if you're looking for a lower level intro physics class. It's entertaining and slightly interesting, though you will have to rely on the book more than Professor Barrett. That being said, Professor Barrett was a decent lecturer, and probably the best that has to be offered at Yale, so stick with him.",
    "Physics 180 is a great intro-physics class. Every single day, there are interesting and exciting demos that keep your attention through the 75 minute long class. Our professor brought great energy to the class, and despite the walk up science hill, I always looked forward to going to class. The grade breakdown is also very, very forgiving, so if you are a bad test-taker or something of that nature, you can still pull off a solid grade. Overall, I absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Definitely take this class! Barrett is really awesome and works hard to make lectures entertaining (and they usually were- I was never bored in class)- though they're not very helpful with understanding the material. If you have taken physics before (ie AP in high school) then you won't have to do much work- it's basically AP physics C (we even used the same textbook my high school used). There's only one pset a week and it's 8 problems. Also, the tests are incredibly fair (not easy, just very fair- if you understand the material you can do well).",
    "Typical intro physics course. Topics covered are much like the first semester of AP Physics C (although we didn't touch waves or thermodynamics when I took AP Physics C). Demos can be pretty interesting, although clicker responses (i.e., having to show up to most classes) can be annoying.",
    "Take this class ONLY if you have prior physics knowledge. Barrett is a wonderful teacher who will show you cool demos, but you are expected to learn from the worst physics book in history. Without prior knowledge, the book will not make sense and you will suffer for that.",
    "Gah! This was a frustrating experience. I basically taught myself out of the textbook. Lecture was not useful to me at all. I think Professor Barrett should take into account the fact that different people learn in different ways. In other words, you can't just have a lecture full of demos! Some people may be able to glean the physics concepts behind those demos, but most people cannot and they're left with a fancy show each class, devoid of any real physics depth. I wish I hadn't gone to lecture, in order to be able to shore up time to use for reading the pretty lengthy physics textbook chapters, but I had to go because of the clicker questions. So, Prof. Barrett succeeded in ensuring that we were in class, but didn't ensure that we understood concepts at all. Also, I often felt that he wasn't certain about some of the things he was saying, so I often left more confused than when I entered, and I would hear others around me whispering the same things, so clearly I wasn't the only one. The 1001 announcements he sent to us were really annoying because then you couldn't discern what was REALLY useful and what was just marginally useful. That should definitely be stopped. You should be able to say all that you need to say in the ample hour and 15 minutes of class time that you have. Additionally, I'll warn that you won't get any nice lecture notes in class, no sample problems on the board, so logical sequence of physics concepts presentation. My notebook is pretty blank. There was nothing to write because I barely thought about physics in class. Let me teach this course next time.",
    "I took this because I heard 170 sucks and 200 is poorly taught and quite difficult. 180 was extremely easy and the lectures were fun although we didn't do any math, so make sure you're good at math and remember from high school how to go about solving physics problems!",
    "PHYS 180 is not an introductory course to physics. If you do not have a basic knowledge of physics, you should not take this course. Professor Barrett is a pleasant man, but does not teach physics--he only shows demos (albeit cool ones).",
    "I would take 180 over 170. This class fostered concept understanding rather than detail memorization, and the assessments were borderline easy as long as you can follow the main ideas in the textbook. Just make sure you pay attention to the conceptual questions P. Barrett posts in class, and write down any questions that fooled you because P. B. doesn't post his notes. However, class was either bearable or a blast depending on the day, and the tests were easier than the problem sets.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU NEED IT. It is boring, you won't learn anything except what you read in the book, and it is a ton of work. On the other hand, for a lot of us it is unavoidable. If this is the case, it's not impossible to do well and the book explains the concepts well enough. It's just really frustrating to have a class where the lectures are 100% useless but where you are graded for attendance.",
    "Yes it was overall a good class but I would warn them of the teaching style.",
    "Yes, good intro physics that shouldn't be too challenging for those with an AP phys background",
    "This course is very intensive, moving through a variety of topics in a limited time. This teacher being new, is still trying to work out some of the bugs that occur throughout this course such as ways to support students outside the classroom and with demonstrations. However, the way that content is presented in this course is very straightforward and presented well. I would recommend this class as a starting place for someone thinking of going into a science background.",
    "If you have to take Physics, its not that bad. Take it with friends so you can enjoy the lectures and work on problem sets together, and prepare to teach a lot of it to yourself.",
    "Physics 180 was difficult. Reading the chapters in the book was imperative.",
    "Yes! Especially if Sean Barret is teaching it. The clicker based learning\/questions were great and the material was presented in such a way to emphasize the concepts. Barrett is phenomenally and the demos were great. I did not even take AP physics in highschool (but I did take multivariable) and I think I did okay. Great class.",
    "Physics 180, as taught by Sean Barrett, would be an abysmal example of an introductory lecture course at any institution of higher learning. The fact that a course taught this horribly exists at Yale is astounding. At no point in a course should a professor utter the words, \"gosh, I really feel sorry for those in here who actually need the knowledge from this class as a prerequisite for something.\" Sean Barrett, a man clearly more focused on the workings of his lab and senior physics projects than on introductory instruction, did not take the teaching of this class seriously. He consistently spent the entirety of class time fumbling around with useless, inapplicable demonstrations and playing with toys like a child instead of giving a professional, useful lecture. His failure to conduct a college course went further in that problem set performance carried virtually no correlation to exam performance. He provided no way to prepare for any of the term exams. The only way to make it through his course was with an extensive background of prior physics knowledge. If Sean Barrett is teaching physics 180, do not take it.",
    "You learn stuff! Awesome! So much easier than orgo or gen chem, and much more fulfilling!",
    "If you enjoy Youtube physics experiments, then you will enjoy this class, since that's all you're likely to see at lectures (apart from the conceptual clicker questions (which you should pay attention to since they often come up in exams)).If you actually want to learn how to solve physics problems properly, then be prepared to go through the textbook in extreme detail and possibly get external help, because you will NOT learn how to problem solve during lectures. The textbook is very useful in this respect, and the professor (Sean Barrett) is more than willing to assist you on a one-on-one basis outside of class during office hours.",
    "Physics 180 is a good foundation to the world of physics as a whole. The book, Halliday Resnick Walker, is very thorough and helps you think about why several things work the way they do. As far as becoming an analytic student and applying many of the principles we learn to the real world, this course fails to produce those type of students. The benefit of taking this course is that you would fulfill the prerequisite requirements for essentially all of the science majors, so taking it as a freshman leaves you open to essentially all of the areas of science and engineering offered at Yale. It's just a wise course to take if you are planning ahead for a career in physics, science, or engineering.",
    "Physics 180 is a challenging course that provides a lot of extra help through the professor's open office hours, tutoring, and study halls. I would strongly recommend the course to students who are interested in science.",
    "This class was what I expected it to be. It teaches you the fundamentals of physics and does a very straight-forward job in doing so. You attend lectures, which are enjoyable (especially with the cool demos). You do PSET's which aren't too challenging if you're on top of your material. And you take the exams. The class also has clicker questions and weekly quizzes that somewhat help you stay on top of your work. I would recommend this course...especially to those who need to take physics to meet certain requirements. This class gets the job done!",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone. It was boring, unsophisticated in material, horrible in structure, and unhelpful. I barely learned anything, which is awful.",
    "No",
    "Professor Barrett is probably a genius, an incredibly friendly, funny, and kind man, but he didn't teach elementary physics effectively. I took AP Physics C in high school and still just struggled with the class. It's just that demos are a pretty ineffective teaching method when the class moves SO rapidly and the EQs weren't explained in a enough detail. You're probably taking it because it's a premed or engineering prereq, so this evaluation won't really matter. Just recognize you'll need to put in a bit of review time to just learn the material. I did a lot of self teaching from the book.",
    "If you don't have a physics background you MIGHT want to take 170 instead, since this can be a bit of a struggle at times for those without any background whatsoever. But, if you're up for the challenge (and most Yalies are), why not go for it?",
    "Definitely not. Chances are you have to take it, and if you do, I'm sorry. Your best bet is watching some calc-based physics lessons online (try Prof. Lewin from MIT) and just enjoying the silly demos done in class. You will not learn how to solve problems from this class and you will likely be frustrated with the lectures.Pay attention to the multiple choice conceptual questions, and write them down if you can, because they will not be posted online and are the only really helpful study tool you have for the conceptual portion of the exams.",
    "Physics is very important, but this course probably isn't the way to learn it. Sean Barrett is awesome, and without his help it would have been far worse. The problem is that this introductory course, intended for students with no background in physics, is filled with kids with a lot of high-school physics experience (many even took AP physics C). It's not fun to compete against those kids on tests, and since you won't be able to get Yalies to actually enroll in the courses they are fit for but might not do as well in (i.e. physics 200\/260), unless you have to take this course it might be best to look elsewhere to fulfill your scientific curiosity.",
    "Physics 180 was a terrible class. Lecture was supposed to \"conceptual-based,\" but this translated into non-stop, non-informative \"demos\" (which were mostly the professor's son's toys). I learned almost literally nothing in lecture (but seriously...I have about 15 pages of notes total from all the lectures, and they consist mostly of random bullet points and elaborate doodles).Also, since lecture was dominated by demos and useless clicker questions (many of which were gotcha-style and therefore rather pointless), I never had any idea how to do the homework, which was all quantitative (WE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING QUANTITATIVE IN CLASS)...we did zero practice problems all year. How are we supposed to learn that way?",
    "Don't take it if you can avoid it, especially not with Barrett. If you must take it, prepare to teach yourself how to do all of the problem sets.",
    "It's harder than you think. I wouldn't take it unless you have too and if you do then I'd get a tutor. If physics is your thing than maybe that's not the case. It covers a lot in a short amount of time. Two chapters a week isn't fun.",
    "This is a decent class and you'll definitely learn the basics of physics. However, you'll have to put in a lot of time for this class for the problem sets, quizzes, clicker questions, and midterms. There are a lot of resources to help you in the class, so if you find yourself struggling, you can definitely find solutions to difficult problems. A background in high school physics would definitely help for the course, since a lot of the learning is reading the textbook on your own.",
    "Yeah, it's pretty fun. Class is cool with lots of demos. Don't expect much teaching; it's a pretty self-taught course by doing the problem sets, which don't take that long. Tests are pretty easy.",
    "If you had a shaky background or has never taken Physics before, don't take this class unless you are willing to learn everything on your own.",
    "Physics 180 is the straightforward, unaltered physics course taught at Yale. It presents physics without a heavy focus on biological applications, on quantum theory, or on any of the other topics focused on by the other intro physics courses. Physics 180 presents all the traditional topics of motion, kinetic and potential energy, rotational motion, forces, fluids, oscillations, waves, thermodynamics, and the kinetic theory of gases. This class should be avoided at all costs if taught by Professor Barrett, but otherwise presents all the traditional topics you would expect of a first semester intro physics course.",
    "Physics is crazy if you've never seen it before. If you need to take 180 and you are in that boat, try talking to your DUS. That being said, you can still do well in this class if you start throwing everything you've got at it early on. Talk to the professor for an early evaluation of how you're studying and working. Good luck!",
    "This is an interesting course with a reasonable workload. Midterms are very different from the problem sets, which can be difficult.",
    "It's fine. If you're pre-med, just do 170. They say 200 has a nicer curve.",
    "Take this course if you didn't take an advanced high school physics course, even if they place in PHYS 200. I had taken calc 3 and diffeq in high school, so I was placed in PHYS 200 without any real physics knowledge and decided to switch. Keep in mind that the physics department usually places according to math preparation. This class is really difficult if you dont read that textbook, but easy if you do because the tests are usually conceptual, easier than the homework, and come from the text. If you are looking for a physics class based on math and intuition, take phys 200 instead.",
    "Take it only if you need it for your major\/pre med requirements. Never take this class for fun.",
    "Good introductory physics class with interesting demonstrations, so a pretty good choice to fulfill the premed requirement",
    "I would not recommend PHYS 180. Professor Barrett really means well and is genuinely interested in his students learning, but his intentions and his methods didn't align throughout the semester.",
    "This was a tough classfor me. What I learned is that, unlike for chem or bio, my instinct was always wrong. In the end, I think this helped me to think problems through. The exam style was quite different than the problem sets. The class isn't too math heavy, so if you can do simple derivatives and integrals you'll be fine. You do need to read the book or else you won't be able to keep up.",
    "Very entertaining class, although I ended up self-teaching myself all the material.",
    "Overall it's a good class that teaches you the fundamentals of physics. I appreciate the conceptual emphasis of the class (we don't work through confusing sample problems all class), but I feel a better balance needs to be struck. We should definitely do a few more worked problems in class. I would also like Professor Barrett to stay on schedule, there were some classes where I feel I really didn't gain much other than a simple formula that could be found in the book. That being said, I definitely learned more about physics from the class.",
    "I don't think recommendations really matter for this course. You just take it if you need to or you just like the subject.It's not bad. But it's not fantastic either.I rarely went to lectures because I didn't get much out of it but it's different for everybody. I never get much out of lectures anyway.One thing about 180 is that it tests you a lot more on concepts than on calculations. Calculations are rarely the problem.",
    "This year, Physics 180 was poorly taught. There's no denying it. The level of presentation was about what it should have been, the exams were fair, the problem sets weren't crushing, and there was a steady stream of emails from the professor explaining concepts (if you can follow hand-written notes); there were also weekly study halls, if you're into that kind of thing. The textbook is decent, and you may have used it in high school. It's Halliday, Resnick, and Walker, Fundamentals of Physics, 9th edition, and you should really look at it beforehand, because you're going to spend the whole semester reading 20 chapters of it. This is because unless matters improve, you will learn virtually nothing from lecture and you will have to rely on the textbook. Seriously, think about whether you want to take a course where lecture is time mostly wasted. On the up side, they do cool demos.",
    "Yes. Its a very very fast paced introductory course that goes over everything. There isn't a lot of depth, so you should have a background in physics before taking this course.",
    "I would not recommend this class for a student who did not take any physics in high school. It was very difficult to learn the material when the class was based on peer based learning. I thought that I would be able to do it, but it was definitely much harder than it should have been. Professor Barrett didn't really teach during lecture. He did some awesome demonstrations and the rest was clicker questions or bad slides that were impossible to get anything out of. The problem sets took forever because we hadn't been taught any of it so I had to rely on the book readings and hope I understood it or my peers who had already taken AP physics. Also, because the curve includes kids who have taken AP and even more physics in high school, it is not very helpful to students who are on the lower end of it. I suggest 170 unless they change this class to make it more available to students who haven't taken it yet.",
    "Do it, because you're premed.",
    "In short, this class exemplifies the mushy middle and, to be frank, is almost your only option if you are pre-med and had not taken AP Physics C in high school. Almost everyone in PHYS 200& 260 took Physics C in high school and, to an extent, the instructors in the courses assume prior knowledge of the material. PHYS 170, though perhaps laughably easy (the average on their first test was a 96), really (from what I have heard from former students) fails to prepare you for the MCAT.",
    "Physics 180 is a very straightforward class. You know exactly what you should study and there are generally no surprises on the tests. However, there is so much material to cover that it can get overwhelming. I suggest, especially if you haven't taken physics before, that you read the chapters ahead of time.",
    "If you can take Physics 200 (i.e. if you did well in AP Physics), do that instead. (Hell, if you're a pre-med, why not do Physics for the Life Sciences?) Physics 180 is horribly taught and won't teach you anything a good physics class from high school wouldn't. All the math is effectively plug-and-chug with basic formulas (calculus used in some derivations but effectively unnecessary), and you won't even come away with a good conceptual understanding of what it is you're plugging and chugging. (Note that Physics 200 has its own issues.) This may just be the class at the right mathematical\/physics level for you given your background, in which case: be prepared to teach yourself. If Sean Barrett is teaching this course again, avoid it even more than you would otherwise.",
    "If there is a different professor I think the class would be interesting and not impossible. It would definitely be a hard class still, but would be manageable with work. If Sean Barrett is teaching the course DO NOT TAKE IT.",
    "Yes. This class won't blow you away, but if you're premed and need a physics class I'd recommend this one. It's fairly easy and straightforward if you've got some high school physics background.",
    "Not particularly hard, especially if you have taken physics before, but except for the pretty cool demos, Sean Barrett and his lectures and not helpful in learning the material. Cool demos and there are resources outside of class.",
    "A good class for someone looking for a strong introduction to physics. It moves very quickly, but the demos and in class questions make the class more interesting\/fun.",
    "Physics 180 is, in theory, a great class to take. It lands nicely between \"I've never heard of physics before'\" (Physics 170) and \"I'm a physics whiz\" (Physics 260)But if this class is taught by Sean Barrett, stay away. Here are 5 reasons why:1) He is never prepared for class. He is usually incapable of explaining or answering questions about the demonstrations (which usually fail anyway) and \"clicker-questions\" he makes you do.2) He does not spend any class time teaching the material. You will very rarely see an equation or discuss the theory behind any physics in this class. Instead, you spend an hour and a half watching Professor Barrett play with his son's nerf guns and blow smoke rings from a garbage can.3) The problem sets are of an appropriate difficulty, however, they are nothing even remotely similar to what you will be tested on. Which is fine, except that Professor Barrett gives you no warning or method of practicing for his exams. In fact, he told us that the exams would be easier than the problem sets.4) Furthermore, he does not proof-read the tests after he writes them. This resulted in many situations where questions were worded poorly (not trickily---- poorly.), misleading much of the class (and himself in one instance) into answering the wrong question.5) Even when he does everything right, Sean Barrett is always wrong. When he does get around to answering questions and teaching material, its usually in a lengthy, wordy, difficult to read\/comprehend email. And you frequently get four or five of them per day.Ya. Stay away.",
    "It was a very self-taught class. Class time was used mostly for demos and conceptual understanding, but a lot of the problem solving you had to figure out yourself. It was too hard, but definitely a challenge for someone who never took physics before. Sean Barrett is the nicest person I have ever met though and his office hours are incredibly helpful.",
    "NO. Just no. If you are able, take 200. If you aren't, take 170. Professor Barrett was TERRIBLE. He essentially spent the entirety of lecture trying to get demos to work to illustrate physics concepts that should've been covered in the previous lecture. His teaching style is awful. Save yourself the headache. Also, how many professors do you know that give a midterm\/final without any DIAGRAMS on it to show you what you should be solving for and then refuse to take questions? I keep thinking that this class was supposed to be a practical joke. This review probably sounded bitter and jaded but really, don't do this to yourself unless you literally have no other options.",
    "This is a good introduction to physics. Knowing a little bit of calculus can help connect all the formulas together in your head, but really everything can be done without calculus or at the very least with a simple understanding of derivative and integral (like integral of x).If you do take this class, I highly suggest that you work on mastering the concepts. The exams seemed much more weighted towards conceptual questions than problem set type mathematical questions. For some this just means easy 30-40 points on exams, but since they are multiple choice, little misunderstandings can lead to 5-6% drop per question missed. I suggest going over the checkpoint questions in the book and going over psets before exams.Overall this doesn't need to be a very difficult class. The actual classes are quite entertaining and useful. However you definitely need to read the book and\/or do the sample questions in there. They will help with problem sets and overall with actually gaining a deep understanding of the concepts.",
    "I found this class to be really difficult for myself personally, as I struggle with science and did not have a very thorough physics experience in high school. The problem sets in this course are very fair, but I would urge you to begin them early, as many of them take several hours to complete. Professor Barrett is very passionate about physics and the material covered in the course. His lectures were helpful, but I had to supplement lectures with online lectures from other sources. I would recommend this course if you have adequate math preparation. Definitely shop different levels of physics until you find one that will be suitable for you, as this one was very rigorous for myself.",
    "This class was a good intro to physics. Lectures focused mainly on concepts and demos which were fun but made it harder to do the problem sets. The class starts off really easy but picks up the pace. You want to make sure you get ahead in the beginning so that you don''t fall behind as the class gets harder. Professor barrett was great. He was very fun and helpful and made the class interesting. Finals and midterms were pretty straightforward. Overall, a pretty good course.",
    "It is an intro science course. I doubt the alternatives for physics are any better.",
    "It's a hard class.",
    "Straightforward class. Truly an intro to university physics. Ironically, the lack of depth of this class sometimes made the material confusing. Professor Barrett is a joy to have as a professor, and you'll find as much help as you need (despite the lack of section) with after-lecture questions and the physics study hall.",
    "Yes definitely. If you have to take physics (or even if you don't) 180 is definitely the class for you. Yes the concepts get tough, and yes it goes super quick, but that's going to be the case with any class, and this one is the way to go. You know exactly what you're going to get in this class - The problem sets are pretty straight forward (all out of the textbook) taking about 5 hours each week and there are 2 midterms that cover the material fairly.As for choosing a level if you took AP in high school, I took physics mechanics C, and I still thought this class was perfect. The first few lectures were about Newtonian mechanics and pretty much review, but still there were presented more difficultly, and after those first couple weeks, just about everything was new and tough.Also, if Barrett is teaching it definitely take it! He taught 180 for the first time this year and he was so so awesome. Class was actually fun because Barrett does demos all class and makes jokes etc. He cares so much about students doing well and frequently even lets students hand in psets a day late if they need.",
    "This class was incredibly entertaining (the demonstrations were amazing) but didn't really teach much. All of the learning was pretty much done on your own with the textbook. It was perfect for someone like me who had already taken a good physics course in high school, but had to take physics again at Yale. I also really liked that the lecture contained a lot of \"clicker questions\" - they really help to engage the students in a large lecture class.",
    "Yes. I think it depends on the professor, but I thought Barrett was awesome and funny. Not too hard, either. There are so many study halls and office hours that you can get all your questions answered individually. The demos in class are mostly fun\/cool.",
    "Physics 180 is a survey of basic mechanics and thermodynamics, the majority of which was most likely covered in your high school physics course. Lectures incorporated many demos as well as clicker questions, which could sometimes be informative\/entertaining. However, Barrett's lectures were occasionally difficult to follow and were lacking focus on problem solving. Nonetheless, Barrett is great about ensuring that students who need help have access to plenty of resources; there were multiple help sessions per week, he was very accessible via office hours and email, and he was very receptive to student needs.I do not think this is a great course; however, if you need to take physics for a major\/requirement, physics 180 isn't a terrible way to go.",
    "The lecture consists mostly of demo's (which are really exciting and demonstrate concepts well...and it's difficult to fall asleep in class when your professor is shooting across the lecture room with a fire extinguisher between his legs on roller blades, dropping soda bottles from the top of a ladder, and shooting rings of liquid nitrogen at the students) and interactive clicker questions (which help you practice MC questions and get a feel for \"physics intuition\"). The course was lacking in help in problem solving, which is an essential skill in physics. I really like physics, but it's a tough course, so you will have an easier time working hard in the course if you're interested. I ended up needing a tutor near the end of the course, which I found to be helpful. When you seek help, though, make sure you have specific questions. Learn the material actively; you will not learn it if you passively read the book and just go to a TF or tutor with general problems. Prof. Barrett was an engaging lecturer who seemed relaxed and fearless before the students. He was approachable for questions and always helpful when I sought help from him. Don't think that taking 180 will not be challenging enough. I took Physics B last year and got a 4, and this course was definitely still challenging. I've also heard that the professor for 200 this past semester (Paul Tipton) wasn't that great (no firsthand experience, though). Also, you shouldn't take 200 if you haven't already taken Math 115.",
    "It's a good class to take for students who are interested in natural sciences. It's not too hard, but it's a serious science class.",
    "The professor is very refreshing. He is so enthusiastic and dedicated to this course. The textbook is terrible, so you probably need to come to class. The professor always prepares demos for class, and a series of conceptual questions. He will not go over the equations, so you will need to understand these before class. If you come to class and have read the summary at the back of the book, you will find it very helpful both in class and when you take the tests (which are also very manageable). I would recommend it over Physics 170, even if you are premed, just because you will actually learn something.",
    "I recommend it. I think it is an essential part of a liberal arts education.",
    "I feel rather indifferent about recommending this course. It was a pre-req for my major, so I wasn't tremendously interested in the subject matter and had no background in it. Lecture was not well organized and the problem sets could take a lot of time. At the same time I found that some of the topics we covered weren't terribly difficult and were actually fairly interesting. I don't know what the other physics classes are like and if you have to take physics you have to take physics. If you can learn well out a textbook and take the class with a couple of friends that you can do the problem sets with then thischoice is probably as good as any other option you might be considering. Prof. Barrett was friendly and entertaining but his lectures weren't terribly useful.",
    "Phys 180 is a great course. But know what to expect before you go to class:This is not a high school physics course that your professor will go to the black board and teach youhow to solve problems. Prof Barrett rather explains concepts and wants you to understand the reasoning and intuition. Therefore, you must read the chapters before the class, (at least the one page review section at the end of each chapter), and then watch the demos really carefully. This is a class based on demos, and most of them are fascinating. But don't make the mistake of thinking that they are only there for entertainment purposes. Many people in my class thought the demos were just for fun, and blamed Prof Barrett for \"not teaching\". However, you'll soon understand that demos REALLY help you understand all the formulas you will use and the reasoning behind them and TAKE REALLY GOOD NOTES ABOUT THE DEMOS, because all the questions in the exams will be based on them. Prof Barrett basically writes the questions based on the demos."
