   "comments": [
    "Excellent, can learn a lot. Useful for research.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to the kind of resource allocation problems that arise in networks. We discussed very relevant and useful models of various networks and algorithms. The course aims to build an intuition for these kind of problems and does not focus on the mathematical details behind the results, so I find the class accessible although I have not formally taken any probability classes. However, you do need to be comfortable working with expected values and discreet probabilities (I have taken MATH244 and CPSC365 which have some probability related material, and did some self-study on the side at the beginning of the course). We had 5 problem sets and a final project. The problems can be hard but Prof. Tassiulas is very nice and helpful. He is also a very clear lecturer and a great person to get to know. Some of the algorithms discussed in class are actually his result back in the day. I would recommend the course if you have some background in probability and are interested in networks.",
    "It is a good course. But it is better you have the background of stochastic process.",
    "Yes, because it encompasses many useful techniques for analysis, which is really helpful for people from both mathematic and practical view points.",
    "Excellent course, Sure"
