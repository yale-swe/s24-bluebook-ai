    "TAKE THIS CLASS. you learn to make awesome metal sculptures and use all sorts of cool and powerful machinery you will probably not have the opportunity to work with in the future: welders, plasma cutter, ironworker, chop saw etc. if you have any background in sculpture you will definitely enjoy this opportunity to explore further from your comfort zone and for 2D it definitely will be a huge change. not much work and Brent is nice. just don't skive off class",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's an awesome chance to take a course unlike any other that you'll take at Yale. Brent is an amazing guy, and really cares about his students. Plus you get to use the coolest tools ever. Do it!",
    "A great and different class. You will learn a skill and learn about art in a hands-on, practical way.",
    "Yes! If you are at all interested in art OR metalworking, or both.",
    "yes, definitely take it, cr\/d if youre not an art major",
    "Take this class! You will learn how to weld and work metal, and also get to make really fun and awesome art. It is as hard as you can make it.",
    "This class is as difficult and time consuming as you want to make it, but if you don't put in ANY work you will get nothing out of it. There's one midterm project, and one final project, and it really does take about that long to make each so slacking is not recommended. It was pretty easy to put off, though, so just watch out. Also, Brent is really awesome.",
    "YES RECOMMENDED. Brent allows a great deal of autonomy in this class, so you have to be read to take initiative and go for it. And you may not come up with the perfect design; that's fine. This class is about exploring a new material, developing a dialogue with it, and trying to convey something through the material. You learn a lot about yourself and your imagination through this class. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, I would. Also, what happened to question 3?"
