    "I learned a ton about state formation and development under conflict. Especially about China's development and its similarities\/differences from South East Asia.",
    "I learned how to analyze the political and social development of east asian nations.",
    "I learned a lot about state-building, its mechanisms and actors, especially situated in the context of Modern China. It was fascinating to zero in on this one topic across a variety of political scientists and historians. I finished the course feeling like I plunged into state-building in China and Southeast Asia from a variety of perspectives.",
    "Really helpful not only in terms of course material but also high-level writing and research skills",
    "I developed a sense of how arguments about state structures are built and overall how to form logical theses about why people act collectively for a political purpose. My ability to analyze these kind of arguments has also improved."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Prof Opper clearly knows what he is talking about and loves it and is funny (but an asshole but in the best way). The class has a lot to offer and there is a ton of information that you will learn just by sitting in class. I'm not a huge seminar participant and I still feel like I learned an incredible amount from my peers and Prof Opper. Weaknesses: Tons of reading. I almost never got through it all but it was all also super interesting and every weeks readings intertwined in some way with each other and with the other readings. So worth doing it.",
    "I think we spent a little too long covering China in the first half of the course and rushed through other countries. I enjoyed the structure of the seminar, though.",
    "The reading load, while interesting and stimulating, could be slightly more directed, i.e. if there was more guidance on how to read the articles and books, like what kind of questions to focus on.",
    "A LOT of dense reading, but comprehensive and interesting material",
    "The course had a very logical progression and built nicely off of preceding readings in analyzing different regions and arguments."

   "comments": [
    "YES if you are interesting in state building and in east asia it was an amazing course.",
    "This is good challenge and really makes being a PLSC major worth it. Far too many of the classes in the major are stupidly easy and designed to give students a shallow look through a set of issues, this class, thankfully, is the opposite.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The critical response paper is kind of vague but the final was a great way to delve into a topic of interest.",
    "Yes! A combination of political science and history to understand state-building and revolution.",
    "Only to someone very interested in the particular course material",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the background topic, I would recommend.",
    "It's a good political science course for anyone deeply interested in the Asian region."
