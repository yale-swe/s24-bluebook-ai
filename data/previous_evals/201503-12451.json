   "comments": [
    "In this class you get to contribute to real research in a lab, which is really exciting. The course doesn't demand too much work besides keeping up with your lab notebook, short weekly problem sets, and a manageable final evaluation.",
    "Assuming you've taken Nucleic Acids Lab I, definitely continue with the second half. Most of the lab times are shorter- we routinely got out before 4. Personally, I also found the second half more interesting. The swap of presentation for final paper is also a huge plus. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it! Such a great lab, especially if you have friends to take it with you\/or if you want to meet other MCDB, science, or pre-med majors. The lab is so chill and you do some lab work, listen to Dr. Nelson lecture, and talk with people. The problem sets aren't bad (3 per lab half-semester). If I had to pick MCDB labs again, I would definitely do MCDB 342\/343. Professor Nelson is the best!",
    "Nucleic Acids lab is a great way to fullfill a lab requirement and learn new techniques while working on an actual project from a research lab, which helps add purpose to the class. The first half 342L had a tendency to run over time during some class periods, but the second half 343L ran much more smoothly, ending on time. Overall, neither have too much commitment outside of class, with 3 problem sets for each class, a final paper for 342 and presentation for 343. Professor Nelson is extremely helpful and a great professor to have a class with.",
    "Great course. Absolutely recommend. One of the best lab courses at Yale in my opinion.",
    "Probably the best lab at Yale, definitely would take the second half. We got to work with crispr on axolotl which is literally the coolest class lab subject area. I would highly encourage everyone to take this lab (both parts) and just email the professor early in the year (like Jan) for the fall. You learn so much, and Kenneth Nelson is very chill and cares about his students learning.",
    "It's a pretty chill bio lab. Professor Nelson is great! Sometimes class goes overtime, but not that often during the second half of the semester. So you're in class for like 6-8 hours a week which is kind of a lot, but there's very little work outside of class, so it's really not that bad."
