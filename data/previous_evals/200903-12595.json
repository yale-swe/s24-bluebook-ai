    "You read Rawls's main works and discuss them at a very high level of abstraction; if you are looking for an intro course to the material, I would not recommend this course because you might get lost in the mess of philosophy and never really grasp the practical aspects of Rawls's work.",
    "Yes this course is great because you are able to focus on one author which makes discussion and learning deeper and more rewarding.",
    "Yes! It is a great intro to Rawls and this is really important for philosophy.",
    "Classic seminar, important topic not usually offered, great professor, and good mix of students. I would definitely recommend this seminar to another student.",
    "Pogge is a great - he's funny and he's good with explanations. He has written a lot on Rawls (Pogge was Rawls' student), so there is really no better professor for this class."
