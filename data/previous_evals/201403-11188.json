    "If one is interested in military power, strategy, tactics, and the overall use of the military as a political tool--take this class. It was great from top to bottom.",
    "I would strongly reccomend the course to another student. Many works are oft cited, and little read. If you are going to do anything in the discipline which deals with the use of military force in either comparative politics or international relations, you should take this class, and read these works before citing them. Additionally, it will help both with thinking about theory and writing clearly, two critical tasks to writing a dissertation."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me a deeper critical understanding of how we conceptualize military force, something which is of use for my thinking about the use of violence to accomplish political goals. It improved my writing skills, as well as thinking in complex terms, rather than simply saying 'X causes Y'. It provided a number of interesting puzzles, some of which hopefully will make it into either articles, or else provide a clearer framing for my dissertation project."
