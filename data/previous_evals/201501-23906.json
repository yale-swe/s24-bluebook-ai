   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. The topic was extremely interesting and I feel we need more classes on emotion however the class structure needs considerable improvement.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students. If you want to learn how to design and run studies I think there are better research methods courses to do that.",
    "Yes if you need a research methods class, otherwise not unless you're very interested in the topic",
    "It'll give you a fantastic review of the literature, but don't expect lectures to be fun. Lectures were boring and just a summary of the readings. I hope that Prof. Siemer changes up the structure a bit, as he really knows his stuff and is a great researcher. Really nice person and approachable. Just boring lectures, that's all. Everything else about the class was great. Final project was fun!!!! That's when I started liking the class a lot. Honestly I feel like you learn more about methods through doing than through lectures, though initial intro to the material thru lecture format is also useful. Perhaps balancing more practice into the course would've been great. Don't take it if you're a non psych major. Do it if you want to fulfill requirement, but also at the same time get really into Emotion literature - for a credit.",
    "I would recommend the class only if you are interested in the psychology of emotion. Otherwise, you will find the course a drag, especially if the professor lectures the entire three hours each class, as he did this semester. But the workload was typically light and the assessments were fair.",
    "Pretty good research methods class. Professor Siemer is very smart and kind. You learn a lot in this class. Reading response every week, midterm and final project where you design your own study during class time under the guidance of the Professor."
