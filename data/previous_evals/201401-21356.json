    "it's a lot harder than you'd probably think. do not take it as an easy class, you have to go to all the lectures and do all the readings and even then you have to work to get even a passing grade. sean is the best TA ever though.",
    "'Twas an excellent class! I really enjoyed getting to understand how the sounds we make when we talk are produced and the distributions of those sounds within and among languages. This is a field that underlies so much of our lives (since we spend so much time talking), yet most people give little thought to exactly how we talk, so I enjoyed getting to delve deeply into something that can so easily be taken for granted. My favorite part of the course was probably its practical focus. The homework often involved recording and analyzing your own voice or analyzing prerecorded sound samples, and the final project was a great way to get a taste of what linguistic fieldwork might be like. A couple of caveats: First, I took Intro to Linguistics before I did Phonetics, so I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed Phonetics as much without prior linguistics background. It probably would have been doable, but I think the first few weeks would have been pretty painful since we moved pretty fast through basic stuff like the International Phonetic Alphabet and the classification of speech sounds as stops, voiced, alveolar, central, etc. In terms of workload, the homeworks generally were not too bad, and I could always finish them easily within one evening. The reading was also helpful but not necessary. Be warned that the workload does heat up toward the end of the semester, though: there is the final project (which was pretty fun but always a fair bit of work to conduct and write up) as well as the last homework sets plus tests in producing and in transcribing speech sounds, not to mention the written final. Therefore, I highly recommend that you spread the project out through the semester and that you practice producing and transcribing speech sounds (with the production and listening exercises from the textbook) early on, or else the end of the semester might get overwhelming. The workload definitely was not excessive, but if you procrastinated the end of the term could be rough.",
    "To linguistic people who like crunching numbers, drawing trees, and other technical things: this is the class for you! Though there are no tree diagrams, its incredibly satisfying to be able to look at a spectrogram and calculate a vowel quality just based on formant frequencies. To sociolinguists, this is absolutely NOT the class for you. While we do occasionally touch on cool african languages and the interesting sounds they make, the focus is on the anatomy and physics of the mouth. It's very quantitative. To non linguists: I suppose if you want to be a dentist or something this class would be very interesting. Or if you're just interested in how humans produce sound the class goes very indepth. After all it is a phonetics class. If you're just looking though to dip your toes into linguistics, this class is very technical and specific. I would recommend something like intro linguistics instead, which will give you a broader perspective of the field.",
    "A challenging, detailed course in phonetics. Very interesting! A lot of work.",
    "You see a divide between future linguists who are into it and people who need a psych credit who are struggling along. Either way, start credit\/d - the work isn't overwhelming, but is challenging.",
    "I took this class because I liked funny sounds people make in other languages (not a linguistics major). The class exceeded my expectations. Take if you think you'll find the material interesting, but also take with the attitude that your mind will be blown by the processes governing how we make sounds with our mouths (seriously, there's the opportunity here to learn some really astonishing things).",
    "I would summarize the class as an in-depth look at the fundamental topics of articulatory and acoustic phonetics that includes an independent field project. I would highly recommend this class because I feel it is important for everyone to have some knowledge of phonetics\/linguistics.",
    "Ling200 has two parts. Part one is learning to produce and hear every speech sound a human can make and write them in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Part two is basic introduction to acoustic and aerodynamic principals behind those sounds and the patterns of their usage in human languages. Part one was the primary reason I took this class, so I could be able to pronounce words in other languages correctly, particularly when singing. The class accomplished that fairly well. Part two turned out to be less interesting, and more memorization and repetition of painfully simple concepts. However, part one alone is a great reason to take this class, so if you care about hearing and pronouncing sounds accurately, I highly recommend this class.",
    "Although this class was difficult, I learned a lot and found the final project (where you analyze a speaker of a different language) very rewarding. Take this class if you want a good challenge."
