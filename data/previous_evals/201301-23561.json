   "comments": [
    "The idea of this class is good in theory (bringing in professors from multiple disciplines) but I don't feel like the course was very well organized.",
    "Question 2: The MindMap exercises were not helpful because they were done in isolation from other assignments. Students have mentioned the lack of benefits from creating MindMaps to the TAs in class. If the exercises were done prior to digging deep into a topic to assess what we know\/don't know, and then a post-instruction assessment to fill in our knowledge gaps, I think the assignments would have been more helpful.Question 13: Overall rating is average because the instructors and TAs were relatively uncoordinated. It was GREAT having 3 professors and 3 TAs, but we often got conflicting or parts and pieces of instructions for assignments and the syllabus changes too frequently.Question 14: I'm not sure what I really got out of this course aside from an in-depth review of some of the key environmental problems occurring on our planet. I thought it was interesting having 3 varied perspectives on each issue presented in every class, but felt that this is something I already do on my own.",
    "2-- Mindmapping was not useful. People are taught this skill in elementary school but call it \"brainstorming\".4-- It almost appeared as though the deadlines for assignments were set to be the most inconvenient (Saturday morning deadlines\/ Sunday of spring break deadlines etc).10-- Terms were rarely defined concretely which led to the professors talking past each other.11-- The class was extremely disorganized, with assignment instructions being posted sometimes within a day or two of their deadline.",
    "the assignments seemed random and disconnected from the rest of the course. They were badly explained and bizarrely graded. I felt as though I spent half my time trying to figure out what the actual expectations were.",
    "Cintra was a great TA. Class was poorly run otherwise.",
    "I don't fucking know; the class was just unsatisfying.",
    "The class was horribly run, making it hard to plan out projects and assignments. Too much emphasis was put on the professor's opinions of the issues (beginning 40+ min of most lectures). The class should instead start with students and perhaps students should take a stronger lead in running the class discussion.Also, the take-aways from the course were unclear. The take-aways seem to be rather individualistic, and no great overarching knowledge was transfered to the class. I felt pretty lost as to the point of most discussions.",
    "The most valuable aspects of this course were:1. The opportunity to hear from three great faculty members their perspective on an issue and hear them discuss about it.2. The chance to acquire a thought organization tool like mind mapping3. The space this course creates for you to openly discuss your opinion on a sustainability matter.",
    "Questions 5 and 6: My TA was Alark Saxena",
    "1. I didn't always do the reading. When I did the reading, sometimes the articles were great. Other times, the reading did not seem connected at all to the lecture content. When I didn't do the reading, I just read enough to write a reflection.2. Some out-of-class assignments were more useful than others. For example, the first mind map (in which we had to use FreeMind) was not very helpful, and the instructions for the second mind map were not particularly clear (in terms of how we should go about interpreting the assignment). On the other hand, the weekly reflection was quite helpful (even though the discussion sections strayed pretty far from the content of our reflections).3. Since an Integrated Framework course is required for people with a broad set of interests, I thought the lighter workload was appropriate. Students could make it more or less challenging for themselves depending on how much of the reading they did, and how much time they put into reflections, the essay, and the poster. I liked that this class seemed to be more about creative, innovative big-picture thinking rather than getting bogged down in technical or academic details. For that reason, I wouldn't intensify the workload. The lighter workload allows more space for creative thinking.6. BinBin was fantastic, and did an outstanding job coordinating our discussion section. I liked the rigorous yet playful way in which she challenged us to think harder!12. In terms of content, I think there could have been more integration and coordination among the professors. In terms of logistics, it often seemed like the professors were still coordinating which each other to figure out the day's class when we were arriving -- that gave the appearance that they were a bit disorganized. The class never started on time, but the professors sometimes gave us a hard time for showing up 3-5 minutes late."

    "I liked when specific case-studies were discussed in detail -- the Congo wildlife\/mine, Alaskan salmon\/pebble mine, and Golden rice classes are the two most memorable classes to me. Also, I wouldn't worry about having to build up so much to these case-study classes with too many concept\/abstract classes. You'd be surprised to learn how much background knowledge the students already have on these issues.Also, I would avoid doing power point presentations. This limits discussion, and many of the slides shown were taken from other classes and presentations. Not only was it repetitive, but we can take other classes of we want to hear a certain professor's lecture. The open discussions were more interesting anyway. Perhaps, consider limiting presentations to a maximum of 10 slides per class, if any.",
    "Having3 faculty members presenting different perspectivesDebateWhen we really dug deep I to 1 topic an analyzed it from various directions",
    "It broadened my approach to sustainability and equality",
    "It was very good to look at complex issues from a lot of different angles. This kind of class is very important and I think it has a lot of potential.It was very interesting and valuable to have all three professors present most of the time.",
    "I thought of it as a class that helped with big ideas and creative thinking. Getting exposure to different disciplines and different talented professors was quite exciting and invigorating. I like the fact that the professors encouraged us to think about how to solve big environmental problems. Having the openness to come up with our own solutions allowed for a lot of creative thinking.",

    "Setting a syllabus and sticking with it in the best possible way, and clarity on purpose, requirements, and submission of assignments.",
    "Better cohesion amongst teaching teamInclusion of more sociological analysis",
    "The week discussing \"chart junk\" was overkill and if discussed at all should be limited to 15 minutes. We spent 3 lecture hours and another hour in discussion section on this topic.Most of the time the three professors running the lectures did not seem to coordinate or prepare in advance for the lecture, which added to the feeling that the class was a waste of time (even the professors didn't want to prepare!)The times when students had to briefly debate\/present in the lecture were obvious time-fillers.",
    "Assignments. Having a mind map due without getting any comments back on the first one was unfair, particularly given that almost no one in the class had done one before. grading in general has had a huge lag throughout the course.",
    "Management!",
    "Instead of having all three instructors talk on one day, it may be better to have them lecture on separate days.",
    "The overarching flow of the course lectures, in order to create coherence over the course of the semester",
    "Improved structure. Connecting the class discussions to the discussion sections",
    "The assignments.a) The deadlines need to be better planned out. One weekend we had four assignments due all for this class.b) The weekly reading response was very helpful, but I wonder if students could benefit more from a combination of say reading responses and case studies (group work). This gives student the opportunity to absorb the material in a different setting.",
    "The mind map assignments should be adjusted. Allow the use of any software or program and use it as a stepping stone to develop ideas for a response or the final project. Also, in class it's great that we get to see a topic from 3 different perspectives but that leaves us filled with questions and not enough time to discuss in class. For the final project I think it would be most beneficial to the students to not restrict the topics. I know a lot of groups who had great ideas of what they wanted to do, but then felt stuck when they had to relate it back to food. I think students could get more out of it by tailoring their project to what they're already studying or focusing on but through linkages they hadn't explored yet.",
    "I would like to see a more concerted effort at integration of the perspectives of the three professors in the future. There is an incredibly diversity of knowledge presented, but I would like to see a more cohesive framework for seeking unity among the disciplinary approaches.",
    "MindMaps- This assignment was divorced from the content. MindMaps should be used to map future papers to have better utility. Also the software didn't allow me to map the way I wanted to, which defeats the purpose of the assignment. I would have done a better job of drawing the linkages by hand.Searching for our own reading- I can understand the rationale behind this but this honestly feels like professors are treating us as undergrads or children. We know how to find papers by now and we don't need a semester's worth of searching to teach us. It was an unnecessary step of work and most people turn to a search engine rather than a database or created a Google Doc of papers and as result the professors' goals are not met.The final presentations- These were either not planned well or executed poorly. Many students presented after class was over which was inconvenient for them and made them late for their other commitments. Next year, each group should present to the class or perhaps split up the groups over the course of two classes. Using TEAL was fancy and a departure from the norm but at the end of the day it might be more efficient time-wise to use Burke.The goal of the course- I know what FES is trying to do here but I'm not sure if Linkages is the best way to achieve this goal. Many of my classmate are tired of talking about issues that they can't solve. It's the same old same old. Present a problem, discuss, leave the class and nothing changes. If the course is to be a requirement for a Masters degree, it should have a practicum component.",
    "Modifying the syllabus on the fly throughout the semester. Disgusting how often this was done. Also giving us the name and author of an article to read but having us go find the pdf ourselves? What pointless busy work.",
    "Overall structure and meaning needs to be fleshed out in more detail before the class starts.",
    "To me the changing reading list was confusing since I like to do my reading ahead of time.Some classes were not as well prepared as others",
    "class structure and syllabus organization",
    "TA sections were too long. I think they could be improved.",
    "I don't think the chartjunk class fit in to the overarching goal of the class. It was somewhat interesting and helpful, but also quite subjective.Having the students find the readings themselves was not very useful or time efficient. If there's anything our generation doesn't need to learn from professors, it's internet search skills. We already have these skills and we can easily apply them to just about any search engine or database. This just became one extra thing standing in the way of actually doing the readings.Some of the scheduling for this class bordered on idiotic. Almost none of the due dates followed the syllabus.One of the assignments was announced on the 1st day of spring break and due the evening of the last day of spring break. Sure, students may have to do work over the break, but we use the time for major projects, trips, etc, taking advantage of the flexibility of the break to manage our own time and priorities. We should not have to worry about managing the minutae of monitoring every single email for minor assignments when school isn't even in session. It's not enough that we were shown leniency after turning in the assignment late. That is not fair to students who prefer to stay on top of things.Having reflections due on weekly on Saturday and responses due on Sunday was also very inconvenient and inconsiderate. This ensured that students MUST complete the responses on Sat or Sun only. Students are given Fri, Sat and Sun off from classes so we can arrange research trips, go to conferences etc. I feel this class violated an unwritten code that there should be no regularly occurring work that MUST be done over this three-day period unless it is rationally justifiable and clearly communicated when we sign on to the course. There was no possibility to complete this work during the week, and it was recurring every week. That was extremely frustrating.Another very frustrating thing about the scheduling is that two major assignments were due on a Friday and Monday surrounding one weekend, with nothing due for many weeks before or after. Why not just stagger the due dates, at least by one week?Lastly, in the final poster session the professors completely disregarded the session's time frame. They went at least 40 minutes overtime. Nothing was communicated to the students about how ungraded presentations would be managed. Many of us had other commitments yet were afraid to leave because it was our final project and we had teammates depending on us.",
    "The class seemed to be kind of hit-or-miss. Some classes were fantastic. Other classes were disorganized, disconnected from the readings, and too unstructured. For me, the classes that worked best were the ones where the professors were well-prepared, the scope of the class topic was narrow enough to go in-depth, and the lecture was connected to the readings."

    "Instructor: Cintra Cady Agee \u00a0Very organized and responsive.",
    "Instructor: Cintra Cady Agee \u00a0As stated above...Cintra needs to improve her organization skills, also, she needs to work on filtering her comments. Often, she spoke over students and interrupted student discussions to go off on tangents that would last several minutes.Though, I feel that much of her confusion was mirrored by the rest of the class's confusion and the professor's confusion about the structure of the class.Cintra, did try earnestly to take time to understand each student's issues individually, and clearly cares greatly about the learning process of her students. But I would have preferred to have more interaction with my peers and other students in the discussion group and less interaction with Cintra.",
    "Instructor: Cintra Cady Agee \u00a0She created a space where everyone felt safe participating and disagreeing. She always tried to acknowledge people recommendations for improvements from class to class.A little bit more structure to the discussions would have helped"

    "Dual degree students should be exempt from linkages requirements as their dual degree necessitates that they comprehend linkages. Much of the material covered in this course (aside from some overly-academic readings) is or should be a prerequisite to a Master's level environmental program.",
    "it doesn't at all. It was interesting though.",
    "It exposed me to the different academic and scientific perspectives on common environmental challenges.Many of the examples were new to me making it an educational experience.",
    "This strengthens the systems thinking mindset.",
    "This is a required integrative framework course in my program.",
    "It doesn't. I took it because I had to.",
    "It doesn't really. Each of the professors could probably teach me useful things in their area of expertise, but when they all come together on this shaky common ground it's just a big nothingburger.",
    "I'm focussing on food, so there is a direct link. However, some of the examples used in class were off topic and unhelpful, such as international forestry agreementsOveral, having a class at FES on food by professors that do not study food was pretty illustrative of the lack of mentorship available to students interested in this topic.",
    "I decided to take this course because I want to work for sustainability. This course is therefore one of the most important components of my preparation at FES. It prepares you to look at a problem from different perspectives and link them to find an effective solution.",
    "I took it because it's a requirement, but I think it really could be a great course for tying a lot of different things together. Unfortunately, there are just so many things that were just infuriating throughout the semester. I'm afraid many students will review the course poorly for those things and not for the actual content.",
    "Most of my classes at this point are more specialized. It was fun to take a more general course, which covered major environmental problems that all environmentalists should continually refresh\/recalibrate their thinking on."

This seemed like an appealing one, because of the opportunity to think about big-picture problems like climate change, overexploitation of natural resources.

I didn't feel like we got a lot of that. I would have liked spending more time (and having some assignments) dedicated to creating graphs\/charts, and getting feedback on how we can improve those skills.",

    "Didn't have expectations.",
    "No, not at all. Communication was probably the primary skill to take aways from this class, but the class disorganization and lack of focus made it difficult to deeply practice communication skills.",
