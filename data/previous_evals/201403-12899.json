    "This is probably the best class I have taken in my 4 years at Yale. Professor Purdy Moudarres is brilliant, caring and warm, and her lectures were a great balance between giving necessary context to the text and her own analysis. I am honestly in awe of her, she is one of the kindest and wisest professors I have ever interacted with. The class is definitely lot of work (frequent quizzes, short papers, plus midterm, final exam and paper), but the difficulty of the reading made all this sort of necessary to force me to keep up with it. I don't understand why there were so few people taking this class, though having it small made even the lectures feel really intimate. You can study Dante your entire life and still not understand everything about it, but this class gives you the tools to relate to it and want to keep reading the Divine Comedy over and over again. I'm also pretty sure it made me a better person. Everyone kept talking about how sad they were when the semester was ending, which I have never experienced with any other class.",
    "As far as classes go, you will learn a lot--reading the Divine Comedy is so much better when you have a great guide (hehe), and the lecture does a great job of explaining exactly what is going on. Christiana is a wonderful professor and will help you throughout the semester to understand as much as you possibly can as well as provide extra activities to do together outside of class to enrich the text. The sections are kind of pointless, and be wary that if you do take the Italian section that reading it in Italian is really, really hard, even with an L5 background. The exams are very fair. I promise that you wont regret taking the class if you have any interest in Dante whatsoever!",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "ITAL 310 is a systematic reading of Dante's Divine Comedy and the Vita Nuova. You read all of the poem, and there is a biweekly lecture each on 3-5 cantos, plus a discussion section. There are 5 quizzes throughout the semester and a midterm, final, and final paper. The only main complaint I have with the course is that it can get a little tedious having to memorize the canto numbers. There are passage IDs on the quizzes and exams, and one of the components that we must identify is the canto number (ex: Purgatory, Canto XXVI). That said, Christiana is simply an amazing professor; she's dynamic, engaged, passionate, and incredibly knowledgeable about Dante and medieval Italy. She hosts a variety of Dante-related activities throughout the semester, in addition to a fabulous feast at the end of the semester. I would recommend this course to everybody at Yale. Even for those who do not think of themselves as \"humanities\" people, reading the Divine Comedy is a transformative experience that helped me grow as both a student and a person.",
    "TAKE IT! I obviously never took this class with Mazzotta, but I would have to imagine that CPM rivals him as a lecturer. The reading isn't overwhelming at all, and you will learn SO much by the end of the class. Plus, there's a bunch of really fun events held outside of class time."
