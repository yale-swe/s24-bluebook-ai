    "Psych 110 is a survey course that spends about a week on each of the major topics in psychology. As someone completely new to the field, I found it fascinating. Take good notes in the lectures and on the readings, because the tests can get really specific. I think I would have preferred a final during finals week to an in-class final because I would have liked the extra time to review, but at least you get done with the class early. The only weekly assignments are reading responses which are relatively fun to do, and there is no section which was a good decision on Prof Bloom's part. And of course, he's an amazing, amazing lecturer.",
    "This was a truly fantastic course. Whether you are naturally drawn to psychology or not, Professor Bloom is an incredibly engaging, knowledgable, and witty professor. The lectures are incredibly interesting and engaging, as Professor Bloom manages to cover a wide variety of topics, while throwing in examples from The Simpsons, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Charlie Bit Me, and more. This all, of course, while cracking numerous jokes throughout his lectures. I learned so much useful and applicable information in this course, not to mention getting to learn from one of the preeminent scholars in the field. Even if you do not think that you are interested in psychology, I would highly recommend this course, as, by the end of it, you might change your mind. My only slight critique on the class is that the exams test very specific knowledge and terms, more than overall understanding of the concepts. Still, the exams are mostly multiple choice, and as long as you know to study the materials in detail, you'll be fine.",
    "I loved this course. The topics covered were very interesting and allowed students to explore all aspects of psychology. The guest lecturers brought in were also very engaging and knowledgeable. Bloom was a great professor. He was very clear and presented many amusing and interesting anecdotes and videos. There is a bit more work in Bloom's psych class compared to the other lecturers, but it is definitely manageable.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone. It's easily the best course I've taken at Yale. Gives a great variety of topics, all of which are interesting and thought-provoking.",
    "A great class, but beware that Bloom's class is significantly more work than Chun's class. And all of the assignments expect you to have done the all the readings. Would not recommend taking it with 4 other classes.",
    "Take it (especially if you're a freshman). Not too much work and interesting material. However, despite announcements in class to the contrary, don't make the mistake of thinking Psychology is a science (yet). The field still has a LONG LONG way to go.",
    "This class is great if you are looking for an interesting lecture, but don't expect to have little to do. I was somewhat surprised by the amount of work as I wasn't expecting it, but it's nothing that you can't handle.",
    "A must-take college course, with Bloom if you can. Some of the most interesting lectures with real-world implications you will experience here.",
    "Psychology 110 is a course where you will learn about ALL the different branches of psychology. Its a lot of material and it is focused towards experiments. If you don\u00c2\u00b4t like biology or you are not really into psychology, I don't recommend it. I took it , and I regret because I could have taken other course more related to my major. But, if you are curious, its a good course.",
    "Yes, you should definitely take this course! Paul Bloom gives amazing lectures, and we even got guest lectures from professors such as Peter Salovey, our soon-to-be president! The workload is moderate - weekly reading responses that incorporate the lecture and book, 5 hours of experimental participation as psych subjects, and a 10 page book review on a morality psych book - with 2 midterm exams (no final) - it was a pretty exciting class overall!",
    "I didn't like it, but everyone else did. How odd.",
    "Psych is a very interesting class for people interested in how people are and why certain things about people are what they are. I would definitely recommend the class to another student because it is excellently taught.",
    "Yes!",
    "I think everyone should take this course at some point. Regardless of your academic interests, everyone will be fascinated by some aspect of each and every lecture. It's an incredible window into human life and Professor Bloom is especially engaging.",
    "Best class I've taken here, since Paul Bloom is the best lecturer I've ever heard. Absolutely.",
    "This is a fantastic class. You learn a fair amount about a number of interesting topics in psychology, and Paul Bloom is reliably hilarious. It isn't an overwhelming amount of work, and the exams and assignments are completely doable.",
    "Professor Bloom is an amazing lecturer! He's clear, concise, direct, and to the point; and it's a very organized class in terms of structure and form. You'll learn a lot by taking this course, and I highly recommend checking it out.",
    "Great, great class. Take it. Not that much work, incredibly entertaining lectures, and a fascinating topic - I keep seeing psychology everywhere I go now.",
    "Just do it. Even if you aren't majoring in the course, and even if none of the (many and awesome) classes for which it is a prerequisite appeal to you, take it. Even if (like me), you think you've read much of the material already, TAKE IT. Paul Bloom will tell you things you didn't know. You'll read a book that will stick in your mind (for an independent project--not the textbook, which is a weakish point of the class). You'll look forward to lecture. You'll ace it or come close if you study for a couple of hours before each exam and keep up, more or less, with the reading. There is no downside, and the upside is learning a ridiculous amount of cool stuff that is applicable to many, many disciplines as well as daily life.",
    "I definitely would recommend it. The workload is not too much, the material is very interesting, and the class is well taught.",
    "Intro to Psych is an incredible class! Every lecture is like a really interesting TED talk, and you learn so much by the end. The readings are long but necessary and usually pretty interesting. Paul Bloom is phenomenal and so nice, and I hear the other professors are excellent as well. I would recommend this class very highly to everyone!",
    "Yes! If you want to learn a lot of cool, quirk things about human psychology, take this class :) It is very broad, however, so be ready for lots and lots of information!",
    "Great class. I recommend it to anyone. Wasn't interested in psychology but took the class on a whim and learned a lot even though I don't plan on taking any more courses on the subject. Bloom is great.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you want to take a great lecture.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great survey course, covering everything from morality and religion to development, language, and psychological disorders. I would recommend this class to anyone who is even slightly interested in the field of psychology. It's really not a ton of work and if you study, you will be rewarded.",
    "Take it.",
    "Absolutely. Take it with Professor Bloom. The best course I took this semester. The topics are extremely interesting and the exams were very much reasonable. As long as you put the time and effort, you can expect to get a good grade.",
    "Definitely take Intro Psych with Paul Bloom - you will love his wit and humor. The material you learn is interesting and applicable, and you will be treated to several amazing guest lectures. 1 reading response per week, 1 book report, and 2 exams - not too much work and definitely worth the experience!Overall, a fantastic survey course and introduction to psychology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 presents a good balance between depth and breadth. Definitely lives up to its reputation.",
    "Very thorough class of psychology, it is always fun to go to class because the professor gives very interesting lectures and makes you laugh a lot. If you are even mildly interested on how your brain works, you have to take this class!",
    "Great class. Huge lecture, but Bloom is hilarious and fun to listen to. Pretty heavy reading, so keep up with it! I'd recommend it.",
    "Definitely worth taking.",
    "Would recommend this class. Bloom is a very good lecturer, you don't see someone of his caliber of lecturing very often, even at Yale. The material can be pretty detail oriented, there's a ton of reading, but the quality of the class makes it a class worth taking, especially with Bloom.PS - if you take it, don't skip any lectures. Not even the guest lectures!",
    "Recommended to EVERYONE. Regardless of major or interests.",
    "Fabulous and comprehensive introduction to the discipline of psychology! Take this course at some point, regardless of your major. It's not particularly hard, although if you do all the reading it will take a good chunk of time.",
    "If you don't mind massive amounts of memorization, then this course is not a bad introduction to a topic that most people are unfamiliar with. However, if I had to do it again, I'd avoid it like the plague- massive amounts of useless terms are things that I wanted to leave behind in high school.",
    "YES",
    "Take it Credit\/D. A lot less stressful that way, and still fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Its interesting and not too challenging if you do all of the readings and go to the lectures. The readings can be long but they're easy to understand. Bloom was really engaging, interesting, organized, and open to questions. It was a great class overall.",
    "This is a great class. Excellent (if very topical) overview of the field of psychology, allowing you to get a taste for what you may or may not like within the field. Paul Bloom is a really great lecturer, and the workload is light. Highly recommended.",
    "TAKE IT if Paul Bloom's teaching it. Such a good class! And everyone should understand the basics of psych. Tests are hard and the book review is annoying. Not a very generous curve so I would recommend starting it credit D. Not as easy a class as it may seem but that shouldn't deter you from taking it. You'll come out of every class feeling good and you'll want to go back for each one of them.",
    "I would totally recommend Psych 110 to another student. Just make sure to keep up to date with the reading and don't procrastinate with the final book review....I personally find these easy things to do in a lecture course, but they will come back to bite you. That said, what's nice about Intro Psych is that those sort of bad habits won't kill you (unless you are mortally susceptible to anything less than an A) and even you don't put in 110% you'll still you'll walk out with radically new ways to think about the world.",
    "So fascinating! Take it. Lectures are guaranteed to be captivating, the workload is not bad at all, and you will find yourself applying psych concepts to every aspect of your life. Loved it.",
    "This is definitely a class everyone should take: you learn about yourself and the world around you. There's so much I can apply to my life. That said, there is A LOT of material, but don't beat yourself up if you don't do as well on the exams. There were two in-class exams, a book review (about 10 page paper) and weekly reading responses, as well as five hours experiment participation. Paul Bloom is great and adds lots of extra, interesting things to his lectures, and all the TFs went above and beyond too. Even if you don't end up with an A, you'll know (if you went to lecture) that you went away with a better knowledge of life in general.",
    "Psych 110 was a really fun and interesting class. Studying for the exams can be hard because its a lot of information, but overall it was totally worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to everyone. It gives you a great introduction to a field that crosses into many other subject areas.",
    "I had no interest in psychology going into this class, and i don't know that I will pursue it any further afterwards, but I still really enjoyed this class. The work was very manageable and the exams were fair. The guest lecturers were all really enjoyable. Overall this is a nice, easy, interesting class.",
    "This is a class that everyone should take before graduating college. I know a lot of people say that, but that's because it's true. Yes, the course material is broad. Yes, a lot of it hinges on memorization. But it's definitely worth it. As someone who leans heavily towards the humanities, particularly literature, I found it incredibly valuable to approach issues of human behavior from a scientific perspective.",
    "Yes, definitely a fun class to take to get a introduction into an interesting field.",
    "Psych 110 was an interesting class with great topics studied. The workload is doable, but the exams and report require a lot of hard work. Stay on top of the material and do the readings and you will be fine.",
    "Super fascinating class--take it. The tests are definitely worth studying for (I did all the work and went to all the lectures and still didn't do so hot), but the material is compelling and Paul Bloom is a great lecturer.",
    "It covers various topics of psychology, gives you a basic understanding of the different subject areas.",
    "PYSC 110 is a good measure to tell if PSYC's something you're into. The overview is taught well and the work is very manageable. Nothing is particularly enlightening; most of what you will learn is common sense backed by some scientific study and sometimes assigned a fancy term. Some TF's grade unnecessarily harshly: they grade all work, which is weekly reading response (we had 9), one essay on a recent psychology book, and two exams. The class is decent but not stellar.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, take it. Everything you learn can be applied to real life.",
    "Great into to Psych.",
    "I would recommend this course to every student that has the opportunity to take it. The material is really fascinating and the lectures are extremely enjoyable.",
    "Psychology 110 is a comprehensive view at psychology and gives you a good sense of the different areas of study within the field. I would definitely recommend this class, it is relatable to everyone.",
    "I really enjoyed this term of Intro Psych. The topics we covered were diverse and extremely thought-provoking. Paul Bloom is a legendary lecturer and Peter Salovey's guest lecture on Love is another highlight of the semester. I would definitely say that the class covered the fundamentals of psychology and provided the foundations for us to explore areas of interest in the future.",
    "Psych 110 was a great course. Lectures are stimulating and thought provoking and the workload is not too overwhelming. You cover a wide variety of subjects and the information is very interesting to learn about",
    "Take this class. Paul Bloom is an incredible lecturer and made every class fascinating. The workload is very reasonable and you don't have to do the readings to do well.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Very interesting material that can be applied to all aspects of life.",
    "I would definitely recommend it and though it does involved a lot of information, it is also very interesting.",
    "Great class to take as a freshman",
    "TAKE IT! it's awesome. one of those classes you must take in Yale.",
    "PSYC 110 gives you a broad overview of psychology. Definitely take this if you're interested in learning about psychology. I took this class Credit-D, but taking it for a grade would definitely be harder--the tests are difficult and the curve is sharp. Worth taking sometime during your Yale career, though.",
    "I would highly recommend Psychology 110 to another student. Professor Bloom is an excellent lecturer and his classes are always engaging and thought-provoking. The workload is reasonable, consisting mostly of about a chapter of textbook reading and a short reading response each week. Whether you're simply curious about Psychology or a prospective Psychology major, Psych 110 is an amazing place to start.",
    "i'd recommend not taking it and just attending the lectures, honestly, if you have time for that, and use your \"class spot\" for like, an english seminar or something.Or if you're like me, and you wouldnt have gone to the lectures had it not been for credit due to lack of time, its a nice class",
    "This would be a good class if someone wants to know more about psychology. I wouldn't recommend it to those who do not, in the first hand, an interest in psychology.",
    "General survey course in psychology. I do recommend it but it's a lot of reading.",
    "Pretty standard survey of the field of Psychology. Twice a week, weekly reading responses, two exams, and one paper. If you think you might be interested in Psych, this is the class to take!",
    "It is a very interesting introductory class, but it has a lot of reading and difficult exams. I would recommend it because it relates to everyday concepts and is useful.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. even if you're not a psych major, it's a Yale can't-miss",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology! But realize that this is not a blow off class. There are lots of readings to do that if you get behind in them, it will be really hard to catch up. There are also numerous videos to watch and articles to read. The test covers the readings, the lectures, and all the videos. Studying for the exams required a lot of time! Either way, it's a great class and I fully enjoyed all the assignments, the weekly responses and the lectures.",
    "A brief glimpse of a considerable number of topics in the field of psychology.I would definitely recommend this course. One learns an incredible amount about how they operate, and how others operate. This is a good course even just to become a better human being.",
    "Interesting course which gives a very broad overview of all of psychology. The book review lets you get more in depth in an area of interest.",
    "Studying for it is a pain, too much memorization and useless info. However, do consider the course if you would like to get a general idea of what a psyche class is like, what psyche itself is like, and what studying for psyche is like. PSYCHE.",
    "Psych 110 is overall a pretty excellent intro course that gives you an idea of the field of psychology in general - I would definitely take it because even if you don't plan on majoring in psych or taking any other psych courses, this course was really interesting and Paul Bloom is great too.",
    "This class is a good introductory course to a variety of basic psych concepts. While I did not find the class to be quite as enlightening as a lot of others, Paul Bloom is a good professor who presents the subject material in an engaging manner.",
    "Definitely take this before graduating.",
    "When Paul Bloom says that you will learn the answer behind questions like, why do we dream, what disgusts us, and why can't we tickle ourselves, he is completely right. If you put in the work, you will definitely learn the psychology behind many of our behaviors.Definitely take this class if you are interested at all in psychology. For the first half there is a lot of reading. A lot of people get by not doing it, but to do well on the exam you kind of need to read. Either way, great class, interesting lectures and material, take it if you can.",
    "Overhyped, for sure. It's definitely interesting and Paul Bloom is definitely a great lecturer, but he's also a bit repetitive sometimes. Also, the lectures\/topics that he isn't really interested in are really boring to sit through. Guest lectures are always fun, though. The reading responses are kind of pointless and arbitrary, and the exams are pretty hard. Unless you're a psych major or need an SO (but why would you? There are so many other choices...), I'd recommend just auditing the class so you can pick and choose which lectures\/topics you're interested in and just come on those days.",
    "Intro Psyc is a great course and Paul Bloom is an amazing professor. This was definitely one of my favorite classes this semester and I always looked forward to going to lecture. It covers a wide variety of topics in psychology, from sex to morality to dreams. Expectations for this class are really clear. Study with friends!",
    "yes!",
    "It's a perfectly fine class. You cover everything for psych 101 and have fun in class, but there is a lot of busy work associated with it. I would recommend taking it with Chun because I find Paul Bloom to be too arrogant, though he is entertaining as a lecturer.",
    "Yes. It's a good class to take whether you're a psychology major or not.",
    "Psych is definitely worth taking. The lectures are super interesting, and they fly by. The readings are sometimes interesting, sometimes they feel perfunctory, but they are doable if you break them up. I found it difficult to do well on the exams even with extensive preparation, just because the questions asked seemed to come from random tidbits mentioned in lectures, rather than main themes or topics. So if you're interested in just going to the lectures for fun, but not stressing about every last minute detail, maybe consider taking credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "This class is great if you really want to know what psychology is all about. It really is an \"intro\" course, as it covers a very braod range of topics in psychology, and very lightly. I would recommend taking this class because it helps you gain a psychological point of view. However, you should not really expect an intellectual inspiration.",
    "Absolutely take Psyc 110. You learn so much and Professor Bloom is THE BEST. He really takes into consideration the needs of Yale students -- he tries not to schedule assignments during hell weeks, breaks, etc. He is very understanding and also funny -- I looked forward to going to lecture every time and I stayed engaged the whole hour. At times the readings are long and tedious -- especially the textbook readings -- but this class is worth it. The exams are fairly straightforward and the reading responses that we have every week (short 400-600 word responses) really help reinforce the concepts and make connections. The guest lectures are also incredible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was my favorite this semester. The subject matter is interesting and immediately applicable, and Professor Bloom is an amazing teacher.",
    "Amazing class taught by an amazing professor. Professor Bloom is the best. Everyone should take this class.",
    "Take this course, and take it with Bloom. It will be such a wonderful experience. I learned a lot about psychology and I can actually apply them in real life. It makes me know myself better.",
    "TAKE IT. Whether or not you're interested in science\/social science, take psych. It's an awesome class and thinking about the world in an empirical way is interesting and valuable. Also, BLOOM IS INCREDIBLE. easily one of the best professors at yale. no matter who you are, take this class.",
    "Great survey course. It changed the way I think about a lot of things (hard to explain, but if you take the course, you'll understand). I'd recommend it 100%!",
    "A must take - comes up in everyday conversations and is one of the most comprehensive and interesting and valid courses here.",
    "Best class at Yale for many reasons. Prof. Bloom is a wonderful engaging lecturer, and the material is highly relevant and interesting. I looked forward to every class.",
    "It's great for a Cr\/D\/Fail because it's soooo much work that an A is almost impossible if you have a full course load.",
    "It was fun, though it could be redundant if you took AP Psych in high school. Even so, when he does little experiments or tricks in class, it's amusing to watch the reactions of people who have never taken a psych course. They \"ooh\" and \"ah\" and it's hilarious.",
    "In Psychology 110 you'll attend two lectures a week and be exposed superficially to a very wide range of psychological concepts ranging from memory, to neuroimaging technology, to sleep and dreams, to clinical psychology and therapy methods. You'll be asked to do a lot of reading, both from the textbook and from online sources, and if you don't keep up you'll be drowned in work the night before the exam. You'll also have to submit a weekly reading response, applying what's learned in lecture and through the textbook and\/or assigned articles to answering a question in 400 to 600 words. This really forces you to examine the themes of psychology, which is why the reading responses are a great addition to the class, despite being an extra essay to write every week. You'll also have to write a 3,000 word book review, tying together psychological concepts, and to participate in experiments on campus as a subject to learn protocol and see how psychology is applied in the real world. You'll take two exams.I would definitely recommend this class to anyone and everyone, regardless of major or interest. Psychology is a fascinating topic, and it's relevant to everyone in some capacity or another. The workload is manageable, the lectures are wonderful and it's really rewarding to be in this class.",
    "Yes, I would but have them know in advance that they needed to be willing to work hard outside class and do all the readings.",
    "It is a basic introductory course in the many areas of psychology. I would absolutely recommend it to another student because Professor Bloom is an amazing lecturer and the course material is interesting to anyone.",
    "Definitely not all it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cracked up to be. I took this class as a junior because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposedly one of the must-takes at Yale, but ended up finding it very boring. Only take it if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually interested in Psychology. Also, make sure to take it Cr\/D! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hard to get an A grade in this class because of the curve.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to any other student, whether or not Psychology is an interesting subject to them. It is a fascinating class, and Professor Bloom is a riveting lecturer. The workload is manageable, but I certainly don't think that this class is a gut. However, Professor Bloom's passion for the material made the work very accessible for me, even the neuroscience portion that was less interesting to me.",
    "A pretty classic class - take it Credit\/D if you're an upperclassman because God knows the freshmen are going to study way too hard and bomb your grade.",
    "This course is fascinating, and Paul Bloom is legendary and entertaining! Lectures leave you reconsidering aspects of day-to-day life, and the guest lectures are also incredible! The only weakness is that as any huge lecture course, it is impersonal and I wish there were a section at least once a week in addition to the lectures in order to discuss the ideas presented in lecture.Paul Bloom is a wonderful, funny, incredible professor! If you are going to take Intro to Psyc, I doubt there is a better professor at Yale or even in universities around the world.Take this class whether or not you need to for credit\/major- it's amazing!",
    "Fantastic course. Information is interesting and Bloom is an incredible lecturer. Workload is very reasonable: weekly reading responses, 2 midterms, paper, and experimental participation.",
    "I would recommend taking this class. For the most part, the material is interesting and the lectures are actually engaging.",
    "It's a hard class, don't underestimate how much you need to study for exams to do well. That said, the material is interesting, and Bloom's a great lecturer. Fun class to attend lectures for, but not so fun to do readings, papers, exams, etc. Take it Cr\/D if you can, you'll probably enjoy it a lot more and stress less about your grade.",
    "Great, interesting class that I always enjoyed coming to. This is pretty much must take class while you're at Yale, but I'm glad I took it CR\/D\/F. The work load is pretty intense, especially for an intro class.",
    "Best course ever, ever. This is mostly because psychology is the most amazing thing ever (which I only discovered in this course). But it is also because the material is presented in a funny, interesting way.",
    "THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS TO TAKE CR\/D\/F. Paul Bloom is a god. This was one of the few classes I was always excited to go to. Even though I took this Credit\/D\/Fail, I still went to all the lectures and did all the readings because it is all presented in such an enjoyable way. Highly recommended, esp. with Paul Bloom.",
    "TAKE IT! There's a reason there's so much buzz surrounding the class. Paul Bloom knows his stuff, and is very personable. Go to his office hours!",
    "The material taught in this class is very interesting, and I recommend it to anyone who is considering it.",
    "A great course. You will learn a lot, but be careful with exams. They are most of your grade and can really be tough.",
    "Absolutely! Take it. It's a phenomenal course.",
    "A good intro course if you're interested in psychology. A little bit of everything is included with interesting facts at every turn, and the assignments are straight-forward and a bit easy while you still feel like you're learning a lot.",
    "A stellar course. I would highly recommend taking it at any point during your time at Yale, but I think it is especially valuable for freshmen. The course is structured SO well to help you learn and teach you how to study and be successful in college. The content is also applicable to learning in just about any field.Paul Bloom is masterful. He is entertaining and clear, he is knowledgeable and interesting. He fields questions and brings in guest lecturers. He has clearly taught this course many times, and he has it down to a science.The workload is what you make of it, but it is enjoyable and certainly not overwhelming.Take this course!",
    "Not if you absolutely have to.",
    "Psych 110 is a great intro psych course, and Bloom is a great lecturer. Be ready to do a LOT of textbook reading. Also, the book report (a ~10 page paper that comes in the second half of the semester) is infinitely easier to write if you choose an applicable book, even at the expense of a book that interests you. Besides some mundane writing and reading assignments, it's generally a good course.",
    "Take this class even if you have no interest in psychology. It's not hard or a lot of work, and you learn so much.",
    "Very interesting class, from first day to last. You will learn a lot. Definitely one of the classes you should take before leaving Yale.",
    "The day before he was announced president-elect, Peter Salovey lectured on how to make someone fall in love with you by either spiking or spilling coffee and on the arousal value of Christians getting mauled by lions.",
    "It's a great class to take for basic understanding of psych and fun class to take. I would recommend this class to another student if their other course load is not terrible large.",
    "Without a doubt.",
    "Really fun! I would definitely recommend for someone who wants an overview of general concepts in psych.",
    "I highly recommend it! The textbook reading can be long, but manageable if you spread it out. Paul Bloom is funny and knowledgable. I learned a lot and feel that it is all material that is relevant in daily life. Material I learned in psychology comes up on a daily basis. The exams are challenging, but fair.",
    "Well, I will still recommend this course even though I didn't like it very much. I'd simply say: pick Marvin Chun instead of Paul Bloom!",
    "Very difficult but would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psych 110 to anyone interested in the field and also for the sole pleasure of self-knowledge. The course is fascinating, but it is a lot of work. If possible, use a Cr\/d\/fail, not with the intent to not put effort into the class, but in this way you would worry about knowledge and not grades. Could be more enjoyable!",
    "It's awesome. Paul Bloom makes his course worth taking and the topics are so fascinating. It is difficult to do well on examens though, but it's a great course to just absorb and experience so take it maybe credit\/d\/fail.",
    "I think it is a course that should be taken by anyone remotely interested in the material.",
    "Psychology 110 is a pretty challenging course that deals with the vast entirety of the broad field of psychology. Dr. Paul Bloom is a fantastic professor, and although the work load is fairly heavy, I would certainly recommend this class to a fellow student. I enjoyed every class that I went to and the material is so engaging that the extra work is well worth it.",
    "Introduction to the perspectives and topics of psychology",
    "Yes! Interesting and not too hard",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It is not too difficult. Just make sure to keep up with the readings and videos. It is not a gut class, however, and you have to work hard to do well. Other than two exams, there are weekly 400-600 word reading responses and a 3500 word final paper.",
    "Really interesting overview of basic psychology. Great class.",
    "I would recommend this course only if the professor were Paul bloom.",
    "Really great class, a must-take at Yale. Bloom is a fabulous and entertaining lecturer, and this class was just so enjoyable. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly.",
    "Amazing class, a bit more work than you would expect (or than what Marvin Chun's students go through), engaging lectures, and fascinating material.",
    "The class absolutely lived up to its hype. I wish I could relive this experience through every semester at Yale - never mind the workload, it was all completely worth it.No, this was not a rigorous psychology class, but we definitely cherry-picked some of the most interesting aspects of the many different disciplines of psychology. Lectures didn't even feel like lectures - it felt like showing up at the YUAG auditorium twice a week and just hearing THE COOLEST SHIT for an hour and fifteen minutes. Seriously, it was awesome.But be warned. The curve was deceptively rough. I think only one-third get A's, the next third gets B's, and the rest get C's or maybe even below. This wasn't a huge problem for me because I thought the midterms were hilariously easy - they reminded me of a high school test, maybe because I'm used to obnoxiously difficult science midterms here at Yale. Still, know that you will still have to study and work hard to get the A.",
    "This is a fairly easy class that although basic, teaches you a good deal. It's interesting and since it only consists of 2 lectures a week, it doesn't take too much time. With a few exceptions, reading is pretty light. The grading of the weekly reading responses is great- i got full credit for ever single one and usually wrote it in a rush at the last minute. The tests can sometimes ask for very specific things, which is annoying but the class is so enormous that if you study enough, it's not too hard to do better than the average. A word of advice: do your experiments early! I would recommend this for anyone that is interested, whether planning to pursue psychology or not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even if you are not a psych major. The topics are very interesting and it's fun to discuss them with other students and friends. The course load is very manageable.",
    "Take psych if you want an easy A or need it as a prereq. Or if you've never taken a psych class and want to learn some fun stuff. If you have taken AP psych in high school absolutely don't take this class you won't learn anything new!",
    "It is a class you should take at some point being at Yale, preferably with Professor Bloom. It is extremely interesting and a good introductory course, there is just a lot of information to read and remember.",
    "Definitely take this class! I waited to take it until I was a Junior, which was probably a mistake because now I want to take more psych classes. Professor Bloom is a fantastic lecturer, and it is generally just a fun course.",
    "I think I would recommend it even though I failed and therefore dropped the class.",
    "A great intro course.",
    "Interesting class, but a lot of work and you have to do all of the readings to prepare for the exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is a great introductory course and Paul Bloom is a wonderful Professor.",
    "It was a solid, good course. Take it if you don't know what else to take. And take with either Paul or Marvin - they are both great lecturers. It is honestly not that hard and not a lot of work - just keep up on the readings and don't be stupid on the tests. This said, it is a bit over-hyped so I would drop another course just because of this one - it didn't change my life but I am glad I took it.",
    "Take this class! Very interesting and Professor Bloom is one of the best lecturers around.",
    "Of course! Intro to Psych with Paul Bloom is incredibly informative and engaging. I took psychology in high school, but I came away from Bloom's lecture with not only insight about more interesting and cutting-edge topics (after all Bloom is a leader in the field), but also with a more in-depth understanding and appreciation for the field of psychology - and just how complex and fascinating it is. So much of the material is applicable that you'll find yourself noticing lots of things that relate back to different studies, lectures, readings, videos (i.e. I just watched the documentary \"Happy\" and had learned most of the content from Intro to Psych), so in that way it's very rewarding and exciting. Definitely a class with a justifiably great reputation.",
    "Psychology 110 is a broad overview of the history and evolution of psychology which gives students a comprehensive knowledge of the key figures and elements of the field. While the course never goes into great depth on any particular subject, it provides a solid base of understanding with which to further explore psychology at Yale. I'd recommend it for any student interested in psychology in any way.",
    "Take it. Paul Bloom is brilliant and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn a ton of things that directly pertain to your life. The sooner you take this, the better \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sophomore Fall already felt like it was too late!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. It provides a general understanding of many interesting aspects of psychology.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a good class.",
    "PSYC110 with Paul Bloom was an excellent course.The instructor was excellent in engaging students during lecture, using personal anecdotes, video clips, and interesting research discoveries to strengthen the material being learned. Lectures are engaging and the guest lectures are especially interesting in providing more details on topics. Keeping up with the readings is important, and the workload is not too much -- a weekly response to a question given.",
    "TAKE IT! You will learn so much. It is so interesting, especially with Paul Bloom, who is legendary. One of my favorite classes, lectures were actually something I looked forward to. The reading responses were do-able, and they weren't even due every week. The exams were tough though, you had to memorize a lot of things (I'm not good at memorizing). The book report was difficult to do - DO NOT wait till the last minute to read the book\/start it. But afterwards a lot of the interesting things I learned in the book stuck with me.",
    "A MUST TAKE class while at Yale - so interesting and all-ecompassing. Take it with Paul Bloom if possible.",
    "I would summarize Psychology 110 as a great introductory course in psychology. It was definitely very enjoyable, interesting, and informative in every way. I would definitely recommend it to another student, and in fact to every student at Yale as I feel that some basic knowledge of psychology is extremely worthwhile for every educated person.",
    "Yes. I found the topiccs very interesting and Paul Bloom was a great professor.",
    "Take this course. Even if you've taken psychology in high school, it is much different with a professor like Paul Bloom. Psychology 110 is a great insight into people's thoughts and behaviors. If nothing else, you will leave the course with a better understanding of yourself.",
    "Good course. Easy enough. Interesting. Lecturer is fantastic, material is fascinating, course is nice to do.",
    "You must take this course at some point of your college career.",
    "Definitely take this course, its very interesting and well taught.",
    "Everyone should take Psych 101 here. It's a great course.",
    "Great great class. Everyone needs to know about psychology.",
    "It's an awesome intro course and very interesting, but make sure to keep all of the requirements and reading in mind, because those can build up.",
    "An interesting survey course. It won't go as in-depth as you may like, but it's still a class worth taking.",
    "Absolutely! The course is hard and it's easy to get beaten up on one of the tests, but Paul Bloom is an amazing professor and the material is highly engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class. Interesting topic, great lecturer, plenty of material covered. It's important to stay on top of the work, but the assignments aren't too hard and if you stay on track it will probably end up being one of your preferred classes.",
    "Psych 110 01 is a course where it can be very easy to get behind in - although the class only meets twice a week and the work load may not seem like a lot, it actually requires more time and thought than expected. It's really important to keep up with the readings (especially for the weekly reading responses), and try to get the Experimental credits completed as soon as possible (a lot of them are actually really fascinating!). I definitely recommend this course; it explores psychology from both a biological and social standpoint, and Professor Bloom as well as the guest lecturers make each lecture very interesting.",
    "A great intro course covering many topics in psychology. Professor Bloom is phenomenal and one of the best lecturers at Yale, in my opinion. Easy and fun to listen to! Reading and responses every week, a few hours of experimental participation, a paper, midterm, and final...if you don't mind that then go for it!",
    "Amazing. Take it !!!!!",
    "Psychology 110 (especially with Paul Bloom) is one of those \"must take\" classes at Yale. It was my favorite class this semester BY FAR and made me decide to major in psychology. Paul Bloom is an absolutely incredible lecturer who makes you actually look forward to going to class. If you actually do the readings and pay attention to what Professor Bloom is saying in class, you'll learn a lot of interesting things about psychology. This isn't a gut class; there's quite a bit of work -- weekly reading, reading responses, experimental participation, a book review, and two exams -- but it's manageable if you don't treat it like a gut class. I would not hesitate for an instant before recommending this class to another student. Just take it. You won't regret it.",
    "Psych 110 is a very good introduction to psychology. I would definitely recommend taking it sometime during your four years! Even if you are not interested in the social sciences or psychology, it provides valuable insight into how people think and function. Professor Bloom is great. If you ever miss a lecture, they are all uploaded online. The work is not bad. There are a few chapters of reading assigned each week, a reading response, one book report, a midterm, and a final. Definitely definitely definitely take the course. Even though there's not a lot of work you learn a lot and it's very interesting.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend. Everything learned in this course is applicable to most situations in life and would make a very interesting major.",
    "I would definetely recommend this class to a fellow student. The knowledge learned in Pysch 110 is useful for any college student.",
    "Challenging for an intro class, but all topics made extremely interesting",
    "A great class, super engaging although obviously a survey course. Interesting for people not even considering a major related to psychology. Professor Bloom was fantastic, too.",
    "I would highly recommend Introduction to Psychology to all students. It is so interesting to learn about the way we think and interact as humans.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It never hurts to learn more about yourself and other people!",
    "This is an excellent course! The material is really interesting, the professor is amazing, and although you need to study hard for the exams, the workload is not overwhelming. I'd recommend Psych 110 to any student, even non-Psych majors. I very much enjoyed it.",
    "It's a solid introduction to psychology but there is a lot to cover. Professor Bloom makes the class exciting. Also I think the first edition of the textbook worked out fine.",
    "Overall, this class provides a good overview of a wide range of psychology subjects. It is an introductory survey course, so it does move quickly and you don't spend much time on any one subject. But it's worthwhile if you're interested in Psychology. The lectures were generally engaging, although you do have to read the textbook thoroughly in order to do well in the course. Despite the fast pace and often daunting amount of material, I would recommend this class as a good introduction to the wide range of topics in psychology.",
    "Great class. I would definitely recommend it. Professor Bloom is great and the material is very interesting",
    "I would recommend this class. Paul Bloom is a good lecturer. If you have never had any experience in psychology, you will love the class as it gives an overview of the different areas of psychology. For someone who has had past experience in the subject or taken other classes in the psychology department at Yale, there may be some overlap. Your grade is based on two exams (your better score counts more), weekly reading responses, and a book review. The workload is very manageable. The exams, however, are tricky. Make sure you carefully review ALL of the reading. The reading responses were fun. The book review was enjoyable, because the books and prompts were interesting. Take this class.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend Psychology 110 01 to another student. I would tell them to be wary of the workload, for it is immense and requires a lot of remembering and reading. Otherwise the information learned within the class is something that will they will carry with them for awhile. Learning about the human psychology is something that everyone should have a small grasp upon because developing a better understanding on how we work is very helpful in life.",
    "Take it!",
    "In Psych 110 you learn the basics of psychology. You learn all of the general information, which at times can be obvious, but is also very interesting. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Overview of the different departments of psychology. I would reccomend this class to anyone even if they are not going to major in psych",
    "Make sure you really like psychology as a subject before you enjoy the charm of Prof. Bloom, or Prof. Marvin Chun. The course includes a considerable amount of common sense knowledge which you can understand easily without any academic training in psychology, namely, from merely from casual readings. Some is anti-intuition and inspiring, but mostly it seems generally not very interesting for me. I gave this course a chance because I wished Prof. Bloom would change my personal view towards psychology, but it does not work - I still dislike this subject and cannot become interested and convinced in either its knowledge scope or its methodology. Very sad. Additionally, the 400-to-600-word weekly reading response is not a very good channel to exercise either psychological knowledge or writing skills.",
    "Great class, definitely worth taking!",
    "An overall survey of psychology. You cover a lot of material on a generally superficial level, but Paul Bloom did a good job of assigning reading responses and generating conversations in lectures that helped students delve deeper into certain topics. I would recommend this class to anybody interested in learning about psychology and how the human mind works. Doing the readings regularly in this course is really important; I fell behind early in the semester and didn't get nearly as much out of the class as I could have.",
    "Intro Psych was an incredible experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094full of interesting studies and experiments, teeming with fascinating lectures and fun pop science reading assignments. Professor Bloom was an incredible speaker, and I left each class enthralled and inspired by the day's material. The course opened my eyes to how good a lecture could be (as a frmr. small-class private school student, I was sort of scared of all non-seminar classes\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had been sure I wouldn't like them), and it has inspired me to pursue cognitive science or psychology as a major. Deceptively large workload (and reading load), but worth it.",
    "It's a great intro class that covers a broad range of material really well.",
    "Yes strongly recommend.",
    "Whether for the psych major, a social science credit, or just plain interest, taking intro psych is a worthwhile investment. The material really prods your brain, and the lectures are rarely boring. Realizing that the way you have been interacting with people your whole life is actually a field of knowledge with scientific backing is both exciting and intriguing.",
    "Psyc 110 is a GREAT intro course.... I would definitely recommend taking it with Paul Bloom if you can - even wait for him to teach it again. He's a great lecturer - makes you want to go to lecture even when you could just get the notes from someone else. Missing lecture was never something I wanted to do, and I was always paying attention, even if I was super tired. Exams are a bit stressful since there's a lot of reading from the textbook that you're responsible for, even when the material isn't mentioned at all in lecture. But it's definitely manageable.",
    "Horrid curve. You'll love the course and Bloom, you'll just hate the curve. And eventually you'll hate yourself for pouring your life into something you love that doesn't love you back. If you can stomach an average of C+ then take it, otherwise take it credit D.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the information is useful and can be applied to everyday life",
    "Intro Psych is a course that delves into every aspect of psychology- don't take it because you solely want to learn about antidepressants- it covers so much material in so little time. The lectures are exciting but be prepared for lots of reading and rote memorization.",
    "An interesting overview of main topics in psychology. I would recommend this course if psychology interests you, but stay away if it does not because the work can be tedious.",
    "It's a great survey course. Bloom is brilliant.",
    "I would describe this as a sort of crash course in all of psychology as you might expect, it never goes too deep into one aspectof it, but gives you sort of a basic understanding of all the different facets of the science.Yes I would very much recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but if you have already taken a Psychology course in high school, much of it will be review. If you are interested in the subject, however, you will probably like it anyway and the guest speakers and ted talks are great!",
    "Easy to keep on top of workload but also easy to fall behind. Interesting topics and fun lectures. Hard but fun!",
    "Extremely interesting and entertaining course, definitely a must-take for pretty much everyone. Paul Bloom is an outstanding professor, and his lectures are so interesting and entertaining that I always looked forward to going to that class. The only negative about this course is that so much information is packed into one semester that the exams cover a lot of information so they are pretty challenging in that way, though the questions are usually pretty straight forward. Also, there is no section for this class so it is easy to get behind in the reading if you don't stay on top of it. Overall though, this was an amazing course and I think everyone should take it, especially if Paul Bloom is teaching.",
    "Very interesting. Great overview of Psych.",
    "PSYC 110 is a large lecture course covering the basics of many major topics psychology, taught primarily through lectures, readings, videos, and reading responses. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as it is taught well (Professor Bloom's lectures are bothinteresting and engaging), and the material is relevant and applicable. I would definitely recommend it to all Yale students to take.",
    "Fantastic course. Paul Bloom is a wonderful lecturer, as are all the guest speakers.The reading responses are graded leniently and the tests are fair. Take advantage of the fact that there is an older version of the course online.I recommend this course for anyone, even those not remotely interested in studying psychology.",
    "Great class. Very interesting and Bloom is a great lecturer. I enjoyed going to class because the material was so interesting and Bloom presented it in an entertaining way. Expect lots ofreading, an easy reading response throughout the week, and very difficult tests (midterm and final are 60% of grade). Again, overall, a great class worth taking.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is interesting and Professor Bloom is engaging. However, students should be prepared to write a 12 page book review as well as complete reading responses every week.",
    "The course is very intense, but definitely worth it. However, a student must put in the work in order to actually benefit from the material -- otherwise he or she may get lost in the discussion. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Take it for the quintessential lecture experience, but you're actually going to have to do the work as well.",
    "Take it as an introductory course. It is very interesting and might lead you into the field which you really love.",
    "Psychology 110 (Introduction to Psychology) is one of Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better introductory level courses. The course overviews the important material from social, cognitive, clinical, and developmental psychology, emphasizing the interactions between the different subfields and using contemporary studies and research to enrich the learning experience. The course workload is normal for a Yale course. There are weekly readings (up to 70 pages, but usually less) and reading responses, a 10-page book review, a midterm exam, and a final exam. The reading responses and essay assignment are good ways to reinforce the material taught in class and in the readings and to tie these in with contemporary events, news articles, or research. The course exams, both administered during class time, are fair in terms of difficulty and length. I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students. The course is applicable to many academic disciplines besides psychology and I highly encourage students to take it with Paul Bloom (or Marvin Chun, whose guest lecture was amazing). If you do the readings and pay attention during class, you will likely do well on the exams and get a lot of out of this class, including a better-educated perspective on human behavior. There are not many classes at Yale that teach students so much about themselves. Because of the great teaching, the wide applicability of psychology to other subjects, and the fascinating breadth of course material, all Yale students should definitely consider making Psychology 110 part of their academic program.",
    "This course surveys many topics of psychology. You will be required to write weekly reading responses, a 3000 word book review, participate in 5 hours of experiments, and take two tests, but the material is interesting enough to make all of this worthwhile.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Both interesting and entertaining, Professor Bloom makes this class something you will look forward to go to.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It is a great survey of psychology, and the end unit on social psychology was particularly interesting. That being said, I had not taken any psychology classes before, so this information was all new to me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for students who have already taken a psychology course, a lot of the material might be review. ProfessorBloom is a great lecturer, always keeping the classes interesting and entertaining (in addition to traditional slides, he tells a lot of stories and uses video clips). It is an amazing opportunity to get to hear from him, because has so much experience in the field. The class itself is not particularly demanding\u00e2\u0080\u0094there are no sections, and the main assignments are short weekly reading responses. Midterms and finals aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too difficult, as long as you read the book in addition to attending lectures (the material covered in the lectures only overlaps about 50% with the textbook readings).",
    "Psychology 110 was my favorite class this semester! Everyone should take this class even if you do not plan on becoming a psych major! This class is so interesting and applicable to life! You learn so much in this course! There is no reason why you shouldn't take it! Paul Bloom is wonderful!",
    "Absolutely recommended. Paul Bloom is an incredible lecturer. An ideal introduction to the subject.",
    "Psychology 110 is the basic introduction to psychology, but don't let that fool you. Even if you've aced AP Psychology, you will learn so much more than any high school class ever could teach. And Paul Bloom is awesome - I've had a lecture class be so entertaining."
