    "PLSC 181 is more of an introduction to the political history and current political situation in South Asia. The course focuses on the relations of the south asian countries with each other as well as with the rest of the world. It focuses on all the major concerns the world has with the region including terrorism, development of nukes etc and students are able to engage in healthy debate to suggest solutions to all of the problems.However the course does not focus on one specific topic in detail so if a student is interested in just the development of nukes and its impact on the region, I would not recommend this course. Also the course ends up focusing more on India and Pakistan since they are two very major countries of the region so if a student is more interested in learning about some other country in south asia in detail I would suggest they take some other course.Professor Hanson meanwhile is very adorable. She encourages healthy discussion in class and is very open to students' ideas. She tries to get to know each student personally, and encouraged us to meet her during office hours. She discussed our research papers in detail with us and would often share whatever resources she found related to our topic. She also shares a lot of interesting articles, websites and videos that help you learn more about South Asia in a fun and entertaining way.",
    "Take this class, and take it with Professor Hanson. It was technically a lecture, but it was small so we also spent a lot of time in discussion. South Asia is an incredibly interesting region which many people know very little about. Highly recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it to any student; you learn relevant information that better helps you understand world issues today.",
    "This a great intro course to the subject matter - it is structured in a way that the material will be accessible to those with little exposure to South Asian affairs, but will build up to the big, complex questions. Unlike big intro lecture courses though, this one has a really personal feel to it - Professor Hanson is such a great person who cares about her students and helps them get what they want to get out of the course. There's no way not to like her. Definitely recommended.",
    "Yes--interesting class, accessible professor, more people should know about modern South Asian history.",
    "If you are interested in South Asian politics, this course is a must take.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Readings are interesting, as are the lectures. You will learn a great deal about South Asia and won't kill yourself doing so.",
    "yes! definitely take it. it is a great overview on south asia (for beginners). betty hanson is so sweet and really cares about her students. the work load isn't that bad--just midterm, research paper, and final. you have to do some of the readings but not all of it. i learned a lot and am so glad i took it!",
    "It is a great class especially if you are interested in how South Asia is shaping world security and economics",
    "It's great and really interesting--class is very relaxed, but informative--Professor is great and nice and lots of in-class participation--plenty of reading though--but grading is fine--class participation, 10 page paper, mid term, final--tests are always straightforward and about the clear-cut main issues",
    "If you have any interest in the region-- take this class!",
    "If you want to learn about India, and Afghanistan and Pakistan- this is one of the best courses.",
    "yes",
    "I would highly recommend this course to someone who has an interest in learning about South Asia. Not only will you learn the history of South Asia and the various conflicts there, you address a lot of the \"why\" questions as well. Work level is very favorable as well.",
    "You should take this course if you are interested in the region but dont know much about it."
