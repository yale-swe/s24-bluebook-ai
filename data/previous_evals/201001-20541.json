    "Fantastic course, will change the way you think about classics (or literature in general). Looks at translation from all angles, very thought provoking. Also a lot of fun.",
    "I would say it is a study of the history of translating the Classics, as well as a practical translation workshop, based on the theories and examples that we studied. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Summary: How texts have been read cross-culturally and individually. Would definitely recommend."

   "comments": [
    "Classics courses consist of translation, yet translation itself is almodt never discussed. I loved being able to approach this familiar exercise and subject in a new way. The act of translating, despite its perpetual stigma, is so important tothe continuation of the field.",
    "I had never thought seriously about translation as an idea before--as well as a career choice! I am now thinking about possible ways to integrate this into my future plans.",
    "Too early to say with respect to research and dissertation etc. But this course contributed in many, many ways to the way I approach texts. To study translation is not just to look at a cultural phenomenon; it is too look how texts have been read (as I've said elsewhere here), and this allows one to examine one's own way of approaching texts. This is a central problem for both literary critics and literary historians (I incline more toward the latter), because one's always got to be aware of these things. This class helped heighten that awareness for me."
