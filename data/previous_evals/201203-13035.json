    "DS H&P is a worthwhile class for anyone interested in humanities, history, classics, or political science. All the history relates to war, government, and politics, so that's something to keep in mind if you are interested in a different kind of history. It's also important to note that, although you pick up some history along the way, the course is primarily a course in historiography (learning about how the study of history evolved over the centuries) and in the history of political thought. It's not a standard history or political science course by any means, but it is a valuable grounding for the study of those subjects in later years at Yale. El Amine is an ok instructor, and you'll be fine in her class, but I would probably accept a switch if someone offered it.",
    "Overall, this course was very useful as a survey of Western history. The lectures were generally engaging, though they varied widely based on the lecturer, as can always be expected. Personally, history is not a subject that I am especially enthusiastic about, so this class was not particularly exciting to me--but is certainly worth taking if you do love history. Professor El Amine can seem a bit intimidating at first, but she is very knowledgeable, and her essay comments are quite helpful--my writing improved drastically over the course of this semester.",
    "I would summarize this class as a study of topics of state, government, and law, with a good amount of Greek and Roman history as well. I would recommend this course to a friend. It was interesting to learn about the ideal governments of the various major thinkers, and how these governments either survive or disintegrate in human society.",
    "DS is just as it seems \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0lots of great books, lots of reading, a paper every week. It's stressful and hard at times, but looking back, I really can't imagine a better semester. While H&P was probably the least interesting of the three sections this semester, it's still a terrific course that will make you a better writer and thinker. Loubna is overall a great instructor, definitely one of the better ones in the fall. While Greek\/Roman\/early-Christian world isn't her area of specialization, she knows it well enough to run section effectively (and this did make her more sympathetic to the fact that some of them are plain dry and difficult to get through). Make sure you go to office hours and talk, especially before papers \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0she is very helpful one on one.",
    "DS H&P is excellent. It feels a little unnatural in that it operates more like a lit course than anything at the beginning, but then moves into political theory. For a new professor, El Amine was great, though certainly was still learning some of the ins and outs of teaching. Also graded very fairly in my opinion. Furthermore, El Amine is very accessible and personable, a real joy to work with. She is also very sensitive and reasonable in working with the volume of reading.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, but I would say that this spring or next fall it would be preferable to have a more experienced professor if possible. Professor El Amine is great and incredibly inteligent, but in terms of instructional\/pedagogical 'know-how', I certainly feel there were better professors to be had this fall.",
    "I won't bother to summarize the arguments for and against Directed Studies as a whole (there's enough of that floating around campus), but I will highly recommend Professor El Amine. Her grading was somewhat hard, but - I thought - very fair; it challenged me and pushed me to write a much better essay than I was capable of at the start of term. Her section, while lacking some spontaneity, is very consistent and thorough; you'll leave the first semester H&P with a very solid understanding of each work and recurring theme.",
    "I would say that DIrected Studies 005 06 is an excellent class. As intensive as it is, you would not regret all your efforts because it truly gives you a better understanding of human nature. Its corpus is delightful and by the end of the term, you really feel getting something out of it.So I would recommend for all those reasons this class to anyone who is ready to work hard to study all those masterpieces.",
    "I would recommend DS Fall Hist&Polit Thought. The material is well-taught and important to learn to have a solid basis of Western political theory."
