   "comments": [
    "The course has a lot of writing, so I would only suggest it to someone who is not taking other courses that have daily or weekly assignments",
    "Take it, it's an amazing course -- it gets you to think about yourself and how you relate to your writing in a really powerful way. The format works really well and the five different essay topics really let a curious new writer explore different styles and voices and figure out what works for you",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This was my favorite class this semester. The articles you read are interesting, and I've never heard anyone complain about an English 120 professor--they're all great. Professor Fehrman gave me meaningful comments on my essays and I do feel like I've grown as a writer. Once this class is over, you'll find you're incredibly proud of the essays you wrote.",
    "Chill, informative class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. There is a lot of reading and writing, but it really helps you improve your writing. You get lots of specially chosen articles to learn from and a great professor to give you feedback. Plus the workshops are fantastic. Not only do they give you feedback from your classmates, but they also give you a chance to see how your classmates write their essays.",
    "English 120 is a great course to take if you are looking to improve both writing and reading skills (analytic or not!) Exercising your writing skills weekly is super important, and this class lets you do that in a fun and manageable way.",
    "This is an awesome English class, especially if you're looking to get away from reading actual books and trying to get at some shorter, more New Yorker type articles. Really teaches you how to read critically. Getting in the rhythm of writing all the time is also very helpful, believe it or not -- as the semester goes on, you find yourself able to produce better writing faster because you've been doing a lot of it. Not as much work as everyone says it is -- I would 100% recommend 120.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL120 to any student even remotely interested in writing, or who has always enjoyed reading. Working with creative nonfiction will open your eyes up to a variety of new subgenres that you may not have been exposed to if your previous English experience was limited to literature and fictional novels. This is NOT an easy class, do not expect an easy A, but definitely worth taking. Especially with Prof. Fehrman-- his comprehensive comments will improve your writing immensely.",
    "This was an amazing class. We read essays and tried to emulate the writing. The readings were interesting. It felt more like reading a blog than homework. Class was comfortable enough so that you participated because you had something to say rather than that it was required of you. The professor is very approachable and, I thought, sensitive to every student's feelings. Discussion was therefore very fruitful. For each essay, we submitted a first draft before the final. The comments were helpful and encouraging even when Iwas having a hard time with the essay. My writing improved drastically, and I enjoyed the process.",
    "Short readings, essays every week. At a certain point I felt like an essay factory.",
    "English 120 is about learning how to write literary non-fiction, how to be a more effective non-fiction writer. It is not a research-intensive course. Rather, it is about discovering how to use your own skills as a writer, how to streamline these skills, and how to fine tune them. I would certainly recommend this another student. The essays are actually fun to write, though you are still improving as a writer every step of the way.",
    "A cursory course to writing the personal essay coupled with reading fantastic essays.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to you if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident in your writing ability and want to write clearer, livelier prose. This class emphasizes adapting the techniques used by professional writers of creative nonfiction to five essays of your own: personal narrative, opinion, place, profile, and cultural criticism. All the assigned readings are engaging and cover a variety of topics that keep the course fun and surprising throughout the semester. Despite this course\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on creative nonfiction, I noticed an enormous improvement in my writing for all my classes that required essay writing. Even though the workload of this course can be intense, if you put in the time and you work with your instructor, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be one of your most rewarding experiences as a Yale undergraduate."
