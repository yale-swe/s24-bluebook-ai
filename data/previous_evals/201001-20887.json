    "Overview of 20th century's most important European social science and philosophical liture. Highly recommended if you want to get a good overview.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any theorist, or anyone who wants to get a grasp on continental philosophy.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Even if you don't understand everything--it is a very high level--still just take this course. Of course if you are in polisci or phil you are stupid not to take it.",
    "This course will give you an overview of the great themes of 20th century Europe. It will introduce you to problems of great relevance to today. If you care about ideas, take it.",
    "Yes. It can be a bit exhausting. The class time and the readings are long.",
    "go to these lectures, all of them",
    "Great in-depth introduction to political theory. Will really provide you with the historical context, and open you to probably previously unknown subject-matter."
