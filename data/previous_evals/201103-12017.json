   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to learn a lot in a laid back course (that's not to say there wasn't work - two 5-8 page papers plus final 15-20 seminar paper). It's great with Irwin. Potential drawback is that you don't come out of the seminar with a solid grasp of what actually happened in the 19th century - just piecemeal views of different empires with no uniform story, but that's the nature of the time period, not the course.",
    "It's a fine history seminar. The discussions are a little rambling (think a fairly large tangent on the EU) but interesting.",
    "Most of the readings are quite interesting, some are actually fun to read. Prof. Irwin is very casual in seminar, kind of a Harkness\/socratic vibe to class. An interesting way to look at imperialism and the questions surrounding it, though probably better if you have some previous background.",
    "i would definitely recomend this to anyone who is remotely interested in the 19th century or empire and wars.",
    "The course is an interesting approach to studying empire in the 19th century. In some ways, its like playing Risk. We spent a lot of time debating things like whether we'd rather have a sea empire or a land empire. The organization was very lax, which meant we had very free-ranging discussions. However, as a new course, the syllabus wasn't very well-organized, and we spent much less time discussing the specifics of the small wars than I had expected.",
    "Small Wars was a lot of fun, mostly because of my bright classmates and the relaxed cadence that Irwin set for the class. However, discussion moved into almost exclusively big picture\/is-today-like-it-was-then\/international order territory halfway into the semester, something that got vague and unsubstantiated way too fast, whereas the first half of the semester, when readings were much more crucial to the conversation and we were able to flesh out the nitty gritty before moving to extrapolate much larger designs, was much more enjoyable. Takeaway: have fun hanging out with Irwin, he is awesome, and love your classmates, but also don't be surprised if the class goes from way cool to too loose by the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Small Wars of Empire, is a great history seminar, covering various minor wars fought by Britain, Russia, and the United States, during the second half of the 19th century. Professor Irwin does a excellent job directing discussion towards the big questions of \"empire\" and towards the parallels between current wars in Afghanistan and the Caucasus and wars in the same regions during the \"Age of Empire.\" The syllabus includes a good mix of primary texts, films, and novels. I would highly recommend the seminar, as it covers a fascinating and under-studied period that has major relevance to the modern world."
