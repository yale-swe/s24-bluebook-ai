   "comments": [
    "Horrible and draining, take it if you absolutely need to. Otherwise, would never recommend you put yourself through it.",
    "Be weary, because it's a flipped classroom!",
    "I find that the course is challenging, but if you have an instructor that is very helpful, can be a great experience. I would also encourage you to seek help from others if you're struggling. The flipped classroom is not the best for everyone, but you will succeed as long as you reach out to the resources available.",
    "MATH 115 gives a very vas but strong foundation for Integral Calculus. It makes clear the connections between Integration, Series, and Differential Equations so one does not just learn the concepts but has a strong understanding of the conceptual foundations of the math itself. I would recommend the class to another student since it was not just learning equations in the class but gave a connected understanding of the material.",
    "I would recommend math 115. It's a great course that covers a lot of material.",
    "I would recommend it to another student with lame previous experience with the course material. However, I found that students with less familiarity struggle with the flipped classroom.",
    "MATH 115 was flipped in spring 2016. We watched 10-20 minute videos and did sample problems before every class, and had a pset every week. The course moves relatively rapidly. Be prepared to reach out for help or do your own research if you do not understand the material, but teachers and peer tutors are very open. The textbook reading helps, especially if something is confusing on problem sets. Peer tutoring is a great resource - use it! If you do not understand how to solve something on a pset at any point (before or after grading), ask. The homework material has a high correspondence to exam questions. John Hall is an excellent teacher with very clear explanations. He would lead us through problems every class. He did not ask his students to do group work past a few times initially - his is a great style for those who like to be lead through a few problems and then are able to use those concepts on homework.",
    "Math 115 taught the basic concepts of calculus. I really liked the flipped classroom style of instruction, and I think that it helped me develop a much more thorough understanding of the concepts of mathematics. This was, without a doubt, the best math class I've ever taken. I used to think I was terrible at math, but now I know that with a good teacher and a good class, I actually can understand math. This class took a lot of work, but it was worth it in the end when I finally felt like I understood math for the first time."
