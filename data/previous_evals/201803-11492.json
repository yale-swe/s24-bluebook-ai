    "i learned so much about human memory and how it works",
    "An understanding of the different memory systems in the brain and the theories behind their function. How and why we remember\/forget things, amnesia, false memories, eyewitness testimony, the effects of technology on memory, and so much more. This class is really comprehensive and Prof CS is really open to suggestions for topics to cover (especially at the end of the course), so if there's anything about memory you want to cover, you probably will."

    "The lectures were super interesting and the weekly assignments were fun and helped us to apply what we learned in class to real-world examples.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are well-structured and organized; Prof CS has an infectiously motivating teaching style; the emphasis on *thinking* about information and really *understanding* it rather than memorizing terms from the textbook; the student engagement and Prof CS's willingness to entertain questions about anything she says. Weaknesses: I'm not sure how well the current class format would work for a larger class size. This will depend on the individual students enrolled, but I feel as if we skimped on a few topics this semester thanks to student questions which led us on tangents from lecture material. I fear that with more students (and thus more questions), the class may struggle to make progress in the material. This effect could entirely backfire if students become more inhibited by a larger group, which would also be sad, as I viewed student engagement as the highlight of this course."

    "Yes! Professor Cordova Sanchez is great and the material is super interesting!",
    "yes!",
    "Absolutely. This was the first year of the course and I can only see it improving with time. Prof CS is fantastic and is passionate not only about the subject but also the learning of her students. She feels much more like a super-knowledgeable fellow classmate than a professor, in a good way. She manages to distill really complex neuroscience topics into a format that is approachable for a non-major with a basic scientific background and provides supplementary material from the literature for students who are well-versed (or ambitious) enough to approach it. The course is well-organized and I learned a ton, especially about how different systems of memory interact with each other. If you're curious about how memory works and how it impacts peoples' lives, I would highly recommend this course, regardless of your background."
