    "This course was one of my favorite courses of the year! It forces oneto think with greater depth and complexitiy about current conservation and natural resource management issues, on a global scale. While theoretical in approach, all topics are relevant and applicable.",
    "There are few courses at F&ES that address wildlife conservation. This class, when run well, really helps fill that gap. Class discussions and student-led classes really provided several perspectives on each issue. The instructor did a great job of making sure discussions, and debates, were constructive and not just long diatribes critiquing the subject. I especially enjoyed student-led role plays and challenges within an issue. The conceptual modeling optional class was also very helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "The quality of discussion was one of the best aspects of this course. From the very beginning, students had no trouble jumping into issues and discussing them immediately. It never felt like there was a lull in discussion or no one had anything to say. It was an environment where people could disagree with each other and people weren't afraid to question assumptions. Amy and Bill did a good job of jumping in at the best moments to keep discussion focused and to force us to think about issues that weren't coming up while still letting the discussion flow naturally. The readings were also great, as were the guest speakers.",
    "Amy Vedder is a great teacher and really great at encouraging conversation and discussion.",
    "Professor Vedder is more than a teacher she is a mentor. She offers a practical prospective that only comes with years in the field. Her experience and insight is extremely unique at FES. It was also extremely helpful to have professor Weber in the class as well, adding an additional prospective.",
    "Establishing a relationship with the instuctor.",
    "Amy and Bill!They are so great.Beyond that, the format worked well for the material and goals, the instructors were engaging and engaged, the students were invested, the student led classes were a great component, as were the lightening round questions at the end of the semester. There were the right number of guest presenters, and they were well-dispersed throughout the year.",
    "The breadth of topics covered throughout the class and applied problem solving for each issue. Guest speakers were also very engaging and added outside perspectives on these topics.",
    "The discussion among students were of very high quality and I liked the participatory nature of the course. The topics of discussion were very pertinent to environmental conservation, and the order of topics was very well planned.",
    "The discussions were great as were the guest lecturers.",
    "See my response to question 15.",
    "Having the visiting professionals come speak to us, and visiting with them over dinner, was extremely valuable. There isn't a lot of other opportunity to have some close contact with conservation professionals, so I really appreciated that about this class. Hearing so much about Amy and Bill's professional experience was great and really inspiring. I also found all of the readings really helpful."

   "comments": [
    "My only issue was some of the readings during the student led sessions. Some sessions were very light on reading and others were far to heavy so I feel like I couldn't get through much. If there was some sort of flexible guideline about the quantity of reading to be assigned during student led sections, that could be good.",
    "The dependence on student presentations could sometimes lead to some duds, but Amy was great at directing discussion in such a way that really kept it going.",
    "I really liked the student led discussions but I would have liked to have more lectures from professor Vedder.",
    "I think that some of the speakers could have tailored their presentations more towards the goals of the class, though most were right on point. Some of our conversations at the beginning of the semester were a bit surface. Amy and Bill did ask some good follow up questions to get people to reflect on their positions and delve a little deeper. I think that could have been done a little bit more in the first third of the course.",
    "I think this class needs to be always taught under the light of constructive criticism and the instructor should continue oversight during discussion to make sure no single student gets the limelight or is allowed a lengthy, deconstructive diatribe. Critique is helpful, but students on soap boxes is an issue in several F&ES classes and I think the fast-paced nature of discussion in this class helped minimize that.",
    "Even though I liked how participatory and interactive the course was, I would have also prefer to have some more formal lectures from the professors.",
    "The course needs a major overhaul, as it is not a 'seminar'. FIRST, it needs to be taught by the Professor\/s and not co-taught by the students. SECOND, the professor needs to lecture in class and provide her lecture in power-point slides, instead of just facilitating wish-washy discussion among students. Discussion can't be productive unless the Professor levels the playing field previously. The professor needs to lecture on basic concepts of conservation ecology, then move on to conservation challenges across different ecosystems. Students need guidance to master those building blocks. THIRD, The professor needs to integrate analysis of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.FOURTH, assigned readings should be applied and not theoretical. Reading should also include gray literature addressing key conservation challenges, successes and failures of conservation NGOs, new ideas and projects being pursued by NGOs. Instead, a lot of the readings were pointless and had not direct bearing on real life conservation.It seems to me that the overall goal of the instructor should be to produce 'conservation professionals' who can hit the ground running with a conservation NGO after they take this course. And this goal should also be shared by the students.The instructors are nice and bright people, but conservation is not just about protecting elephants, gorillas, and lions in Africa. At any rate, conservation case-studies should be left for the final part of the course, say the last 3 weeks. Cut down on the number of guest speakers and pack them into the last three weeks as well.If the course format doesn't change (get rid of the wish-washy, feel good discussions) then I would not recommend that you take this course no matter how attractive it may seem and how nice the instructors really are.That said, they truly care about their students, which is a rare thing among most FES faculty !! So take this course but demand that they lecture a lot more and that they provide you with lecture power-point slides that you can fall back on as reference. Also, do demand integration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in all lectures ! Hope my advice is helpful to you."

I left with almost no questions resolved, but in the best possible way.

I also found the social science aspects in particular far more interesting and engaging than I expected!",
