    "What a phenomenal class. This class, over the past several years at Yale has grown to become a legendary, highly demanded class to get into. And after taking it this year, I am not at ALL surprised. The amount of effort Prof. Wolenski puts into the class and his students is simply unrivaled. Detailed experiments; thoughtful, intelligent TAs; amazing guest speakers; and most importantly, having an almost application process for entrance into the class makes it so that all of the kids in the class are clearly qualified as well. You get on a biweekly basis, an enthralling 5 hrs\/day (yes, 5 - but believe, time flies when you're actually having a blast in lab) lab session with the infinitely optimistic and charismatic Dr. Wolenski.If not for the material of the class alone, take this class to get Wolenski and meet him on a personal level. Truly one of the greatest personalities on Yale's campus. Don't miss out and get on the waitlist for this class early.",
    "Cell Bio Lab is a wonderful class. In fact, it has been my favorite class of all time. It allows students to experience a lab setting in a non-competitive environment which makes the class incredibly fun and also very informative because the focus is on understanding the material and not getting out of lab early.Take this class if at all possible, but make sure you contact Professor Wolenski as early as possible, because the wait-list has been known to fill up more than a year in advance (clearly because the class is so fantastic!).",
    "Awesome awesome awesome. You learn so much about not just biological research but also about how the scientific community\/research works! One of the best classes taken at Yale.",
    "You should take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, but only if they are a science major. A general understanding of many scientific concepts is useful to understanding the experiments. More importantly, this is a great class for anyone who wishes to learn more about experimental procedures and how to use different lab tools. This class is much more personalized than any lab I have ever taken. I would highly recommend anyone who is genuinely interested in science to take this class.",
    "This is a great full-credit biology lab. I learned so much, in a relaxed and supportive and above all fun environment, and I enjoyed every minute of it.",
    "If you can get into this course, take it! (Make sure to e-mail the professor really early!) It's a great bio lab...two days per week can take up a lot of time, but not having lab reports and getting a whole credit for the semester if you take 345 (which everyone in the class did) definitely makes up for that. To be honest, at first I was a bit frustrated, because if you've worked in a lab before, you probably know many of the techniques you'll use at the beginning of the course. However, I found that by the end, everyone accumulates a wealth of tips that can be applied to any lab.",
    "This is a basic lab where you learn Cell Bio techniques through doing actual experimental work as designed by the TA and Professor Wolenski. Coordinated experiments with a research purpose make the class far more enjoyable than normal labs. This is, in my opinion, the best lab at Yale. You actually learn a lot without having the unnecessary busy work of weekly lab reports or anything of the sort. You will spend lots of hours in lab, but I genuinely enjoyed my time (and I'm not a big lab rat)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my fellow student! One of the best lab courses I have ever taken!",
    "Overall, this was a fantastic course. It was by far myfavorite lab that I have taken at Yale. Unlike many Yale course, in this class, I felt that I was this class was free of busy work, irrelevant assignments, and stress, which made me feel completely free to focus on learning. I went into lab everyday and felt like I was just playing around with science, but came out with a much better idea of basic lab techniques and how to approach and think about scientific questions.Strengths of the class: no lab reports, exciting lab atmosphere, cool experiments, oral presentations, good rapport between students in the class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It gives you a feel for what real bench research is in a way that other lab classes at Yale cannot. Dr. Wolenski is a great instructor for the course who really cares about the students and devotes a lot of time to make sure that experiments work or that there are results to discuss. The TAs are also awesome. The days can be a little long, but that's how research works - experiments don't always fit a set timeline.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. So fun, learned SO much about biological techniques that are actually relevant to real research in a lab. Awesome way to fulfill a lab requirement!"
