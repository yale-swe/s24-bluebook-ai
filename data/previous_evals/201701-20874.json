    "This class couldnt be a bigger disappointment. In the first class, I was really excited since Frankel made a very good impression as a lecturer. However, throughout the semester he turned out to be the most irresponsible teacher Ive ever had. He cancelled nine classes, which is roughly 30% of all the class time. One time, he didnt send us any email about the cancellation of the class, so we came to the class and waited half an hour in vain (it was a 9 am class, too). Even when he did show up to classes, he was usually 10-15 minutes late. Thats not the end, though. We were supposed to be graded based on problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Right before spring break, he decided to send us a take-home midterm over the break instead of giving an in-class exam, but he never sent us the exam - after the break, he casually told us that there wouldnt be any midterm or final and we would be graded solely based on problem sets. When it comes to problem sets, he usually assigned them much later than he promised - even a week and a half later. And the last one was assigned in February. It was by far one of the worst experience I have had at Yale, and it destroyed the flavor of differential geometry for me.",
    "I learned a little about how to choose charts on manifolds, measure curvature, and work with abstract metrics."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Prof Frankel attempts to give a good qualitative understanding rather than getting lost in the notation (which is very possible with Diff Geo). Weaknesses: Prof Frankel himself (see below). I also think that this class has a lot of overlap with MATH 230\/231, but that most people exiting that class are not ready for the graduate Differential Geometry. This creates a sort of difficult gap where students are either bored or drowning."

   "comments": [
    "Don't really know what to say about this course. Professor Frankel missed so many lectures that we didn't get into the meat of the material. He's a great lecturer when he shows up though. My only critique would be that he needs to prepare more. The little bit of material we covered was interesting though, and has inspired me to do some reading on my own.",
    "No. I think that more Differential Geometry is taught in the physics department and I should have just taken General Relativity there.",
    "The class is too computational.",
    "Really interesting material. This semester seemed to be a bit rough on Frankel though, and we didn't get to see much of it. Under different circumstances, I could see this being a great class, but as it was I wouldn't recommend taking it."
