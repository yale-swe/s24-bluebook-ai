   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You get to see amazing cellular structures and really understand how certain organs work on the cellular level. A lot of work, but definitely worth it.",
    "I LOVE this lab - it is so cool to be able to go from start to finish - starting with tissue, fixing and dehydrating it, preparing it, and imaging it. I loved the fact that I saw things so up close: Nuclear Pores and Mitochondria! A very satisfying course and not too much work. 3 hours of class and 2 hours on your own a week.",
    "One of the best bio labs. Lots of work though",
    "Most lab courses are very structured and class-like, but some labs like EM lab are more similar to real research. I thought the lab was very cool as I was able to produce almost textbook-quality images of cells and organelles. I am also much better at interpreting the structures in both electron and light micrographs. Students are encouraged to come in outside of lab time to take more images, but I came in for at most 2 hours every week (also consider that there are no weekly quizzes or lab reports, except for one introductory paper). Because there is a lot of independence in scheduling work, time management is important. If you put off the final paper until reading week, it may still be do-able, but those couple of days before the due date will be quite painful.",
    "This lab is a fantastic class that I am so happy to have taken. It is probably one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I came out of it feeling like I learned so much and enjoyed myself along the way. I recommend it to any biology major interested in the body.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Especially if you need an extra bio lab. Don't be intimidated by the extra hours you have to spend in the lab. There are no lab reports. Just a paper at the beginning of the class and a long paper and presentation at the end. Think of it this way: the amount of extra time a week you spend in the lab is less than the amount of time you would be spending writing lab reports in a normal lab. The only exception to this is the final paper. That literally can take up your whole reading period. Thiscan be avoided if you plan ahead, though. a",
    "A great introduction to microscopy instruments and techniques that (if you are pre-med or into research) you will very likely need to use again.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with a caveat: it requires a considerable amount of work to do well in, and the instructor does not mess around.",
    "LOTS OF WORK! Very hands on with tough procedures and tough analysis. Expectations are to be in the lab for multiple hours outside of the already schedule lab times. If you take it, which I don't necessarily recommend, try to do your work steadily all along and keep asking for help, you will eventually get it."
