    "Take it if you have some interest in primates. Don't use it just for Sc, you'll regret it.",
    "Yes, especially if you're interested in primatology. You definitely don't need to have a background in genetics to handle the course.",
    "if you like genetics.",
    "I would recommend this class if you like science if you like primates and if you like biology.",
    "Yes, the material is interesting and the professor is engaging. If you want to get a great introduction to primates, this is perfect. The science is pretty simple but there is enough of it so that you really understand the methods behind the studies you read about. Reading and work in general are light, but you learn a lot. Overall a great class.",
    "It is a great class. Everyone likes monkeys! I would definitely recommend it, it is very interesting, straight forward, and you also learn some science as well.",
    "take it."
