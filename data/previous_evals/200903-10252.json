    "Anthropology 503 is an anthropology writing and professional development course. The syllabus includes numerous writing exercises including experimental writing, self-reflexivity exercises, and other useful assignments. Reading and writing assignments are due three times a week. The initial version is due on Monday, the reading is prepared for Wednesday, and revisions are due on Friday. I would recommend it to another student because it provides the student with the opportunity to experiment with different writing styles and to evaluate various approaches to the discipline in general.",
    "perhaps not yet a bread and butter course, but very valuable for second years or maybe even third years who are starting to mold their projects."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very useful in deepen my knowledge of anthropology, both as a discipline and a profession. The course contributed to my dissertation research in several ways. First, it helped me to develop my voice and my positionality in the field. Second, we spent several classes developing our the framework for our research proposals. Third, the writing exercising pushed me to evaluate my project from several perspectives that I may have otherwise missed.",
    "displayed some of the difficulties involved in finding an ethnographic voice and in rendering one's research in prose."
