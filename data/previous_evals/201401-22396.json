    "Great reading list and a good professor. Shop the people as well, though--our seminar was a little sleepy.",
    "I would recommend it for any student with an interest in learning about decolonization across several African countries. I would not recommend it as a class for someone looking to explore whether they are interested in the subject matter.",
    "Excellent survey of recent African history!",
    "I would summarise the class as an effective and wide-ranging look at a variety of African countries through the lens of decolonisation.",
    "The class offers a tour of some of the political, social, and economic forces at play during the decolonization and independence periods for a variety of African countries. I would enthusiastically recommend this class to anyone interested in Africa or 20th century history.",
    "I recommended it to many students."

   "comments": [
    "This class gave me general knowledge of several different colonial movements in Africa, though it did not delve too deep into any particular one. It also introduced me to the historical method of writing, since we had to critique the historical accounts provided in the readings.",
    "Being interested in postcolonial theory more broadly, the class developed my knowledge of African literature provided by my MA and undergraduate work, and was invaluable in illustrating different methodologies in contrast to literary scholarship (history and political science approaches).",
    "It gave me a whole new focus for my work."
