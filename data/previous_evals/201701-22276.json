   "comments": [
    "really great course but could benefit by having less theory at the beginning and more time to use the programs and get the practical skills required to solve structures- maybe a 70\/30 practical\/theory split instead of 50\/50",
    "Overall, this course was amazing. At times however, I feel like we rushed through some of the hard parts of the theory. I eventually learned those parts but I was frustrated at the time. I do think that Brandon did an amazing job and did the best he could. Overall, I really enjoyed the course!"
