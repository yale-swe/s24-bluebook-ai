   "comments": [
    "An excellent course to take Cr\/D\/F. Five modules, each taught by a different professor, which provided a nice change of perspective and allowed the course material to be taught by an expert in each field. Five non-cumulative exams, with the top four scores comprising your course grade. An especially great course to take after Physiological Systems, as Biological Reaction to Injury focuses primarily on what can go wrong with the human body (and how the body responds). A great choice for an aspiring doctor, or anyone interested in an in-depth exploration of how the human body responds to various injuries (cancer, GI tract, etc.).",
    "yes. Great way to get into what you will learn in medical school; however, if you have taken higher level courses than this one, then you might find this a little boring...",
    "MCDB 315 was a very informative class. I felt like I learned a great deal about a variety of important organ systems. For any student planning to take the MCAT and\/or go on to medical school, this is a helpful course, much like physio. There are five lecturers, and five exams throughout the semester (no final). The exams were fairly rigorous, but the material was all worth learning.",
    "A really good class, well organized - the material is very interesting and medicine oriented. I thought all the professors were effective lecturers - the notes\/slides provided really helped thorough and the TAs were always accessible and helpful. I would definitely recommend this class as a second semester senior, and I would also say that it's a good class to take credit D since you won't get too lazy because the frequency of exams keeps you on your toes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in medicine or physiology. The lectures were great and the 5 midterms were very fair and non cumulative. You get to even drop a test. My TA, Ryann, was very helping in going over the course material.",
    "It's a great class for future medical professionals, but that doesn't have to be why you take it (I'm definitely not one)\u2013take it if you have any interest at all in how the human body works. I found a lot of the information relevant, and now whenever I feel sick I always think about the material I learned.",
    "Pretty interesting intro to human pathology. I recommend taking after physio.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class, especially for someone preparing for the MCAT. It really gives you an in depth and comprehensive understanding of a lot of topics in human biology. The class, with 5 exams, requires continuous studying and you really need to go to every class and section, but in the end I really appreciated not having a cumulative final exam. I really learned a lot in this class. My recommendation would be to find other people to study with -- I found talking through complicated processes with some friends in the class particularly helpful.",
    "Great class! Very interesting and clinically relevant information; good to take after physio. The 5 tests can get to be a little much sometimes when you're dealing with other midterms, but they're spaced out well enough that with proper planning you can do just fine. The tests are fair, and there were no real big variations in difficulty"
