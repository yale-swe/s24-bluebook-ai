    "My independent study with Professor Mirakhor was deeply enriching. I learned how to put a range of texts--fiction, theory, critical reviews, documentaries, etc.--in conversation with one another in order to produce new insights. Professor Mirakhor encouraged me to drive a lot of our discussions, which enabled me to practice valuable organizational and critical thinking skills. Not only do I feel more capable of speaking with greater clarity and intentionality, but my writing feels more precise than ever.",

   "comments": [
    "This course really has no weaknesses. Its strength lies in its multifaceted syllabus, including documentaries, interviews, literary reviews, short stories, theory, as well as novels. This course is a testament to the ways in which critical engagement is a practice that extends beyond the work and research commonly associated with academia. In other words, theory and traditional scholarship are not the only pieces that are worth critical engagement. I felt as though there was a lot at stake in the work we pursued in the course, it was meaningful in a way that many other courses I have taken have not been."
