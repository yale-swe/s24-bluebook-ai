    "I deepened my understanding of the role of sound in art and performance.",
    "Sound Art was my first art class at Yale. Briane Kane and Martin Kersels challenged me to approach my \"sound art,\" which I prefer to think of simply as art engaging the medium of sound, with full intentionality. As a philosophy major, I had been out of the habit of creating music\/artworks, so their feedback in the class sessions dedicated to critique of student work were immensely helpful. I approached the class as someone engaged in contemporary music culturemaking beats, playing jazz piano, listening to new musicwho wanted to explore the boundary between music and sound, and to use sound as an artistic medium divorced from the cultural baggage of Western classical music and contemporary pop. The class absolutely delivered on both of those. Especially due to the presence of MFA students in the class, I grew as an artist and enjoyed viewing, listening, and responding to the artwork of my classmates.",
    "I gained an appreciation for viewing (or rather listening to) the world with a critical lens. I learned some strategies for thinking about sound, and for using sound to create art.",
    "I learned about the history of sound art, sound art theory, and critical approaches to studio art in a sound art context"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is very helpful in the sense that it provided sufficient time for students to discuss each other's works and learn from both teachers and peers.",
    "The strength of the course is the combination of expertise Brian Kane and Martin Kersels offer. Kane is many things, but for this course he contributes deep insight into musicology, sound studies, and historical and contemporary works of sound art. Kersels is an art educator, and more specifically teaches sculpture at the School of Art. His critiques of my works were revelatory for meI learned from him how to communicate something other than my own subjectivity. The weakness is the class sessions dedicated to the discussion of the readings. These discussions fell flat and did not utilize the four-hour time slot for the class. We often stopped after two hours of conversation which were really a back and forth between five of the twenty-or-so class members and the professors. This could be addressed by eliminating the Brandon LaBelle readings on sound art and instead assigning readings about specific artworks, ideally with the added component of being able to listen to\/see\/engage those artworks.",
    "The course was great in that it was very open and left it to the student to engage as much as they wanted. This is probably typical of art courses, but this course especially allowed me to rely on creativity in the pursuit of craft rather than classical training. Feedback from the professors was key, and they are extremely insightful and intelligent.",
    "The most salient issue was the large number of students which prevented the workshop and crit classes to really delve into any one person's project without simply exhausting the rest of the class. In addition there was no real standard of quality for students' work which can be pretty distracting for an art class when there is 20 minutes of discussion devoted to what was clearly a half-hearted project."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class to all art majors and those interested in music and performance. It offers a new perspective on art-making.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in creating artworks that respond to questions about music, sound, perception, space, and institutional expectations. There is something inherently philosophical and countercultural about art using sound as a medium. It does not fit easily in the white-wall gallery context, easily leaking from one room to another. It requires different sensibilities than the visual arts to engage critically. Take this class if that challenge excites you. The professors will respond to your efforts productively.",
    "This course is dope if you are going to take it seriously! It's definitely not for people who want a gut or who won't engage with it. I'm no art major, but I am very passionate about sound and definitely consider myself an artist at heart. This course gave me the freedom to explore that creativity and get weird. Profs Kersels and Kane are geniuses, have a lot of great thoughts about your work and how to improve it. The reading is dense and long, but you don't have to read it that carefully to engage in the few purely discussion-oriented classes."
