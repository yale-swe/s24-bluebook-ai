    "If you take the course, you should take the lab.",
    "History of Life lab was an awesome experience - if you don't take it, you're really missing out on not only touching fossils of what we study in lecture, but also the opportunity to take advantage of the resources of the Peabody, the third largest collection in the country. The lab trains you to think from an evolutionary standpoint, and to make inferences from basic observations ( like, if this trilobite had legs, it probably used them to walk!) After covering the major clades you discuss in lecture, we also had a field trip to Mystic Aquarium, where we could see evolution in action! Lab reports for this are not stressful at all (just writing up a synthesis from your observations) most of your work for this half credit takes place in the 2.5 hour lab. Do it!",
    "The lab for History of LIfe is an excellent supplement to the lecture course and I would recommend students take it with the lecture course.",
    "If you take History of Life, take the lab with it. It gives you the chance to play with all sorts of fossils and meet Professors Briggs and Hickey. It is not a ton of work and is a lot of fun, and will help you understand the lecture more than anything else. The lab is geared towards complementing the lecture and does so perfectly. This class might be my favorite so far at Yale."
