    "Yes I would. It's very interesting, fairly relaxed except for the big assignment at the end. The Professor is great.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the Spanish Civil War.",
    "I would highly recommend it! For someone looking to practice their Spanish, looking to read great spanish civil war literature,or wanting to study a war not very well covered in international media and history books, this class is perfect. As a student, you can really document how much you've learned throughout the semester at the end. Professor Valis is incredible! I couldn't have asked for a nicer, more passionate, more engaging instructor. Take the class if you have room in your schedule!",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student because it is something that can be applied to literature and films from other wars, especially given how important media has become in the modern world; it's impact and how history is represented cannot be overlooked in modern literature."

    "Good class - a bit slow at times, but interesting readings and fun overall.",
    "Interesting perspectives about problems of represention",
    "For my main interest in contemporary latin american literature, the courseon representing the spanish civil war was extremely helpful because it gave me a lot of insight about how to interpret and analyze representations of historical events. given the complex histories of latin america, and the many conflicts (both external and internal) the tools I have acquired in this course will serve me in future analyses of these events and their corresponding literature."
