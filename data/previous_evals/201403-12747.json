    "The first half of this class is a study of transformational geometry-it is about isometries of the plane, conjugation, similarities, and a very comprehensive look at the classical coincidences (probably most interesting part of the class.) The second half of the class is basically a geometric study of linear algebra that discusses the non-Euclidean geometries and relativity. It is a broad, very rigorous geometry class that will most likely be difficult for you if you are not a math major. Professor Howe is an expert and always available if you need help, and is one of Yale's most devoted professors, even though he can sometimes be a little aloof. If you want a different, off the beaten track math class, take this course.",
    "Good course! Probably more work than you expect. But Prof. Howe is very good, (and you can tell he really cares about this stuff. Theres always that sparkle in his eye when he gets going on some topic he cares about).",
    "I would recommend MATH 228 to a fellow student who wants a peculiar view to geometry. The course covers many interesting points of Euclidean geometry. Its most important strength is the different approach to most geometric operations and concepts using plane transformations (isometries and similarities.) Professor Howe is also a brilliant professor. He is always willing to help with the demanding problem sets. He actually concerned about how much his students are learning. I would say the weakness of the class is in its timing. Affine transformations, and spherical, hyperbolic and space-time geometries were entirely covered in a short time span near the end of the semester. The ideas behind these geometries are definitely more difficult to grasp than those of isometries, similarities and conjugations, and I mostly found myself drowning in foreign water. The fact that every other course demands your attention in the finals weeks also makes it difficult for you read the chapters Professor Howe provides. Additionally, you must be prepared to do about a chapter of reading from the very first week. However, the book, written by Professor Howe himself, is well written and easy to follow. Heads up: the term paper can be a drag.",
    "The first half of this class is a new take on the geometry that you've studied before. The second half gets a bit more complicated as you cover different geometries and ultimately special relativity. Most of the assignments are actually pretty fun to do, but a few can get tricky (luckily, Howe offered weekly problem review sessions). Overall, this was one of the better math courses I've taken. For those interested, you do not need any prerequisites, although knowledge of matrices helps for one chapter\/problem set.",
    "Yes ! Take it if you are interestered in symmetry and if you want to understand the math of special relativity!"
