    "It's a class where you read Ulysses, Tristram Shandy, GEB, Moby Dick, Borges, and others, and it all makes sense. If that's not a reason to take it I don't know what is.Oh right: Prof. Sussman.",
    "Books, Displays, and Systems Theory was a pretty free-form collaboration between Sussman and the students. We were able to direct the course toward our interests, and honestly, if you're at all interested in books as a form, visual displays, computer science, and feedback loops in general, you will love this course. If you prepare yourself to work through some tough readings and immerse yourself in the material, this course will totally be worth it.",
    "I'd recommend this class to people who look at the syllabus and decide they definitely want to read the texts. I'd also recommend this class to people who want the chance to do very creative and open-ended final projects -- in our class, one person made a video, someone else did a photography project, and a few people did creative writing assignments.",
    "A crazy class about literary and textual theory. Basically going in and getting to witness Professor Sussman's eager and intelligent monologue a lot of the time, but there's so much in there that it rarely is not super engaging. Lots of reading and movie-watching and thinking but in the best way.",
    "I'd recommend it in a second.",
    "Excellent seminar. Sussman is brilliant. It's rare to find a class at Yale with such latitude for creativity and with an intensive, hodge-podge manner of integrating different disciplines. What exactly is the material? I had the hardest time explaining to people what \"Books, Displays,&Systems Theory\" aims to teach. In our semester, ideas like recursion, isomorphism, meta-narratives, open and closed systems, digital versus analog, etc. provided the anchor points for discussion. Each student drew from his\/her own knowledge of \"systems\" in various disciplines. In fact, our class included people from a variety of majors (cognitive science, biology, architecture, music, political science, etc.) Most importantly, everyone was humble, friendly, and seemed to be genuinely interested in learning from their peers. Maybe it was just the luck of our year, but I think the course attracts this kind of group to begin with. Take what you will from the class. Sussman's booming voice is a constant stream of wild, thought-provoking ideas, but it is not autocratic in the least. Each topic thrown onto the table will be turned around and around by everyone. Just try to keep up."
