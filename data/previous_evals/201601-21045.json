   "comments": [
    "It is too much work for the amount of credit you get. The lab report can take up to 11 hours of continuous work.",
    "You have to do it, so try to enjoy it. I would only recommend this class if it was a prerequisite because it is very time consuming and not very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course only if it is needed as a prerequisite for another course or for graduating as a part of your major \/ pre-med requirements.",
    "Only take if if you need to, as I am sure that there are more exciting lab courses at there. You will learn some useful skills, but will end up practicing those same skills over and again in long and tedious experiments. The quizzes also get harder than first semester.",
    "If you plan on majoring in anything that requires Gen Chem, you don't really have a choice in whether or not you want to take Gen Chem Lab. I personally would not recommed it if you can avoid it.",
    "A difficult class worth much more than its 0.5 credits. I would recommend it to another student who needs it for a prerequisite.",
    "A good class with good and patient instructors.",
    "If you want to put in a lot of work for 0.5 credit, take it! If you're taking this it's likely a requirement so you don't really have a choice.",
    "CHEM 136L is a lab course designed to familiarize you with common lab techniques used in a chemistry lab. I would recommend this to students who are looking to gain that basic knowledge.",
    "Slightly harder than Chem 134L which comes the semester before, but by that point you've figured out how to do the lab reports and do them ahead of time so you don't have to stay up ridiculously late the night before lab. Lab reports are mostly busy work. All the concepts are covered in the Gen Chem lecture class at the same time, so nearly no new material.",
    "Worst lab ever. Do not take if suicidal, because it will make you want to kill yourself. Dr. G is nicer than last semester, but his class is still hard, unfair and boring",
    "What you would expect: a lot of work for half a credit.",
    "CHEM 136L is a continuation of CHEM 134L, with the arbitrariness of the grading and the sheer quantity of things to do during each lab turned way up. You probably are taking this class because you have to, so you just have to take it. On lab reports with long writeups, you will typically have shorter lab times - there were definitely times when I got out of lab over an hour before lab officially ended, but then the lab writeups invariably took longer than usual, requiring more complex graphs and such. On more hectic labs, ones where you have to work right up to the wire, there would be shorter writeups in comparison. It's usually a tradeoff, but the workload is manageable and reasonable, especially if you are coming off 134L, because the formats of the writeups and the structure of the course are identical. What is not reasonable is the way that the lab reports are graded, where you can ask your TF why points were taken off for missing a single chemistry term, and he or she will just shrug their shoulders and tell you to talk to Dr. G. This was a particularly frustrating aspect of this course, and I hope that it changes.",
    "Only take this lab if absolutely necessary.",
    "Chem 136L is a very comprehensive and labor-intensive course that definitely builds a strong foundation in chemistry for its students. Being in this course concurrently with the Chemistry lecture has definitely helped me understand the material and learn how to apply it in a practical setting. It is strong in that it is well taught and the expectations for the labs are clear. It is badly taught in that the actual lab class, however, because the setting is often crowded and thus structured in a way that you cannot find or obtain the materials you need because you need to wait in line. The grading requirements for the lab reports were also very unclear, and points were often taken off without valid explanations given. It is a very hard class to get a good grade in, and takes a lot of time every week in comparison to other courses. In comparison to Chem 134L, it goes much more in depth and requires more time and effort for writing the lab reports than its predeceasing course.",
    "Lab was a good class. The quizzes were more challenging than in 134. The workload is manageable. Overall, you should definitely take this in addition to lecture.",
    "I'd recommend for people who need this for a prerequisite or like to do hands on stuff and like to not have an afternoon free.",
    "CHEM136L is kinda cool sometimes. Definitely not chill, but if you're into chemistry you'll probably enjoy it. A lot of the experiments are really fast paced and might make you feel like you don't have enough time to finish them, but you'll generally be okay. Eat lunch before lab. Really. Do it. Also, the grading is pretty strict and there's no curve, so make sure you study up before the quizzes, and make your lab notebook and reports as neat as possible or Dr. G will take off points. Good luck.",
    "Not an enjoyable course, I'll just come out and say that right off. It's likely just a necessary evil--some of the labs are painfully long, and full accuracy is essential to lab procedure and reports. I would definitely say that between the lab reports and the pre-lab preparation, this takes up more time than a half-credit course should. If you must take it, take it, but if you don't need to and have a handle on titrations, don't feel the need to subject yourself to this.",
    "CHEM 136L is a continuation of CHEM 134L. It allows you to practice most of the skills learned in CHEM 134L. It is hard for me to say whether I'd recommend the class or not because it is a necessary pre-requisite for most other science courses, which is the only reason I'm taking it.",
    "I think that first semester of chem lab was much more beneficial and helpful. Unless your major requires it, I don't think I would've taken this class.",
    "An overly laborious course. The problem is that the pre-lab lectures are really basic and a waste of time, but you get graded pretty harshly on assignments. So its really the worst of both worlds, where you first get treated like a 5-year-old who doesnt know any science, which wastes 45 minutes each time, but then your reports are expected to be really detailed, as if youre an advanced scientist. Never take this class unless you need it for pre-med requirements",
    "Obviously, only take this class if you are required to. This is a poor class, but you already took Chem 134L, so you know that. Labs are unnecessarily long and tedious. The lab reports are too long and are often graded harshly. I got very little out of this class, and put in more work than I should have for a half credit class. Have fun!",
    "General chemistry lab is long, stressful, and intensive, and that cannot be avoided. It is what it is, to be honest. Some of the experiments were very interesting!",
    "Difficult but well structured.",
    "Terrible. Would not recommend.",
    "Don't take this course unless you need to for pre-med or your major. It's tedious, frustrating, and Dr. G takes off arbitrary points for neatness and sig figs that will drive you nuts. The course is only .5 credits, but the work is equivalent to a full-credit course. If you must take this course, don't take it on Friday or Monday. Take it Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. This course sucks the life out of you and teaches you very little chemistry. I wish we designed our own experiments.",
    "Only take this lab if it is needed for a prereq, it is time consuming and boring, and the lab reports are long. But it is necessary for science majors and pre-meds.",
    "I would only recommend this course if one absolutely needs to take it in order to fulfill a certain requirement, such as pre-medical requirements. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend the course.",
    "Basic lab chemistry course, required for premedical requirements.",
    "NO. Unless you need it for pre-med.",
    "This class requires too much work for what you even learn. Do not ever take this class unless required. Most of the labs are mundane.",
    "Chem lab is necessary for science majors but time-consuming and not an exciting class. It's not hard if you're careful and prepare in advance, but it's often frustrating to get bad data in lab or simply to collect data that is too simplistic to be useful.",
    "As necessary as it is for many students, CHEM 136L has a few interesting labs. Be prepared for some monotony in the first few sessions of the lab!",
    "This is a good supplement to intro chemistry classes and helps with practical training in chemistry.",
    "Hours are long and grueling.",
    "A lot of work but worth it.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to, but don't worry if you do have to.",
    "This is a chill class. Make sure you stay on top of all the work and you'll be fine.",
    "It's difficult but not that bad in the end.",
    "Good, hard course. Be prepared to put in a lot more work than you do for many classes that give you a full credit.",
    "It's good, but the workload is harder than the first gen chem lab.",
    "They don't expect too much from you and TAs are generally helpful. Just a very long lab.",
    "A lot of work and sometimes a waste of time.",
    "Only take it if it's required of our major or to fulfill other requirements. A lot of the land get repetitive and aren't so exciting.",
    "Chem 163L is going to take more time than the .5 credit is worth. That being said, it is still a good way to appky what you learn in gen chem.",
    "Your experience depends on the T.A. in lab. Understand that the work load is a lot, and unfortunately the course is a half credit. The grading is pretty fair, though.",
    "Yeah, but be mindful of the workload.",
    "Chem 136L was a much better chemistry lab course than the one taught last semester 134L. The labs were much more interesting and the lab practical at the end of the year was more fair. Also the lab reports were logical and fairly easy to write if not put off until the last minute.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 136L to students who need it as a requirement. The class teaches you fundamental lab techniques that are useful in various lab settings.",
    "Useful and goes well with the Gen Chem course. Probably wouldn't have taken it if I wasn't doing Pre-med though - lab reports take a while and shouldn't be left until the last minute.",
    "This course was a continuation of Chem 134L and matches up well with the concepts from the lecture course. Almost every lab has a reports associated with it, which consume a decent amount of time.",
    "I like it more than the first semester lab class, still a pain. Taking lab on Friday is miserable, don't do it.",
    "Only take this course if you need the requirement.",
    "You take this because you have to. It's better than the first semester, but the pointless, tedious lab reports are still the same.",
    "Take this class only if you have to or really want to. It is way too much work for a half a credit course, I spent more time per week working on CHEM 136L per week than 3 of my other classes combined. The grading is harsh and the quizzes are pretty tedious. Otherwise, the experiments are sometimes fun and it is a much more enjoyable lab course than CHEM 134L because the experiments and concepts are more interesting.",
    "Very informative course",
    "Terrible - don't take it unless it's required for you. If it becomes a full credit course, it could be worth it - but to subject oneself to such long hours weekly both during the day and at night to complete the lab reports for only half a credit is insanity.",
    "A lot of work",
    "Chem 136L is harder than gen chem 1 lab.",
    "I would not really recommend this course. I took it for my pre-med requirements, and while it was a good supplement to my Gen Chem lecture, it wasn't a course I could say I enjoyed. The labs were long and tedious, but even with that said, the instructor and TA's are all incredible scholars.",
    "A necessity for pre-meds, and although it's objectively worse than first semester Chem 134L, you quickly get accustomed to Dr. G's standards. They're not kidding when they say labs are double the work for half the credit, but you can't really get around this if you're pre-med, anyways. Just be prepared for higher expectations.",
    "Again, it's a pre-med requirement so you have to. And it's not too bad, so just suck it up.",
    "The quizzes seemed pretty unnecessary and the lab reports were often long and tedious, but the labs themselves were interesting and often related to what we were learning in class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone taking Chem 165 or 167. It closely followed the material in CHEM 165, and I found that it even helped prepare me for assessments in that class. I also felt more confident in applying chemistry to manual skills in the lab.",
    "I would recommend this chemistry lab class to a fellow student because it is interesting and an enjoyable class, in general. The pre-lab quizzes and lab reports can be difficult at times, but I still think this class is awesome!",
    "CHEM 136L is what you expect the second semester of General Chemistry Lab to be. The lab reports and experience can be long and tedious. But you will walk away with a solid understanding of the applications of titrations, kinetics, and equilibrium.",
    "You'll take it because you have to, but find another science credit if you're taking it for any reason but it being a major requirement.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Sure, you learn lab techniques, but this lab just seems high-stress sometimes. It's a lot of work sometimes, busy work, which can be characteristic of lab work. Should be worth 1 full credit for sure.",
    "If you need to take it, its an alright class. You've probably been through chem134l already so its basically the same deal. Lab reports are very thorough and tedious, but understand that in the end they really do help you understand the material. Try your very best to do it before the night before its due because these labs can be the cause of many heartaches, sleepless nights, and broken dreams. Note that there is a fairly generous late policy if you do fall into this category. It's only 5 pts off per lab per day as long as you submit it by 9am the next day. (hard deadline) Very very handy for people who sign up for the Friday sections because it counts as just one \"late day\" as long as you hand it in before 9am monday. TWO WEEK LABS ARE A LOT OF WORK. So if those ever come up, pace yourself best tip to future chem labbers: READ AND WRITE OUT YOUR OWN PROCEDURE BEFOREHAND. The quizzes count for a lot more than you think and if you're striving for an A, the cutoff is very high and very strict. No curve. You legit need a 94.8 to get that A. If you have that 94.5, the quizzes are what boost you to an a. Also writing out the lab beforehand saves you so much time. The people who get A's in this class and the people who finish the labs first know this is the key to success Good luck, young freshman. Much pain and sorrow awaits",
    "Hard but worth it -- you will learn a lot. It does, however, often feel like way too much work for a half-credit course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone taking chemistry because it helps you see how the concepts taught in class apply to experiments. It is a lot of work for half a credit, especially the lab reports, and how well you score on the lab reports depends on the TA you have. The quizzes are pretty manageable and the pre-lab lectures are helpful, so pay attention to those. Be careful on the data sheets--Dr. G takes off points for detailed things.",
    "Standard general chemistry lab course with the standard layout and the standard amount of work. The material is very closely tied to what is being covered in the general chemistry lectures so it actually is very beneficial to one's understanding to take this course, engage with the material and do the labs. The TAs for this course are usually very good and really help you learn the material in addition to being fair graders. Like all labs it is a major time commitment--four hours of lab a week is nothing to scoff at and the lab reports take about 7 hours on average. This course should of course be worth more than a half a credit but you will probably do very well if you put in the work.",
    "Lab is long and often tedious but you get through it. Just move quickly through things, so ou can finish as soon as you can. Quizzes that are each class are harder than for the first ten chem lab.",
    "CHEM 136L is the second half of the general chemistry lab series, and it is very much its predecessor. However, I do think that this half was more challenging in all aspects from the lab procedures to the reports and from the quizzes to the final lab practical. Generally, I did not really enjoy it because it is long and tedious, but I took it because it fulfills the pre-med requirement. Do it if you need to fulfill the requirements or are truly interested in chemistry, but otherwise, it may not be worth the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Very difficult, needlessly and unnecessarily difficult class that teaches you little in the ways of lab skills. The class has lackluster teaching but if you're premed you have to take it so good luck.",
    "CHEM 136L was a great continuation of 134L. The structure of the class is exactly the same as 134L because it's also taught by Dr. G, and I really enjoyed my second semester with him. The course is organized very well and you know exactly what is expected of you.",
    "This class ties nicely with Chem 165 and is a pretty good science credit. Take it if you need to, or even if you want to.",
    "This class is a lot of work, and not a lot of credit. The work is not necessarily hard, it's just a lot of time and very tedious. Attention to detail is crucial. This lab is a prerequisite for many people and rather inescapable, so it's a necessary evil. Just know ahead of time that it's going to take a lot of your time, and choose lab for a day where you have a light work load the night before so you can get your lab done on time.",
    "It was tedious, but necessary for my major. Labs are long and so are lab reports. Reward is hard to see, but overall not too bad.",
    "I would recommend it to a student because this course teaches basic laboratory techniques which are necessary for any Science student.hkwevet, I do think this course should be assigned 1 credit instead of 0.5.",
    "It was tedious but I had to do it as a premed. Study for the weekly quizzes and you can get a good grade.",
    "Yes, it is a great lab course, and I learned so much more about chemistry by being in the lab. It definitely helped me be successful in Chemistry 165.",
    "This course is interesting, but some labs and lab reports are difficult and time consuming. If you prepare, you should do fine. I would recommend another student take this course.",
    "CHEM 136L is a fairly decent class; there is a lot of busywork, but as it progresses the class gets pretty interesting.",
    "Overall I think this was a good course; the experiments were generally interesting and helped me understand the topics that we were learning concurrently in Chem 165. Occasionally lab reports took longer than usual because the calculations were difficult to figure out, or the error seemed too high even though the data appeared to be fine. Generally the reports took a few hours to complete, but you're better off starting them early if you can, especially the few that end up taking longer (sometimes Dr. G tells you that a particular report will be challenging or long). The prelab quizzes were more difficult to me than those of 134L; questions sometimes centered on parts of the lecture or manual that seemed unimportant or otherwise tested memorization rather than knowledge or application, which was a bit frustrating.",
    "Not a fun class, but a requirement for some things and isn't the worst.",
    "I would summarize this lab as much more unnecessary and time-wasting work than the amount you benefit and learn from it and would not recommend it.",
    "Interesting class. Quizzes are a bit harder.",
    "If you have to take this class, you have to take this class. Attention to detail is important. Look at the practice quiz questions each week. Try to keep your spirits up. The experiments themselves are actually pretty cool, but there's a lot of peripheral stuff that kind of sucks.",
    "A basic general chemistry lab for people majoring in something requiring the class. Do not take this lab if you do not need it for your major.",
    "The work load consists of writing a lab report once a week. The labs are significantly more involved than those done in 134L and the lab reports take longer to write too. Overall though, I think I learned a lot.",
    "CHEM 136L is a time consuming lab course that I would not recommend unless it is required. The course is laborious, and if not required, I would recommend another lab or science course.",
    "This course was personally just me checking off a pre-req for medical school, and the entire course feels like just that, a requirement. It is hard to do well without committing great amounts of time to the course, however given it is just half a credit, it is hard to commit that time. Don't expect to have fun or enjoy the course, expect working hard and spending hours of working to just get by.",
    "This is one of the better lab courses because the labs aren't as bad, but the grading is too harsh.",
    "Chem 136L is a lab course that expands on the basics and teaches more advanced laboratory experiments and skills. At times, it is interesting and fun, although it can also be tedious and time-consuming. Some of the experiments are really cool, and connect to real life applications in many ways.",
    "This course is a course dedicated to teaching basic techniques of study of chemistry in a lab. Typically, we met in a lecture room where Dr. G would provide a pre lab lecture about the experiment we would be doing that week. After his lecture, there would be a 15 minute quiz. After this quiz, we would proceed to lab. In lab we had about 3 hours to follow the procedure and record findings in the lab notebook. Our recordings would then be used to do the lab report. This report is due the week after the lab is completed."
