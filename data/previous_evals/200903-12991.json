    "The sequence of analysis for the parks was great, the analysis and open discussions were great. The problem is in the course's agenda, are we supposed to learn about landscape or are we supposed to be developing representational techniques to represent very basic ideas about landscape?",
    "Overall, the sequence of projects covered in this class was not very clear. Perhaps one of the weaknesses of the class was the lack of crossover between the student projects and analyses. Nothing in the class seemed to really tie together, and as a result I do not feel that I gained too much from the class.Furthermore, I would have appreciated a look at projects outside of New York City (specifically non-urban projects).",
    "I think the attempt to have lectures, readings, weekly drawings, presentations, a drawing review, a paper, an additional set of drawings for the paper, was simply too broad and overreaching for a three credit course. The ambitious set of requirements was difficult to adequately complete given other course work. If in the future the goals are narrowed or at least explicitly prioritized, I expect the student work would improve.",
    "it was an interesting exploration of New York City. all the particular parks were valid case studies, although sometimes they were poorly paired.Overall, it seemed like there was an unrealistic expectation for the outcome of the class, with a website and publication. It is clear that the professor had never mapped out a realistic amount of work and the expectations were just not feasible. It was also unclear for most of the semester what was expected week to week, and often the demands were high. I think the class would make more sense without the website goal.",
    "I found the material presented to be logical and the assignments interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Every project we do in school and in our professional lives deals with the issue of landscape, and this is why I took this class. My expectation for the class, therefore, was to learn how to better address the issue of natural and built landscapes within my projects. Unfortunately, I do not think that this class met my expectations for this.",
    "I expected this to be not only a representational course (one in which students produce drawings, etc) but also a reading\/discussion course. Ultimately it ended up being entirely a course about representation. There was little to no discussion about the readings or lectures. Instead all the emphasis was on the production of drawings.",
    "The analytical diagrams and personal response were an interesting exploration for our case studies. It was also helpful having the paper at the end to tie all of our thoughts together in the end. In the course we had the chance to delve into good research on one specific case study.",
    "The course met all my expectations"

    "I loved this course and hope to see this one and others take on this format in years to come! So engaging and provocative! thank you Kate for a wonderful semester!",
    "All that being said, I must state that it is of great importance that there be a course in landscape architecture like this here at the school (a course that is active, not just a history course). There is no other venue at Yale for this valuable content. The faults I have identified with the course I know are simply the result of its newness; the course will no doubt improve over time.",

   "comments": [
    "I think that the discussions in this class could have been more valuable than they were. I am still somewhat perplexed as to why we never discussed any of the readings in the class. As a result of this lack of discussion, students stopped doing required readings, which further lessened the value of the class.While I appreciate the \"open\" format of the class, there needs to be more planning and preparation for each of the classes. I really enjoyed Kate's lectures and the guest visits, and I would have appreciated more of these.",
    "Kate John-Alder is well-qualified and giving of her time and criticism. As I explained earlier, the schizophrenia of the course--desiring to achieve many things, from reading, to drawing, to presenting, etc--I know will be focused as this course develops in the future.",
    "the lectures were interesting, although not heavily structured. for some reason, it was difficult to get any real discussions going in class. it was clear that the professor had an agenda for each case study or the course in general, but that agenda was never clearly articulated and left the students guessing as to the course they should be taking in their work.",
    "I found the instructor effective and inspiring",
    "Kate's expertise of the subject matter was evident through her lecture presentations and class discussions. She succeeded in exposing the students to a multitude of the landscape typologies through different modes of visual\/graphic representation. Perhaps my largest criticism of the course would be the overall organization or sequence in which the case studies are presented. New York City case study visits would also be more beneficial if they were taken individually, rather than as a class. The class trip could then focus on a larger site for fieldwork such as Central Park."

    "more frequent lectures by the instructor on the topics discussed in our analytical drawing reviews.",
    "More lectures and guest visits, as well as more discussionsbetween students regarding the readings. This would help spur more interesting analyses.",
    "A honing of intentions and assignments. Is this a representation course, about how to represent landscape? Then a new drawing should be due every week, perhaps about a new topic, readings should be secondary and there should be no presentation. Think of different strategies for organizing the course material. By park is one way of doing it; it could be thematized by scale, time period, any number of things.",
    "more realistic approach to the work load of the course",
    "Could use more information in the beginning before delving into student presentations."
