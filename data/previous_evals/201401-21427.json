    "Lots of reading, lots of writing, lots of class discussion, not a lot of grammar in class but be prepared to see it later on tests. You will get better at French from taking this class, that's for sure. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "This is a genuinely fun and useful composition course. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. The readings are also interesting and literary.",
    "I would recommend this class to any advanced student since it is a good combination of grammar review and interesting discussion which help to improve conversation\/writing skills at an academic level.",
    "A good way to solidify and practice French. I would absolutely recommend it",
    "This was a really intense but incredibly rewarding course! I really feel like I have a grasp of the language and can speak somewhat comfortably in conversation. Its strength was a great grasp of the language and a comprehensive overview of grammar. Also intensive conversation practice and HUGE amounts of writing in French. A weakness would be overkill with the amount of writing assigned. It was overwhelming and in some ways counterproductive after a point because I couldn't focus on it as intensively as I would have it I had fewer writing assignments."
