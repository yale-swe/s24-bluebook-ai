    "I learned about Montaigne; his contributions to intellectual history, and his influences.",
    "Writing and close-reading",
    "Developed an intimate understanding of Montaigne and a new, engaging way to read philosophy and contextualize politics and the human experience in a more thoughtful way.",
    "I gained a thorough overview of Montaigne's thoughts in his \"Essays,\" as well as an excellent introduction to contemporary Montaigne scholarship.",
    "I loved the chance this course offered to engage deeply with a single text, and the intellectual community that grew up around this engagement was one of the warmest and most stimulating I've found at Yale. My close-reading and discussion skills developed immensely in this course, and I think I could say the same for the others who were there."

   "comments": [
    "I wish I had the chance to discuss more with people of the opposite section group. But I did very much enjoy the close interactions with the Professors.",
    "No weaknesses, great course",
    "The strength was definitely the slow, intense approach taken to Montaigne. Spending a semester focused on a single book was brilliant. A lot of the in-class discusssions revolved around how Montaigne compares to other thinkers. For those of us in the class who didnt do DS and maybe havent read Rousseau or Hobbes in a while, that was pretty frustrating. I often felt totally out of my element in class as a result. Id love for the conversation to either focus more on Montaigne or provide readings of the authors wed discuss for context.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The course's strengths lie in its intimacy (only 14 students with 2 professors) and its focus (only on Montaigne). I love the \"Interpretations\" lecture\/seminar format, with split lecturing by both professors and split time with each professor in section. I was blown away every week by the quality of lecturing and discussion. The additional film-viewing sessions for the class were also spectacular. Perhaps the only suggestion I would have for improvement (or really, experimentation) is to attempt a different arrangement of chapters to approach Montaigne's thought. Each week, we would look at a different topic that focused on one primary essay and two or three related ones -- I found this approach extremely effective to get a sense of the entire book and its internal logic (without slogging through from the beginning), but I wonder if there could be a way to try the class again with a completely different organization of chapters (and what that would say about the nature of the book).",
    "Strengths: the discussions, the brilliant lectures, the choice of text itself, all of which helped vastly expand my intellectual horizons. Weaknesses: precious few."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any Humanities Major because the required classes can be a gamble and not all of them are as stellar as this one. The topics Montaigne covers are so broad that I think they are perfect for the Humanities major, but I don't think the course makes sense to anyone taking a more specialized degree path. I will be recommending Montaigne and specific essays to many of my close friends and family.",
    "Yes, awesome class",
    "Absolutely yes. A wonderful introduction to or deep dive into the humanities. One of my favorite Yale college courses ever.",
    "I would recommend the class to every Humanities, political theory, or literature student (and really, anyone at Yale). Montaigne should be mandatory reading by everyone at some point in their college experience, but reading the \"Essays\" in (almost) their entirety has given me a new view on life. The class works brilliantly as an \"Interpretations\" requirement for the Humanities major and Smith and Oskian were a stellar teaching team.",
    "Absolutely! Be prepared to be deeply challenged by the central text, whose style could perhaps best be described as an artful meandering, and to write (and re-write) your essays as you struggle with new ideas and conclusions that emerge from the book. If you can do this, your ability as a thinker will increase immensely."
