    "It's really a fabulous program, as long as you go over these authors in depth later on - it gives you an interdisciplinary road map - but it's very far from complete",
    "yes",
    "Second semester DS Lit is a chance to read some of the classics of literature in an engaging environment. Since you did DS first semester, you know how much work you will have to do, but you also know how rewarding it is to begin to make connections and appreciate the literature more deeply. Professor Jewiss is a good section leader who is quite tough at first. She works hard to get everyone in the class involved, so if you do not like to talk, this may not be the section for you. Overall, pay attention to close reading and you will do well in this class.",
    "I would totally recommend DS! You get to read the western canon and have amazing professors guide you through it! just do it already!",
    "Yes definitely, my writing greatly improved and she really helped me with my work.",
    "Directed Studies I would recommend, and this particular section I would recommend with reservation. It could be a bit frustrating for someone whose style (of class participation, of writing, etc.) does not match well with this particular professor's- that seemed to become at times an important factor in this class.",
    "The curriculum's superb, and Jewiss handles it very well. Her knowledge both within her areas of expertise (translation and Italian works) and of the curriculum as a whole is impressive, and her views on literature in general are insightful and make for fascinating discussions. A memorable and amazing course."
