    "HSAR 112 does a good job of covering the History of Art from Prehistory to the Renaissance. The course focuses on Ancient Greek and Roman art, as well as Medieval Christian and Gothic Art. The lectures are pretty informative, and the workload isn't that demanding, although grading difficulty really depends on your TA. A great course to take if you want to understand Western Art before the Renaissance without getting bogged down by too much details about any particular period.",
    "yes! everyone should understand how to look at these pieces",
    "Definitely take this class. It should be an undergrad requirement. Take it with Laurel, if possible. Not only did she make the material more engaging, but she is also a brilliant writer and gave feedback on my papers that I applied to other classes.",
    "Biggest waste of time ever. This is one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. It was dry, poorly taught, and simply uninteresting. If you are looking for an art history survey class, this is not the one.",
    "A good survey course but not as great as it is often said to be. No amazing moments. I would only recommend it as a way to complete the introductory course requirement of the HSAR major.",
    "Yes! take it!",
    "Take a different art history class. Lectures are moderately entertaining because you look at slides the whole time, but the content is boring and class adds nothing to the textbook. Sections are pretty good and the workload is negligible, but your time would be much better spent in a more specified class. Gaifman is decent, but you get the feeling that she gets 100% of her lecture material from the readings in the textbook. This is a frustrating class.",
    "I knew nothing about Art History coming into this class, and I came out of it knowing small bits of information about various pieces of art stretching a variety of styles and time periods. This course is more historically based with anecdotes about the time period and what may have influenced that art. My favorite part of the course was section. I know that normally this can often be the more tedious side to lectures, but I found section to be fascinating and enjoyable. Each of our sections were held in the Art Gallery itself. This allowed us to be up close and personal with the pieces and better understand them in their presence. We could share thoughts and opinions, ideas on why the artists chose to do what they did, etc. The discussions were collaborative and developmental. I felt like we all learned from each other and left this class being able to walk through the art gallery and know a bit more about what we were seeing. I was always the type of person who would walk up to a sculpture and say, \"wow, that looks nice,\" and then walk away. Now I can look at a sculpture, divine the time period, what motion if any the artist is trying to depict, if it's a realistic or idealistic portrait, etc. If you're looking for an introductory art history course, definitely take this one.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class at all. The lectures consist of mostly visual summary. IE 90% of it is her talking about what you can see yourself, and 10% maybe less is actually analysis. Of the part that is analysis, most of it is \"this is like that other statue we saw from this period\" or \"instead of leaning forward like in the past, the leg of this person is leaning to the side.\"I was expecting to walk away with a greater appreciation for art as a medium for human expression, and how that expression changed over time as humanity grew and evolved, but I didn't get any of that. To be honest, I'm not really sure what I can take away from this course. I guess it's cool to see things now, particularly architecture at Yale, and be able to identify specific elements, what traditions they're drawing from, and what makes them different from other things, but that's about all I can think of.The class is easy in the sense that you don't really have to do the textbook readings and the two essays are 5 pages and pretty simple, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially considering that you could be taking a much more valuable course instead of this one.",
    "I loved this course! It provides a great overview of art up to the renaissance. It also teaches you the essentials of art analysis is and gives you the vocabulary to intelligently discuss works of art.",
    "Definitely take it, especially if you come from a STEM background. Sections are incredibly refreshing- you have 50 minutes each week to explore the art gallery. It will really make you more well-rounded and appreciative of everything around you.",
    "I think this is a fabulous survey course of art history! You learn so much. Very minimal work throughout the year...However, be prepared to put in A LOT of work before the midterm and final.",
    "If you really enjoy the words \"dome\" or \"Christ\", you should definitely take this class.Otherwise, it's not a must take class, but it's easy, fairly interesting introduction to art history. You leave with knowledge of a broad span of time, including the Gothic period, on which a lot of Yale buildings are based.The tests ask you to identify works of art based on pictures, so studying for tests is essentially a lot of memorization.",
    "I think this course should be a requirement for a degree from Yale College. The content is essential to understanding and existing in the western world. I already know that I will be pulling from the knowledge I learned in this course for years to come.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student even slightly interested in art as it doesn't require any special knowledge and is just a very cool course that allows students to explore art before the renaissance as well as Yale's own art gallery.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone looking to appreciate the visual arts a little better.",
    "The class is good as an intro to art history, but involves a lot of memorization, so if you're not taking it for your major, I recommend you take it Credit\/D.",
    "HSAR 112 is an interesting course, but mostly due to the material, not the delivery of the lecture itself. Prof. Gaifman often did not say anything beyond what was offered in the textbook and, as a result, you often either did not need to do the readings or did not need to attend lecture. I enjoyed the class, but mostly as a result of the subject matter. The sections were also held in the Art Gallery, which was cool.",
    "It's super basic. If you know anything about art history, skip it.",
    "I would not recommend this course. If you have taken AP art history in high school, it is essentially an identical class.",
    "I learned how to analyze and critique not only art, but humanities in general. It was fairly challenging at times, but it was very doable.",
    "good survey class of art and architecture from wide range of time. book and lectures matched up pretty well with most pieces on the lecture slides being in the book. 2 papers and 2 tests. Tests are not very difficult as long as you have all the pieces memorized",
    "If you are unfamiliar with the field of art history, I would highly recommend this course as a great introduction to early Western art. By covering art from its beginnings up to the Renaissance, Professor Gaifman was able to draw connections between different eras, noting several themes like the evolution of portraiture, realism, and architecture. If you have taken art history in the past, keep in mind that this is an introductory course; the discussions do not delve as deep given the immense quantity of artwork reviewed. I would take this class for the section alone, which met in the art gallery every time. It made a huge difference contrasting Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection with the canon discussed in lecture and in the textbook.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who might be interested in art history, or who just wants an overview of the discipline. Because it was a survey, the lectures could not go very in depth about any subject, which could be annoying at times, but surveys also allow students to see connections across time and space - something a more in-depth class could not provide. Section in the art gallery was also amazing - it was great to familiarize myself with the YUAG and even get to go to the object study classrooms to get a closer look at some items. I had a great TA as well, which also enhanced the course. The course work was not too bad at all - just two papers and two exams, each with plenty of time to prepare. It is a lot of memorization, though, so I would recommend starting to study early.",
    "One of the best courses at Yale."
