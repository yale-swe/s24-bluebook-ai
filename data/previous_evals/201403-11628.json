    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Might try to reduce the workload a bit...though every assignment is useful.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, I have learned a lot and I have learned how to think about food and nutrition",
    "I thought that the course content was really interesting. Class discussions went well and the assignments were challenging. I thought that the format of the final project was a little disjointed. I personally don't enjoy working on long group papers.",
    "Great course! Using some supplemental material to help students familiarize themselves with nutrients and food sources.",
    "This course was excellent, I wish there were more like it at YSPH. I really appreciated the intention behind the development of the syllabus. I know I learned something practical from each assignment that I can use in the future. This included learning how to navigate datasets on the FAO and DHS sites. I now have a deeper appreciation for the challenges associated with research and interventions related to malnutrition. I would not change anything about the course but I would suggest one way the group project could be improved. I think we would have benefitted from a short period of class time to discuss group expectations, with guidance from the instructor or group discussion. I came up against several frustrating obstacles and challenges with my group that I didn't anticipate. This might have been averted if, for example, we were given a worksheet on setting up timelines for ourselves. If short on class time, a couple of handouts or worksheets (like proposed project timeline\/ group expectations) could be uploaded to classes v2 and students could use them if they choose to do so. I felt that I took on the majority of the project, and could not convince my group partners to make changes or add content to their work or our group paper. I may have been able to make these changes myself if the pieces came together sooner. I did not know what to do when there was a disagreement since there was no one person in charge over the others.",
    "I thought one of the class's strengths was the breadth of material covered in the course, and the diverse perspectives it covered (from a micro level to a global scale). I feel as though I could have retained more from the first module since there was a lot of material about micro and macronutrients and their relationship to nutrition and disease that we went through quickly, but that's the class's only weakness, in my opinion.",
    "The daily quizzes during two of the modules helped reinforce the readings and course content. The assignments were varied, which kept it interesting. I also liked that there was plenty of opportunity to work and discuss topics with other students in the class.",
    "Overall, this is an excellent class. Strengths include building a good foundation in the first few weeks regarding what malnutrition is, how it manifests, how it is measured globally, and the current trends leading into the later modules; useful and interesting readings; thought-provoking class discussion; opportunities to explore the readings more in-depth as a class and one-on-one; reinforcing the readings through the in-class quizzes; creative assignments and a very knowledgeable professor. Weaknesses include perhaps a lack of linking the material to the student's personal life (could perhaps suggest an assignment where the student assesses their food security, food environment, and dietary intake), not as much attention was given to what foods were actually linked to the micronutrients we were learning about, and the quiz questions were sometimes challenging to understand (in terms of what was actually being asked). Some suggested improvements would be to introduce some way for the students to personalize the information and assess these topics on a personal level. Very interesting class overall. Second module was excellent, exploring these issues at the systematic and institutional level. Assignments were all reasonable, and I really appreciated that the work done for the final would benefit someone beyond the classroom."

    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0She was very helpful for teaching me how to think, the materials were very good and assignments were very intresting.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie was very nice and helpful. She also did a good job facilitating class discussions. Her feedback was always very thoughtful and I enjoyed her class.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very knowledgeable about the material. Great overall presentation style.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0No suggestions for improvement. I was very satisfied with how this course was taught and the content. I can't say I looked forward to the quizzes but I did appreciate how they helped me read the material more carefully.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries was excellent! Highly knowledgeable about the topics covered in the course, engaging, and encouraged great discussions in class. Also had us over to her house for dinner at the end of the semester--it was wonderful!",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries is so knowledgeable but also not afraid to tell us when she is unsure of an answer or needs to look into it further to give a quality response. She is very open to questions and I felt very comfortable speaking in class. Great instructor!",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries is an excellent professor. Strengths included being approachable and accessible, inviting good discourse, being open to new thoughts and ideas, and providing multiple perspectives. It felt like sometimes Dr. Humphries was hesitant to share her on views on certain topics, which can be understandable; however, I think her views and experience lend themselves to the discussion we are having and can open the floor for either assent or dissent that may further the conversation even more. Overall, very good professor. Enjoyed working with her."

   "comments": [
    "You will gain the foundation of global nutrition and nutrition interventions. There are expectations to do the readings, but this leads to better class discussions.",
    "This course provides an overview of how food systems around the world have changed over time and impacted the health of populations in low- and middle-income countries.",
    "I do recommend this course and think it is necessary for all students interested in nutrition, global health and\/or food systems and food security.",
    "A really great class to learn about how nutrition affects disease, specifically how micro and macronutrient deficiencies affect disease and nutrition, and some of the factors (political, economic, agricultural, etc) that affect this. A manageable workload and I learned a ton! Professor Humphries was great as well. Definitely take this class if you're thinking about it!",
    "Global Aspects of Food and Nutrition - what a huge topic! This course did a great job of giving students a background in relevant nutritional information and then tackled some of the major concepts. I really feel like I left with a good overview of the topic. This was one of my favorite classes of the semester.",
    "Overall, this course is an excellent way to explore nutrition on the global public health scale, particularly as it relates to infectious disease outcomes. It is unique in that aspect but provides a wealth of knowledge and information that students from a variety of backgrounds can appreciate. I would recommend it due to the content being well disseminated and cultivated throughout the course, and Dr. Humphries is an excellent professor to explore this area with. I have already encouraged many students to take the course. I do not believe they will be disappointed."
