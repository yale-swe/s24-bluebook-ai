    "I learned a continuation of Middle Egyptian grammar.",

    "I learned more about Middle Egyptian grammar.",
    "I learned a bit more about Egyptian grammar and culture. There's not really anything else to say...",
    "We built on the grammar learned during the class' previous semester and translated longer, more complex texts. There is a greater focus on parsing to figure out what form a word is in. We practiced analyzing and evaluating texts in their historical context and what this tells us about Egyptian history."

   "comments": [
    "Well organized! No serious weaknesses. Would maybe have liked more grammar sheets to help guide my reviewing -- not sure I understand some verb tenses still.",
    "The course was active at reinforcing learned grammar through translations of engaging fiction. The teaching of grammar could be improved, because there were some types of verbs or parsing that we never came into contact with and thereby, most likely forgot.",
    "The strengths of this course is that the language is very interesting, and the grammar is taught very well. I also really like translating so many different things. The grammar can just be really hard to grasp sometimes, especially when it comes to figuring out what verb is being used in a text, but that's just because the language is difficult. The class is really interesting and well-done.",
    "The course was organized in a way that helped us learn the language effectively. The only issue I had this semester was just related to the changing of faculty a few times.",
    "I feel like a learned a lot reviewing the homework, but at the same time it often felt a bit unstructured. Sometimes only a few people would ask and answer questions, so it wasn't entirely clear if other people also knew what was going on. But I think we all learned a lot anyways and did really well (except on the 1st quiz).",
    "The focus on parsing and how to determine what form a word is in was very helpful. A bit more emphasis on vocabulary would be useful."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is either interested in Egyptology or understands that this is not a transferable language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The language is very interesting and just a very cool thing to learn. It's also a lot like a puzzle and can be very rewarding when you figure out how the grammar works. Although it can be frustrating because hieroglyphics has a lot of exceptions to grammar and a lot of it is process of elimination so don't expect it to be an easy language credit because it isn't.",
    "Yes! This is a really neat language to learn especially for those interested in history, archaeology, or related fields.",
    "I recommend this to anyone who's considering it. If you liked 110, then 120 is fine. I don't think the 2nd semester is particularly more difficult, just jump in and do your best. I wouldn't exactly call this class a gut tho. I felt like grading got a little harsher in 120 for whatever reason. The curve just wasn't as good anymore, but everyone will get a tolerable grade in the end assuming they actually try.",
    "If you took Hieroglyphics I and still have any interest at all, I would highly recommend the course. There is more creative freedom in translations as you being going through larger sections of actual texts rather than standalone sentences, and this aspect becomes the greatest focus of the course after the last few verb forms and sentence types are covered."
