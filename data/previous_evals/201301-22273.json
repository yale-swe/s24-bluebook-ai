    "Ah, well you have to take it.",
    "Keniston is extremely inconsiderate as a teacher and he is very unprofessional. He is consistently late to class, doesn't finish the material he wants to lecture, and poorly explains more complicated concepts. Section is very useful, but TAs have no higher understanding of the material. The class is fine and you will learn to read social science papers.",
    "This course was undoubtedly my least favorite course that I have taken at Yale. For one, I was poorly prepared. I took a different quantitative analysis course because I was abroad, so I had never used STATA prior to this class. In addition, many students in the class had taken more advanced econ courses (whereas I just took intro micro and macro freshman year) but even they were struggling to grasp the concepts covered in this course. The class was poorly taught--the professor would commonly mumble explanations and not explain each step to arrive at formulas. There were typos galore in the lecture slides, and the problem sets had typos as well, which students would identify and only then would the psets be corrected. Despite investing hours and hours of work in this course, I felt like I got little out of it in the end. This class should be heavily altered if it is to remain a core course of the Global Affairs major.",
    "It's a core course, so you'll have to take it anyways. But one thing I would say is that if you go into the class knowing nothing about international development (that was me), you will get a pretty decent overview of critical issues in international development and you will definitely understand the statistical tools. The psets can be pretty cumbersome though.",
    "Well you don't really have much choice. But, it is WAY better than Security, so be happy about that. Make sure that you have taken intermediate micro and applied quantitative analysis (or have a good grasp of how to use Stata) before taking this!",
    "Required class that covers a lot of the major topics with key research, but lectures are not very engaging.",
    "Professor Keniston is clearly very smart, and clearly trying hard to teach us as much as possible, but is sometimes disorganized (arriving to class late, fixing slides in the middle of lecture) and can get frustrated. In fairness, I understand his frustration, trying to teach an introductory class in development economics where there are technically prerequisites and yet everyone has such a wide variety of skills. If you come prepared to this class by taking statistics and intermediate econ, you will have a much better time in the class and probably learn more as well.I also think that the dualfocuses on a qualitative understanding of development and on research methods (more quantitative) made the course difficult. On the exams, especially, it was unclear which was more important.If you are taking this class, you have to take this class. Make the most of it. It's not an easy class, but it really is a good one, and the conclusions are often counterintuitive. Most of what you learn, qualitatively, in the class, comes from Poor Economics (a great read), but the topics are taught at a higher level and include more methodological features as well. I think being exposed to econ research for the first time was the most valuable part of the class to me.",
    "Take this class if you are a global affairs major, not that you have much of a choice. But make sure you have taken GLBL 121 or Econometrics beforehand- something that has taught you STATA as you will be using this program a lot in the problem sets. Also make sure you have a good problem set group with people who also know STATA.",
    "You are clearly taking this class because you have to. Don't get excited. You will be reading (or not reading) about various studies and you will spend class discussing the methodology. I can honestly say I have never been less interested in a class at Yale.",
    "If you're taking this course it's because you're a GLBL major and you have to so recommendations don't really apply. Yet again a case of an incredible syllabus, important ideas and good themes completely bungled by course administration and pedagogy. Yet unlike last semester, when I was willing to give Professor Sanchez the benefit of the doubt and attribute the poor quality of the course to a bad mismatch of (bureaucratically mandated) course design and professor aptitudes, in this case I'm really not.The syllabus *is* a good survey of the current topics in development. Yes (*clutches self*) it involves econ, econometrics, and some Stata. Unfortunately these are realities of the field and should be embraced rather than feared by students. However, the I have to say that Professor Keniston was hopeless in his ability to teach this stuff. I would attribute part of that to GLBL students refusing to admit that they might need to actually work to understand econ and proofs rather than just copying them. However, Professor Keniston's approach to that obstruction was not to adjust his teaching and come to class better prepared to go over the econometrics that were clearly causing people so much trouble, but instead to be obstinate and consistent in his grumpy approach to teaching proofs- e.g. copying them incorrectly on the board and then refusing to answer any questions about them when confused students asked. Don't get me wrong, Professor Keniston is clearly an expert on this stuff in practice. He is not an expert, however, on relating to students and\/or conveying knowledge.I don't know how to solve this problem. I'd say that spoiled GLBL students got a small taste of what science students deal with regularly and just struggled with the learning curve, but I also refuse to believe this stuff couldn't be better taught. A dose of respect on both sides would help of course.My advice:1. Even if you form study groups (probably a good idea, as everyone has different areas of expertise), do the pests on your own. That's where you learn things and the tests won't be such a surprise. Make a special effort to become familiar with Stata syntax.2. Do the readings, as they're the best part of the class. If Keniston was the one who compiled the syllabus, he did an excellent job as they're all interesting and some of the most important papers in the field.3. Come in with an econ\/econometrics background, or take concurrent classes in research methods, and this stuff will come real easy.",
    "You have to take it. It's better than security, and both will change substantially next year....so I won't waste your time. You're going to see a lot of really angry comments on here, but it's not entirely as bad as it sounds. The T.A.s were terrible, and Keniston wasn't good either, but at least you'll learn something. Unless you've already taken a dev economics class.",
    "A required course that will hopefully be better next year than it was this year.",
    "no. but too bad you have to take it cause you're in glbl affairspoor economics is a great book however, and the topics are interesting.",
    "Take it if you need to. If you're not GLBL, don't take it.",
    "It was one of the hardest classes without being properly taught anything",
    "Can we end this CRUEL GAME???? http:\/\/touch.dailymotion.com\/video\/x7ms63_saturday-night-live-the-herlihy-boy_fun",
    "You don't really have a choice!",
    "Well, you have to, if you're a GA major. But I do think this class is very useful - even as a Security track major, I think I've gained a lot from the methodology of development economics, and made me more aware of global economic issues. My advice is to take it in junior year as scheduled rather than in senior year, because the knowledge earned from this class can be followed up on in future classes, which is what I plan to do.",
    "Well, this is required so if you're reading this you already have to take it. I'm an int'l security track student, but I still think this course was better than Security although this course is still not great. The course has very interesting topics to cover, but if you don't have a strong econ\/stats background it can be pretty hard. Go to class (Prof. Keniston has a beef against people who don't go to class and mentions things in class you can't find anywhere else), go to section and have your TA's advocate for you with Prof. Keniston, and DEFINITELY do the Psets in groups. I did them by myself because I wanted to be sure to learn, but I feel my grade suffered for it. Keep a positive attitude and try to enjoy the topic as the topic is legitimately interesting.",
    "Well you have no choice, but it was truly fascinating.",
    "This course is mandatory for Global Affairs majors, but I would say it is worth taking. You will learn a lot about recent developments (heh) in this field and get to practice your statistics and programming.",
    "No, but it's required - so I guess you have no choice.",
    "Required, obviously. Much MUCH more worthwhile than the Core Security course. Reading research projects etc was actually quite interesting (well, skimming more accurately) and lectures covered some interesting topics. I think this could turn into a really awesome class --- the material is so relevant, but the course isn't quite there yet. Problem sets were a total pain, and we focused more on quantitative details rather than aspects of application and policy.",
    "economic approach to different problems faced by the poor, overview of development, yes I would recommend it because it is very interesting as an approach.",
    "It's required for the major, and it isn't fun at all. Probably the worst class in the major."
