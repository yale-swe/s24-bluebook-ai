   "comments": [
    "I learned more about various elements of artistic composition and expression using materials I had never worked with before. I also saw how much student collaboration can influence and improve others artwork through working together and group critiques.",
    "It was pretty fun, coming in with a relaxed open mind will help you navigate and truly enjoy the class",
    "I learned how to talk about art more in depth and with new vocabulary. I also got to create abstract compositions which is a genre I'm not the most comfortable with creating.",
    "A basic understanding of video and sound editing",
    "Processing information visually"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course does a good job forcing you to consider certain aspects of composition and design that you may not have previously. However, it did a terrible job keeping me engaged and motivated. The best part of art classes is always the fun group working environment, but this class kept everybody working individually. Collaborative assignments would have gone a long way towards improving the course. I feel like I don't know most of the people in the class, which isn't how an art class should be.",
    "I know visual thinking is usually not a very exciting class, and although Sophy made some more interesting projects for us, I was never truly excited by the subject material. I'm not really sure how to improve this as it seems it'll always be the case with a required design concept class.",
    "I though this class did a great job in terms of structuring its content, giving students adequate time to complete assignments, and introduce students to a new range of materials and concepts while not feeling overwhelming. I wish we had more time during crits, especially the final crit. Maybe if the crits were more structured, looking one by one at each composition, then we could review everyone's artwork in the time allotted.",
    "The post-midterm assignments were far more engaging than those in the first half of the semester. Maybe mixing up the order of the assignments would help. Or opening up chances for collaboration and working in audio-visual media earlier in the semester. For a while it felt like we were doing the same assignment over and over but somewhere between October break and Thanksgiving break, things really picked up and stayed lit until the end of the class.",
    "The class was absolutely freestyle, it was never a bother and the professor gave adequate extensions whenever necessary, she was very kind and the courseload was never at all heavy. It fit into any schedule of mine any day",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely the projects. They were fun, interesting and not overly time consuming if you managed your time properly. The critiques were a little disorganized although especially since we usually didn't get to talk about everyone's pieces enough.",
    "The projects focused too strongly on looking back at old work rather than improving yourself with new work. For example, being bound to making a piece look like a previous piece or having to make it through a specific formula compromised the creative integrity of the work."

   "comments": [
    "Take it if you need for the art major or as a prereq for other classes. Sophy is super knowledgeable, but not great at getting you engaged.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, from any major, as it teaches you how to engage your brain creatively without any former knowledge or art and without any pressure to be \"great.\" Many of the assignments produce abstract results from which one can see how formal artistic elements are at play.",
    "Absolutely. Great class to take whether you are an art major (the class is required for the major) or not. The class is meant to challenge the students to critically consider elements of composition as they make work in various media. My professor was especially excited about the course and willing to customize the course to the group's interests so that made it even better.",
    "Take this course! Light workload, Great professor (and TA) you get to understand a lot of things about art, especially Abstract art and transitive art. I myself came in quite skeptic but found myself speaking out and engaging more and more as time passed by. It was really fun and most of the assignments could be easily done, especially if you were into it",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if you want to engage in cool projects that challenge you to make compositions you never thought of before.",
    "Definitely."
