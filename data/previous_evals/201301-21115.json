    "It's necessary and useful for future study. Yes I would recommend it to other graduate students.",
    "Geophysical Fluid Dynamics will give you a great overview of how fluids work in a rotating system. It's a better course to take if you've already had another fluid dynamics class, as you'll benefit greatly by already being comfortable with the vocabulary and how fluids work in general. After this class, you'll understand why and when certain approximations are appropriate in oceanic and atmospheric systems, and you'll gain enough background to facilitate future study in rotating flows. I'd certainly recommend it to another student, but I'd warn students who haven't done a lot of geophysical flows (or fluids in general) that you may need to put in extra effort to keep up in the course - it's geared toward students who already have a general knowledge of how the oceans and atmosphere work.",
    "Definitely recommend. The course provides a solid foundation of basic knowledge about geophysics. And it's very useful.",
    "Yeah. GFD is the fundamental knowledge for those who are working on atmosphere and ocean sciences",
    "I recommend, because students'd be able to explain geophysical fluid phenomena after taking this course."
