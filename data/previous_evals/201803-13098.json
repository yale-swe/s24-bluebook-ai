    "This course taught me how to closely read certain passages of text with attention to detail, analyzing how and why an author made a specific choice.",
    "This class was helpful to me in that it allowed me to develop my reading and discussion skills. I feel as though I learned to be more comfortable with my ideas and comments in class, which helped me grow as a student and peer.",
    "I learned a great deal about history and various views on black lives throughout history. The teaching of how to write was not great. The class was interesting, though the feedback for writing was not always clear",
    "I definitely got better at structuring essays, understanding how to write a research paper, and how integrate evidence into essays in a way that is clear and elaborative.",
    "I learned a TON about the writing tendencies I have and how to improve in specific areas.",
    "I was able to develop a lot of my writing skills, especially close-text analysis. I also learned the basics of writing a research paper and connecting multiple sources within my essays.",
    "I developed how analytical reading skills and how to better provide reasoning behind my claims"

   "comments": [
    "I feel this courses literature is a broad and important collection of black literature. This is where the course truly is important to take as an undergraduate, and the course literature is well chosen. However, I feel this courses weakness is professor feedback and grade standardization, which Ill refer to when I review the professor.",
    "This course has a strong emphasis on literature, which could be seen as a positive, but expects students to write in a very specific way without offering much writing guidance. I believe that the course could be strengthened by more focus on writing, including examples of good writing and peer review.",
    "The strengths are the discussions and the quality of texts we read. We did not learn how to write that well which was the main weakness",
    "Sometimes his comments were not very clear in the draft phase of the essays, and grading varied a bit.",
    "The reading pace was fast but always VERY interesting!",
    "I really liked the books we read; however, I wish we spent more time talking about the larger novels especially Invisible Man and Beloved.",
    "Strengths: Seminar structure which allowed each of us to contribute to deep discussions Weakness: More clarity in the beginning of the semester as to how to write college papers since many of us were freshman. This could be improved by looking at successful papers written by previous students",
    "lots of good readings; could have more natural discussion"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend a student read this courses material, but I would not recommend this course to a student. While the topic of this course is extremely necessary to examine, I feel as though the professors feedback was never designed to actually help me improve upon my work, which often left me feeling frustrated and helpless in terms of receiving a grade.",
    "I don't think that I would recommend this course to a peer because based on what I've heard, other English classes offer more structure and support and have equally engaging material.",
    "I think people should take this class because it is so interesting and fun, and despite the struggle of writing essays without lots of guidance, the class was worthwhile. I would recommend because of the great discussion",
    "Yes. Professor Kreiner was very nice and passionate about the material. The books and essays we read were almost always very interesting and important.",
    "Yes! Fascinating, not a lot of time needed compared to science courses especially.",
    "If they are interested in African American history and\/or literature then yes. It is a great way to learn how to write while also learning a lot about this topic.",
    "It was an interesting class and we got to read novels by prominent African American authors such as Toni Morrison and Ralph Ellison and if you are interested in that then you should take it",
    "yes"
