   "comments": [
    "LOVE IT. TAKE IT. it will make you think about the world in a completely different way. also, i really enjoyed the final project, in that you get to design and carry out your own fieldwork -- it's a lot of fun, and the final paper is basically no stress because its 20 pages written in conjunction with a couple of other people. i also really liked that it was a sophomore seminar because i feel like i got to know a bunch of other sophomores a lot better!",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this class to everyone. If you can take it, take it. You examine capitalism as it affects, and is affected by, culture and society. You dismantle your ideas about capitalism and leave with a deeper understanding of what capitalism is and isn't and what exactly goes into structuring an economic system. Professor Rogers is amazing. This class was really thought provoking and super interactive.",
    "This is a great seminar to take if you're interested in looking at economics from a different perspective and using qualitative ethnographies to reexamine your assumptions about capitalism. The readings are on an eclectic range of topics but provide really great discussion material. The final project for the course is a group ethnography on some observable aspect of capitalism in New Haven, which I think is a big draw for a lot of people, because very few anthropology classes actually allow you to practice the discipline. It's a difficult project, but the course is structured so that you do it sort of piecemeal throughout the second half of the semester, and I'm really glad I had the opportunity to play the role of ethnographer. The class is not a huge time commitment, and unless you've extensively studied capitalism outside of the econ department before, I see no reason not to take it.",
    "Overall, this class is perfect. The other students are definitely the clincher in an already exciting course full of classical theory alongside new readings in capitalist scholarship- from Marx to the marketplace, and from i-banking to industrialized post-Soviet Poland. Take every sophomore seminar you can at Yale!",
    "YES. THIS CLASS HAS BEEN SO AMAZING! I came in a little skeptical about the coherence of the class and the relevance of the books we were going to read. However, anthropology and Professor Rogers made this subject be the mos mind-blowing course I have ever taking. Being all sophomores, we really enjoyed each other's company and the discussion was always great. For me, it was a great experience to learn to think in a new way, without resorting to generalizations and identifying very subtle modes of action and thought that determine how people interact with socially constructed ideas of the world and themselves. LOVE THIS COURSE",
    "Highly recommended! Sophomore seminars are few and this is an excellent one to take. It will give you an entirely new perspective on capitalism, one that goes beyond the usual 'capitalism is evil' generalization and really examines its effect on the way we think about our lives.",
    "An extremely engaging seminar that ranges in topic but generally approaches capitalism from a cultural\/ethical point of view. Readings are split between theory and case studies, and discussion use readings as references for broader discussion. TAKE THIS CLASS. Totally great.",
    "Anthropological Approaches to Capitalism is innovative in its reexamination of the viewpoints of several major economic theorists, including Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Adam Smith, from the perspective of an anthropologist. It wins the status of being one of the only \"cross-listed\" courses that had enough to say over a whole semester. I would definitely recommend the course to another student, not just because the reading is consistently interesting, but because as one of few sophomore-only seminars this fall, the course created a classroom environment in which students could share personal anecdotes and opinions about some very personal topics, including the relevant consideration of Wall Street capitalism as a future career option.",
    "Take it if you wanna learn about capitalism!! Anthropologists have important things to say about capitalism and our society. I am more like a philosophy person and used to think anthropologists are sort of inferior to philosophers, but now this class changed my view! It literally made me think about my life differently. Great class! Not too much work for a seminar!"
