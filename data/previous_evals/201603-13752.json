    "-Receiving instruction from experienced and renowned professionals -Hearing stories about their professional experiences in theater around the world -Spending time with the design students and observing the time-consuming dedication required of creating a scenic design -Hearing feedback and suggestions on student designs from Ming, Michael, and Ricardo -The instructors were open and receptive to our questions and our desires to learn\/improve -The choice of plays and operas made for a fascinating variety in scenic requirements and design choices -Seeing the talent and ingenuity of my classmates -Copies of the plays\/operas\/music were conveniently provided -Saturday schedule left flexibility in class end time -Watching the process of student directors interact with student designers for the Shakespeare project",
    "Overall, I very much enjoyed the studio and found the different ways of working on a conceptual problem and design in interesting dialogue with my studio work elsewhere. I very much appreciate Michael, Riccardo, and Ming Cho Lees interest in each student and their personal development and would only hope to spend more time with each of them discussing design. Alas, the class is very large and I can understand it to be very challenging to review everyone's work. Thank you for a great semester.",
    "I love this class and the format of it is very well set in my opinion. The interaction between student and student, student and instructor, and even instructors together is very valuable. The last three classes which we worked on Shakespeare was mind blowing. As a director we don't get much chance to get feedback from our instructors how to talk or collaborate with designers and here was a great place to experience that. It was such a privilege to have 4 to 5 designers design you different sets and give you all the time to practice collaboration. I think the team of Mike, Ming and Reccardo has an amazing dynamic they are each very different and you get the sense of not everything is right or wrong.",
    "It was very valuable to get all of the professor's perspective on each model the designers brought in, and also to collaborate with the designers on our Shakespeare shows. I learned a great deal about the practical and aesthetic concerns of theater design. I also thoroughly enjoyed learning how to better collaborate with designers, a skill I look forward to taking forward into my future productions.",
    "The communal nature of the class, in which all the students discuss the content and needs of a given play and then share their designs, is extremely interesting and instructive. The content was equally interesting and obviously the instructors are experts in the field with clear points of view."

   "comments": [
    "-Start class on time -Use a classroom or studio space more conducive to the needs of design reviews. It was hard to hear and stay engaged with the design reviews because we could not gather around each design, and had to awkwardly spread out among tables and chairs and that extra pew in a crowded room that barely holds all of the students in the class. -Purchase a set of 30-or-so lightweight LED clip lights and a small collection of gel and tape, so that students can attach them to their models (instead of the cumbersome and well-used flexi-lights that have to be plugged into the wall.)",
    "My comments to improve the course grow out of my own deficiencies and knowledge about opera and theater. I found myself feverishly taking notes on many of the references (or precedents) discussed in class in order to research them later. I would suggest a bibliography or selected books for class in order to build a library of set design work and canonical productions in the world of theater.",
    "I have couple of suggestions to improve this great class. 1. Although I think we are absolutely lucky to listen to Ming talking about theatre but I think this class needs a necessary time management. either announce that this class is 6 hours and give us specific breaks or stick to the time that class has. Because starting class hour, hour and half late is something most of us can not afford. 2. I desired more diversity in the plays that has been chosen to work on.",
    "My main request\/criticism for this class would be to get Ming Cho Lee to arrive sooner (or change the scheduled start time of the class to reflect when he will actually arrive) and to encourage him to start looking at the models MUCH sooner. The class rarely gets to the point where Ming and Ricardo and Michael are actually responding to the designers' work until a few hours after the stated start time of the class, which means that the directors (and virtually anyone else who is in rehearsal or has meetings) have to leave before we get to the part of class that would be the most useful for us. While rehearsing my LH, I actually saw almost none of the design students' work discussed or critiqued (much less the homework I've brought in) because there is such a long 'preamble' from Ming before we get to talking about the design of the play or opera at hand, and I've had to leave to go to my rehearsals before the models are looked at. I understand-of course-that Ming is a legend of the theater, one of the great designers of the past 100 years, and that this class and format has produced many great designers from the school (Ming's Saturday set design class was one of the classes I've looked forward to the most in coming to YSD). But because we spend so long, every week, both waiting for Ming to arrive and listening to him tell very long stories that aren't about design, or even listening to recordings of entire operas that we should have listened to before class (!) just to have done the assignment, we--as directors-don't actually get to be present during the part of the class that would be the most useful for us: hearing Ming and Ricardo and Michael critique the models and drawings. I know it is a delicate subject (and that a class doesn't need to be run like a factory), but I would encourage the teachers of this class to start critiquing the models, sooner. On anther note, I felt a bit awkward when the designers were designing my SRP at the end of the semester because it was scheduled to happen at the exact same time as my actual design process for my SRP (this is due to the fact that SRP 1 has been moved earlier, but that the Shakespeare project in this class has been kept at the same time-It would be very helpful for the director of SRP 1 if the Shakespeare project for this class could be moved to BEFORE the design phase for SRP 1).",
    "This should come as no surprise to anyone, but the class is extremely unpredictable and hard to plan around. While this may work albeit inconveniently for the drama students, as an architecture student trying to take this class it was and continues to be the primary deterrent for more students from outside the school enrolling in this class."

    "I wonder if stage management and directing students would benefit from a different scenic class, perhaps one that is more vocabulary-based or doesn't overlap with the 2pm rehearsal schedule.",
    "The structure or weekly expectations for the class were at times vague. If possible, I would have greatly appreciated a weekly email from the TA indicating what was expected for the next class. The assignments were usually standard, but sometimes modifications were discussed outside regular class time that were never communicated widely.",
    "I think I have mentioned everything in the two previous questions. Thank you"
