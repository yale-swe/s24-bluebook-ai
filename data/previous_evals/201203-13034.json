   "comments": [
    "I would definitely encourage another student to take this class, especially if they were interested in political theory.",
    "I would describe this as a survey of pivotal works about history and politics. I would recommend it if the students are committed to the reading.",
    "Absolutely not. Stay away if your heart is not calling you to it. It is a death sentence. Do not take it if you just want to seem smart. You will actually feel the opposite.",
    "When they say the course is \"History and Politics\", they mean \"Politics.\" I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in pursuing political science, political philosophy or as a sort of supplemental course for a history major. Students with a strong interest in politics would enjoy this course; those without such interest may struggle. Students looking for a history course should look elsewhere, but it's a good introduction to political theory. DS H\/P is a good course, but one with a very specific audience.",
    "H& P maybe had tougher essay prompts and a more difficult final, but like the other DS classes the material and discussion is so interesting that all the work is worth it. Smith isn't for everyone, but I personally greatly enjoyed his section.",
    "It's a great course with a lot of good reading. Go for it!",
    "Take it! The reading can be daunting in H&P. If you can get a good 75% of the reading under your belt you will probably be in good shape for section.",
    "I had a generally positive experience in History and Politics, but a lot of students do not. Of the three courses in Directed Studies, H&P feels the leastunified and most nebulous as a subject. You start off reading historians and end with semi-theological texts, which is a shift that throws some students off. It mostly boils down to the fact that this is NOT a history course\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a historiography course (i.e. you learn about how other people conceive of history, not history itself). That said, I think most of the stuff is worth reading, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel bad if you skim\u00e2\u0080\u0094in fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite important to do so if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary and when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in DS. I think this course, while not as enjoyable as lit and philosophy, is worth taking, and is definitely worth taking if you are in Professor Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s section. Although his class can sometimes get off track, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an experienced instructor and a distinguished scholar. Overall, I think that DS generally is very rewarding for people who love books, love reading them, and love writing about them (emphasis on the \u00e2\u0080\u009clove\u00e2\u0080\u009d). DS is definitely the hardest thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever done academically, but without a doubt the most worthwhile.",
    "Take it. It is eye opening and wonderful.",
    "If H&P is why you're doing DS, don't. Take intro to political philosophy if that's your thing, or history if that's yours, because H&P tried to be political philosophy (Aristotle, Plato, Dante) tried to be historiography (Herodotus vs. Thucydides, etc) and tried to be pure history (Tacitus) but was actually NONE. The sum of all these parts was a mess, and I don't feel like I learned much of from most of the books. A more focused curriculum and goal for the course would definitely help. The readings are the most boring of any DS reading- nobody read the Roman historians. Nobody. Also, if you're committed to DS, don't take it with Smith. Professor Smith is very important,apparently. He's certainly one of the best lecturers we had for H&P, and I would gladly take a lecture course with him. Still, his style of leading a seminar had a lot of room for improvement: he would begin each class by raising a general topic, and then write down those whose hands were raised in order, putting our names on a queue. This was an easy way to manage a class in which lots of people wanted to speak, but meant that class discussions consisted of each person raising their own (often repetitive) point on the topic, with very little debate or room for the discussion to progress. Naturally- we stayed on most topics for far too long, because there were really only five or so points to be made for each. Further, his style of grading was frustrating. He was the toughest grader of all of my DS professors, which is fine, but he was the only one who didn't give extensive, helpful feedback. My Lit teacher would give me an A and a page of comments, both pointing out the positive and the spaces for improvement, whereas Professor Smith would give me a B+ with very little indication of how I could do better. If he's going to be a tough grader, he should be more clear about what he's looking for.",
    "If asked to summarize Directed Studies: Historical and Political Thought for a fellow student, I would emphasize that this course is NOT a history class NOR a politics class. Rather than examining the substance of history or politics, this course considers the methodology behind these fields. By reading the historians of ancient Greece and Rome and the political theorists of antiquity, this course seeks not so much to study specific concepts, as to think about the HOW of history and politics: how these fields should be studied, how historians and political theorists can shape society's self-awareness, and how we should think about the individual's relationship to that society through time.It is precisely for this reason that I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. While there are, admittedly, some drier texts on the syllabus, many of the texts (especially the histories) contain rich and vivid accounts of great battles, impressive leaders, and controversial political theories. Such richness is sure to provoke the thoughts of all students, resulting in satisfying time spent reading and dynamic classroom discussions. Furthermore, as freshmen begin their college studies, nothing could be more worthwhile than considering the methodology and theory behind the fields of the humanities, before diving into the hard, fact-based substance in later studies. The themes and messages of the syllabus help to frame how students think about the individual-society relationship, providing a firm foundation for continuing scholarship. Truly a key element of what may be called a \"classical education,\" Directed Studies: Historical and Political Thought is eye-opening and definitely worth taking.",
    "Everyone has different tastes, so I didn't there is a 50\/50 chance that this course is right for you."
