    "I would recommend this class to someone only if they are extremely interested in documentaries, or are looking for something to do on a Monday night. This class was interesting at times, but also very tedious as well.",
    "I would, I think it gives pertinent information and a good way of looking at a wide range of seminal documentaries.",
    "A survey course tracing the evolution of contemporary documentary in the U.S. and the its many divergent styles. There's one weekly screening where you watch a few clips from films in addition to one full length documentary, and then you discuss the films in section on another day. It's relatively light on work, and it would be difficult to get below a B+ in the course so long as you complete all the assignments. The only graded assignments are a midterm paper, a final paper, and three short responses to films seen outside of class. Allof these papers are open-ended and you can write about pretty much whatever you want, which is cool. However, it's a lot of time. The aforementioned screenings are 4 hours long, and section runs for an hour on top of that, so it got a bit tedious at times. At the end of the day, I watched a few good films that I would not have seen otherwise and wrote a couple interesting papers, but I didn't get too much more out of the class other than that. And for every good film there was a not-so-good one. Only take it if you are very interested in learning about different styles of documentary filmmaking."
