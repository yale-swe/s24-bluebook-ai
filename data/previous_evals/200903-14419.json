   "comments": [
    "This course takes a graduate-level approach to Black feminist theory while simultaneously thinking through the practical implications and applications of these theoretical framework to life. We begin with some of the classical works and delve into depths of newer and genre-bending texts.",
    "Very highly recommended. Intellectually and morally challenging.",
    "Good for the brain, good for your work, and good for your spirit. A truly safe space to learn in the traditional sense because we're reading and talking but also because like I said before, there's the space to really think through things and that includes saying things here you might be afraid to say in other spaces. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in the subject matter and just anyone period. There is a level of open-ness and work required on the part of the student to help maintain the safe space of learning."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me to explore Black feminist theory as an analytic for my dissertation research. I was exposed to thinkers and theories outside of what has been determined to be the traditional canon of the field.",
    "I feel I will be much better equipped to do intellectual work and to teach in gender studies having taken this course.",
    "We were encouraged to stretch while also strengthening skills we use in our own fields. I did just that. The course helped give focus to my dissertation research and reinforced that I could do the kind of work I wanted to and toward a purpose I feel proud of. I think that's one of the most important things I could have gained from a course especially with so many years toward the PhD still on the horizon."
