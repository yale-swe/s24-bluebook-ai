    "The course examines the intersections of African history, novels and films. Because the weekly workload consists of a novel, a film, and a historical work (at least), I would only tell students that this course requires a real time commitment. I would definitely recommend this course to a student.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who is interested in having a broad understanding of topics related to African history, film and literature. It is a class that touches on a lot of topics, from griots and oral African tradition to the genocide in Rwanda. However, for someone who wants more in-depth knowledge of either African film, history or literature, I would not recommend this course. Because of the wide range of topics studied, there is not enough time in this course for a deep analysis of these topics."
