    "Aerodynamics is one of the few advanced fluid dynamics classes that you can take at Yale and is the only class that actually teaches about aerodynamics of airfoils (if you are interested in car\/building\/other applications of aerodynamics, it is not covered here). Gomez teaches the class very differently than other professors would, but he does a decent job of covering the basic theoretical side of aerodynamics. There is absolutely no hands on approach, and he only introduced us to computational techniques on the last day of class. The homework assignments are absurdly long, time consuming, and unrelated to what we do in class, which is very annoying (but luckily they are only about 5% of the grade, so it does not really matter). But, I imagine that Gomez is a pretty fair grader so if you put the work in, you should be happy with your grade. I am not sure if other professors would do a better job of teaching the class, but since it is offered every other year, you do not really have a choice. Basically, if you want to take the class just do it and try not to complain.",
    "Small and solid class. If you want to learn about why things fly, definitely take this course. Disclaimer: This is really a math course. Expect some heavy homework. I recommend this course.",
    "this was an OK class. delamora usually teaches and we had sandro so no idea how it'll be for you. that said he means well and is smart and good at explaining concepts quickly with no bullshit. however sometimes it was hard to follow, i wish there was more support from the prof\/TA. book wasn't great, p-sets took a while, all exams were pretty hard (second midterm esp. jesus christ). he likes tandem airfoils a lot on his exams so think about those a lot. overall difficult class, kind of meh, credit\/d if you can (and i'm super into aerospace engineering too...)",
    "Not with Gomez. No sirrrr. Don't do it.",
    "This course offers a theoretical approach to aerodynamics and the different frameworks that can be used to evaluate the properties of different airfoils. There was a brief introduction to simulating software, but this was not a focus of the course. Two midterms, a final, and weekly problem sets. No section (just meetings with the professor). It will be good if you are interested in the material, but otherwise it will just be dry."
