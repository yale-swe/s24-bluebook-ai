    "Comprehensive engagement with the foundational texts",
    "A broad, detailed introduction to the discipline of cinema studiesincluding many key figures, past and present, in the discipline. As this was my first semester of graduate school, it also helped me learn to participate in discussion: when to introduce my thoughts, when to pull back, how to defer to others' expertise and work through problems with the reading. As I did not have a required proseminar in my other department, this course was a helpful and steady home base as I got used to many aspects of adjusting to PhD life."

   "comments": [
    "Too many texts, too short the duration",
    "The great strength of this course lies in the invitation of faculties from the Film program. This is such a great way to get to know the faculties and their pedagogical styles. It should really be kept as a mainstay of the course. For improvement: I would recommend that the faculty really emphasize the importance of the weekend screenings. Some of the discussions were the best that I've had on campus, and it was extremely unfortunate that only 1\/3 or 1\/2 of the seminar members showed up.",
    "I would like to see more integration of the required films into the structure of the course; I recognize that this is a particular difficulty of the seminar, given it is not designed to include discussions of films. But the screenings, especially toward the end of the semester (with the notable exception of Persona) did feel like a bit of an addendum. The biggest strength of the course, for me, was the way it introduced us to other members of the department who had various different methods of working through the readings."
