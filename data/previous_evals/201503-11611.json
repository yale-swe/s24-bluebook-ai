   "comments": [
    "This class is great and you learn a lot of astronomy (sometimes a little more than you bargained for) but it is overall a very good experience and tremendously informative.",
    "Overall, good course material that I really enjoyed learning about. However, as a non-science major in a science for science-majors class, I felt like I was putting a lot of effort into a class that at the end of the day, I didn't enjoy as much as my other classes.",
    "Would definitely recommend, learned a lot and have a solid understanding of galaxies and cosmology.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who are serious about studying and majoring in astronomy.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It is definitely aimed towards science majors, and if you are considering the astrophysics major, this is going to be the best introductory class. There is obviously more of a focus on the large scale universe rather than on planets and such, but the class definitely gets into some of the most interesting topics in the field, particularly cosmological models.",
    "An introduction to the small and large scale structure of the universe. No final, a cool observing project, and manageable workload. The class is a great real science for people not necessarily looking to major in stem.",
    "ASTR 220 is a slightly difficult (as a non-science major) but rewarding course. I took it for a science credit, but most of the students in the class were science or astronomy majors. The course was occasionally confusing and the lab report was poorly explained, but Professor Edwards and the teaching fellows were more than willing to help when asked. Professor Edwards is an incredible professor, brillant but also capable of explaining anything. I would not hesitate to take another class with her, but this class is definitely for students with a strong math and science background."
