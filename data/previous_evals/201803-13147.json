    "I gained an overview of all of the pertinent topics in the field of control theory thus far; from learning basics like defining a system in terms of state variables and determining if a system is stable\/unstable, Lyaponuv's theory, optimization methods, Kalman filter, adaptation, and learning were all touched upon.",
    "I learned how to identify systems from the real world, represent them in state form, evaluate their controllability, observability, and stability, find their solutions, and develop optimal control policies.",
    "I learned a lot about how to control systems and the math\/theory behind it. I thought it was really cool learning about the power of Control Theory and really enjoyed working on my project and learning more about it's applications in the real-life setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The purpose of the course is to have breadth as opposed to depth and to have students obtain some sort of exposure to all relevant elements that incorporate control of systems. This is fantastic, however many topics that are highly relevant as engineers, like the Kalman Filter, only had two dedicated lectures when it could be a course in itself. If there was a way to offer more courses in order to have students pursue depth as well, I think that would be the best solution as there simply isn't a way to get an exposure any other way besides this very broad class.",
    "The material is fascinating, and the lecture notes are great. Professor Narendra is very accessible and welcoming to students. However, sometimes it would have helped to do more worked problems to flesh out the theory.",
    "I would recommend having more TFs for the class so that we could have more office hours when necessary. I thought the problem sets were very difficult, but if there'd been more consistent office hours I think I would have grasped the material better."

   "comments": [
    "If there are remotely interested in control theory, yes. This is the only class at Yale that covers these extremely important topics in the field.",
    "If your interested in learning about systems control, take it! Don't take this class just to fulfill a requirement though; the research project will drive you crazy.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are comfortable with mathematical theories and equations without numbers. Being good at linear algebra also helps a lot."
