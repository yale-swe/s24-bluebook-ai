   "comments": [
    "Wouldn't recommend it; I kept it in spite of my initial reservations because I felt obligated to since it's a freshman seminar. This was a mistake. The material itself is pretty interesting, but the class is really disorganized and you rarely actually get around to discussing the material. Your grade will be mostly determined by work you do in the last couple of weeks. Take at your own risk.",
    "Varieties of English is a really interesting look at the dialects spoken across America, with a focus on the differences among different geographical regions and social groups. The workload over thecourse of the semester isn't too much, with weekly readings and written assignments every 2 weeks or so. A journal of dialect awareness and a final project (class presentation along with a write-up) were due at the end of the year; while these took a significant amount of time to complete, they were pretty interesting and rewarding to do. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the course! The material can be dry at times, but for the most part the information discussed is really interesting and relevant.",
    "The subject matter was interesting, but the atmosphere wasn't particularly engaging. Professor Horn ended up lecturing most of the time, which would have been ok had it not been a freshman seminar. The material used for class was mostly the one book American English; i would have preferred more news articles, academic articles, videos, and other media. The project (and final write up) were tedious, not only to do but also to present and listen to. The professors were obviously very knowledgeable, but unfortunately, the energy was really disappointing.",
    "Varieties of English was a very interesting class to take. We talked about all kinds of interesting linguistic topics, all revolving around how different people speak English. There was something for everyone- if you're from the South, you'll enjoy the discussion of Southern English, if you're from Boston there's a part about your hometown, and being able to relate to what we were discussing and having it all be so relevant was a great part of this class. The assignments throughout the semester were usually very interesting (we got to analyze Ke$ha's Tik Tok, for one- where else can you listen to Tik Tok for credit?), and there was a final project that you could do on anything you wanted, which made it a lot of fun to do-people worked on things as varied as text speak, the use of filler words like um, and even Canadian English. This was definitely my favorite project that I have done for any class at Yale this year. Sometimes there was not a lot of participation for a seminar class, and occasionally some sections could be a little dull, but overall I really enjoyed this class and would recommend at least trying it out if you can.",
    "This was a really interesting class, especially relevant at Yale, where we all come from different speech communities. The work was pretty manageable, involving analyzing \"Tik Tok\" linguistically, seeing if our friends distinguish between \"caught\" and \"cot,\" etc. I hope they offer this in the future!",
    "If you are interested in linguistics, I would recommend that you take the class. This class gives you a good idea about what linguistics is all about, so you'll know if you're really interested in it or not. It's not an incredibly structured class though, so if that bothers you, you may want to reconsider.",
    "It's a course in which you learn about many variations of the English language in this country. The assignments can be a little dull, but the discussions are interesting. The journal of dialect awareness, prepared by each student, is an original idea of assignment that was very enjoyable. The final project too.Overall, I really liked it, so if you have the opportunity to join this freshman seminar, do so!"
