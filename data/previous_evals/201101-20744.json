    "I would summarize it as a very good introductory course on Classical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics, covering a wide range of topics of interest for all of Chemists, Physicists and Engineers, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in learning the subject, due to its comprehensiveness."
