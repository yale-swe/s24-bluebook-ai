    "Aramaic of the Dead Sea Scrolls is a class for those who already have a good grasp on Hebrew and want to get a good understanding of Aramaic, how it evolved over time, and basic mechanics of the language. I would recommend this to another student who is interested in Aramaic because it is necessary to know Aramaic for our field of study. It can also be fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially someone who has a solid base in Biblical Hebrew and is looking to expand his\/her horizons to include Aramaic. Very useful also for students interested in Second Temple Judaism and Dead Sea Scrolls.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course and learning a language through the inductive method was a new experience."

    "This course has been very useful for my scholarly interests in Second Temple Judaism and Dead Sea Scrolls. It has provided me with a foundational understanding of Middle Aramaic so I can now read relevant aramaic texts on my own."
