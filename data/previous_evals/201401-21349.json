    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Teaches students about economic research in engaging manner. Research proposal is a cool opportunity for creative and independent learning.",
    "Econ 462 is a terrific class. Personally, I wasn't always the most interested in the material (though that's something you can judge from the class name--the material really is about various determinants of human capital in Latin America), but both the in-class and take-home material were always really interesting and allowed you to learn a lot. It's one of the few Economics classes that really allows you to get some insight into how economics is practiced, with an especially strong focus on how economists empirically test their predictions (there is some focus, though a little less, on the theory behind those predictions). The main assignment is to formulate a research proposal, which is a challenging but not unmanageable assignment, especially for a senior seminar. It's much more interesting than a standard paper on some subject--you have to formulate your own economic model and way of testing it empirically, getting you to really think about how some process you're interested in takes place.",
    "Take it. The best class I've taken at Yale, hands down. You'll get really comfortable with some common econometric techniques and reading empirical economic papers. Professor McKee, as you've heard, is just phenomenal. He's the definition of a perfect instructor\/teacher. Just to clarify--based on the past years' reviews, I came up with a HIGH expectation. The expectation was exceeded. This is just a wonderful course.",
    "Each week, you read 2-3 econ papers on a particular subject relating to human capital in latin america and do reading responses. In class, students present on the papers (with Doug stepping in to clarify, emphasize, or teach tools of econometrics). Then, we have small group or full class discussions: \"Given what we've learned from these papers, what is the policy recommendation?\" Over the course of the term, you work individually on designing your own research project. Doug is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale. I always had a good time in class, and I learned a lot about empirical economics. However, the homework was rough. I did not enjoy doing the readings or working on my research proposal. So, if you are just looking to fulfill the senior econ requirement, I would recommend this class only if you are interested in development in Latin America.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, even if for no other reason than to take a class from Prof McKee. The material is very interesting and engaging, and the format of the class, both in terms of how he teaches material and of how each student develops his own research proposal, make it exceeding fulfilling.",
    "Yes, amazing course. McKee is brilliant.",
    "Great course! The reading is a bit much though.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. There are just weekly worksheets that (while time consuming) are not too difficult. They just force you to read what are otherwise dense Econ papers very closely. Professor McKee is outstanding, and this was, without a doubt, one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you're at all interested in the subject matter, it is a must, and if you're not, you should still probably take it.",
    "This is the best econ class that I've taken at Yale. Definitely take it! Professor McKee is extremely engaging and you will actually learn how to read economic papers and do economic research in this class, which you don't get anywhere else.",
    "Good class. McKee is a great professor and guy and really makes the class. Be prepared to read a lot of econometricsy papers so shore that up before taking the class. Struggled through it but really walked out feeling like I learned a lot. Going in this was ranked highest rated economics class at Yale but I don't believe it deserves such high praise.",
    "Most definitely. Professor is great. Material is very interesting. Class is well structured and organized. Why not?",
    "Yes, Take it. It can be tough with the econometrics, but Doug McKee will help you through. Also, if you are a junior, try and take this course. Would set you up really well for a senior essay. Also, don't be afraid to tell Doug McKee to slow down on the econometrics, because he will!",
    "I highly recommend taking this course if you are willing to put in some work to get far more out of it. Doug is a great teacher, the subject matter is interesting (and often overlooked in other Yale courses), and the workload is reasonable (even for a second semester senior with a job). If you are looking to cut corners and breeze through a seminar, this one isn't for you. There and demanding weekly readings, and the final project is not something you can put off until the last week. However, you will leave the class with a better understanding of human capital, the Latin American region, and how to apply more advanced econometric techniques to answer research questions (something that isn't covered in much depth in Econ 131)."
