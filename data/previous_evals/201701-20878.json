   "comments": [
    "I learned the basics of thermodynamics. It is a must take course for MENG majors. Take it with friends, the psets can be hard to get through alone.",
    "I can't say that I gained any practical knowledge from this course, but it definitely will come in handy if I go into the industry. It definitely made me work harder for a grade than probably any other class I've taken, which as a positive did let me see what I'm truly capable of here at Yale.",
    "Working with abstract forms of ideas and new theories. The relationships in between heat and energy.",
    "Strong understanding of basic thermodynamics principles that I'll be able to use in future engineering classes",
    "I learned a lot more in depth about the theory and practical purposes of learning thermodynamics and how it relates to energy production.",
    "Introductory and intermediate thermodynamics knowledge. Heavy on theory and application.",
    "learned a lot of thermodynamics and a lot of applications!",
    "This class helped develop our problem solving skills and showed us some applications to differential equations and multivariable calculus.",
    "This class taught me how to think in terms of finding variables in terms of others that are known.",
    "As its name suggests, this class provides an honest introduction to engineering thermodynamics, providing us with the basic tools to analyze the work, heat intake and dissipation, efficiency and properties of heat engines or heat pumps. The class starts off with AP chem level thermodynamics and the ideal gas law, gradually adding in more advanced mass balance and energy balance. The difficulty took off when entropy and thermodynamics relations were discussed. All MechE majors have to take this class, but it is not a bad way to look into efficiency and other design aspects of these systems.",
    "I learned the thermodynamics from a mechanical engineering perspective.",
    "The thermo textbook",
    "Basically, we learned about the flow of heat during various processes, we learned about thermal efficiencies and the cycles that enable heat and work to be converted into each other.",
    "The course was a great combination of theory and a practical approach to thermodynamics. I particularly enjoyed how knowledge and skills of thermodynamics were applied to real life systems and mechanical engineering machinery. The class also helped us practice mathematical skills of equation manipulation and derivation, and was a great course to show how these can be used to derive equations that govern real life phenomena.",
    "This course covered on overview of thermodynamics in relation to mechanical engineering.",
    "I gained a knowledge of basic thermodynamics and how to solve thermodynamic problems.",
    "This course allowed me to have a greater understanding of the principles of chemistry and physics, and how to apply them to engineering concepts. Rather than simply looking at the empirical effects of certain technical processes (like turbines, condensers, pumps, etc.), this class allowed for us to look at the reasons behind their functions.",
    "Not much, maybe how to use steam table and a more applicable knowledge of states and state functions.",
    "I learned what Thermo is and how you can describe how energy changes in and across boundaries.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the fundamentals of thermodynamics with an exciting(!) emphasis at the end of the course on whole thermodynamic systems and their operation. We considered primarily steady-state system analysis but were exposed to a few transient behavior analysis examples. The course builds steadily from defining key thermodynamic terminology to the culminating consideration of complex systems- an awesome curriculum!",
    "I learned about different thermodynamic systems and under what circumstances I should apply different equations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would like to have solved many more practice problems and leave the derivations to the book and online videos to people who want the derivations. It's useful sometimes, like if you are solving problems and would like to remember fewer formulas, but mostly it's just not as helpful as practice problems in class would be, so there's a conversation going on and people can participate. You don't realize that you don't understand until there's a problem you don't know how to approach.",
    "Professor Cha is almost as good of a lecturer as Professor Smooke. Give her another few years and she will be one of the best professors. That said, she is currently brand new and the tests she gave were absolutely awful. Far too many questions for the time allotted. Practice, practice and practice problems for the tests on speed. Hopefully, she will change up her test style but for now it is rather rot. I've learned a lot in this class but since I'm a slow test taker, I'm taking the L on this one.",
    "It's very hard! I'm not sure how to necessarily improve this because the material can't change, but they do have some good implementations in place to help students. Weekly review sessions to cover recent material was helpful, and Professor Cha is extremely helpful one on one in her office hours.",
    "The materials isn't very hard to understand and if you don't have a conceptual grasp on the content it is really hard to do well.",
    "Great lectures. Could use more group problem solving. Second midterm was too long",
    "It would have been extremely helpful if there were textbook-problem-style examples in class. It was difficult to connect what we learned in the lecture (mostly theoretical stuff) to the numerical aspects of the problem sets",
    "It was a very dense course but it was always reasonable to learn and understand the material.",
    "tests were super hard :( but class was well taught!",
    "This course could be improved by showing more examples in both class and during review sessions to get more comfortable with the types of questions and problems we received. Besides that the lectures were well planned and gave a ton of useful background material.",
    "Judy was a really good teacher, but her exams were impossibly long and hard. The averages of all the midterms and finals were just above 50% and I think that's indicative that the test wasn't designed well.",
    "Professor Cha is very sweet and makes funny jokes about thermo. One of my favorite moments was from the beginning of the semester, when we we were discussing conservation of mass, and she used her pregnancy as an aside saying she didn't think it always worked because she didn't lose as much weight as she hoped when she had her baby. I wish we had done a few more examples in class though.",
    "Strengths: professor Cha provided a very thorough and unambiguous walk-through of the wide array of concepts, correlations and equations. The class is easy to follow if you had enough coffee before walking in, and the notes contain everything you need to know for the pset and exams. The psets are great tools to practicing the skills from lectures and generally clear the cloud. You basically know all the stuff after working through the problem sets. Professor Cha also made excellent attempts to add in relevance of the course by having students do presentations on the parts that analyze different applications of thermodynamics, and tour the power plant. Current research topics are also discussed. Weaknesses: The only weaknesses I can think of for this class are the occasional dullness and disjoint of lecture materials due to the very orthodox manner Prof. Cha teaches. Students could get lost, and although much of the confusion clears after doing the homework, having to make up for the understanding sucks during the week. The exams are also rather difficult.",
    "Overall it was a good class, the one thing that would have been helpful would be if we did more practice problems in class",
    "Much if not all of the lectures were entirely derivations with little application to problems. As a result it was very difficult to apply the highly theoretical lectures to the practical problem sets and exam questions.",
    "It was an interesting course, but the class was essentially a live version of the textbook. I wish we had done more practice problems.",
    "Needs more example problems in class",
    "I thought the pace of the class left something to be desired. We seemed to take awhile at the beginning on the really easy stuff, and then later we were going lightning fast through the harder material. I think I would have preferred it to be the other way around, but then again maybe that foundational knowledge takes longer than I'm giving it credit for.",
    "The course lectures were strong. I enjoyed how our Professor mentioned real life applications to the concepts we learned in class. Only ways it could be improved were perhaps if we had more office hours available for homework assignments, and more in class practice on how to solve example problems.",
    "I thought the pacing of the class was pretty appropriate and the class did not feel as rushed near the end of the semester as some other engineering classes I have taken. I was not impressed with the way the lecture time was spent, however. Professor Cha spent most of each class writing full sentences taken almost word for word from the book. I think more effort could have been put into dissecting what the most important parts to know were. It would help to interpret most things into diagrams, graphs, and bullet-pointed bare minimum notes. The time spent writing full sentences on the board could have been used to go through a couple of example problems. In addition, the homeworks and exams were very varied in difficulty and relevancy. Since we spent no time in class going over real problems, the homeworks took a lot of additional time to self teach the problem-solving part of the course. There were also extremely difficult questions that had little relation to the actual chapter, practicing skills that were not core to thermodynamics and relating more to advanced differential equations and algebra. The second midterm was extremely stressful because the length was not practical at all. If I remember correctly, the average was below 50% because most students could not finish half of the problems with the given time.",
    "The lecture is a bit dry, and sometimes gets a bit theoretical without doing a great job of tying the course material to real life. Professor Cha essentially taught from the book, which made it easy to go back and review the material in its theoretical form, but sometimes made it a little difficult to figure out the homework problems or exam questions. In terms of the homework, it sometimes felt as if the problems were arbitrarily chosen from the back, without the professor\/TFs checking to see how closely they tied into the course material. That being said, I thought this was a fair covering of thermodynamics, especially compared to reviews of previous courses\/professors. There needed to be a better job done of vetting the exams. 11 questions in 75 minutes is ABSOLUTELY preposterous - any student could tell you that is impossible for a STEM exam. Because of that tests did not test understanding of the material - instead they became a race against the clock for how many equations you could spit out that were somewhat relevant to the problems so that you could get partial credit (if you did this without trying to answer any of the questions it was almost guaranteed that you would do better than your peers), which did not seem like a fair testing system.",
    "I think that this course is great for student\/professor engagement since it's taught in an intimate space (Becton C031), which makes it really easy to ask questions if the material is confusing. The material is usually pretty dry, but Prof. Cha does a good job of formatting the material in a way such that it is understandable, however I think that the occasional overview of an example would be helpful for further understanding. What was especially useful (even though it never applied to a test situation) was the inclusion of student taught presentations with a tour of the power plant so that we are aware of the real world applications of our learning.",
    "The material can be super boring and esoteric and not really make sense all at the same time. Often I felt like this course would require us to have intuitive knowledge and memory of all of the equations we learned so that we could arbitrarily plug equations into other equations in order to get our solution that is another arbitrary equation.",
    "It was a lot of equations and I have so much trouble following equations. I needed there to be more connection to theory. Prof. Cha was a really nice teacher. She always answered our questions when we asked them.",
    "The course was well-paced and highly organized, with the course expectations clearly delineated and problem sets consistent in their difficulty level. We didn't do many practice problems in class, which could've been a useful exercise to solidify concepts and better prepare for the assessments.",
    "I wish that the material was presented better in this course so that I understood why we were doing what we were doing. It felt like we were just going through the motions of deriving certain equations just to apply the thermodynamic properties in different ways. Only as we approached the final did I understand why we needed these new equations. If the information was better connected from the beginning, I would have learned more from this class."

    "Professor Cha will be a great teacher but watch out for her tests. They are atrociously fast. But she is very kind and helpful. You probably have to take this course anyways, but it is very academic in order to prep you for all the higher level mech e courses.",
    "Honestly, I would only take this class if you have to. While it is pretty integral if you want to go into engineering, there is no reason to take it otherwise. The workload is manageable, but the content is pretty hard, so it takes a lot of time and effort to do well in the course. It was not as difficult as people had said, but definitely was the hardest Mech E. class I've ever taken.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you're ABET, you'll have to take this anyways, but it isn't burdensome like other courses may be (unless you really, really hate chemistry). For others, if you enjoyed chemistry or just wanted to learn more about energy and heat transfers, thermodynamics is great for that.",
    "This is a good course, but very difficult. Not for the faint of heart.",
    "take it if its required for the major! its pretty hard :(",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who enjoys STEM because it is very math heavy. I also think this course is tailored towards mechanical engineers (but they are required to take it).",
    "Professor Cha makes this much less painful than I've heard thermo was going to be. She's also very nice and helpful.",
    "If possible, take it with Professor Cha. She was a charm to learn from, as her candid and humorous (i.e. salty) personality made the class chill and student-oriented. She also made the class very well structured with the correct pacing and clear, unambiguous notes. Although the exams were tight on time, grading was largely lenient and so is the curve (thankfully).",
    "As far as thermo classes go, this one wasn't so bad",
    "As far as engineering requirements go, this class was pretty interesting.",
    "if its required",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to. It's a tough one, but reading Enrico Fermi's book beforehand helps a lot and chegg will totally save your ass, so it's not that bad.",
    "Professor Cha is a good lecturer, take it with her if you can. Thermo is a fundamental mechanical engineering course so try to take it if you can, even if you don't necessarily need to. The course is challenging and the workload is significant, and it'sreally great to see how thermodynamic concepts aply to real life and govern how machines and phenomena work.",
    "If this class is not a major requirement of prerequisite, I would not recommend this class.",
    "You're probably taking this because you're a MechE major, so I'm not sure how much this recommendation will factor into a decision about the course. Professor Cha's teaching is straightforward if not a little dry, and follows the textbook very closely. Homeworks are of fair length and are a bit confusing\/doable. The exams were quite difficult - it was Professor Cha's first year teaching the course, so I am not sure if the nature of the exams will change based on our course's feedback. Overall an decent course, not terribly thrilling, but much more doable compared to previous year's reviews\/professors.",
    "This course, like other mechanical engineering courses, might only really be recommendable to mechanical engineering majors, since there might not be much use for this course specifically for students with other interests. Then again, it is the quintessential MechE class, so if you enjoy the subject matter, it might be of interest to you.",
    "Do not take this course unless you have to or have some thermodynamic experience and know that it's what you like to do.",
    "You have to take this class if you are ABET. I would say don't let fears about this class stop you from being ABET as happened with some people I know.",
    "An excellent intro course. You hone many important skills in thermodynamic analysis and familiarize yourself with integrated thermodynamic system analysis.",
    "This course is required for all ABET Mechanical Engineers, so a recommendation might not even be applicable. If there are changes made to the current model of the course, I think that MENG 211 could be worthwhile to take."
