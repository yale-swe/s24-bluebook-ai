    "One of the best parts of the class is the opportunity to read and reflect on a book of poetry a week, and to give yourself the space to write a poem a week. Louise gives great written and one-on-one feedback. However, class can drag a little bit, especially if some of the same people are being workshopped week after week. Not having a set workshop schedule can also be a bit anxiety provoking (you're unsure which poems will be workshopped, and thus have no control over which of your poems receives class feedback). Sometimes workshop times will be very uneven (an hour on one poem, twenty minutes on another). Although it is very frustrating and alienating at times, the class did push me to look honestly at my writing and the ways in which it could be improved.",
    "This class is really wonderful. The best part is, of course, Louise. She is very thoughtful with every piece of work that you give her: try to meet with her as much as possible, although make sure you prepare and give thought to revisions."
