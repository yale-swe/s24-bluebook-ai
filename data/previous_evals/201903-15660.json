   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "In this course I strengthened my German skills, specifically focusing on longer speaking, reading, and writing assignments. I liked how in class we would have mini-reviews on important grammatical topics, because it helped clarify some of the more advanced topics that we previously learned, but take a while to stick. It was also very insightful to talk about current social and political issues in Germany, through the lens of media.",
    "I practised my German a bit and learned a bit about media in Germany",
    "A much better grasp of speaking, reading, and and writing in German, along with a good understanding of the unique aspects and challenges of media in modern Germany.",
    "I learned about different formats of media in todays Germany, and how they intertwine w modern politics: social media campaigns, youth movements, concerning the refugee crisis, global warming, etc. Also read a novel and watched a cool movie during class, and was introduced to the wonder of Tatort",
    "My German got a good bit better and I learned a lot about German media and culture that I didnt know about before.",
    "I learned about current events\/issues in Germany today, as well as different media in the country and how they compare to media in the rest of the world.",
    "I deepened my cultural knowledge of Germany and learnt how to speak about more complex cultural issues such as social injustice in German. I also learnt about different cultural issues in Germany",
    "My German improved a lot through taking this course. The focus on grammar structures and vocabulary wasn't super heavy, but just by putting in the effort to keep a weekly vocabulary list, doing the readings, and participating in discussion, I could tell my language skills improved greatly. My writing skills also improved a lot because of the biweekly writing journal assignments as well as the larger writing assignments and term papers, all of which came back with useful feedback from Theresa."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength of this course is the approach it uses of discussing contemporary Germany through its media. However, we discussed so many different types of media that we didn't get to spend a lot of time on each one. It might have been better to focus on a few specific types of media. I also liked the integration of current events by watching Tagesschau at the beginning of every class. It was a good way to practice listening comprehension and keep up to date on the news.",
    "One strength is that the classes themselves are fairly fun. A major weakness is that after a semester I don't think I've really learned anything. It might be more useful to take an L5 class with a more in-depth theme.",
    "The strength of this course was the diversity of its materials, from blogs to novels to television to podcasts all being studied in the context of their form. The only weakness I can think of was that its pacing was perhaps a bit inconsistent, with some lessons having to be rushed or skipped over due to a backlog from prior weeks.",
    "Strengths: great breadth of content. Felt super woke coming out of this class. Theresa is super energetic and she makes the class fun :) it was helpful that she sent out weekly emails with our assignments and such. Weaknesses: we sped by some topics such as podcasting, and we didnt really discuss novels so much as just read one. Half the class seems to have read the assigned novel at some point in the past, which could be considered a good thing, but was also not as engaging for those students. it was assumed that we knew most grammar topics, and any new-ish ones were only briefly introduced. It became sort of apparent that some students, probs the heritage speakers and students fresh out of ap German, werent as familiar with the grammar topics that the class breezed by. Wish it was less assumed that we knew the more complex grammar, and perhaps we would have benefitted from some more practice. None of this really got in the way of the fun of class, though, so its all good.",
    "The course was really good at creating a atmosphere where people were comfortable just talking about stuff in German, which was good for improving my German skills. Maybe having some more grammar practice could have been useful, but its also L5, so thats not really a focus.",
    "Strengths: Theresa is always a fantastic instructor (this was my third class with her). She does her best to make sure no one's getting left behind, and is very good at designing courses so that the assignments don't become boring or repetitive. I really enjoyed having a variety of work, between the weekly homework assignments that alternated between spoken and written, the varied creative tasks, and the option to do something different with the final assignment. Weaknesses: The course could have been paced a bit differently. I think we got really bogged down in the unit about books, when we really only were reading excerpts of one novel. Also, sometimes it seemed that the course was too big to be able to actively volunteer\/participate.",
    "Strengths of the course was the use of different cultural topics and the use of different media to analyze and discuss. Group discussions in class were also a great way to learn. Weaknesses of the course was sometimes the material felt a bit disconnected.",
    "Strengths: the content is very interesting and relevant to today. The discussion format means that you'll get a lot of practice speaking and you'll definitely improve your speaking skills. The frequent writing assignments mean that your writing skills will also improve. Weaknesses: I would've liked to see just a bit more focus on grammar structures, since there are many that I still don't feel entirely comfortable with. However, this might just be a matter of needing to be exposed to the language more and more to get the structures ingrained, which I think the class did a good job at. Whether this is considered a weakness or not will depend on how important you find specific instruction on grammar structures vs. learning through exposure and use."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it offered a good way to work to fluency in German while focusing on interesting modern themes. The fact that we discussed current issues in Germany in addition to media offered a nice analysis of the current social and political state of the country. For students who are interested in discussing current events and social and political issues, all while improving their language skills, this is a great course.",
    "I wouldn't. Theresa's great but that's about it. You'd be better off taking another L5.",
    "This is a great course both for learning German and learning about contemporary Germany. It has a good mix of different types of media to practice with and study, and the assignments are creative without being too taxing.",
    "Yep! Theresa is a *fun* and intelligent instructor. Definitely take the class if its offered by her. Its a good way to brush up on your German skills if youre a bit rusty, and to take them to the next level if youre really focused on the class. Theres really a huge range of experience with the language across the students in the class, so its easy to feel comfortable in it. Per week I think I spent an hour on readings, an hour on a written\/spoken journal, plus a couple more hours whenever we had worksheets, a project, or a paper of sorts, so its a moderate workload class.",
    "Yes, Theresa is great and makes it a lot of fun, also your German gets better and you feel like you understand German life more.",
    "Yes, it gives good exposure to contemporary German and Germany.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students that want to deepen their German skills and knowledge of contemporary Germany.",
    "Yes, absolutely, especially if Theresa is teaching it. The material is super interesting, you'll improve your German, and the workload isn't unduly heavy -- it's just enough to make sure you're keeping your German up outside of class."
