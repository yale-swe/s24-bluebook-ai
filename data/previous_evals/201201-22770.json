    "This class centers around the papers submitted by students every week. The weeks when you have to write essays are really tough and require a ton from you, but it is quite rewarding. You'll obviously learn a lot in this class.",
    "Really, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. DO IT. You'll learn so much about international politics, strategic thinking, and human nature. Make sure you keep up with the reading, though!",
    "YES! Take this course. Learn from Kagan. Don't be that person who failed to take a Kagan class before graduating.",
    "Take it!",
    "This course is useful if you are interested in Greek political and military history from the end of the Peloponnesian War to 362. It will not cover social history and will barely touch on literature or philosophy. Also notable is the fact that there is no term paper in this seminar. Instead, you have two 6-7 pg reports, the topics of which are assigned to you, and a final exam. This means that the work is distributed throughout the semester rather than heavy towards the end, which is nice. It also means, however, that you never get to really try your own hand at tackling a topic of particular interest to you, and you are never required to go beyond the course readings. You receive no grades at all until you get your final grade for the course, which is frustrating for the more neurotic among us.",
    "This class, like all of Kagan's offerings, is among the best at Yale. While it suffers somewhat in comparison to his course on the Peloponnsian War (partly due to source quality and partly due to Kagan's unparalleled expertise on the Peloponnesian War), this is still an amazing history seminar that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in political or military history.",
    "The Spartan Hegemony was by far the best class I've taken at Yale. The course covers roughly forty years in the fourth century, relying on several primary accounts and some secondary works. You really learn how to be a historian: often the primary accounts disagree with each other and omit key details, so you have to decide based on context, knowing the writers, and contemporary observations which source was right. A source for my paper was a marble stele found outside Athens--so cool. The content aside, Professor Kagan makes the class incredible. He approaches the material with freshness and enthusiasm. He asks incisive questions that propel the discussion forward. And he really reflects on student comments--so open-minded that he changed his opinion on one debate after the class discussion. Plus, he has a brilliant sense of humor. Believe the praise you read about Kagan: he's the real deal and even better in seminar than lecture. Take this class."
