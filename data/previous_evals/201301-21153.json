   "comments": [
    "I would summarize the course as a THOROUGH introduction to the socio-political, economic, and religious factors that were at play in Vietnam during the 20th Century. If one wants to understand what has brought Vietnam to the point that it is today, this is the right course.I would also advise another student that this course is very intensive - the workload was quite large at times and the weightiness of the papers we wrote was hard to juggle with other courses at times.I would absolutely advise this course for another student interested in Vietnam. Without question, I will take much from this course in my understanding of Vietnam, as well as its geo-political relevance in Southeast Asia.",
    "History 851 provides good coverage of the history of modern Vietnam. Highly recommended for students whose research interest includes Vietnam. Because it focuses so much on content rather than transferable historical research or reading skills, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who does not know anything about the country."

   "comments": [
    "It very greatly deepened my knowledge and I believe it has significantly aided me in my orals preparation.",
    "I had always considered Vietnam a topic that was almost too complex to approach. This course has unravelled it so that I can think of the recent history of the country constructively. I believe that an understanding of modern Vietnam is essential to an understanding of US history after the Cold War, as well as Southeast Asian history. I am thoroughly satisfied with the understanding I take with me as a result of taking this course.",
    "This course did not contribute to my dissertation research since I am not working on Vietnam but it plugged the gaps in my historiographical knowledge of the Southeast Asian region."
