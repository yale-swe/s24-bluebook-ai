    "This is a weekly 2-hr seminar, with the first hour a lecture (technically supposed to be on books we have read, usually something completely unrelated to course material), and the second hour a presentation from a prominent researcher in the field of ethnography.I would not recommend this class, simply because you could drop in to any one seminar where the speaker was of particular interest to you. Eli Anderson also is a difficult professor to take a class with, because though he knows a lot about ethnography, he gives students very little space to talk about the issues at hand, instead repeatinga few sound-bites week after week and telling tangential stories about his life (very, very long stories). I would not recommend taking a class with him, as I have heard Ethnography of Af Am is similar.",
    "A series of speakers who have either conducted ethnographic sociological research or who have engaged with issues of race (and class and gender) in the United States. The reading is terrific almost without exception, but it is only sporadically assigned. Some speakers are more interesting than others. I would have wished for more opportunities to workshop pieces in progress."

    "I am not a graduate student, but I think that the presentations from researchers in the field were very helpful in deepening my knowledge of urban ethnography.",
    "I didn't learn much about how to do ethnography in this course. I did, however, acquire a lot of important and relatively esoteric knowledge about race, education, and discrimination in America."
