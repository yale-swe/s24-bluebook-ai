   "comments": [
    "Teaches the basics but you need to do the work on your own",
    "worse class i have ever taken and i went to almost every class. not worth my time. no one goes to class",
    "No.",
    "No. I know that many of you will end up taking it regardless of all the negative responses that you will see here, but the responses are all true so don't have high expectations.",
    "Accounting 170 is very cut and dry. You know exactly what you're going to get based on the textbook. We don't talk about much other than what is in the textbook. There is a problem set due every class, which is a lot of work. You end up teaching yourself a lot of the material in this class by doing the problem sets.",
    "Not the most exciting class. The textbook is pretty good to learn from though. There are definitely a lot of useful concepts to learn if you are interested in finance. Open book tests, and electronically submitted homework that usually takes an hour at most.",
    "You can definitely learn this on your own-the textbook is good. It's pretty boring, and not many people go to class. It's not hard (homeworks for credit, tests open book sometimes notes). You should CR\/D\/F it, and it will be very easy.",
    "Problem sets 2x a week are rough",
    "Its ok for practical purposes, since those are rarely considered at Yale. Take credit\/d or don't at all.",
    "If you were really motivated, you could learn this on your own pretty easily, but the class is nice if you want a structured way of incentivising yourself to learn about accounting. Being able to read financial statements is a a basic tool anyone thinking of entering the business world should have. Taking this class also works as a decent signal to employers that you're interested in going into business\/finance.",
    "The material taught in ACCT 170 is definitely useful. If you have studied accounting before, the course is not too difficult. However, the exams, despite being open book\/notes, can be tricky. You might get tested on material not covered in class or in the book. Also the midterm is work 40% of the grade while the final is 50%, so if you screw these up, its hard to get a good grade. The classes can be rather boring and I often had a hard time convincing myself to go to class at 9 in the morning.",
    "Don't take it until they change the curriculum\/instructor.",
    "A brief into to accounting. Course is poorly structured and taught. Kind of helpful in that it gives you a bit of a structure to lean this stuff.",
    "best credit d at yale. learn as much as you want to",
    "Horrible class. Teacher didn't care about it. Homeworks were ungraded and the midterm was a random multiple choice in order to make the correction less work. You learn as much as you want to. You teach the course to yourself from the textbook",
    "The material is interesting, and it is a pretty useful course in general.",
    "No, waste of time. Better off just getting the book and teaching yourself.",
    "If you are thinking at all about working in any pre-professional field, I highly recommend taking this course. This course covers all the basics of financial accounting, and is especially useful for those considering entering the financial sector -- a lot of the stuff covered in the course is tested through i-banking case interviews. Professor Schiffres is a friendly, accessible professor, and the course overall is very laid-back -- it's a great 5th or Cred\/D course.",
    "Great course that gives you the fundamentals you'll need for accounting. Definitely take this if you have interviews (internship or otherwise) coming up. For juniors, I would take this in the fall. The exams aren't too hard - open book, notes, etc... Overall, not too difficult of a course.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about the materials. It's a good way to make yourself learn.",
    "Accounting 101",
    "Easy introduction to accounting.At this point, the course has serious flaws. I would recommend taking it to put on a resume if you're pursuing a finance oriented career, but I would not recommend taking it for a grade."
