    "The professor is great, and the class activities encourage creativity. Most people speak Spanish well, so things move fairly quickly. There's a heavy focus on speaking and basic vocabulary in the first semester so this may not help you very much if you just want to read Portuguese. More work than intro Spanish, but you turn in homework a few days at a time, so it's manageable.",
    "Yes I would recommend. The prove is that after only 4 months, i can speak and understand portuguese.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone with a solid background in another Romance language and looking to add another language to their repertoire (or are going to Brazil\/Portugal).",
    "Yes - I would recommend Tania as a professor. She is very patient and the steady amount of work really forces you to get into the language daily.",
    "Yes, it's definitely the best way to learn Portuguese if you have previous experience in a romance language. Don't cop out and take 110."
