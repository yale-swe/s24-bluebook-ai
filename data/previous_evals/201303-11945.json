    "This was a good class for those who want a low stress environment to read and write Portuguese. It could have been more intensive for the sake of language, but the class is as serious as you make it. If you really read and studied the readings for vocabulary and wrote the essays for more than completion, you can take away a lot.",
    "Take it. A fantastic way to hone your skills, learn about Brazilian history and culture, and have fun.",
    "It's the only L5 Portuguese class, so if you want to keep studying the language you kind of have to take it. You do interesting readings and there is time for discussion so you practice speaking. Overall, good class.",
    "I would definitely recommend L5 Portuguese with Marta. She's an excellent professor and it was a great way to keep up with my portuguese. The class was not too difficult but actually was more work than I was expecting. But at the end of the day, Marta is just so awesome you gotta take the class for her.",
    "pretty small class so great opportunity to practice your speaking. also a good cultural overview brazil. definitely recommend."
