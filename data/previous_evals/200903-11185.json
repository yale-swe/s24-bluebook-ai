    "This was a time-consuming elective, but rewarding. Do not take it as \"one more\" elective. Take it because you like the material and the teaching style, because you will ut in no small amount of effort.",
    "A good, solid introduction to an important modern field, and a fun way to practice basic quantum algebra. Long problem sets.",
    "Strongly recommended:The class covers basic topic of atomic physics, but actually it contains a lot of application of quantum mechanics at advanced level.Therefore, this class is useful also for students whose research topic is not atomic physics."

    "Time was limited and the class only covered basic topics but it helped me prepare basis for my research. Physics is a subject where basic knowledge applies to a wide range of application. So, this class was very helpful in that sense.",
    "Taught me about atoms--gateway to the quantum world. The only way to understand QM is through a thorough examination of its most fertile playground: the atomic realm."
