    "Yes I would",
    "dont take it. Maria Pinango is meandering and often incomprehensible. It's virtually zero work (just pass-fail homeworks every week and easy tests) and an easy A, but you'll come out of the semester having learned nothing but how to make sentence trees. Really, don't take it. Take another linguistics course instead.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend taking it. In general, I found myself spacing out and disengaged. It's not incredibly hard to do well, though, and the work isn't too intense.",
    "This course forces you to erase what you thought you knew about English structure and grammar and start from scratch, learning the structures of language and understanding the methods of proving that these structures in the process. The class is very interesting but can also be very confusing and it difficult to study for tests at times. I would recommend this class for people interested in the linguistics major.",
    "VERY difficult course but the grading is not terrible. IF you put in a lot of extra work then it will be okay but if you do not plan on putting in extra work and time then this class will be terrible. You cannot skip lectures because you will instantly be lost.",
    "This is a very difficult question, as someone who once thought they'd be a linguistics major (and still is kind of considering it). Take this class if you think that you are interested in linguistics VERY much, but don't expect much of the mind to show up in the course. If you just want the linguistics, take Intro to Ling, and if you want the mind, take into to CogSci or Neuroscience.... But still, this was a good class. I recommend shopping it for a bit to see if it's right for you.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is a basic linguistics class, and I think that there are better classes out there that teach the same information.",
    "If you are interested in CogSci, do not take this class. This is an introduction to linguistics. And on top of that, all of the things that we learned this semester were confusing and not clearly taught. The grading is relatively easy but lectures are very difficult to get through. I would not recommend this class.",
    "This was a terrible class. I don't feel like I got much of anything out of it. Professor Pinango was terribly unorganized. If she is teaching it, I wouldn't take it. I can only image the class would be better with a different teacher.",
    "It's a complete gut. Homework is graded pass\/fail. It's very easy to get 100% on exams since the maximum number of points you can earn is fewer than the number of points on the exam. For example, atest could have 30 points with a maximum score of 25 (you can miss 5 points and still get 100%). There are 3 exams (including the final). DON'T take it. The class is a mess. It's disorganized and frustrating because people ask too many useless questions during lecture. As a result, the professor never got through the material. I became frustrated because there were so many inconsistencies. The professor would say one thing one day, and then change her mind the next day.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. If you're interested in psychology, be warned that this course covers psychology in only the loosest sense.",
    "I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS. Only take if you need it as a requirement or you're an over eager freshman who thinks that this kind of non-teaching \"teaching\" is cool and new and you're too young to realize what a complete turd of a class this is.",
    "It's an interesting course. It gets a little technical which was not cool with me because I wasn't really interested in learning the technicalities of linguistics, just the theoretical stuff and how it connects to the brain. Unfortunately, this class is more language than brain heavy which was a little disappointing. The tests aren't too difficult.",
    "I would, if that student is patient.",
    "I absolutely do NOT recommend this course. This was one of the worst classes that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever taken. The material seemed to be amorphous, as she would rarely give concrete definitions or explanations of concepts. Most students in the class were confused the majority of the time. In addition, the professor would regularly contradict both herself and the TA with regard to material, which was quite frustrating. The organization of the class was horrendous; we were repeatedly given questions on homeworks that covered concepts not discussed at all in class, and the same was true of the study guides. The professor and TA were also incredibly inefficient with regard to grading, as it would take weeks to get homeworks returned, and neither of our two tests was returned in less than three weeks (even though there were only around 30 kids in the class). The professor neglected to upload the study guide for the final exam until the day before the test, and her TA, in our section three days before the final, said that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know which topics the exams would cover. Even students in the class who want to major in linguistics disliked the style of the class. It was a roller-coaster ride of a semester in this class, and I do not think that most people would enjoy it. If you are dead-set on taking a linguistics course, I would recommend taking one with a different professor.",
    "If you have a strong interest in language and you think you have a strong intuition for language\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the mechanics of languages come easily to you\u00e2\u0080\u0094I strongly recommend this course. However, keep in mind that you have to wade through quite a bit to get to the point where you feel \"fulfilled.\"",
    "I really loved this class and it has gotten me interested in Cognitive Science and pursuing this kind of material for my major - but that was me. Professor Pinango doesn't explicitly explain everything youneed to study and learn... The material is sort of \"vague\", and she lets you struggle with the ideas and asks you to think deeply about the relationships between language and human conceptual thought. If you're interested in the material, then the class is great - the exams aren't difficult, the homework assignments are just graded for completion (but you'll want to do it well to learn the material), and lecture is interesting and you'll want to go every time. However, if you're NOT that into this stuff... I can see how the class could be irritating and too ambiguous, and worrying about your grade wouldn't be fun. A lot of students in the class didn't like Professor Pinango's teaching, but I think that if you DO like it, you will really like it. So just shop the first couple lectures, pay attention to her, and you'll get an idea of the lecture style and see if it's for you.",
    "For those wishing to learn the practical parts of linguistics, I highly recommend taking LING117 over the other introduction course. LING117 can be complicated at times, but if you ask the right questions, everything will make sense. The tests are also graded very fairly.",
    "I would summarize it as an interesting class that was thought-provoking but not as useful as I had hoped in terms of providing a foundation of knowledge for further classes in linguistics or psychology\/cognitive science.",
    "Run awayyyy. This class is boring and confusing and stupid.",
    "Linguistics 117 was an interesting course that probably requires a different type of learning approach since lectures are not structured and there is no textbook to follow. Expect more linguistics than neuroscience."
