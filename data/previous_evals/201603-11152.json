Professors also worked well with each other and their understanding of each other made the class flow very smoothly. Weaknesses: only that discussion sometimes lulled. This seminar should be more selective.",
    "I can't think of any blatant weaknesses. Maybe the weekly film time being at an inconvenient time?",
    "Having two professors was a great aspect of the course and listening to their discourse was fantastic. the films we watched seemed like very poor and disengaging choices when we consider the literature provided."
