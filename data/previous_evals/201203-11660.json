   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to an incoming freshman. Although it may seem like it begins slowly, I realize that I have learned so much from this course. The topics definitely reinforced my passion for the natural sciences, and the professor is extremely interested in students' successes.",
    "This course is very heavy on the microbiology. You will learn a lot of terms for receptors you didn't even know existed. If you're a humanities-oriented person (like me), this can be a little frustrating sometimes, especially because the discussions of social issues, such as the ones on Henrietta Lacks and polio, are a lot more broad. But I'm still glad I took this course. I really did learn a lot, even if I won't remember the difference between Toll-like receptors and PAMP and MHC I vs. MHC II.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Dr. Kavathas is a great teacher, and you'll definitely learn a ton of material. In addition, the classroom environment isn't extremely stressful and learning with the class and Dr. Kavathas is enjoyable.",
    "The subject material for the course is pretty awesome, though I was sad to find out that it was a science course for non-majors, so it was not as intense as I hoped it would be. Overall though, there is a short paper (3 pages), a final paper (5-7 pages), and a few books to read, so its not bad at all. Take it if you want a nice intro to Immunology with an overview of a few microbes.",
    "I think that if you have no background in the field, and even if you're not a science major, this class is accessible and useful. However, for people looking to gain a really deep understanding into the field, this course might not be as useful; in a sense, it felt a bit like a survey course, although it went into a little more depth than regular survey courses do.",
    "It says it's not for science majors, but it is for science majors. If you are a non-science major, like I was, you'll find the material challenging. Still, this class isn't very hard (in terms of grading and assessments), so you can still do well, and you'll learn a lot more than in classes that are actually for non-science majors. It's a really fun class and she's a great professor; I would cautiously take it if you're a non-science major and definitely take it if you are a science major.",
    "MCDB 050 is an awesome class. As someone with no bio background, there was a steep learning curve. I honestly felt like I knew nothing every day when I left classes at the beginning of the semester, but I was interested in science and stuck with it. One day things just started to click and as the semester progressed I actually felt like I learned a few concrete facts that helped me in my other classes and that I could use to better understand viruses and immunology as a whole. The workload is light to average. There are a few problem sets at the beginning of the year and then it transitions into reading novels and discussing them in class. THe novels are quick easy reads that can be completed in a couple of nights if you're dilligent. Most nights there was no homework, and if you ever had a problem printing something orgetting it done right before class, Professor Kavathas was willing to let you turn it in when you got back to your room. There were no exams and for me at least, this low pressure situation actually made me want to learn more because I wasn't so concerned about being right as I was about acquiring new knowledge and trying to understand and simplify it in my own way. Our class got really close and shared a lot of laughs. I'd highly recommend the freshman seminar program. Professor Kavathas made this class very enjoyable. She's a little intimidating until you get to know her but once you do she's really sweet and helpful. She took us out for pizza to BAR and held a movie night where we got to watch Contagion. She took us to her lab down at the med school and let us look inside mice that one of her RA's was working with. She gave us all little heart-shaped chocolates at the end of the class in individual bags and hugged us as we were walking out the door. I will miss having this class as part of my week. Take it.",
    "This course is definitely a course you can take if you are slightly interested about the immune system. It is a course that covers all of the immune system as well as diseases and epidemics. It's really a fun class with not a lot of workload. I recommend this class to all freshman interested in the immune system."
