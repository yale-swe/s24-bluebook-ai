   "comments": [
    "I learned about the language of Old English, including vocabulary and grammar. I also learned a bit of history of the region, and about the literature (prose and poetry) styles of Old English.",
    "I learned Old English well enough that I look at Beowulf and realize that I know a lot of the words and could read it easily with a glossary. Also I look at English totally differently now.",
    "A lot of the class was direct translation, but it was really interesting seeing where different words and phrases come from and how English has evolved over time.",
    "This course was a great introduction to the academic process of translating old texts with a gloss. It was also a great introduction into the history of the period.",
    "I learned to read Old English literature.",
    "Learned a lot about Old English literature and English history. Learned how Old English works as a language, how to transcribe Old English texts, and how the language has evolved over time. We read\/transcribe a decent amount of literature in class and also get to discuss the readings and the background behind them.",
    "I learned how to translate old English texts and I learned about the history of the Anglo Saxons.",
    "I learned a lot about the language, as well as about grammar and how to translate.",
    "I not only learned some of the basic dialect of Old English, but gained an understanding and greater appreciation for Modern English and its origins.",
    "I developed much knowledge regarding the intricacies of the Old English knowledge and how to apply certain fundamental rules to translation of Old English passages. This skill has helped me feel much more confident in translation\/analysis of Old English texts. Further, we learned a great deal about the culture and traditions of Anglo-Saxon England. Much of these were revealed through analysis of texts and through our discussions in class.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and culture of Medieval England. I also learned about the type of analysis that can be done on a historical level. I started thinking about words in terms of the multiple meanings over time, and how words could be brought in by people and cultures and changed based on circumstance. I started to become immersed in and fascinated with literary theory and criticism.",
    "Prof. Frank's course was an exciting and whirlwind overview of Old English literature we learned a new grammar, vocabulary, and system of pronunciation within a matter of weeks, and it felt extremely gratifying to go directly from that to reading Old English texts in the original. The work of translation could often be demanding, but Prof. Frank maintained a lively and invigorating class atmosphere; it was a joy to study with her."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were the translations and seminar style. I really enjoyed learning the grammar and reading the pieces. However, two weaknesses were that I felt I didn't get enough credit for doing the translations (reading just two sentences out of 50 is frustrating), and the final exam relied a little too much on knowing a lot of random Old English words or memorizing entire pieces of literature, neither of which had been expected before.",
    "I think it would be great if we did more than go over translations in class",
    "I think it is a very well taught course. I especially enjoyed the final project because it gave me an opportunity to do something creative that pushed me to really learn about Old English poetic meter, vocabulary, alliteration, and writing. The translations took me a lot of time for each class, but were thoroughly enjoyable. I'm not sure if it has any weaknesses. I don't think vocab lists of quizzes would have helped me.",
    "More time could be spent on conjugations and roots, that would be helpful.",
    "This was an excellent course!",
    "You get to decide how much effort you put into the class and how much you get out of it with little effect on your grade.",
    "Strengths: interesting discussion of the content of the texts we read, great for people who are fascinated by linguistics and linguistic anthropology Weaknesses: I wish we could have learned more history to complement the translations. It would have contextualized what we were working on.",
    "The workload for the course is very highly concentrated in translations, which take an extremely long time to do and aren't for a grade. If there was a way to shorten the amount of time spent on translations, or to make them more important to the class, that would be nice. It was also hard early-on to tell what we were supposed to be gleaning from the readings. The workload was pretty steady over the course of the semester, however. And the presentation portion was fun and informative.",
    "The course's weakness is the repetitive translations that are done each class. Since we are permitted to use online translators and must bring our translations to class, the translations in class are redundant and do little to bolster knowledge of the language. However, I do not advocate making this process more difficult, as this is only one semester to familiarize oneself with a language. Therefore, I recommend that this course focus more on the history of Old English, with learning the language as a secondary element.",
    "A strength is the pacing of the course. It is paced well so that we can learn the vocabulary and translation skills within the early weeks of the course, followed by progressively more challenging passages as the course neared its end. I feel that the pacing was at a good rate such that most of the class could engage in the course well and enjoy the discussion\/translations. One weakness might be the lack of online assignments\/due dates, but it was easy to refer to the Syllabus regarding weekly assignments (such as readings\/translations).",
    "This course has taught me so much about different ways of read, think about, discuss, and view poetry. I especially appreciated Professor Norths essay prompts, which were major learning experiences for me. I dont know if theres necessarily a way for the course to be improved. I did like the bits of literary theory that we readI would like a little more theory or introduction to texts like Aurora Leigh and Ondaatje. Otherwise I really loved how the other texts spoke to each other.",
    "Strengths an excellent professor, a comprehensive but manageable workload, and the opportunity to read a set of texts that have mostly vanished from many English curricula. There were very few weaknesses, but if I had to say maybe one I wish we had been able to devote a little bit more time to discussion of the texts we translated, especially poems such as The Wanderer and Dream of the Rood. Prof. Frank has such a wealth of knowledge about this material, and I would have loved to see it come through even more in a full-fledged seminar discussion."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Old English.",
    "The final is shockingly hard compared to the rest of the class, however the class is overall very relaxed.",
    "I would recommended it very much especially if you are passionate about medieval history, Northern European mythology, linguistics, the material history of books and manuscripts, or Tolkien. Its a shame that Professor Frank is retiring. She was truly wonderful. Your life will never be the same after translating the Wanderer.",
    "I would. It was a very relaxed class with a friendly professor and students that were genuinely interested in the history of the subject. This made the class enjoyable.",
    "Yes, the material is fun, and gives some good perspectives on how English functions in both prose and verse.",
    "If you are genuinely interested in Old English literature, yes!",
    "Yes, it is very fun and very interesting and Professor Frank is an absolute sweetheart who knows a ton of cool things about Anglo-Saxon England.",
    "Yes! The content of the course is fascinating, but the real reason I would recommend it is because Prof. Frank is such a phenomenal teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a different type of learning than many other English courses, so it's a great way to fulfill an English\/humanities credit. I would make sure to communicate with the professor early on and often about how your grade is, though, because it can sometimes feel overwhelming, or like you're not doing well, even when you are.",
    "This course will teach you Old English for translation purposes but also provide cool insights into the culture and development of Old English. Plus, if it is being taught by Prof. Frank, you will learn a great deal from the professor's mini lectures at the beginning of each class. Through each text we read, Prof. Frank brought up clear insights and analysis. While we were often focused on translation alone, Prof. Frank helped make the texts more engaging.",
    "This course is amazing! Please take it! You will learn so much not only about the language, but also the culture and history of medieval England. You get to translate and read works written very long ago, by people with some vastly different worldviews that still remain relevant.",
    "Absolutely! Especially if you're considering English grad school or work with ancient English texts, this class provides a language-learning opportunity that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. The workload is manageable, and the class is refreshingly free of the mild bs-ing that so often appears in English courses: partly because it's heavily focused on language learning, and partly because many people from outside the major take it, and bring really fascinating, different perspectives on the material."
