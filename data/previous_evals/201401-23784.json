    "I thought the topics we did cover were covered well. However, some topics were left off the list.",

   "comments": [
    "The heavy reliance on technology (IPAD, laptop) withouth fully understanding how those technological systems work definitely put a hamper on the flow of the class. However, maybe that is a function of getting older and not using that technology regularly. The presentation of the material would improve with technological savvy.",
    "Guest lecturers were particularly awesome!",
    "Some of the classes were excellent. Vicki Peterson was interesting. Trucking, transferring a show was informative. The leadership traits lecture felt fluffy and impractical. Budgeting and scheduling was a strong lecture. A lot of the other content I feel could be condensed. Some of the the technical supervision stuff was covered in commercial scenery almost to the exact word. The powerpoints sometimes seem to slow down the presentation of information.",

   "comments": [
    "We had four major assignments spread across the semester. They were relatively equally spread out and the workload was just right.",
    "It was an appropriate quantity, but it was difficult to get engaged in it because it felt like busy work. There were not enough guidelines or not enough freedom - somewhere in the middle, it felt like there was no chance of making an accurate load-in calendar for an actual production, nor did it feel like it was useful to make an inaccurate calendar just for the practice of making one.",
    "Nothing too daunting, generally we'll-spread across the semester. Sometimes more tedious than educational but generally fine."

  {
   "question_id": "DR381",
   "question_text": "How useful were assignments in furthering an understanding of the topic?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt that areas we did cover were excellent-- union labor, touring, and comprehensive and consecutive assignments dealing with the same show. However, I feel that we did not speak much to regional theater, nor integrate what is happening at Yale with the coursework. Connecting what we learn in class with how things are done at Yale would be beneficial moving forward.",
    "The assignments fell somewhere in between too vague to be practical, and too tricky to get correct. This is an industry which relies heavily on precedent, and not having examples of this precedent, or stricter guidelines, made it difficult to accomplish. Further more, because it was so abstracted, the assignments didn't feel like practice for future work, EVEN if that future work was as a technical supervisor. It would be good to tailor the calendars and schedules to something we will use, and maybe have a separate assignment to understand the IATSE contract. The OneNote assignment was very practical to production work! And it was surprisingly helpful to see how our classmates used it.",
    "The projects were done in too much of a vacuum. Despite receiving information about an actual show, there were too many variables we had to make up to complete the projects. It felt like more of an exercise in spreadsheet and calendar formatting than manipulating accurate data.",
    "Useful, in that now I have labor-tracking spreadsheets (mine and my classmates') to use in future. Stage Use was pretty tedious, since it was mostly rehashing and data entry, but I get why we did it. The OneNote assignment was an utter waste - would love to see this the way we did videoconferencing\/whatever in Digital Tech last year, where we have options to present on other alternatives, and their pros\/cons.",
    "It's hard to budget a show we know that little about. Maybe we should do the assignment for Rep shows? Not sure, but it was hard to connect the dots."

Something that we do not do particularly well at the Drama School is efficiently track labor. I believe the spreadsheet I made will make that task easier.",
    "Some parts yes - labor spreadsheet, etc - some parts I don't remember. Wider industry perspective is one of the more valuable takeaways, especially through the visiting lecturers, though it's not directly relevant to production work."

   "comments": [
    "I think that this course should be more integrated with the weekly, monthly, and yearly workings of the production department at the Drama School\/Rep. Namely understanding how the artistic costs of a show interface with production costs. Another good idea would be to develop actual labor costs for shows at the Drama school, rather than ignoring labor in reconciliations (which is often the most expensive component). I feel that all things considered, there is not as much emphasis put on regional theater and educational models as their could be. The focus is heavily on professional\/Broadway, which is likely a market that many of us will not work in. Additionally, I think there is a lot of merit to having the professor of the course be working currently in the field. With the rapidity of change in the industry, staying relevant is important as an educational tool. I believe that because this course has to deal with a lot of constantly changing industry parameters, staying current is crucial to teach this subject matter as well.",
    "Mostly see above. The stuff in classes v2 resources is great - I'd love to see a wider spread of examples stolen\/donated from other sources for comparison.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and felt like there was good information and that the instructor was well informed and knowledgeable; however, what we were covered in class seemed to be less planned out. The guest speakers were great and their information seemed appropriate but sometimes there did not seem to be an order to which we were seeing them. It felt like if a guest lecturer could come then we will learn about what they have to talk about, but there didn't seem to be an order of information that flowed throughout the class."
