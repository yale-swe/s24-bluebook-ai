   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class but this is not the typical art history class so make sure you know what you're getting yourself into if you choose to take this class.",
    "Take it if you are interested in exploring a very specific area of art history. It's a big time commitment - 2 field trips on weekends and a very lengthy paper but worthwhile!",
    "Take the course only if you're interested in the subject--the class can get a little monotonous in terms of structure. However, those with interest will find this course rewarding.",
    "If you're passionate about Dutch painting, you can get a lot out of the final paper. I certainly learned a lot. I'm not sure I'd recommend the class otherwise. I felt very uncomfortable at points with the amounts of privilege and wealth that this class seemed to breathe.",
    "I am not sure this course will ever be taught again, but it is an intensive study of 17th Century Dutch painting taught by one of the leading experts in the field. You will get to know the paintings of the so-called Great Masters while becoming an expert on one particular painting that you will research and present to the class. This is a terrific class for you if you are truly dedicated to the study of art history, because in many ways it exposes you more than any other course to what that field actually looks like. In the two field trips we went onto Boston and to New Yorkwe were able to meet curators, conservationists, private collectors, and art dealers. This gave me a much better sense of the art world and the people involved in the work of an art historian. Even if you do not have a particular inclination for 17th Century Dutch painting in particular, I highly recommend this course if you are dedicated to being an art historian or to leading a life deeply involved with art in some capacity.",
    "This is a full tour of 17th C Dutch Art which starts out slow but culminates in a thorough (25-30 page) research paper. Recommended if you would like to get a taste of not only this art, but also a different perspective on the art and museum world.",
    "Only for upper-level art history majors or humanities majors with extensive background in the arts. Workload is larger than any class I've had purely from the final paper."
