    "Yes, solid class",
    "Very interesting class if you're interested in how states compete for power or end up fighting one another. It covers the basics and sometimes more of subjects like nuclear weapons, insurgency, terrorism, and numerous theories about the interaction of states. KEY: If you are interested in theory, or do not mind the significant amount of reading required to understand it, this is a perfect class. I'm not a huge theory buff, but I enjoyed the class nonetheless. Such an interest would just have made it easier. The class is almost entirely theory, with a little bit of empirical support inserted when helpful. The tests are structured to make sure students read and go to class, and are very manageable if you've done both. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "This is a great class for political science and international studies majors because it is all about applying theory to current and past situations.",
    "This course is very interesting and essential for this day and age. It helps the student understand many different points of view in the world of security.",
    "I would recommend this class to fulfill a Political Science requirement and if you are looking for an interesting class relating to war.",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Kocher is interesting and knows a lot about the subject he teaches. While very few people actually come to lecture, you will be rewarded greatly on the midterm (choose 6 out of 10 basic short answers\/ID's) and the final (essay format). They are solely lecture- and reading-based. From what I heard and experienced, both TF's were excellent. There are 2 short papers, a midterm, and a final, so this class is perfect for the person who needs a non-seminar class that is still very interesting.",
    "if interested in political science - it is definately a class to take.",
    "If Kocher gets better TAs this course would be fabulous, but the TAs ruined it for me.",
    "yes, easy poli sci credit",
    "Take this class! It is a great way to analyze international affairs and really adds to one's cognitive abilities in political science.",
    "recommend it",
    "Yes I would recommend this class for a Political Science major",
    "An alright class about fairly interesting material. If the course was taught differently I think it could have been a much better course.",
    "Good class for people interested in IR.",
    "Overall, this was a surprisingly worthwhile class. The professor isn't terribly engaging, but he gets the material across concisely and fully. He mostly sticks to his powerpoint, which in turn often summarizes the readings. Thus, you really don't have to do the reading in order to fully appreciate the course.As for the material itself, it was a very broad and wide ranging selection of subjects. The reading, if you choose to do it is actually quite interesting and manageable. However, the range of opinion isn't terribly diverse.This makes a great introductory course to the material. If you already know quite a bit about international security, then I would suggest taking a more specific course."
