   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "In this course, I learned how to do a close reading of a text. I learned how to effectively annotate a source, and how to better analyze the information I was given. I also learned how to write a clear, concise thesis.",
    "Deeper reading--looking below just the text to see what techniques Austen employs.",
    "The curriculum and material encouraged us to become more perceptive readers and more inquisitive writers. After taking this course I am much more comfortable reading a substantial chunk of text--and subsequently discussing it--than I was before (was slightly daunted at the beginning of the semester). Our exploration of all of Austen's novels also allowed me to consider intertextual questions in more depth.",
    "The most important part of this class for me was being able to make comparisons between different Austen novels and see the trends in her work as a whole. This experience changed the way I read old favorites, like Pride and Prejudice, and helped me to understand Austen as a growing writer.",
    "Besides reading basically every work of fiction written by Jane Austen, you will also improve your skills of close reading and scholarly literary analysis.",
    "I learned about the different ways Austen employed the Bildungs and courtship plots in her novels as well as how she characterized her heroines, structured her plots, and used humor and language in general. The feedback on my writing helped be to better structure my arguments, and from class discussions I learned how to read and analyze literature more effectively.",
    "I learned how to more critically analyze texts.",
    "I think my writing and critical evaluation skills greatly improved in this course due to the discussion-based nature of the class and the professor's excellent comments on our essays. It was really interesting to read an author's entire canon of work as we did in this Jane Austen Seminar and I think I gained an appreciation for how various texts can relate to each other and how to track an author's development over time.",
    "I learned how to look at the work of one novel across multiple works.",
    "I learned to read prose critically, to analyze an author's entire body of work in relation to each other, and to manage a heavy reading load.",
    "My close reading skills have improved so much by taking this class. Though familiar with close reading before, the essays and discussion in this class really pushed me to think about the historical context of the words being used in passages, the effect of specific punctuation, the use of words elsewhere in the text and what that said about their use in certain passages, and the many various ways in which a single sentence could be read. My writing has also become much more concise and clear. In essays I was pushed to strive for both style and straightforwardness. I was pushed to go beyond the structure of a traditional five paragraph essay and think of the body of an essay more as a logical journey in which you developed ideas and perhaps ended in a different place then where you began as opposed to a succession of points ending in a conclusion that rehashed and overstated a previously determined thesis.",
    "Besides the opportunity to read fundamental texts, this class cultivated skills of critical thinking and reading as well as synthesis of texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I love Jane Austen, and I thought the material was very well taught. I wish we would have had more time to look more at writing methods and categories. I felt that there was a lot of assumed prior knowledge that I didn't have. Maybe if there were more secondary sources\/handouts in addition to the reading (pertaining to bildungsroman plot, philosophers, etc).",
    "Overall, the course is very strong. The only specific suggestion I have is to make the online posting more interactive between students. Perhaps Professor Markovits could pose specific questions each week and students could consider and discuss them online before class?",
    "We did move very quickly, of course. There was always more to say about every novel. But there was incredible value in being able to read every work and discuss long-term trends.",
    "Strengths: Class was fun, as it was centered on discussions about the books we were reading. There was a good selection of supplementary material such as critical readings of Mansfield Park, fanfic, and we also watched Clueless. Weaknesses: Reading load is pretty intense, especially if you've never read Jane Austen.",
    "Though the reading assignments can be ponderous, they are balanced well throughout the course so that it is easy to follow a routine to finish each portion on time. The blog posts can also feel superfluous, but I did find that they gave me a reason to think about each book on a deeper level before going to class. Including movie adaptations of a few of the novels on the syllabus was a really fun way to discuss how other have interpreted the novels.",
    "The grading is very fair, but the workload is heavy.",
    "I thought this course was very strong. I really enjoyed going to class every day because Professor Markovits was such an engaging and exciting professor. Topics came up in discussion that really interested me and I realized so many things that I had completely missed during the initial reading. I took this course because I had read Pride and Prejudice and I was interested in reading more Jane Austen. I was slightly nervous that I would grow bored of Austen overtime but instead, I came out of this course with her as my favorite author. Professor Markovits was excellent about getting everyone to speak during discussion, even though some students were nervous at first about speaking. She listened to every idea and found a way to always keep the discussion moving forward but also let it be driven by the students. Overall, she was my favorite professor that I have ever had at Yale.",
    "The course is extremely well structured, thanks to Austen's works fitting into a semester very well. I also really appreciated the time we had to look at literary criticism and film. The highlight of the course was Professor Markovits in her ability to make us see new ideas and structures within and between the texts, and get everyone to participate.",
    "I LOVED this class. The discussions were always really interesting and well-moderated and I feel like I learned a lot. My only possible complaint is that I wish the class had been a tiny bit smaller, since it was about as large as a seminar can possibly be (seriously, we were squished around the table). Nothing to really do about that, though, because I wouldn't want to reduce the number of students who can take it.",
    "This class has a very high reading load. While I really enjoyed this I wonder if it would be possible to more carefully balance the reading load given the number of days between meeting classes. For example though classes met on Mondays and Wednesdays the same number of pages would be assigned for the Monday to Wednesday space (3 days) as the Wednesday to the following Monday class (6 days). If there would be a way to proportion the reading slightly more to acknowledge this difference in the amount of time I think that would help ease the load. That being said one of the main strengths of this course is the fact that we read the entire Austen cannon. Being so well versed in one author is a really unique experience and it feels amazing to be able to make references between the different books. Classtime was rife with close reading which at times could feel a little exhausting, but I was led to see a lot more meaning in things that if I had been reading by myself I might've just passed by quickly. I think we could've been encouraged even more to interact with each others posts, maybe by requiring that we reference each other's posts or write a response for a certain number of our posts, or by requiring that we comment on a certain number of other people's posts. I also think that the Mansfield Park critiques required more time to sort through. They took a long time to read and though I enjoyed them a lot I found myself more confused than elucidated by our hasty discussion of them. (However, I was surprised and pleased at the effectiveness with which this class generally managed to make sure we had good discussions about other major chunks of texts--something I have struggled with in other classes that demanded similar heavy reading loads).",
    "The strength of this class is in the depth of the syllabus, in that we are able to read every major Jane Austen novel, and many smaller bits of writing as well. One weakness of this course is that it does move at a fast pace, so that sometimes pieces of the literature are not afforded the attention that they deserve."

    "yes",
    "Absolutely. Austen is a rhetorical genius, and her work is pleasurable to read. Markovits was arguably the best professor I've had thus far at Yale, and I would HIGHLY recommend any student to take a class of her's.",
    "Yes, for several reasons. Just a few listed here: an incredible professor who provides beneficial feedback on writing; an opportunity to read one author's entire body of work (and Austen is wonderful); and an ability to develop reading and writing skills in the context of a group of freshmen (less daunting).",
    "Yes. Absolutely take this course if you are able to do the reading.",
    "Take it whether you're already a Jane Austen fan or not. You can learn so much about writing and literature from this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I would especially recommend it to someone who considers Austen's novels to be \"too feminine.\" This class explores why the general understanding is as such and in what ways the novels transcend gender constraints. The class is a great way to develop discussion and writing skills while working with some really great literature. Professor Markovits is great at facilitating class discussions and has so much knowledge about the texts.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has a passion for Jane Austen only or is specifically interested about learning about her works.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anybody. I really enjoyed it and I think that anybody interested in reading Jane Austen's works would love it at as well.",
    "Yes! For several reasons: (1) Jane Austen's novels are great for thinking about the craft of fiction. (2) It is a great experience to read an author's oeuvre. (3) Professor Markovits has thought about these texts a lot and shares her extensive knowledge and enthusiasm. (3) Professor Markovits leads discussion very well, incorporating students with various levels of engagement with the text.",
    "If you want to read all of jane austen's books, and get a lot out of them while you do, this class will help you do that. The pace of reading is really fast though, so be prepared to budget a lot of time for doing the readings.",
    "Absolutely! This is a great freshman seminar and one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. It's not too challenging, although it is a lot of reading, and the discussions are always very interesting. If you've read a couple things by Jane Austen and liked them, I highly recommend this class because you'll get a really rich understanding of her entire oeuvre. It was also cool to be in such a female-heavy seminar.",
    "This class is awesome! It is super cool to read all of Jane Austen's work and I found it very valuable even though when I came in I wasn't particularly a huge Austen fan (though I had read both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility). I would not write this off just because you are not a huge Austen fan, this class is a great opportunity to discuss complicated literature and there is a good chance you may fall in love with Austen along the way. Her books are really complex and even though this class is a LOT of reading\/work it is so nice to know that the 100 pages of reading you have to do are of a novel that you can immerse yourself in. Professor Markovits is wonderful and really pushes you to look deeper into the novels, do great writing, and be engage with the texts. She is open to meeting and super helpful in discussing drafts of papers and possible theses. Such a great freshman seminar, would 100% recommend.",
    "This was a great freshman seminar, a great introductory English class and a great writing credit. It will improve your writing through the three papers, and it will make you much more comfortable in a seminar setting that is dealing with challenging material."
