    "A deep understanding of what electric utilities are and how their business models operate.",
    "I learned a lot throughout the semester and particularly enjoyed the first problem set and dissecting the rate case.",
    "I came into this class with no knowledge about the electric grid or electric utilities, so learning about many of the moving gears and the political issues they face has been incredibly fascinating.",
    "I was familiar with most of the content but gained exposure to more resources and information.",
    "A very broad sense of what utilities look like in New England",
    "Deeper understanding of how the current electric utilities were formed. Also, the challenges these utilities face right now.",
    "You learn about the details of the electric utility industry, the regulations that drive those details and how things are changing.",
    "Really helpful for understanding the arguments behind deregulation of electricity markets and other transitions in the utility sector",
    "Energy transition",
    "The thorough explanation of all facets of the utility industry was super great",
    "Comprehensive background on the electric utility business model, policy trends, and new technologies that are transforming the sector.",
    "This class provides an excellent overview of electric grids and how they are built.",
    "A better understanding of the utility industry.",
    "Learned so many facts and trends in the utility industry as it transitions.",
    "This class is fantastic. I learned a lot about electric utilities, how the grid operates, regulations, and the many technological and other innovations present in the electric utility industry today."

   "comments": [
    "Well.",
    "Met expectations",
    "Professor Reilly spent the first lecture clearly outlining the content that we'd learn throughout the semester, so everything aligned well with my expectations.",
    "I thought there would be a lot of interesting reading that would reinforce and expand my current knowledge. It met my expectations.",
    "They were not. The class is focused in the past without enough focus and how to move forward. In terms of applicability, its very limited by the geographic experience of the professor who has only worked in a very specific region within the US.",
    "The class materials were very adequate and met my expectation of the course.",
    "Class covered material that I wanted to learn and I will probably download course materials to reference later on after FES",
    "Great",
    "Pretty good.",
    "The class did not provide as much depth or as much opportunity for critical conversation\/analysis as expect from a graduate level course.",
    "aligned.",
    "About the same.",
    "Perfectly",
    "I audited this course and it aligned very well with my expectations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The 3-block is tough, but understandable since Larry commutes from Mass.",
    "Professor Reilly's industry knowledge was the strength of the course. In terms of constructive criticism, I wish there was more discussion built into a 3 hour lecture. Having periodic breakouts for students to break into small groups and discuss questions would help retain student attention.",
    "Professor Reilly is incredibly knowledgeable and that lends itself to be a huge strength of the course. Sundara was also an amazing TA which made our lives much easier. I think the biggest weakness was the inconsistencies in projects\/papers compared to expectations -- we lost points on our group project for doing what the sample project did. Perhaps a rubric of sorts would be more transparent moving forward?",
    "The lectures were long, dry, and not interactive. The professor did not need to read word for word everything off of the slides. Forcing more interaction and discussion on the readings would have been helpful. However, the professor was extremely knowledgeable of the industry and provided interesting and insightful stories.",
    "The syllabus looked very promising. A more engaging lecturer that is not afraid to teach content outside of his comfort zone would be great. The professor was very approachable and understanding, though.",
    "Strength: great depth and breadth of course material + use of video clips during class Weakness: I believe the course would be more fulfilling if we got more feedback for the final project (the last few weeks to prepare for final presentation felt a bit rushed and we would have benefitted more by having interim feedback session",
    "Lecture material can be quite dense and hard to follow especially since the course is 3 hours long",
    "Great",
    "The professor is very knowledgeable about existing practices of utilities but should have provided more perspective and readings on emerging technologies and pilot solutions to utilities.",
    "The material is a bit dry. It might be better to try and explain things better. Some of the slides are very text heavy. That being said, this material was very current, I could see that the slides were updated for 2019. The reading materials were also super good and it will be great to have those reference materials in the future.",
    "The course should in theory benefit from being taught by an experienced industry veteran, but the instructor largely glosses over complex concepts and provides little opportunity for class discussion. Assignments rarely require deep analysis\/learning.",
    "The content is very specific and relevant to the expectations of the course. The lecture style is quite monotonous and not very engaging. The slide decks are too long. The grading of the first two psets should have been geared toward understanding and work, not correct answers.",
    "There could be more discussion and more effort to encourage that students actually do the assigned reading.",
    "The presentations are clear and informative. Being able to download them and follow along in class is very helpful. The class is 3 hours long, but is engaging the whole time."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Much of the class waterfalls from the first rate case so make sure to invest a lot of time in the first assignment.",
    "Shop the first lecture! It's a good indication of what the semester will be like. My only caution is that I don't really know how I'm doing in this course in terms of a grade -- the class is graded on a curve, but I'm unsure of what that curve is.",
    "The class would be better for someone with little exposure to the utility industry because many of the concepts were basic.",
    "Unless you are interested in the connections of the professor or working in New England, dont take the class; there are a lot more and better ways to use your time.",
    "Take time to think about your final project and prepare early!",
    "If you plan to work in energy, this class could be valuable for you.",
    "Worth taking to get a very broad overview of electric utilities. Material is dense and sometimes hard to follow, but you can dig deeper on your own if you want.",
    "Great",
    "Its important material to know.",
    "The readings are likely the most useful part of the course.",
    "Do the readings and come prepared with questions. Class is significantly more engaging when people ask questions.",
    "Know that this class is very specifically focused on utilities, but will overlap a lot with other energy courses.",
    "Take this class if you are really interested in electricity and the utilities industry. The lectures can be dry, but they are full of really good information.",
    "If you want to learn about electric utilities and renewable energy, this is a great class to take."
