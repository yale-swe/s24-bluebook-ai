    "Word and Image in the Middle Ages asked me to leave behind my understanding of how print media and oil painting communicated among 18th and 19th century beholders and train myself in a considerably different way of looking and thinking about art. I often felt over the course of the class that my typical strategies of visual analysis were unhelpful. The course's inter-arts focus worked to estrange, or defamiliarize how I usually would talk about an object. This, in part, had to do with the very simple fact that I approached the seminar as an outside field. I felt that I entered into the study of the Byzantine and Western Medieval art from the deep end. I entered Rob's seminar with some undergraduate courses in Christian iconography and early Christian art, but found myself found myself rapidly consolidating knowledge of new terms, new categories of objects, new contexts and practices of reception, all whilst trying--as a student of the visual--to challenge myself to also consider the verbal, the interrelation between the two. Word and Image asked me to seriously reflect on how a work signified or communicated, if it represented or could represent, and to whom and how. I feel like I have cut my teeth on icons, inscriptions, psalters, sermons, secular manuscripts, monumental sculptures, liturgical vessels, devotional painting programs, stained glass windows, church architecture and all under exceptional circumstances. I consulted these objects for the first time in a highly effective fashion, through a lens that embraced the various roles that the words of medieval art could fill. I have a solid grasp on how that word evolved historically: from a scriptura continua orality into the codex and silent monastic reading rooms. I also acquired a passable grasp on the place of the word and the image in Western Christian and Orthodox theology, and the differences between the two traditions. For better or worse, my research paper introduced me to an incredibly dense field of scholarship about monastic practice and verse rhetoric in medieval Bulgaria--a foundation to build upon in the future. Fundamentally, I will never make the mistake again of blithely saying that the picture illustrates the text, or that the text captions the image. Rob's course helped me admit to a much wider range of possibilities, and move past the \"priority\" of one form over another. In practice, the course seriously humbled me, sobering me up as a student and giving me credible goals to pursue in my subsequent years of study. It helped me to realize that without my accustomed strategies of visual analysis, or the meta-narratives of my inside field, I had no truly systematic way of approaching a research project, and that I had previously intuited a lot of my scholarly work. The seminar paper was both painful and productive: driving me to evaluate how I write (or how I couldnt write in this case, how I couldnt shape up these ideas quite as I wanted). The experience encourages me to professionalize and standardize my approach--to take Robs advice and produce better outlines and to improve my presentation skills. Despite the difficulties of coming to grips with the seminar's subject matter, I feel a strong urge--regardless--to sit an undergraduate survey in Byzantine art in the future, or even to try and pick up Slavonic in my years, here, that I might make a much better showing in medieval art (perhaps of the Eastern Christian world, in particular) later in my degree program.",
    "This class was very clearly invested in several methods: semiotics and reception theory in particular. I had little experience with the former so I learned a very large amount this term. At first it was very difficult but I was able to end with a fairly high comfort level because we remained so focused on a limited number of methods for the entirety of the term."

    "Rob's decision to start the seminar with readings from Barthes, Mitchell, and Marin--to introduce us to the communication theory of Roman Jakobson--helped me to really substantiate the objectives of the course. These readings furnished an apparatus that I could carry forward, and apply in later weeks. I appreciated the scope, or perspective that the seminar built: getting us to step outside of our practices, and scrutinize the word and image in the present day, word and image in antiquity, before attempting to speak about the word and image in the middle ages. This sort of broad view intersected with the dialogic, or comparative structure of the course--shuttling between east and west--and gave me a strong sense of the uniqueness of the word-image relationships we considered. (I.e. The icon does not communicate like an artwork that behaves as a \"bible for the poor,\" nor like Phrasikleia, nor like an advertisement for pasta sauce.) I appreciated that we were asked to summarize our readings each week independently or in groups. I found the one-on-one conversations with with my mostly medievalist colleagues that resulted from this demand of the course to be extremely productive. They extended my learning outside of the seminar, helped me gather information and clear up misunderstandings that allowed me to hold my own in session without inside field training, and proved pretty enjoyable. Towards the end of the course, I really tried to challenge myself to summarize these articles lucidly and logically--to produce clear written outlines--and I wish, in way, that I had begun that process earlier. That performative aspect of rehearsing a reading for the class was beneficial: giving me a sense of what sections next year with undergraduates will entail. It demonstrated to me that I cannot rely on my memory alone, that I need some scaffolding or buttressing to not make a muddle of an article in its retelling. In general, I found the readings from Svenbro, Mondzain, Carruthers, Saenger, Camille, Caviness, Kemp, Chaterjee, Drpich, and Chaganti to be the most memorable and helpful.",
    "Professor Nelson was very good at engaging the group in discussion and in crafting a syllabus that slowly led us deeper into his method."

    "Definitely.",
    "I would! Rob demonstrated time and again in class that he was seriously contemplating the structure of Word and Image: summarizing our objectives, going over where we were at in the seminar, and oftentimes thinking out loud about how to make the course more effective in the future. I think that kind of attention to how the graduate student learns--that reflection on pedagogy--helped me to keep track of my own progress intellectually through an unfamiliar and intimidating subject matter, and it ultimately bodes well for another student to whom I might recommend the course. Robs sure to build upon and grow Word and Image, making it the subject of additional revisions and lessons learned!",
    "This was not really a course in which I learned more about the content of medieval or Byzantine art but I certainly learned more about the motivations for making it and the ways in which it might be interpreted as making meaning. I would recommend it for someone who wanted to learn more about the creation of meaning in medieval art and literary ways for understanding it."
