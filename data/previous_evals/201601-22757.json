    "The class reviews and provides a critique of the papers that we read ahead of our Organizations and Management seminars. It is intended to enable students to read early stage work and provide thoughtful feedback to presenters at our seminars about how to develop and improve their work. I would hesitate to recommend this course to another student, because the quality of many of the papers that we read was relatively low and the papers seemed to be more peripheral to our field than mainstream."

    "This course provided an overview of some of the current work done in sociological research on gender and racial inequality and on the psychological work in those areas. My research interests do not cover these areas and for these reasons, I did not think that the did much to contribute to the development of my own research."
