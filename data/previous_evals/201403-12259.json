   "comments": [
    "Great course. Definitely worth taking if you are interested in the content at all.",
    "Pretty good class! Covers lots of material and it's a lot of memorizing for each exam. Exams were literally \"fill in the blank\" questions and were not particularly intellectually stimulating. But this was a fun survey course for someone without any psychology background and I am very happy with the introduction that I received.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in neuropsychology or if you enjoyed \"human brain\" (PSYC 160). There is however A LOT of memorization for the exams and you really have to put in the work if you want to get a good grade. On the plus side however, professor Brown brings delicious cookies to class every Thursday! YUM!",
    "This class does an overview of human learning systems and memory capabilities. It is very technical and primarily neuroscience - readings are very scientific and there is a lot of memorization. Exams are very specific and difficult! I would recommend if someone has a great interest in this subject and a willingness to put forth a fair amount of effort into studying, although the actual semester during the workload is minimal.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in learning, memory, or neuroscience. The course is a good mix of science and social science- lectures are divided into three sections (which the book does also): behavioral processes, brain substrates, and clinical applications. There are 3 non-cumulative exams (which are challenging due to the quantity of material but doable if you study), readings, and some lab assignments. The class this year was mostly cognitive science majors; it's still accessible without a neuroscience background but the pace will probably be fast. Prof. Brown also brings cookies and they are amazing.",
    "I loved it, but I think a lot of people wouldn't. I learned a ton about the brain and the class just made me have an incredible appreciation for how awesome our brains are, and I didn't really understand that before this class. If you took Intro to Human Brain or something, you have a good enough background for this class. There definitely is a lot of information in each class- sometimes the lectures and slides went fast, but I was always able to just go back quickly after class and fill in missing information since the slides were posted online. Professor Brown really wanted you to get the material and was always cool with you interrupting class for questions or staying after to ask, and during the tests was SUPER nice and would help you try to understand what he's looking for. He always brings in cookies for class and it's just really nice to feel like your professor wants you to do well on his assignments.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It was amazing - one of the best classes I've ever taken in my life. It was a lot of work if you haven't taken any classes on the Human Brain, but totally doable. Make flashcards - they help tremendously. Talk to Professor Brown, also - he loves talking to his students. Also, look him up online. He's done some amazing things. A lot of the research you learn about in this class has been done very recently by him and his colleagues.",
    "Learned a lot in the class, but the tests were straight memorization (sometimes an overwhelming amount of information).",
    "A good class if you're interested in the topic. Some background in neuroscience would be helpful, however. Overall, class was very fair, and Professor Brown is very nice!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if you're interested in the topic (it's a lot of work\/memorization so only take this class if it really interests you).",
    "Yes take this course if you are interested in the material. But be prepared to study a lot for the exams! They are not heard as long as you are prepared. Fascinating topic and laid back but challenging class - a great mix.",
    "This class is essentially the neurobiology of learning and memory. It is difficult and dry, but very in depth if it is the topic you're choosing to study."
