    "If you like art, theater or visual, take it. If you like stereotypically passionate research professors, take it.",
    "A fascinating course that combines art history, theatrical history, and the politics of performance into a single seminar. A class perfect for any technician or actor, as it gives you a great insight regarding the process in which we engage today.",
    "Absolutely recommend. If you're an English or Theater Studies major or if you have any interest in the humanities, take a class with Professor Roach before you graduate. He is a wonderful professor and human being. And if this class is offered again and you're interested in the subject matter, it's so enjoyable. It's an interesting mixture between art history and theater history (you'll also read a lot of plays). Many of our discussions centered around what makes good theater, how the theater has changed over time, why certain works are or aren't still performed, what you can learn about the theater from a piece of artwork, etc. You can also get the class to count for a pre-1800 credit for English. Plus you'll get to take lots of trips to the Yale Center for British Art, which is so worthwhile.",
    "Take it to be in a class with Prof. Roach."
