   "comments": [
    "Historical, legal, and philosophical perspectives on movement and migration, particularly with regard to their interplay with nation's sovereignty claims, human rights, and the nature of the political community.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of the philosophical, legal, and historical roots of the modern immigration debate.",
    "While I learned a great deal about citizenship and immigration, I think this class pushed me to improve my writing skills a lot as well. While it is not a writing intensive course, the essay questions were challenging and I felt as though I had to dig further into our studies to answer them.",
    "I learned a lot about the field of political philosophy and the way in which thinkers have conceptualized migration and statelessness. More concretely, I learned how to write philosophy papers and learned how to tackle very difficult and dense readings.",
    "A better understanding of the development of the international system since 1947.",
    "This is a very interesting way of surveying major theoretical works with attention to the definition of the national community, others and immigration.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of issues related to immigration and citizenship, using political philosophy, law and academic articles as an insight into such issues.",
    "I gained a better understanding of a variety of pivotal texts on sovereignty and citizenship, and a better understanding of the situations and complexities of contemporary migration issues.",
    "I learned a lot about the political theory of citizenship over time from Aristotle to present day. That literature review in particular shifted the way I think about political theory and made clear how citizenship and borders are the inescapable basis of literally every thing in political theory, every form of rights or organization. So that was mind blowing. The second half of the course was a more legal approach to immigration issues, analyzing the history of international law regarding stateless people's and then examining U.S. immigration policy and potential future for the issue.",
    "I learned about how the notion of citizenship is inextricably linked to borders, culture, and ethnicity. I was able to think more critically about immigration policy and law today by utilizing the political theory I had learned in the first half of the class. I also learned about different perspectives on the argument for or against borders, immigration, and refugee status.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing - one of my favorite courses at Yale. Although it isn't a writing credit, I feel that this class progressed my analytic, critical thinking, and writing skills immensely. I have so much more confidence in my ability to synthesize texts and form a thoughtful and original argument in the face of high-level academic writings. I greatly enjoyed how this class pushed me to think through various ideas on migration, and often multiple at once, in a way that helped me find my own voice throughout the process. Great class!!",
    "A super detailed and in-depth look at the philosophical considerations behind migration and citizenship. Learnt a lot about both classical and modern theories.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great TAs, wonderfully kind and brilliant professor. A particularly notable strength was the emphasis on teaching; it was clear that the professor and TAs were really committed to helping students improve their writing (TAs were super receptive and eager to meet with students, students were encouraged to do corrections for papers). That is really something that I wish we saw more of among similar political philosophy courses. Weaknesses: Lectures were sometime not as clear as I would've liked",
    "The course is quite thorough and very interesting. Discussion sections help significantly to tease out the main ideas of the readings. The lectures can be quite dense in material at times.",
    "This class was taught as a lecture, but there were maybe 30 of us in the class. I think if the same number of students were to take this class again, it could be even more engaging that it is treated a bit more like a seminar, with more student involvement during class.",
    "This course is strong because Professor Benhabib is incredibly knowledgable about the course material. It is obvious that she is a leader in her field and that she has strong rationales and arguments for what she believes in. She also makes sure that we understand very difficult readings. There is honestly much I would change about this class.",
    "I think this course did a great job of engaging in the theoretical and legal arguments around topics discussed. Probably the coolest part of this course was how Professor Benhabib would invite graduate students and other relevant guest speakers to present a lecture! Super cool!",
    "Sometimes the lectures were a bit too repetitive with the readings. I was motivated to do the readings carefully because my section was excellent, and felt the lectures could have a bit more different of a focus. Its great that the class assigned 500 word reading responses due at the end of the night before section this really made me think through the readings in a critical way, and contributed to making the section discussions wonderful. I also really liked the way the workload was distributed three 6-8 page essays that each touch on 2-3 authors really helps you engage with different components of the syllabus, and integrate the different perspectives weve read about. The questions were always very interesting. I like this more than either a final exam or a longer research paper.",
    "strengths were that the content was interesting, the sections were engaging and helpful in developing my understanding of the readings. A weakness was that Professor Benhabib's lectures were more or less a regurgitation of the readings, so it would be nice if the lectures were less like summaries.",
    "I don't know if I would cite any in particular.",
    "The strength was professor Benhabib and the teaching fellows, by far. The course was jam packed with fascinating content that was very obviously connected and thoroughly examined. I think the latter half of the course was less structured because it had so many guest speakers, but that was totally fine for me because those guest speakers were so interesting\/helpful.",
    "I think the class was extremely theory heavy in the beginning, and it was at first difficult to see their relevance to the later themes in the course. I would have appreciated a more engaging lecture rather than Professor Benhabib simply summarizing the readings. However, I loved how everything came together in the end and became more cohesive.",
    "The format of the class with the three take-home essays was a big strength. I felt they progressed evenly in difficulty so that I had the adequate knowledge and skills to handle each one, so it was challenging in a fruitful way. I thought the readings were fantastic (although, regretfully, there were so many that I couldn't get through all of them). I think it would be helpful if there was a review at the end that captured the big-picture ideas of the thinkers because at times I got lost in the nuances of the arguments and lost the overall understanding. I loved the discussion sections (Nica was amazing) and found those to be really complementary to the class. Professor Benhabib is remarkable, although at times I felt the lecture was a bit dry just because there was a lot of summarization happening. Having guest speakers to tie the class to the real world was a great idea. I think it could be interesting\/important to tie more sociology into the course as well.",
    "Strengths: The content was super interesting and lectures were insightful. Weaknesses: Readings were sometimes too long for a lecture and the time needed to complete them might not be enough. Lectures sometimes might not be engaging enough.",
    "Lectures should be more interactive and interesting Slides should be available on canvas as she moves quickly"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! What a lovely class with a professor who is truly renowned in her field. Take it, but be warned that this course may feel a little heavy on the philosophy if you're not super into that side of things.",
    "Anyone interested in immigration law or policy would do well to take this course. It is not so intensive as to distract from other classes either.",
    "Yes, because I think the topic is incredibly timely and because Professor Benhabib does a great job tying in political philosophy, current affairs, and international law into a succinct class.",
    "Yes! The material is engaging. Professor Behabib knows a lot about theory. And, the workload is not too intense!",
    "Yes, I would. Great look into the theoretical and legal progression of the international system since the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
    "Yes! Great class that touched on legal and political philosophy. We explored the concept of citizenship and the implications of migration in a way that I hadn't done in other classes. Would recommend for ER&M majors too because the material is very similar but from a new perspective. Lectures were very interesting.",
    "Yes, provided they are interested in the material.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Benhabib is incredible and a leading thinker in her field. She explains difficult theoretical works succinctly and clearly while at the same time demonstrating their connection to one another. Through the course, you can gain solid foundational knowledge on the debate around immigration today.",
    "Yes definitely! This course was not only intellectually mind-boggling and theoretically rich but it was incredibly timely and felt more important and real than any of my other classes this semester. The course builds your writing and philosophy skills but also asks you to develop legal thinking and modern political ideas. On top of that, the instructors were all very interested in how we students reacted to, or felt about a certain writer or concept. I felt very comfortable discussing not just the ideas at hand but MY thoughts on the ideas, and the result was a discussion section wayyy more lively and deep than in most lecture classes. This course inspired me to try to do immigration advocacy work this summer, and I feel very prepared to explore that path further with this course as my basis.",
    "I would! Be warned that there is a lot of political philosophy and theory in the beginning, but it is examined through the lens of borders and migrants, which makes it far more interesting.",
    "Yes!! The intersection of law and political theory provides a powerful look into migration that balances theoretical questions with specific treaties\/declarations. As an undergraduate, I was happy that the law was more for context, and wasn't central to the course. The political theory we read provided the most abundant form of synthesis and critique, and really helped me understand some of the issues at hand, as well as become a better thinker\/writer. This class is so important for anyone interested in migration!",
    "I would if they are interested in Political philosophy. I did not expect this course to be so heavy on political philosophy as it was and mightve reconsidered if i had known"
