    "Would not recommend, I learned everything on my own (just reading articles, research, etc.) Discussions were quite lacking",
    "I'd recommend it. I thought the material was interesting and covered a good time period from present day to 1950's.I don't know what it would be like without Professor Hamada teaching it though.",
    "Prof. Hamada is going to retire After this term, so unfortunately you won't have the opportunity to take it with Prof. Hamada. The material is very interesting, and Prof. Hamada is a top scholar in the field. You can definitely learn a lot if you put in the effort.",
    "A waste of time if you are actually trying to learn something besides your paper topic. Good if you want something that takes only 110minutes of facebooking a week in class, and then a week of work for your paper and presentation at the end. Not really a class at all until reading period work.",
    "Good econ seminar.",
    "a very easy class - format with Hamada: discussion\/lectures for first half of semester, student presentations for second half, final is a paper",
    "An informative survey to Japanese economic and polotical issue. Thought-provoking discussion."
