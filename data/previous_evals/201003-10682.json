    "My elevator sell for the course was: It's about taking the things we learn in academia and communicating them to 'the public' and figuring out what the public or publics are.I would recommend it, but only if you are interested in academics and theoretical discussions and then figuring out how to integrate these ideas into actions. I would recommend it to graphic designers as this is the very crux of their imperative: the dilemma of mediating a message.The level of discussion and reading is extremely academic, and operating within this type of environment can be very, very intimidating if you are no already well versed in it. That said, not being an american studies phd myself, I found that the class and the instructor seemed very interested in having an outside voice and once I realized this, it became much easier to engage.",
    "It is a great introduction to public humanities practice and theory. It is a class predicated on exploration and sharing. The class practices the very methods and types of inquiry it encourages and explores."
