    "I though overall the course was very strong. I think it could be improved by having more overlap with the two instructors. Having joint office hours or class sessions I felt could have been very beneficial because the sections are so small. Doing this, would give students more peers to interact with in a classroom setting and allow them to make more connections.",
    "I think the course moves fast, but it is taught well.",
    "The syllabus was very interesting and manageable for a person not previously exposed to economics The seminar format provided an opportunity to discuss ideas and ask questions",
    "Strengths: -small class size -solid curriculum -good teacher Improvement: I wish the curve for the seminar was as easy as the curve for the lecture. I know many people who took the lecture only because it was easier."

    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think for anyone who is thinking of becoming an Econ major this course is very helpful. It will definitely give you an indication as to whether economics is something that you want to pursue further. Even for students who are not interested in economics as a major, I think this course would be very beneficial. It gives great insight into how the world works and is also so different from the majority of high school classes.",
    "I would, as it is a great subject to atleast have a baseline knowledge of.",
    "yes, but get a tutor",
    "Yes, since it provides a good introduction to economics",
    "It's a solid introduction to microeconomics. Take the seminar over the lecture--it's taught much better and goes more in depth."
