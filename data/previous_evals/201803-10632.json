   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The people who run this class are the nicest people ever, but this class is a ridiculous amount of busy work. The quizzes are hard as hell, so be ready for that. If you think youre going to study for half an hour and get a 20\/20 on the quizzes youre wrong. The two post lab reports are graded so meticulously for format its really annoying. Overall, the class is super relaxed, so the work sneaks up on you and you always feel like you should have a better grade than you do.",
    "The course was well structured and the labs all taught very important skills. There were some overlap and review of past techniques learned, which is very nice. This gave us time to really grasp the techniques.",
    "Strengths - great professor, great TAs (they both seem genuinely concerned about our wellbeing, both with PPE\/mental health which is refreshing), well-structured course We kinda had to jump headfirst into scientific-style writing, which is something many of us hadn't done before, but I feel like the first post-lab was a good transition and we weren't being forced into writing a huge paper in week two or anything like that; I think the post labs helped me become a better writer which is good bc as a stem student I have anxiety around writing",
    "This course was a great introduction to organic synthesis. It could be improved by teaching more of the theory that students are expected to know, as this class does not correlate with the organic chemistry lecture course at all.",
    "I loved lab and looked forward to this class every day. At the beginning of lab, I had to be glued to the directions for every little step, but now I find myself doing the same techniques with more skill and more confidence. Maybe it's just because I didn't take gen chem lab, but I feel like there could have been more guidance when writing post-lab assignments. The guidance that does exist is scattered and somewhat contradictory between the multiple documents and examples (though my TA was great at clarifying exactly what we needed to do). I also wish the labs lined up with the lectures (though I know that's not only lab's fault). Sometimes we'd go through a mechanism in lab that wouldn't make sense just because we hadn't got there in lecture yet.",
    "Strengths include the logical progression of the labs so that you are able to learn techniques and apply them again and again for practice in various settings.",
    "The small sections, enthusiastic TAs, and warm and approachable nature of Dr. DiMeglio made the course feel small and accessible when the lecture course is so big. I liked how quickly I received feedback on my experimental plans and could always find an instructor within reach if I was confused when carrying out a lab protocol. Organic chem lab really lets people free in their workflow and note taking methodologies (within reason, of course), and the chance to gain that sense of independence is something I didn't encounter in gen chem lab, but I was grateful to have in organic lab, and makes this lab such a strength.",
    "clear instructions on the course packet for everything, reasonable workload it would have been nice to get an answer key for the study questions (released after the last EP)",
    "The final lab reports were graded extremely harshly (unnecessarily so at times). Everything else was fair.",
    "Lab courses are generally fun, and I appreciated that organic chemistry lab was much less stressful than gen chem lab. This class, however, was definitely more work than some of my full-credit seminars, and I feel like it should be worth more than half a credit.",
    "The grading is unbelievably harsh. Many people I know received very low grades on very big assignments, not because they did not know the information or do a good job, but because they got points off for things that were never mentioned were something we needed to or shouldnt do.",
    "Strengths: organization, course material, and the lab environment. Weaknesses: More guideline or feedback on PLs.",
    "Strengths - TAs and the professor were very willing to answer any questions about lab techniques and procedures. Weaknesses - unpredictability of grading",
    "I thought the course was great and well taught! The course packet was so helpful. I do wish office hours were more promoted.",
    "Keep it the same",
    "Strengths: no weekly lab reports. This made the lab much more enjoyable than Gen Chem lab. We only had weekly experimental plans and 2 post lab assignments, so the workload was quite manageable. Dr. D is also a very nice professor! Weaknesses: for the post-lab assignments, the material and rules appeared scattered across multiple documents, so you had to go through them all and figure out what was expected for the assignments by consolidating the information. Also some TAs graded harsher than other TAs on the writing assignments on small details, so perhaps consistency among grading would be nice.",
    "The course packet is very vague in many aspects. Coming from a high school with poor lab facilities, it was hard to catch up to the same level. It should be more straightforward with ALL information in one area. At times it was like a wild goose chase to find exactly the information needed--and often (especially for lab reports) there are not enough examples of what a perfect lab report looks like. The TA feedback is not adequate. I asked for help on a Post Lab Assignment and was told to \"keep my head up\".",
    "Strengths: clear, engaging labs; homework assignments were very helpful in understanding the labs; plenty of opportunities to receive help if needed",
    "I think that the course was good, I can't think of many changes. I think that the class was pretty back-loaded (a lot of weight on the PLB and the final), I think some more quizzes throughout and maybe a PLA, B and C could be good just to space things out a little. I also wish that the final were part practical, part written (or all practical). I feel like a 100% written exam doesn't test what we learned adequately. I liked the range of experiments and the timing of the lab. The course instructors were all fantastic and I think that they were really understanding about the fact that we are all beginners and will make mistakes.",
    "There is SUBSTANTIAL variation in grading by TAs. some automatically gave As on every assignment- others rarely gave above a B.",
    "Grading seems kind of arbitrary sometimes.",
    "A strength of the course is the various techniques we learn, which are very useful in multiple lab settings. One weakness of the course is that there are not enough times between the start of the semester and the Lab practical where we connect the labs with the content we learn in class.",
    "It is a class that encourages independent thinking to answer questions and that is highly effective in teaching many critical techniques used in organic chemistry labs. A weakness is in how grade breakdowns. I don't think having the final practical exam be worth such a large proportion of the grade is representative of the skills that this course should emphasize.",
    "I thought the labs were a good length of time and Dr. DiMeglio and TF's were very helpful, but I think grading of the course could have been improved. Everyone seemed to get different scores based on what TF they had, and there was no clear rubric to how things were graded (especially EP-B), so it was kind of just like shooting in the dark, hoping that some points would stick. They would take off points for the smallest things that could be easily fixed, but since they never told us, I wouldn't have known to fix it.",
    "The strength is the way it facilitates learning. I don't really have any weaknesses. It would have been nice if they played music more often. It made lab more exciting!",
    "The strengths are definitely good organization, clear experiments, and help when you need it. No suggestions for improvement!",
    "This is a great and well-organized lab course. Skills were taught clearly and effectively, and I gained a good understanding of both how to perform them and how they work. The second lab report was very useful for gaining experience writing up results and analysis, but it was really the only time during the semester that we were asked to fully analyze our data. It might have been helpful to have the first lab report incorporate some similar elements rather than asking different questions in a different format.",
    "The strengths of the course were that I was able to develop my laboratory skills. I enjoyed being in the laboratory. The weakness of the course is that for the post lab assignments there were guidelines in order to formulate our submissions. However, grading seemed rather arbitrary. For example, many people lost points for not including something that was not asked for.",
    "Strengths: This course offers its students a lot of independence: students can walk in early and start getting prepared, and they can work at their own pace. Weaknesses: An unnecessarily large emphasis is placed on formatting and formality in the grading of assignments. Many points were taken off for seemingly innocuous errors, and it often felt like we were more worried about the formatting of the material than the content of the chemistry.",
    "Strenghths: really interesting course, good instructors, way more engaging than chem lab 1 wakneeses: pretty strict an arbitrary grading on the post labs, but other than that very little",
    "Structured well, great teaching staff, course packet and instructions outline perfectly what needs to be done. Weakness is the fact that you could feel all the chemicals in the lab so being more careful watching people working with the chemicals maybe.",
    "Only a few quizzes were given in this class, but not enough information was given beforehand about the content of the quizzes so it was hard to study for them. They sometimes contained material that was not supposed to be on the quiz.",
    "The lab itself is well set up for learning and reinforcing concepts. I felt like I gained a lot of confidence regarding lab work while in the course. However, the Experimental Plan system is pretty poorly executed, and the requirements about not including too much information were so stringent that the Experimental plan ended up being pretty useless. Grading in this course felt like it had very little to do with knowledge and the grading expectations for assignments were unclear and inconsistent.",
    "A strength of the course is the quality of the resources students have. To each have our own lab station is a real privilege that definitely heightens the ability to learn. There are a bunch of more structural weaknesses in the course. For one the prelab EP's serve next to no purpose in their current form. While its good to get in the habit of looking of up SDS information for the chemicals we will be using in lab, if they really cared about lab safety they would just give us this information outright so we don't accidentally get incorrect info. Additionally most of the information we have to fill out in the EP's is irrelevant to the lab (like MP and BP if we aren't melting or boiling the chemical). To lose points for information that is irrelevant to the actual information just seems weird. Additionally, you can also lose lots of formatting points on EP's, which is silly because EP's aren't actually a formal scientific thing. The post lab assignments also require massive restructuring. There are about 20 documents (hyperbole) on canvas that purport to relate to how the PL's should be formatted but none of them are actually a good rubric for us to follow. It felt like we were getting graded based off of some secret rubric that had we just been aware we could have easily implemented the arbitrary changes it required.",
    "This was a great course in that each lab built off each other such that by the end of the course I felt I had developed many skills. Moreover, the course material went hand in hand with much of the material we were learning in the Organic Chemistry course, so it was nice to have a practical approach to chemistry while also learning about it in lecture. I think the course could be improved by having PL assignments that more accurately tested our knowledge. I feel like the TAs graded too strictly on the PL assignments in ways that did not accurately reflect our knowledge and understanding of the material. This was similar to the disastrous lab reports in General Chemistry Lab.",
    "I think the grading of this course was ridiculous. The rubrics were so specific that I lost points for saying the right answer completely correctly, just with a different line of reasoning.",
    "grading could have been more transparent, wished that there were rubrics distributed ahead of time for written assignments found that grading was too nit picky at times, with points taken off of EPs for little missed details or not using the exact wording as written in the grading rubric (which i would have been unaware of since i did not know of it ahead of time) for the post lab written assignments",
    "I thought the course was well organized.",
    "The course was well structured and enjoyable. Every week in the lab was informative and enjoyable. The point distribution could be more distributed over the whole course rather than 3 large assignments\/ tests that account for the majority of your grade.",
    "I think the class was well-organized, and it was rewarding that every lab built off the previous one. All assignments were manageable, but the point system and way things were graded is extremely annoying. It felt like points were arbitrarily taken off sometimes, for the sole purpose of lowering the average.",
    "The course is very good.",
    "The class is a lot better than the general chemistry lab classes. The labs are fun and you feel like you are actually learning something useful. Still, the assignments are pretty tedious. The EP's are mildly annoying but they do not take long. The PLA's are fine, but graded unnecessarily harshly. Points are taken off for every single minor mistake.",
    "The weakness is that with each assignment, despite any feedback given, there would always be new issues arising. It was very frustrating, and almost depressing at some points, as it felt like no matter how hard I tried, I was never good enough.",
    "There were no weaknesses. I thought the class was well-organized.",
    "Strengths- well-organized; plenty of time to complete labs Weaknesses- did not always receive helpful feedback;",
    "Generally, I felt that the labs were designed well for the amount of time we had to complete them, although there were one or two that felt long for the class period. I appreciate that there were clear expectations for the material to be prepared before the class.",
    "This courses grading is hard to do well in. I felt like no matter what I submitted and no matter how hard I worked on an assignment, there was always something missing that was never conveyed was important for the assignment.",
    "Strengths: NO WEEKLY QUIZZES OR WEEKLY LAB REPORTS LIKE GEN CHEM :') The \"Experimental Procedures\" that the course had us prepare before each lab made it very easy to understand exactly what was going on in each lab, and they did not take too much time to prepare (~1 hr). There are only two lab reports which made it much easier to understand exactly why we were using each technique. No need to worry about the yield of your product as the course was more focused on learningunderstanding the techniques, figuring out what went wrong and how to improve the next time around. Weaknesses: Very little guidance on creating lab reports. There was a document that outlined what exactly was needed in each section as well as an uploaded document about how another student's report was graded, but it would have been nice to get more than just that. As for the EPs, you sometimes get small points marked off on very small things that seem to be very subjective between TA from TA. For example, some TAs preferred more concise procedures while others didn't.",
    "more clear parallels to orgo class (220) would make understanding concepts easier",
    "Maybe just help students structure the Post-Lab Assignments more.",
    "Throughout the course, it was challenging to understand what exactly we were being assessed upon. More emphasis was placed on the particular format of a given assignment than the content or the practical lab skills. The TA's were grading our assignments based on very specific rubrics and the students were not clued into what was required. Students were left feeling confused and frustrated.",
    "I thought the experiments were very interesting and taught me a lot of skills. Dr. DiMeglio was also very kind and helpful. Sometimes I felt that the grading was a little bit inconsistent and focused on including certain key words rather than complete concept understanding. But overall, I thought the structure of the course and experiments was great and we received a lot of help and guidance.",
    "The course does a nice job of allowing students a good environment to learn and practice a variety of lab techniques. However, your grade depends less on technical skill and more on your ability to follow--at times vague--instructions when making EP's or reports.",
    "This course is a lot more relaxed than general chemistry, but you have a lot less guidance too. Everything relies on the final exam rather than being an actual skill based test in the lab.",
    "The lab experiments are quite interesting, even if they are challenging to get right. I like that we get a chance to practice the same techniques over multiple weeks. It can get repetitive, but I feel confident performing them now.",
    "I thought I wasn't going to be able to catch up because I didn't take college-level gen-chem before, and did not do much lab work in high school, but overall everything was very straightforward. I think that the course should be structured with a lecture going through the lab beforehand, because sometimes we went into the lab with no prior knowledge besides what was in the course packet. Also, searching up the safety data sheet for every single chemical seemed a little excessive. I found it interesting that the lab was not aligned with the course material in the Organic Chemistry class.",
    "The course much organised much better than Gen Chem lab, which made it easy to learn and retain the information. I would have appreciated more information\/help with the Post-Lab assignment, since it felt like even though I followed the examples posted closely, I missed out on lots of points for seemingly few errors.",
    "The labs were interesting and I learned a lot, however, more demonstrations of how to perform new techniques would be helpful.",
    "The experiments were very well organized. One thing I think that could be improved is that sometimes I was pretty confused on the grading and how much some of the assignments were worth compared to others.",
    "Grading can get very harsh and the differences between TAs are meant to be accounted for but it still feels uncomfortable that work in one section can be evaluated differently than in other sections. Strength is that it's very easy to stay safe and figure out methods with the help of TAs or even lab staff.",
    "it is super fun and it is not hard to follow up. I just hated the post lab assignments (only two this semester), they were super long and they were very harshly graded",
    "I liked the detail of the course packet and how it explained things so clearly. I wish we had an example of what the PLA should have looked like before the first one since it was such a big part of our grade. But overall, the class was quite fair in grading.",
    "I loved DiMeglio and I really liked how kind she was. She made me feel less stressed about the course and made lab enjoyable. My TA (Nata) was above and beyond, and I appreciate her for having office hours in addition to her incredible review session before the final exam. She was always here for us and made me feel prepared for lab and the exam.",
    "Strengths: it's pleasant being in the lab, the professor, TAs, and other lab assistants were very helpful Weaknesses: the things we do in lab typically go quicker than what we do in the course so we don't really understand what we're doing yet.",
    "A strength of this course is that the course packet is very clear and the EPs are helpful for preparing for experiments. A weakness is that some TAs put so much pressure on their students that even those in nearby sections get stressed.",
    "I really liked how the techniques built upon each other. I also really liked how we were focusing on the techniques rather than how much yield we got (like in gen chem). It was a very relaxed and non-hostile learning environment for the most part. I think it should be improved by having more objectively graded things. There are only four \"objectively\" graded things before the final, and depending on your TA, that might be great or that might be horrible for your mental well being because you never know how your grade is going to turn out. The TA grading was very inconsistent and the grade really only depends on four things since everybody is doing well on the EPs, which actually is very stressful. also, nobody ever knew what to expect on the PLA or PLB, which led to a lot of confusion and frustration when grades came out.",
    "This course facilitated student learning well, with the exception of the post-lab assignments, which often seemed unclear in purpose and grading. Overall, the course had a wonderful support system of TAs and lab directors that guided students through each experiment to facilitate learning.",
    "This course is very well-organized and the expectations are very clear. However, EP grading seems to be very subjective and based on the TA you have, which can have a sizeable impact on class performance.",
    "A major strength of this class is that it teaches concrete skills in the lab, and thus what you're learning feels very applicable. A major weakness is that the lab reports felt arbitrarily graded, and performance in the lab and understanding of the content didn't seem directly correlated to performance on lab reports. A really good thing about the course is that there were PLENTY of people to help you if you were confused or had questions, including the TAs, lab assistants, and the lab director.",
    "This course was well-designed, intriguing, practical, and informative. Strengths include the thorough and clear pre-lab guides, informative teaching fellows, and interesting weekly objectives. There are few weaknesses for the course, but the lack of clear, actionable feedback on the first of two post-lab reports, which are major assignments in the course, made it somewhat difficult to do better on the second post-lab report.",
    "The strength of this course is the course packet that outlines every single experiment in one place in an organized manner. This class has no weaknesses, as it is what I have always imagined a university lab to be like.",
    "The lack of clear instructions on PLs and the fact that rubrics drastically changed from the first to second led to difficulty in the second PL even after doing everything the checklist asked us to do.",
    "The course was very strong at starting at a simple place, then working up to ore complex experimental procedures.",
    "Strength: Help was accessible Weakness: Not very engaging, TF graded a bit too stringently.",
    "The course is structured well. Difficulty increases with more techniques to learn. But each experiment built on the previous and I really enjoyed the incorporation of many techniques into one experiment. However, grading is very harsh and varies by TA. It seems very unfair and subjective at times.",
    "The course was very hand-on learning, which I enjoyed. I feel that this course required quite a bit of work for something worth only half a credit.",
    "The staff are excellent at communicating exactly what is expected of you and of the experiments. The TAs and staff are incredibly friendly and willing to answer any question. The largest weakness, on the other hand, is that most of the grading seems relatively subjective, making it difficult to know how to do assignments. In terms of approving this, I think that the staff should provide more examples submissions of the assignments and the TAs should, on the first day, go over expectations for every aspect of assignments like pre-lab assignments.",
    "The strength of this course is the Course Packet, which includes a guide for each lab, as well as instructions on how to set up each assignment. The course packet has very useful information, but sometimes the instructions on the later labs are less detailed or a little confusing. The course is also very lenient on mistakes, which is nice because it is the first time many of the students are performing some of the techniques involved. One of the most outstanding weaknesses of this course is that the instructions provided for many of the assignments, especially the Post Labs, are very basic, and there is no rubric given to have an idea of what will be expected. The rubric given to the TA's seemed to ask for specific terms and ideas that, if not mentioned, greatly affected the score received. This caused great frustration when, having worked very hard on each assignment and having asked for further clarifications, the scores received were still low. Many of the grades given throughout the semester seem to be greatly subjective, with the only real objective assessment being two quizzes and a final exam.",
    "Strengths were that help was often available. However, one weakness is that the instructions was sometimes very vague or misleading.",
    "Too much stuff to do for every week!!!!!",
    "The strengths of this course are how welcoming Dr. DiMeglio makes it, as well as the help that is offered by TFs during labs in order to ensure learning is occurring. The weaknesses are the way that EPs (experimental plans) are worth so little points and can therefore be quite detrimental to your grade when only a few points are in.",
    "The atmosphere is great, but the assignments feel difficult\/unfair as no rubric is given and they are graded so harshly.",
    "I felt that the strengths of this course were generally that Prof. DiMeglio and my TA were very open to questions and were happy to help if there was any confusion with a protocol. I never felt overly stressed in lab. The only weaknesses were the PLA and PLB. I didn't think the instructions were very clear as to what exact formatting, information to include, or level of depth should have been used.",
    "A big weakness is that many of these introductory labs are very boring and tedious. The only strength is that I felt proficient in my techniques at the end of the semester. Also, putting together the experimental plan for each lab was very, very tedious and did not contribute to my learning or safety.",
    "One strength of this course is the quality of the course packet. Whenever I had a question about a portion of the lab or something that was due, the course packet would always have the answer. It was well-organized and easy to understand. One weakness of the course was the time of the lab. Maybe expanding the possibilities of when students can take this course will be better for their schedules.",
    "The strengths were that it was very well organized and the prof was very nice. The weakness was my TF, who graded unnecessarily hard.",
    "I think the strengths of the course is the design of the procedures and the sequence of what procedures we were doing. I also think that the structure of the assessments was generally well designed. I think the biggest weakness of the course was the organization of information. Oftentimes, when doing assignments, I'd have to search 4-5 different places on the Canvas website to find all of the relevant information on how to complete a Post-Lab Assignment or EP. I think it would be useful for Professor DiMeglio and the TAs to maybe look through the Canvas website and reorganize the information, because it did end up affecting my grade when I didn't find or consider certain information because it was so spread out. Moreover, I think it would be useful to compare some of this information, because it sometimes is also contradictory.",
    "*Strengths:* Professors during lab were very helpful with conducting the experiments. They would circulate through the lab and I feel like I learned a lot from asking them, the TAs, and even my classmates, questions and gaining some hands-on, real-life experience with lab equipment and synthesis. The lab was always very clean and well laid-out and the glassware was professional grade. We werent graded on yield and were given ample time for the experiments, so during lab we had a chance to learn instead of stressing about grades (more on that later). Most materials for this course were included in the Course_packet.docx posted to Canvas at the beginning of the semester so we had time in advance to plan ahead and there were no surprise projects due on short notice. Final grade can be determined either via equal weight on pre-labs:post-labs:final exam or 100% on final exam which was ~35 question 1 hour multiple choice, which was fair with minimal tricks. If you know the material, youll do fine. *Weaknesses:* The prelabs and post-lab reports felt like a waste. The prelabs were very frustrating since the majority of the work was copying safety data from an online database into a multipage chart in a word doc. Then the prelab grading is anal, emphasizing formatting and other minutiae. I understand safety data is an important preparation for doing the lab, but it was quite time consuming and felt like a big waste of time that could have been used for actual learning. The post-lab reports are long, redundant, have a large emphasis on formatting and procedure in place of actual chemistry, and are graded arbitrarily according to a rubric with little details that are basically impossible to prepare for and everyone does pretty poorly. I learned nothing from doing the lab reports, which are ostensibly meant as a preparation for writing actual scientific publications. However, examples given in the Guide_for_scientific_writing.docx on Canvas that we were to follow for our write up and other examples found in the literature are at odds with how the lab reports are actually graded. PLEASE make the grading rubric for the lab reports consistent with the examples, and structure the reports so they focus on the chemistry instead of formatting and procedures.",
    "Labs took fair amount of time Prelabs and PLs took longer than expected",
    "The course is structured very well and the pace for each lab session is ideal with enough to keep myself busy without being stressed for time. The grading for this course is very arbitrary and very small details that are often very relevant to the concepts or procedure at hand end up making a large difference in the grade received.",
    "The labs were easy, but the guidelines for PLB were kind of vague, and the grading was very arbitrary. The final was also way more difficult than the rest of the course.",
    "The only weakness in this course is the fast pace of the lab. Otherwise, the course is very good at teaching students, especially those with no prior lab experience like myself, how the lab functions.",
    "EP rubrics should exist and be available to students to be more clear. Point deductions were very inconsistent among sections.",
    "Weakness: The way that we were graded on the PLs was absolutely ridiculous. The rubric was way too specific and had weird requirements that we did not know about from the instructions and the assignment. Many points were taken off for no apparent reason. Strengths: we learn a lot and we don't have to do a lab report every week",
    "Strengths: Labs are interesting and completely new from anything I had done before. Experiments allow for hands-on approach to understanding chemistry. Weaknesses: Grade in course is largely determined by how difficult your particular TA chooses to grade.",
    "The instructors are kind and help you figure things out but for major assignments sometimes you're left floundering and even emailing the TA doesn't help necessarily.",
    "I thought this course was taught in a way that limited the stress and the scariness of being in the lab. The TAs and Dr. DiMeglio were all very encouraging, which helped facilitate learning given the difficulty of a lot of the lab techniques we were using.",
    "This course is great because DiMeglio creates a very relaxed and constructive atmosphere in which to perform the labs and learn from them. The TAs are generally very friendly and although TA grading ranges widely, DiMeglio curves to account for that. This course is so much better than Gen Chem Lab and never causes that much stress.",
    "The final was worth a disproportionate amount of our grade. Get introduced to a good variety of techniques.",
    "This course is very forgiving and relaxed, while at the same time requiring effort and various skills from inside and out of the lab. The work load is manageable and both the TAs and the instructors are kind and very helpful.",
    "Strengths: interesting, new material; TAs were helpful in conducting experiments; workload wasn't too high; course was well-organized Weaknesses: sometimes expectations for PLs were not the clearest and sometimes many points would be taken off for minor mistakes",
    "Course is great",
    "I thought it was a great lab, though depending on your TF, it couldve been more stressful based on how strict they were for grading.",
    "Very chill, weekly EP write up, one multiple choice final with 30 questions",
    "I very much enjoyed every lab we completed due to the cumulative nature of each successive lab. Lab TA's were very engaging and helpful and Dr. DiMeglio was very instructive and spent much time ensuring each of us understood the chemistry behind each lab.",
    "One strength is that the expectations are very clear in the course packet, one weakness is variability in TA grading according to the expectations.",
    "Strengths are the course instructor, Dr. DiMeglio. She is very kind and checks in with every student during lab. Another strength is that the class focuses on practicing lab techniques and not harshly grading students for making mistakes, which is inevitable in a lab class. The class emphasizes learning rather than the grade itself, which students appreciate. A weakness is that post lab assignments count for a significant part of the grade when they are assignments that students work on independently without much instruction from the teaching staff. Perhaps more guidance on writing post lab assignments, especially in the style of the later one, would be helpful to future students.",
    "The course material itself was not challenging. However, the grading of the course was base on an unnecessarily specific rubric that the students were not given access to. In my opinion, the material found on the rubric did not test understanding of the course or course material, but rather unessential course minutia.",
    "Strength: you learn a variety of lab techniques Weaknesses: A lot of the grading is based on how well you format your paper",
    "If the curriculum were more organized according to what the organic chemistry class was doing, that would probably facilitate understanding in both classes.",
    "The TAs, who basically run the course, differ from section to section. It can be very hard to do well in the course if your TA grades harshly or does not know how to help in the lab.",
    "It was very well organized. However, the grading seemed inconsistent and borderline arbitrary at times, particularly from TA to TA. This was ameliorated by the fact that Dr. DeMiglio normalizes scores among the TAs.",
    "The course is very informative and focuses more on student understanding instead of memorization (as Gen Chem Lab). It could be improved with better pre-lab lectures. While the pre-lab lectures do a good job of explaining the procedure, I had a hard time following the chemistry of the reactions. Also, I had a hard time understanding what exactly was expected of me on the post labs assignment and EPs. A rubric might benefit the students, given that often times, points were deducted on specifics that I didn't know should have been included.",
    "The labs aren't the most intellectually stimulating, and the environment wasn't always the most supportive",
    "I thought this was a very and course to be honest. It was unclear how you could succeed, what was expected out of you in assignments and quizzes, and the grading felt very random with many points taken off for random things while the administration of this course didnt even know how to handle it and there were many mistakes in the course packet.",
    "I think that the course is set up well as is. Strengths include the accessibility of Professor DiMeglio and the teaching assistants, always encouraging questions, and the wealth of information available in the course packet and textbook. Additionally, I think that it is a strength that the the final exam is written as opposed to a lab practical, because it is a better measure of students understanding of the material, whereas a lab practical contains a certain element of chance. I think the one weakness is most of a student's grade is reliant on the strictness of their specific teaching fellow.",
    "The course was organized very well; very rarely did I find myself confused. The faculty and lab TAs were very eager to answer any questions I had.",
    "it is hard",
    "The lab courses here at Yale, especially ones needed for premeds, are really out to get you with the grading and unfortunately, o-chem lab is no different. The grading of experimental plans and post-lab assignments is ridiculous (how could the average for such a simple assignment be an 80?) and there is not much transparency in terms of the methods they use to dole out such low scores. Sure, you know that you'll get a full 1\/10 points off if you forget to number your EP pages, or half a point off of a perfectly labeled IR spectrum for not writing the date you took it, but the finer details of grading are really a mystery. It seems that what would otherwise be an A with reasonable effort is taken from you due to markdowns made any and everywhere for omitting \"requirements\" that are not even made clear to students before submitting the assignment.",
    "I think the course could have prepared us a bit better for the bigger lab reports.",
    "I love the content of this class. I love learning lab techniques. But this lab experience is terrible. The grading is completely arbitrary, the assignments are misleading, and the TAs grade according to vastly divergent criteria. As an academic\/preprofessional endeavor, the experience is worthwhile; but as a CLASS (an experience that culminates in a grade and is in large part informed by grading and evaluation), it's poorly organized and generally unfair.",
    "There are not many weaknesses to this course. It is not too difficult, and the actual labs are pretty interesting. There were only two labs that actually went the full 4 hours, and the rest of them end an hour or two early.",
    "A weakness is that all the TAs are different and not standardized, in that some TAs gave a lot more extra help than others. It might be helpful to get a criteria\/checklist of what are some things TAs might take points off for in the EP's since points seemed to be taken off from a subjective criteria.",
    "I'd say the main weakness of this course is the lack of guidance I had during the writing and composition of post-lab assessments. This may have been due to my lack of reaching out to peers or my TA via email, but I would have liked more online resources in the form of an example post-lab or something along those lines.",
    "Amazing professor and TAs",
    "I thought that this course was laid out very well in that every technique and most chemicals recovered\/produced in the first few labs were used in later labs. One definite weakness of the course was that the expectations and rubrics for post-lab assignments were not clearly stated. For example, in post-lab B, we were expected to regurgitate specific facts from a secondary source article and were taken points off if we did not have those specific facts in our \"Introduction.\" However, it is unreasonable for everyone to use the same exact pieces of information for his or her \"Introduction.\" Perhaps the rubric could be modified to require a certain number of facts instead.",
    "The course was great, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though I, personally, felt unprepared for certain aspects of the lab assignments, it was altogether a very fair class.",
    "The course is very straightforward with a linear curriculum. Lab TAs are extremely helpful. Main weakness of the course is the grading system. Although the professionalism necessary in lab reports and experimental plans is necessary, many times errors not related to organic chemistry topics themselves caused my grades to fluctuate. These errors include bibliography errors, not including page numbers on reports, poor formatting, etc.",
    "Strengths: Very straightforward. Course packet was very detailed and provided most of the necessary information. Lots of great details, I always read the course packet and felt more or less prepared for lab each week. Weaknesses: It seemed like all the TA's graded differently (which is to be expected to some degree, I understand). Grading seemed very particular (I had points taken off for the title of one of my post labs, which was \"technically correct, but not the best option.\" I truly appreciated the feedback (and have learned from it), but my title followed the format of the example and that one didn't have points taken off for it and it was something we didn't touch on in class.). Also, in my opinion this class should be worth more than 0.5 credits. By doing all the readings, EP's, Post labs, and ensuring I was prepared for lab, I spent as much time outside of class for this course as I did for courses worth 1.0 credits. In all though, very strong and straightforward.",
    "I think the course was well taught, but I wish we learned more actual chemistry in the lab (like how the reactions work - we got glimpses, but I feel like a lecture at the beginning of the session would have been helpful.)",
    "This course was organized very well. I felt that the workload was just the right amount and the laboratory work was very engaging. I think that the TA lectures could have been more engaging. The final was a comprehensive overview of our understanding.",
    "For pretty much every technique, we got at least two chances to practice it within the labs, which was useful. The light workload makes it much easier to keep up with other courses than it was back in gen chem. It did make things a bit difficult when we actually had to do lab reports, simply because there are many, many requirements to hit and unless they are all perfect, it's almost impossible not to lose points. There were a few times where I felt I lost points unfairly, but I did not follow up on these instances, so I don't know whether I would have received points back or not. I don't know that this lab really needs to be changed though, because it's certainly better than having a long lab report due every week. It was far less stressful than general chemistry, and for that I am thankful.",
    "a lot of work and harsh grading considering its only worth half a credit",
    "The course could improve on giving a grading rubric or at least a clue to the students on how the PLs and EPs will be graded. I found it quite stressful that I would get points off for not saying that a certain compound is specifically used in something and that I would get points off if the TA was simply not satisfied with it",
    "The grading system in the class feels punitive. Tiny errors that represent maybe 1% or 2% of the information detailed in a prelab or other assignment would result in point deductions of 10% or more. Students could probably receive a -300% on an assignment for doing a terrible job rather than a 0%, and deductions for writing a date as 11\/15 rather than 11\/15\/18, or tiny semantic differences in my reflection questions than what was expected, were typically worth far more than deductions for embarrassing mistakes that actually pertained to the course materials. The comments I received showed that my scientific writing was strong, and my understanding of all the chemistry was strong, but God forbid if I didn't spend hours crafting the perfect analysis of one paragraph of a journal article about safety, because there would be hell to pay. When you lose only 5 points on an assignment for forgetting how recrystallizations work (for anyone considering the class: recrystallizations are important), but 25 points for not rephrasing an article about the importance of salicylic acid perfectly, it really felt like the importance of the subject was undermined.",
    "The strengths were that the protocols for each lab were clear. Also, I'm very thankful they didn't grade on % yield, as my yields often weren't too high as a result of this being my first lab course ever. I can't think of many weaknesses. Of course, a 4 hr time block isn't super nice, but I feel like there's no way to get around that.",
    "Strengths: Learned a lot of lab techniques which would be helpful for a possible future research career Weaknesses: A lot of work for only 0.5 credits",
    "I don't like how the purpose of the experiments were not important until the post lab assignments or the lab practical. I felt that a lot of the actual chemistry going on just got kind of brushed over most of the time.",
    "This course was very well structured and really interesting. I enjoyed a lot of the labs although I think the post lab assignments should have had an example of what was expected especially since format was such a big part of the grade.",
    "My TA seemed reluctant to part with information about assignments I think because she feared giving me answers too easily. Guidance and help were very limited and I had to really reach out beyond what I felt should have been expected to get help. Help needs yo be more accessible because not everyone has taken lab before at Yale.",
    "Strengths - It engages everyone in a more individual way. Weaknesses - It seems a little tedious at times with a lot of downtime, but that is to be expected.",
    "The strengths of this course would be doing the experimental EPs every week before coming to lab. They really helped me to understand the experiment better. Also, not having to complete a full lab report after every experiment was great."

    "If youre taking it, you obviously have to. The professors are so much nicer than Dr. G from Gen Chem Lab but this class still sucks. So much work for half a credit.",
    "Yes, organic chemistry lab is definitely worth your time and so much more enjoyable than gen. chem lab.",
    "Yes. If you are on the fence between gen chem and orgo just take orgo\/orgo lab and spare yourself the pain of Dr. G. I came into the lab every single week with severe anxiety because I'm actually traumatized from gen chem lab. Everyone in orgo lab is so nice and if you make the most of it while you're there it's actually kind of relaxing to just go in and do what ya gotta do for a few hours.",
    "Yes - it's a lower workload than gen chem lab.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes lab work.",
    "Anybody who's interested in doing hands-on experiments in a chill environment should take this class.",
    "Orgo lab was a lot of fun! You learn a lot about mechanisms in orgo lecture, but lab allows you to apply the knowledge and create conditions that allow specific steps in a mechanism to occur.",
    "You probably have to take this course as a bio major or a pre-med, but it's enjoyable and you learn a lot. SOOOO much better than general chemistry lab, so any upperclassmen are in for a treat.",
    "Yes, it helps to have a hands-on counterpart to regular Orgo",
    "Yes, it was not extremely challenging or time consuming, but I still learned a lot about working in orgo lab.",
    "If a student is taking organic chemistry, this lab course is a cool way for them to see applications of lecture. However, it is important to keep in mind that the two curricula do not line up exactly - lab is an entirely separate class from lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is very interesting and fun.",
    "Yes. If you are taking orgo lecture, taking the lab is definitely helpful to understand some of the topics in lecture. It makes the material more tangible and generally more interesting. Also, the labs were pretty fun, especially towards the end when we did synthesis reactions.",
    "Yes. It gives you a good introduction to laboratory expectations and reactions.",
    "Yes, it's necessary to take in order to go further in chemistry",
    "Yes! Take orgo lab with Dr. D; she is a wonderful professor. The workload for this lab is very manageable on the weekly basis, and there are not many writing assignments. Be careful with formatting and following the rules set out in the course packet for writing, because you will get graded on those small details. If you have questions, ask Dr. D, she responds very quickly and is very helpful.",
    "If I recommended the course to them, I would tell them that its difficult to receive a good grade. You also can never really know what your final grade will be--the curve is never posted.",
    "Yes! It was a challenging yet very engaging course.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students taking organic chemistry.",
    "Only for major\/premed.",
    "Don't take lab if you do not need to take lab. It can be time consuming.",
    "More likely than not, you are thinking of taking this class because it is required. That being said, it isn't that bad as most labs are not too long, and the TA's and staff are very helpful. The class also helped me become a much more independent laboratory student.",
    "Yes",
    "Like Orgo, you are in this class because you have to be. No, it's not easy. But, you will get through it. This is a lot easier than Gen Chem Lab workload wise, it felt like a fair 0.5 credits (though ideally it should count as 1).",
    "Yes, it's a great lab class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course is a nice change from General Chemistry Laboratory.",
    "It is a good deal of work for a half-credit class, but chances are, if youre taking this course you didnt really have a choice. Either way, its one of the better lab courses I have taken, and I would recommend it if it is a requirement for you.",
    "Absolutely. It's a pretty chill class given that its a premed requirement. And if you were a nonstem major or thinking about a major for which its required, its not a bad course to take and then just end up using as a science credit. Overall pretty fun, only an hour or two per week outside of class, and get out early most weeks.",
    "Yes if you want to learn basic lab techniques.",
    "Not unless its a requirement",
    "Honestly the lab work is fairly enjoyable, and I legitimately learned a lot this semester. The only downer is the weekly EP and the occasional post lab assignments. They aren't awful but don't add much to your learning and are graded very strangely (and very differently by different TA's).",
    "Most people who take this course are taking it because they have to for their major requirements or Pre-med, but overall it was a great course and would recommend.",
    "Only if you have to take it. It is a lot of busy work and I did not get much out of performing the actual experiments.",
    "much much better than general chemistry lab",
    "Yes, it is a requirement and it is not too bad.",
    "Yes, it is likely you have to take it as a requirement, but it is a very enjoyable lab course.",
    "O",
    "Yes, the workload is very manageable. The lab techniques learned are very interesting.",
    "No, but chances are you have to take it so my opinion doesn't even matter.",
    "Not if they can avoid it.",
    "You have to take it if you are premed so yes.",
    "This course is not the most engaging, and I am not a student who greatly enjoys labwork. I would probably not recommend a student take this course for fun, but as a required course, it does a good job.",
    "I would recommend this to students who need to complete this class as a requirement, or who are interested in doing lab research.",
    "If you enjoy organic chemistry or working in a lab, then yes. I would not recommend for fun.",
    "Yes if you have to take it, no otherwise. There are easier science credits that are more interesting. If you have to take it, do not worry too much about the class. So long as you follow the instructions and keep up with the EPs and don't do the lab reports last minute, you should be fine.",
    "Not for anyone that is not required to take it for their major.",
    "if orgo lab is needed",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction into organic lab processes",
    "Not unless it is required for you.",
    "I would if they are interested in organic chemistry and lab skills.",
    "I don't think anyone takes orgo lab if it isn't required.",
    "Yes",
    "I would take the lab if it were a requirement (for premed or something), but if you don't have to, don't take it because the half credit is not worth the amount of time you put into work outside of lab. Also, if you are a slower-working student, you may find this class stressful, as there is little time to make everything perfect.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because I had no experience with chemistry lab work going in, and I learned a lot throughout the semester.",
    "Yes! It is super fun to learn about organic chemistry from a more practical point of view and working in lab is an experience that I'd say is definitely a must-have experience.",
    "yes",
    "Yeah. Its a cool lab and you get to make products. I think it is good for an into to orgo lab techniques.",
    "No, it's not worth it if you don't need it, but you probably need it.",
    "Yes! It was a great learning experience",
    "You probably have to take it, but I think if you get a good TA, then you should keep it. This class is really TA dependent, so it really depends. The workload is not very bad, but make sure you put in 10000x the work when you do your PLA and PLB, and the two quizzes because those are the main determiners of your grade before the final. Then, study for the final by just reading the course packet.",
    "If you have to take it, yes. It is eons better than Gen Chem lab, and there are fantastic support systems available (the wonderful Dr. DiMeglio, your TAs, fellow students).",
    "Yes. It is a great way to learn basic techniques.",
    "Yes! Although I didn't look forward to going to lab, once I was there I really enjoyed it. You are able to learn many important lab techniques through interesting and enjoyable experiments. If any student is vaguely interested in chemistry, they should definitely take this class! I was on the fence whether or not to take this class, and am very glad I did. The workload is not too overbearingout of all my classes, this one had the lowest workload.",
    "Though this course is usually taken as a mandatory companion to organic chemistry, this is one of the most enjoyable lab experiences I've had so far. The labs are not intimidating, but still prove to be informative and interesting. The well-written and concise pre-lab guides provide a sufficient background with a clear strategy for each week's lab. The teaching staff and professor DiMeglio are available and provide valuable advice. Unliek general chemistry lab, certain unnecessarily anxiety-inducing aspects are thankfully absent, including weekly quizzes and time pressure to finish by 5:00.",
    "Yes. The labs are not too difficult, and the pace of the class is perfect. I was able to learn lab techniques for the first time and implement them with ease.",
    "Yes, this course is necessary for anyone studying a field in the life sciences or chemistry.",
    "If you're taking lab because it is a requirement for a major or pre-med, yes. I would recommend this class for fun.",
    "Yes, if necessary.",
    "Yes if they are curious about research as many techniques are taught in this course.",
    "I think that if you are looking for some introductory lab experience or you need this class for a requirement, then take it. Otherwise, I think that the course material was mostly uninteresting and most of the emphasis of the course was thinking about getting grades.",
    "Unless a student has to take this course for a major requirement, no, I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in working in a lab.",
    "NO NO NO. I mean if youre taking this you have to but good god do not think Im gonna take chem lab for fun. So much pain",
    "I would say to only take this course if you have to because of your major or premed\/prevet.",
    "Unless this course is a requirement for you or if you are interested in doing chemistry research, I suggest that you do not take this course.",
    "This class is probably going to be taken because it is required for certain majors\/career paths. However, this class is 10x better than the general chemistry labs. The most important part of this class is not the yield you obtain at the end of the lab, but learning about why we do certain things during the experiment. While everyone still concentrates on conducting their experiment, there are way more smiles and laughter seen than in general chemistry labs. The EPs and PLs do take some time, however, and the quizzes and final practical are super straightforward.",
    "I would recommend it only if required.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course to a student unless they need to take it. It has nothing to do with the course being good\/bad; it's just that all lab classes take up large chunks of time during one day of the week which really severely limits flexibility of your academic schedule.",
    "If youre looking at this course, you probably have to take it as a prereq for some requirement. Overall, I would recommend the lab component of this course which is good, and Professor DiMeglio and Professor Martinez are very helpful in lab. However, I found the written homework component of the class not meaningful, time-consuming, and the grading very frustrating.",
    "As a required course for certain stem majors and premed, it is not too bad",
    "Yes it is a great lab course and is very refreshing in comparison with general chemistry lab with regards to stress, workload, and amount learned during the lab course.",
    "Yes! Organic chemistry lab is a fun course, and will be a useful supplement to organic chemistry.",
    "Sure I would recommend it as the TAs and professor are helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to another student because I found my time in the lab very enjoyable, and I feel that I grew a lot over the course of the semester.",
    "This is generally a pre-med class so you don't really have an option to take it, but honestly this course was a very positive experience and DiMeglio is a wonderful professor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Aside from being needed for many STEM majors, it is a great atmosphere to learn more lab techniques in.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it was fun and interesting to learn a variety of lab techniques. Although the EPs and PLs were sometimes tedious, they helped to develop a better grasp of the material as well as experience with writing lab reports.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. It is a good supplement to the lecture.",
    "Absolutely, so much better than gen chem or physics lab",
    "Yes for premedical requirements then yes, it really is a laid back lab course but the material can be challenging at times.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student aspiring to find a career in STEM. It provides many of the fundamentals necessary to fully understand and apply concepts learned from lecture .",
    "If it is not required, it probably wont be very engaging!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone in the lecture class and to anyone who wants to learn more about organic chemistry lab techniques.",
    "The course is very engaging, but be prepared with subjective grading.",
    "Yes, it is good to complement the organic chemistry lecture.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! But I like labwork in general, so...",
    "Yes, the skills learned are important for furthering your scientific proficiency.",
    "Yes, if its necessary. It isnt too difficult and the grading is fair, but it isnt that enjoyable. And, as most labs at Yale seem to be, it feels like much more work than 1\/2 credit is worth.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those that require it. While it was an interesting course, this is to be taken in conjunction with Organic Chemistry lecture, which is a very demanding course.",
    "It's not great, but if you have to take it you'll get through it.",
    "No; very poorly taught course with no guide to do well.",
    "Yes. Though I think most students take this course as a requirement anyway, I learned a lot and had a very pleasant experience!",
    "Yes, this course was very useful for students who are taking organic chemistry. The application of the theoretical to the practical was a much-needed supplement to my understanding of the material taught in lecture.",
    "not if it is not required",
    "Don't take this if you have a choice. For all of you who took gen chem lab, at least rest assured that this is a step up.",
    "If you need it as a prerequisite or are interested in chemistry research, its good.",
    "I would recommend this course, if standardized rubrics are implemented grading forward. Otherwise, I recommend the learning the material\/gaining the lab experience in a different setting.",
    "Yes, organic chem lab is a requirement for a lot of different things, and this course is a good mix of fun and not too difficult.",
    "I'd recommend this class to any student interested in science research.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it's definitely a great lab course. Just the post-lab assessments are really tough (to me, at least).",
    "Yes if required",
    "If you need this lab, take it. If you like organic chemistry, definitely take it. Otherwise, this is a challenging course and requires understanding of organic chemistry to truly get the most out of the course.",
    "The course is well organized with very simple assignments that follow the same format. Experiments are anxiety inducing under time constraints but are doable.",
    "Yes. This was a relatively straight forward course. I always received help when I was unsure about something, which was fantastic because of the hazardous nature of the chemicals we were working with.",
    "Yes, but it's not really a choice - you probably have to take it, and its a really well taught class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the translation of organic chemistry concepts to practical lab work. It was a highly enriching course and I look forward to next semester.",
    "As is the usual with these kinds of courses, the only people taking it will be the people who have to. However, do know that it's not as stressful as general chemistry lab. It actually does feel like the 0.5 credit course it purports itself to be, so you can relax a little.",
    "Only if it is required.",
    "If you are taking organic chemistry, this is lab is good to supplement it.",
    "no unless you have to (much better than gen chem lab though)",
    "Yes. If you're a chem or bio major, you'll have to take this. It's not bad by any means, especially compared to the bad things I've heard about gen chem lab.",
    "Take it if you have to as a requirement. Instructors are fair but much work for 0.5 credits",
    "This course was very interesting and useful overall .",
    "Absolutely not unless you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in chemicals and learning how to use more scientific instruments.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is actually more enjoyable than general chem lab."
