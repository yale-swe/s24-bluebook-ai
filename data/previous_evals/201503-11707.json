    "Chinese 130 is fast-paced and demanding. If you take it, your Chinese will definitely improve, but the workload can be difficult to manage if you are taking a lot of other demanding courses. I would recommend it, but only if you are willing to really commit the time and effort.",
    "Chinese is a great language at Yale but a LOT OF WORK. Take it and it will pay off, but you really do need to pour time into it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but only if you have plenty of time in your schedule to dedicate to it. If you are a student who has taken L1\/L2 at Yale, be warned that the emphasis of L3 is more on speaking and writing (as opposed to grammar and sentence structure).",
    "Instructors: Liang Laoshi and Xu Laoshi are both incredible instructors! They are beyond supportive of your Chinese studies and always willing to answer any questions. Furthermore, they are wonderful people in general that held a cheerful attitude to make the class much more enjoyable. Grading: I wish I realized how fairly this class was graded from the beginning. It really is graded in a way so you can get a decent grade as long as you keep up with the work. For example, the dictation quizzes that require character memorization may seem impossibly challenging but you are always awarded half of the points you missed back for doing corrections. The rest of the class is also very generous about its grading, and the instructors are ready to help whenever. Class dynamic: The class was mostly fine, however, the weekly routine became monotonous fast. Every two weeks were essentially the same structure with different chapters, which made the class unbearably boring at points. Although that shouldn't deter you from taking the class because it was an effective way to cover a lot of material at a quicker pace. You definitely learn a lot and I somewhat feel like my Chinese has improved but I wish we constantly went over what we learned in prior weeks via more projects (we only had 2) or something so I don't feel like I forgot most of the new grammar structures and vocabulary like I do right now. Furthermore, I wish the class was more culturally immersed and we learned more about China's culture through projects and whatnot. The weekly tutorial sections were a nice break from the daily in class routine and I wish there were more opportunities to practice my conversational Chinese. Overall, a class that I'm definitely glad I took even if I did something feel incapable of succeeding in it.",
    "CHNS 130 is much less work than L1 and L2. It is taught relatively similarly to L1 and L2 but there are only 2 rotating teachers."
