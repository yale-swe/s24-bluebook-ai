    "It's hard to recommend this course; it's required and the material is interesting, but the experience of the course was disaffected and lackluster.",
    "I personally love film theory and, while this class seems like it should have a lot, the focus was actually more on the culture and criticism than the theory. I don't know if it will be taught the same way in upcoming years, but if it is, I recommend shopping it and getting a feel for the class structure to see if you enjoy the reading!",
    "Crash course into thinking about film via important texts. Take this course before other courses more focused on certain areas in film (race, gender, sexuality, etc.); otherwise, the class will feel redundant."
