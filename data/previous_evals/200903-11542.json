    "A relaxed, good class, but can be unstructured at times.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It's not a lot of work at all but really helps you advance through the language. We do a lot of different things: read a story of a movie plot, watched a movie, watched clips and did listening comprehension, performed skits, and dialogues. The only weekly assignment are journal assignments and the quizzes aren't too bad if you prepare by doing the worksheets. By the end of this course, you should be able to navigate your way with Hindi pretty well.",
    "It's a great class. If you liked elementary hindi, by all means take intermediate."
