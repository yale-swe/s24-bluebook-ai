    "Great reading list. Maxwell is a trip as well.",
    "I would only recommend this class to an upperclassman with a lot of experience in the departments. Some of the younger students seemed really confused by the lack of organization and structure, because Professor Maxwell is really disorganized and doesn't really tell us what he expects of us. As a result, there would be days when half the class would have the wrong book, because we didn't know what to prepare for that day. There was also no context for what we were reading, so I still can't place these poets in their historical context - and there was hardly any mention of what 'modernism' or 'lyricism' mean, in any context or for any of these poets. So you end up reading cool poets, but not knowing what to do with them.",
    "Not really. I enjoyed writing the papers, but I feel like most of what I got out of the class came from me and not from the class itself. Richard Maxwell is a sweetheart but was kind of ineffectual as a professor.",
    "The Modernist Lyric is a very difficult course in that all of the poems are in translation and tend toward inscrutability. That being said, Professor Maxwell does a great job with making the material approachable and engaging. It really helps to be ableto read some of the poems in the original, especially for the papers.",
    "'The Modernist Lyric' comes highly recommended. You'll get to read poets whose work simply isn't offered in other classes and by the end of the course this fact will astound you. From what I've gleaned, most of Prof. Maxwell's classes are run like informal book clubs. There really isn't an agenda and Maxwell lets you take the poems wherever you want hermeneutically. Don't expect to take away a grand thesis from the course, but do expect to be exposed to some of the most important work outside of the Anglophone tradition in the twentieth century. It will make you want to read these poets in your spare time."
