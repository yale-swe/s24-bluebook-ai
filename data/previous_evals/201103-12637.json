    "Bah. If you're interested in operations research, it's worth taking it just to be exposed to this cool field. There's a class at SOM that's better-taught and similar, however. Homework is pretty easy, but the material is not, and the class can be hard to get through. If you have a good group of people in the class who can support themselves through it, the class could be good, but it definitely doesn't get my highest marks.",
    "Good course, but I would suggest better organization in the lectures.",
    "Very interesting material taught reasonably well. If you're doing applied math, it's a useful course to take under the electives. If not, it's interesting anyway and will teach you how to excel your way through common business\/operations problems.",
    "Take it if you are really interested in the material. Otherwise, it is a very small class and only count toward very few majors."
