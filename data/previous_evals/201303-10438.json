    "The exams can be challenging especially for those not accustomed to writing about art, but I think this class provides a new and interesting way of looking at recent history from various cultures and artistic perspectives. A must for anyone interested in modern art.",
    "A great survey class. HIST 323 is fairly straightforward and about the same amount of work as any other art history class. Zeilder is an entertaining lecturer, and you'll get to look at the work of artists from this period who you wouldn't normally see in a survey that covered a larger time period.",
    "this class was WONDERFUL - the only two weeks of it that i didn't like was when we focused on russian constructivism for an overly long time, i thought. the midterm is straightforward, the paper was fun to write, and zeidler is a thoughtful and very knowledgeable speaker. lectures were so fun.",
    "If you are really interested in the time period I would recommend this course. Otherwise, I would recommend Professor Zeidler's Picasso and Matisse course which is more interesting and more engaging. Professor Zeidler tends to get sidetracked and strays from the syllabus, but he is really fun to listen to - definitely worth taking one of his courses at Yale.",
    "If you want to take one Art History course at Yale, and you want a survey course that's more specific than Intro. Art History, take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "Early 20th century art is a survey of modern artists from Manet through Jackson Pollock. Zeidler is a phenomenal lecturer and goes through the key paintings by each artist from the period with formal analysis and historical context. I had never taken an art history course before and found his style really managable without any art history jargon. Zeidler is great at helping even those with limited art history experience understand how an artist's formal choices contribute to the painting's overall sense, and knows a lot about the history and politics of the period as well. My only word of caution would be that the course spends a lot of time on Soviet art, so if that does not interest you you may find November boring. Otherwise, it's a great class, especially for those with no art history background.",
    "I would suggest taking either this class or Zeidler's Picasso and Matisse lecture in the spring before you graduate. He's a really entertaining lecturer, and you'll learn a lot just from going to class. He also picks the readings very carefully; there isn't a whole lot, but each reading really adds to what you learn in class.Zeidler organizes the class through themes rather than going by rigid chronology, which makes it fun and easier to follow.",
    "Pretty good! Exams were uninspiring.",
    "pretty awesome, Zeidler is hilariousAlso whatever the workload survey says, consider that almost no one does the reading, and the TAs know that and alter the sections so that no one has to be called out for it. The reading wasn't even that long, but the prof's lecture is so comprehensive it feels unnecessary.",
    "Absolutely. Whether or not you've taken art history, the class is a great survey of a very interesting time period. It gets harder as the course goes on so you have a chance to get used to the material.",
    "Absolutely take this course! This was the first class I'd ever taken in art history, and I loved it. It's not technically a class for beginners, but there were many other people in my situation as well, and it makes for a really fun and interesting humanities credit. My TA was great with helping those of us who had no prior knowledge of art history. Professor Zeidler is also fantastic, and really engaging lecturer! You really get to know his style over the course of the semester and appreciate his sense of humor. The workload for the course is completely manageable (one eight-page essay, a midterm and a final), and because I really enjoyed both section and lecture, it felt like barely any work at all.",
    "Zeidler gives really powerful, insightful lectures (better than Nemerov!) and the readings are mostly interesting and relevant. The workload is also pretty light. It does dwell a lot on pre-1900 painting though, so don't expect to get to any of the weird modernist stuff till after October break.",
    "Zeidler is awesome, definitely a great art history class but I might recommend Picasso and Matisse over it, just because it is more fulfilling to completely understand those artists as opposed to getting glimpses at a million others.",
    "Interesting course with fascinating artists",
    "Take this class! As a senior I had wanted to take an art history class before graduating and was upset that Nemerov's survey class had been discontinued, but I took this instead and it may be my favorite class ever taken. I looked forward to lectures, Zeidler is quiet but an amazing lecturer and the material is fascinating and gives a great overview of modern art. Work load is totally manageable.",
    "yes but i personally prefered the material in his picasso and matisse class. very political art doesnt interest me much.",
    "YES! I highly recommend this class.",
    "This is an awesome class. You will love Zeidler, his lectures are so engaging, and you will learn so much about important art. A trip to a modern art museum will never be the same. And Zeidler wants you to do well-- so the exams are super fair. Take it CR\/D if you don't want to have to memorize any paintings, but this is the type of class that anyone can do well in.",
    "YES - a must-take at Yale and for life. I'm not an art history person at all, but this class was very accessible while still challenging. I learned so much, and thoroughly enjoyed every single lecture.",
    "Yes. If you can only take one HSAR class at Yale this should be it. Absolutely made my senior year.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a contemporary art history class or interesting in 20th century history or art.",
    "Take it! Do it! First history of art course I've taken, and I absolutely loved it. First half of the semester was off the wall incredible\u00e2\u0080\u0094Zeidler is truly a fantastic lecturer and so entertaining. Second half of the semester was a lot more to take, we got behind on the syllabus and ending up cruising through a bunch of political movements in a disorienting way. Bottom line, though, this is a fascinating period to look at and very well taught.",
    "AWESOME art history class. If you're at all interested in knowing about the modern art and all the isms of the 20th century, surrealism, dadaism, constructivism, suprematism, futurism, (and the earlier monet, manet, seurat stuff), TAKE THIS CLASS.the lectures are really very well done and it's not a lot of work at all... especially because I didn't do the readings. The exams can be stressful because you have a limited amount of time to talk about each painting and\/or compare paintings (they're projected on a screen) but I feel like I can talk about art now which is cool.Great for non art historymajors.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone looking for a thorough introduction to modern art. I had never taken Art History before this class, and I left it looking at art completely differently. Zeidler was an engaging lecturer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sometimes his theories seemed a little out there, but that kept class all the more interesting.",
    "I'd never taken an art history class before and was rather skeptical. Spent most of the class frustrated with the material, but it really came together at the end when you start to see the connections between different movements. There were several \"wow\" moments in this class, but there were a whole lot more \"ehhh\"s. Very easy class if you attend regularly. Still not too bad if you miss some. An ideal Credit\/D class for the casually interested.",
    "Early 20th Century Art was a fantastic class - one of my favorite taken thus far at Yale. This was my first art history class ever and the period we studied was broad enough for me to get a taste of many different artists of several different styles, but narrow enough where we could spend good chunks of time on individual pieces of art. Also, Professor Zeidler is flawless. The only downside for me was that lecture was at an awkward time of day 4:30-5:20 pm, but I'm not sure if it'll remain at that time in future years. Overall, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Worth taking",
    "He lecturers, we discuss readings in section, then we take exams where we basically just regurgitate what he said in class and drop in a few names from the reading. Not too hard, and his lectures are so fabulous it's worth it. Seriously, the lectures are really good. Just go to one and see for yourself. I took the class credit d, mostly because my TA seemed to be arbitrarily slapping grades on things and I didn't feel like going all out to be absolutely sure I got an A.Perfect class for credit d, and a lot of people seemed to be doing that.",
    "Definitely recommended for anyone remotely interested in learning about art history. Professor Zeidler explains concepts well enough that even someone without any previous art history experience will be able to follow the course material.",
    "It is the thorough investigation of a few influential artists of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Learn about history through the lens of the art created. Awesome class!",
    "An overview of late 19th and early 20th century art, I found this to be a good description of trends in both painting and painting's politics, as an Economics major. I found the lectures boring at first but more engaging as I paid closer intention and the year went on. Shop it, make it a 5th course, and have some fun.",
    "Yes - a survey of al you need to know",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Zeidler had very interesting things to say, and I never found myself checking the clock. That being said, I think the lectures could have been a bit more organized, so that the overarching themes could have been a bit clearer. Be prepared for the fast paced nature of Art History exams as they can be challenging.",
    "This was a wonderful class. It was stimulating and thought-provoking, and I learned a lot about art but also gained a greater understanding of the human condition, especially in modernity. The readings were not too long but they were often quite difficult. Prof. Zeidler was brilliant and insightful. Don't be fooled by his accent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he was more eloquent than anyone sitting in that room. He is passionate about modern art and a great teacher. Heads-up that the title is a misnomer because it was really a course on art from 1860-1950. Also be prepared that it is not a class on modern painting; a variety of media (painting, sculpture, collage, even a poem) were discussed, and I was surprised at how interesting the different media were.",
    "TAKE IT. This class was both informative and inspiring- even those who don't think they have an interest in art history will find themselves drawn by the material. It's not about memorizing dates or names, but about understanding the major themes of art making in the context of turbulent early twentieth century history. Fascinating and manageable for non majors.",
    "A survey course that is as much about learning directly about art as it is about the theories and histories that accompany it. The best course I have had thus far.",
    "An excellent survey of late 19th\/early 20th century art - keep in mind that you won't reach the early 20th century until after the midterm since the course title does not indicate this fact. The workload isn't too heavy, and it's particularly memorable as an incredible lecture course - Sebastian Zeidler is an engaging and insightful lecturer, and you have the chance to learn about some of the most beautiful and fascinating works of art. I'd highly recommend this course; it's very accessible to nonmajors and majors alike.",
    "Yes - take it pass fail though. If you take it for a grade, it's actually kinda hard. Lots of memorizing slides.",
    "Fantastic. Engaging lectures, gave me a new appreciation and understanding of the period and of art history in general. I wish it had been a bit more historical in its approach.",
    "The lectures were fascinating, Zeidler is great. The difference between the two halves of the semester were quite stark--something I wasn't expecting. I definitely felt that the cultural context provided allowed me to learn both about artistic movements and the historical context surrounding them. The test material was a lot to retain, and the test itself was more than just citing dates and artists--just something to note. Overall, I would most definitely recommend the class to a fellow student, but if you are taking the class as an elective be sure to have an inherent interest in the material.",
    "This class is an art history class that covers works from the late 19th century to mid 20th century covering well-known artists such as Manet, Monet, Gauguin, Rodin, Brancusi, Matisse, Picasso, Malevich, Rodchenko to name a few. I would recommend this class because it is a very good class, and I enjoyed it a lot. It also taught me a lot about modern art, and I am able to go into a museum and properly analyze a painting and even identify a few. Take this class!",
    "If you have even an inkling of a thought that you like this period of art, you should take this class. The workload is very manageable, and the payoff is huge: you end the course with a broad perspective of what modern art is, the story of modern art, and the struggle of artists in the early 20th century. Some of the readings are cryptic but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all very interesting, ranging from dialogues to psychoanalytic theory to hard-core art theory. Professor Zeidler also happens to be one of the best lecturers I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had.",
    "Yes - just be weary in choosing TAs.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone. It is a fascinating period in art history and a privilege to be able to learn from him.",
    "A must-take class for anybody interested in art. Professor Zeidler makes you look at art like you have never seen it before. Although his conclusions about certain pieces are often very out there, you cannot help but believe every word he says. His lectures are amazing, and while he often ran over time, I found myself entirely absorbed in each one of them. Sit in the front because he tends to speak quietly and you'll want to hear everything! An amazing class I would absolutely recommend!",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!! ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES AT YALE!!",
    "Excellent. Professor Zeidler does not simply wave his hand around and make grandiose statements, but instead guides you through all of his arguments carefully such that they are all grounded in formal elements and historical context. You start with Caillebotte and Monet and work toward Pollock and Barnett Newman, covering a lot of the major artists and movements in between--some familiar art and some unfamiliar as well.",
    "Take it! Even if you don't think you like the art from this time period (which I didn't). Professor Zeidler is a fantastic lecturer- he's an expert close-looker, and you'll leave each class seeing things you had never noticed before. Readings are completely manageable, and exams are pretty much just straightforward memorization. A great art history course!",
    "Yes. Period of art history everyone should have at least some understanding of, great lectures, maybe not the best if you don't have some HSAR background as you aren't taught how to analyze.",
    "Good class, take it for Hu, if you like the class when you shop it. Go with your gut, if you don't like the first two classes you will hate it for the rest of the semester so don't even bother."
