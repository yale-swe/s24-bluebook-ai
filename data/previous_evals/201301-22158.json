   "comments": [
    "The course got progressively more difficult. I wish we had been graded more on translation than pure grammar, but I suppose that is the nature of latin. But this class was very rewarding, I never would have thought that I would be reading extended selections of unadapted Vergil, Cicero, Lucretius and real latin inscriptions by the end of just one year of studying Latin. It was a very hard class that might have hurt my GPA but it was interesting and worth it, intellectually.",
    "This course finishes Moreland&Fleischer (Units 13-18) and involves many outside translations from Vergil, Cicero, Catullus, and others. It's fairly straightforward, and while not as intensive as L1 because there's less grammar, it's still a huge time commitment.",
    "Yes. Your Latin reading skills between the end of L1 and the end of L2 is a world of difference.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. I took the class under Jelle Stoop and enjoyed it! We read a variety of texts like speeches of Cicero, Vergil's Aeneid, and several inscriptions. Over the spring break, we composed letters to each other on papyrus and then read\/responded after break. We also took a tour to the coin collection to learn more about Roman coins and read the inscriptions on them. In short, it is anexcellent class for those who enjoy Latin and would like to explore the language more."
