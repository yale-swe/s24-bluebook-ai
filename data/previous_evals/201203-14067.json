    "If you are looking for a different perspective to global health and the issue of health equity, then this class is for you. This course does have a lot of reading and writing, but it is an exercise to help you critically think. Unlike other previous social and behavioral courses, this course provides you with the theories, its importance and impact on policy and intervention to all diseases, not just non communicable diseases and touches upon the mental and cultural components.",
    "This course is not your typical course on health disparities. The articles and readings are more than likely ones that you have come across before, but if you want to take a course that will teach you how to take the same old information that you are used to and apply it outside the classroom as well as how to interpret it in a realistic manner so as to create sustainable and feasible change, this is the class to learn just that. Professor Panter-Brick will not only introduce you to the leading articles on the topic, but she will introduce you to the men and women who wrote them.",
    "Definitely recommend this class to other students who are interested in reading social science articles and discussing, frustrating to not necessarily come up with solutions, but the discussion is at least thought-provoking",
    "This course is great for a broad overview of health disparities and health equity, for it covers a range of health topics. It is interdisciplinary in nature.",
    "Yes! Definitely! Anyone who is interested in global health",
    "Yes, I would recommend anthropology 583 to anyone with an interest in the subject matter or medical anthropology more broadly. Do be aware that Professor Panter-Brick puts her students on the spot and that there is a heavy reading load."

    "As a public health student, the current teachings in public health seem over-taught and she provided a breath of fresh air to the topic that pushed current theories to a new level. This course has contributed to my education by providing an additional layer of thinking to my public health education. I consider this course an \"aha' course that inspires me to address the issues in public health in a comprehensive way.",
    "This course has made me a better and more compassionate physician.",
    "Contributes significantly to taking a social context approach to health and healthcare as a worker in health",
    "I think it was very helpful in giving me a deep understanding of global health disparities and current interventions. It gave me an opportunity to go through the literature i had not delved into in the past."
