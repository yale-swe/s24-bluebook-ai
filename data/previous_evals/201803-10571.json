    "As someone who focuses on stars and exoplanets, this class was beyond anything I've studied before. We learned about galaxies, including stellar distributions, galactic structure and evolution, composition, etc. We also learned about other structures like globular clusters, galaxy clusters and groups, and different types of galaxies. This was a great overview of galaxies and also galactic interactions. We learned some math behind every concept but were not overwhelmed by it, and the qualitative focus challenged you to understand topics fully as well.",
    "This course is a good overview of phenomena that play a role in the state of the universe today. We learned about galaxies and components of galaxies, both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, sometimes these two methods weren't completely synced, and so some of the math was hard and confusingly presented, while many of the homework problems involved dumb\/confusing math from the textbook that we hadn't gone over in class. The qualitative aspect of the class was excellent, though, and class was always a ton of fun. Professor Kenney is hilarious and always made class fun with interactive parts of lecture and lots of participation.",
    "This course definitely taught me a lot about astronomy! It was a nice overview of the study of galaxies!",
    "Galaxy formation, evolution, and galaxy dynamics. We talked about the ISM a bit and also chemical evolution in galaxies and the specific elements greatly influencing our study of galaxies.",
    "This course gave a good background on galaxies that every astronomer should have.",
    "I learned the basics of galaxy formation, what causes different types of galaxies to form, the kinematics of stars within these systems, and a bit about black holes and active galactic nuclei."

   "comments": [
    "The course covers a lot of material in one semester, so it can feel like information overload. There is also a lot of extra information provided in class and the psets that is definitely interesting, but it is hard to know what we really need to know and what is just a tangent. It would be helpful to have information come full circle or for there to be summaries at the end of every powerpoint to tell us what we learned\/key takeaways. The wording on the psets could be improved and the questions from the textbook could be provided directly. It was annoying to have to dig through the textbook, especially because the textbook was not very helpful in learning the material of the course. I really loved Prof. K and our class time -- especially his multiple choice in-class interactive activities where we had to hold up our answers to questions. It was fun and challenging and Prof. K's responses to our answers were always entertaining. Prof. K himself is a strength of this course.",
    "This class was great, mostly because of Professor Kenney. I really enjoyed learning about galaxies and our universe, and the classes were organized to facilitate learning. However, the math was disjointed and confusing at times, and many of the problem set questions from the textbook were unnecessarily confusing and didn't help me learn the important material.",
    "There was a slight discontinuity between the psets and what we covered in class which was certainly a weakness of the course.",
    "Professor Kenney was a really great lecturer! I loved how involved and engaging this class was. We had lots of interactive questions which helped make the lectures more interesting. The content isnt too difficult and is totally manageable. I wish that this class had been slightly more rigorous, especially in explaining the fundamentals of core concepts. Sometimes we would just brush over tricky math or physics, which I felt could have added a lot to my understanding of the material.",
    "Jeff Kenney was the reason this course was so fun. The topics were all related only by nature of the fact that they all had to do somewhat with galaxies, but in reality they were incredibly different in content. Some topics required more math and physics to comprehend and others were more content and memorization based. It felt like at times it was hard to put it all together, but the exams were pretty fair in term of not asking us to do so. We were tested on specific elements of the topics we covered, so I felt that at the end of the day it was easy to show our knowledge.",
    "While this course covered important and fundamental content, it was highly disorganized. There was a lot of extraneous information in the lecture slideshows, the professor was surprised when students did the assigned readings, and the grading was inconsistent on problem sets sometimes points were deducted when one student did something a certain way, while points were not deducted when another student did the same thing. A very important course and the professor is very knowledgeable, but the class is very disorganized and could have been a lot clearer in terms of what was expected from students. Also, many concepts that proved to be important on the exams were quickly glossed over in class. This course could be a lot better organized.",
    "The problem sets didnt match up with material all the time; though they would be loosely about the same concepts, we didnt do many practice problems and so had to spend a while on homework learning before we could solve problems."

    "Yes! If you are an astro major you have to take it, but if you are at all interested in astro you should absolutely take this course. It isn't an \"easy\" science credit, but if you have some background in anything asto-related, the material will feel like a natural extension of what you already know. This is also a good class to have before astro 320 because they talk about some similar topics, just qualitatively!",
    "I would recommend this course! Professor Kenney is great, and the class is a lot of fun. Be prepared for some annoying psets, but in general they don't take too long, and as long as you have friends in the class it's fine. You learn tons of interesting things and get to watch a lot of cool simulations and demonstrations.",
    "Obviously, if youre an astro major, you have to take this class. But, if you just need a science credit for some other reason or youre interested in astronomy, I would definitely recommend it! The workload was definitely manageable and the content was pretty interesting. Professor Kenney is really great and very approachable!",
    "If you're an astro major, then you'll have to take it. Otherwise, if you're a physics major looking for another elective then this is a great course. It's not too difficult, and Jeff is really approachable and helpful if problem sets, exams, etc. aren't going as you'd planned. The physics and math isn't too intensive but would definitely be helpful to have a good background in physics and math, it'll make things click a bit easier. It's really interesting and Jeff is awesome. Definitely take it if you have the chance!",
    "No. While this course is required, the material is interesting, and professor Kenney is very knowledgeable, it is fairly disorganized. Get ready to sort through a lot of extraneous material and to play a guessing game when it comes to expectations on exams and problem sets.",
    "Yes; material was the most interesting of any class Ive taken at Yale."
