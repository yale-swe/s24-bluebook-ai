   "comments": [
    "Yes, ENGL 459 is not as sexy compared to some of the fall semester's more glamorous (or coveted) nonfiction offerings, but it is a very, very fine writing class that IMO is pretty underrated in student writing circles. There is a strong emphasis on in-person reporting and you are encouraged (nay, required) to spend a substantial time outside of class going on hikes and fishing trips or visiting labs and attending conferences, not to mention working on your stories. This class requires a lot of work but Zimmer is a great prof (if a little stern) and I have found it to be very rewarding so far.... if you're the type to get salty about a non-A final grade, you would probably find it more rewarding if you took it Cr\/D.",
    "This class taught me to never be satisfied with my writing. The mentality of the course was that in order to produce good work, you need to revise, revise, revise! This required an intense commitment to reporting and crafting written pieces. Be prepared to go wherever your reporting takes you (for however long), and have your beautiful, ideas continuously shut down by the iron pen of Prof. Zimmer. This class will not give you an easy A (or even an easy B). Four assignments of increasing length (work required grows exponentially with length). We spent over a month reporting, revising, and writing our final, 4k word pieces.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It seems promising: its an opportunity for students to do their own reporting and writing on any topic of choice related to science or the environmentwith the help of a well-known science writerand the requirements are pretty standard: weekly readings, four writing assignments (progressively longer), in-class workshops and discussions. Id been excited to work closely with Carl Zimmer, to work hard for the class and for him to work hard for all of us, too. But he is not a generous or dedicated professor. He expects a lot from students and grades very strictly and punitivelyand it is fine to be a hardassbut he doesnt hold up his end of the deal. Hes careless and negative in his editing of student pieces (all my drafts came back with hasty line edits full of typos), and he comes to class with seemingly little preparation for the discussion of readings and student workno real method or message. Teaching the class is not a priority for him, and it shows. If you are someone who likes to develop relationships with professors, to be inspired by their ideas and conversation, and to have your work constructively, thoughtfully, and thoroughly critiqued as they strive to help you become a better writer, then you will be sorely disappointed in Carl Zimmers class. If you just want an opportunity to do your own reporting, this class is a good enough place to start; you will work hard and gain experience reporting.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a strong English or journalism background, or for them to audit during a semester where the rest of the student's course load is light.",
    "Take it when you only have three other classes that aren't too hard. I heard that going in but didn't listen; I thought it might have been okay if my fifth was a gut, but it wasn't. This class is rough, both in time and stress-levels. We had a solid month when someone dropped every week. That being said, this class was one of my favorites so far at Yale. The learning curve was quick, and I learned skills that I will take with me forever. I would recommend seeing a writing tutor for every piece to avoid getting points off on basic stuff, Zimmer demands perfection. Take it only if you are really interested and have the time\/mental stamina for it.",
    "Take it if you get in, go to office hours, write about things you like, and it will be a good time. Cr\/D it at first."
