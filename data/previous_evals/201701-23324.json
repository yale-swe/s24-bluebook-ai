   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this class. It taught me how to think differently about media representation, how to critically, and analyze poems and novels in the context of race, sexuality, history, etc. I also learned how to compare different cultural materials and learned about Latin American history and US relations. Overall, it helped to challenge my thoughts and to think critically about Latinx culture.",
    "This introduction to Latinx Studies course went over so many themes and it was an overarching review of topics relating to different countries and cultures.",
    "Interdisciplinary skills of analysis and comparison, academic writing, cultural analysis.",
    "This is a broad survey course on Latinx in the United States. I learned about Latinx social movements (Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican) and read a lot of wonderful text from historical to modern authors. This course helped me develop a deeper understanding of my own identity.",
    "I learned a lot of statistics about Latinx people and learned something or another about non-Caribbean Latinx folk that I didn't know prior, but most of the class really affirmed what I already knew.",
    "Really understanding & questioning he concept that Latin America - as obvious as it may sound - is not a monoculture, or \"new\" in the US",
    "Representations of the Latinx community, US- Latin American history and relations, how to closely analyze text.",
    "The course exposed me to a wide variety of topics pertaining to the Latinx community as well as forcing me to practice critical thought and analysis of cultural products such as novels, media, etc.",
    "I have learned how to better dissect cultural objects and heir influence on American culture. As a latino students, I learned a lot about myself and how I personally reconcile both the Mexican and American parts of my identity. This course was also a great way to improve and more critically think about my writing.",
    "I learned so much about so many aspects of Latino culture that I had no idea even existed. It was a really great learning experience and I feel like I understand my own culture and identity so much better now, even if that's only in knowing what questions I don't know the answers to.",
    "This course taught me to analyze, historicize, and criticize cultural production (literary, visual, musical) within the specific context of Latinx studies and the larger context of world history. These skills enabled me to build a nuanced understanding not just of this group but also of the work of the humanities in general. The specific lessons learned in this survey course gave me the tools necessary to think deeply about race, gender, sexuality, and class across academic disciplines.",
    "I learned a lot about the various Latinx communities in the U.S. and improved my close reading skills by having to choose only one text for each paper.",
    "This class was an excellent overview of US-Latin American relations for a number of countries. We learned historical context and interpreted more recent cultural production as well. I improved my critical reading and writing skills.",
    "My knowledge about queerness in Latin America.",
    "This was a great survey intro course. Professor Laguna is a very engaging lecturer and all the course materials are very interesting!",
    "Great course. I learned a lot about Latinxs, about history that is often erased or overlooked, and about how to critically view what the media puts out there for us.",
    "Invaluable perspective on Latinx history and culture. Feels really essential to an understanding of American identity and history. I especially will carry with me all the history, and the relationship between race and Latinx identity.",
    "This class helped me to critically evaluate the place of Latinx populations in the United States. I learned how to historicize the information and better understand recent trends in Latinx-American relations.",
    "I developed an understanding for how the US has historically interacted with Latin America and how that helps us understand modern relations. I feel I better understand Latin American tropes and what they represent. I felt this course was more of a literary analysis course than anything (in a good way).",
    "I further developed critical thinking skills in regard to race and how\/why people migrate. I learned that it is important to historicize and problematize events in history, as well as how literature can reflect movements in history.",
    "This course gave me a good overview of a topic that you don't learn a lot about in many survey history classes.",
    "This course is really important, because often when discussing Latinx people in the United States and in Latin America, they are people who history is acted upon, rather than people who are enactors of history. Often, we learn the version of history of Latin America and Latinx people through the lens of the United States, and with a positive spin on the United States relationships to these countries and people, if they are mentioned at all. In contrast to this, the course does important work to complicate these stories and histories, and show how Latinx people are actors of history and creators of equal and worthy systems and cultures. It also complicated the relationship between the United States and Latin American states and people, revealing the imperial relationships the U.S. has cultivated throughout Latin America. Finally, this class was important to me in terms of talking about Latinx people and Latin America at all. I am Puerto Rican, and this class was the first time I had ever discussed Puerto Rico for an academic class or setting. I believe this class and ethnic studies in general is important because this field allows people to think critically about the world in new ways, and reveal new points of view, while allowing one to discuss things an American education system does not normally include in academic settings.",
    "The class was very informative and did a good job at introducing me into the field of Latinx Studies.",
    "I developed the ability to analyze the cultural histories of various commercials, films, television shows, and musical pieces.",
    "Intro to Latinx Studies has solidified better my skills in linking histories of oppression and imperialism to current situations. Often times we focus solely on one or the other and do not make the connections necessary to come to terms with their existence and move forward. I think of current issues in a more nuanced way and have more resources to investigate why things are the way they are.",
    "I learned a lot about myself as a Latino and how my upbringing influenced me.",
    "I gained a wide variety of knowledge through my participation in the course. First, I learned a lot about Latinx communities both in and out of the United States. We focused primarily on the countries with the largest populations in the US, but we touched upon many of the countries in Latin America at one point or another. In this sense, I gained a lot of knowledge about American history and current events. Second, I learned a lot about broader social issues, such as race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc. Through this process, I feel like I significantly improved my understanding and ability to critically evaluate the way these concepts manifest themselves in any setting. Finally, I gained a lot of practice in critically analyzing cultural production.",
    "I learned to be critical of judgments founded on moral arguments. I learned about other latinx identities and their historical and political construction. I learned more about the commonalities amongst different latinx identities."

   "comments": [
    "This class has very interesting and intriguing course material. Professor Laguna keeps the lectures entertaining. Most of the readings are also easy to get through. I wish we could discuss the material in more depth, but because of the lecture format we are limited to 50 minutes a week. Overall, this is a great class and has caused me to seriously consider the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration major.",
    "The survey nature of the course offers a broad spectrum of many useful themes, from history to music to literature. Some topics are treated very lightly due to a lack of time.",
    "This course could be improved with a paper reflection at the end of the semester on how each student feels that the course has changed them. Otherwise, I really enjoyed Laguna's teaching style. He is very engaging, speaks well, and offers fresh insight into Latinx topics.",
    "I really like that the course made us do literary analyses and allowed us to look at so many different texts and forms of art; it was a nice change from just stuffy academia. At the same time, I wans't a fan of the final paper being a second literary analysis - with sources. I feel like we could've done more with the final paper - like go out into the community and or something similar. I feel like we talked a lot about things in class but we only really got to write about the literature.",
    "Very engaging material, well taught, easy to keep up with, taught at a good pace.",
    "As a Mexican American female, I felt at various points throughout the course that I was learning about myself and my own identity. At the same time, it exposed me to issues and histories that I had never heard of and gave me a greater awareness about the breadth of the Latinx community. However, there were areas that I felt deserved more time and attention as they are too many different facets of the Latinx community to be discussed. Accounting for the fact that there is simply too much information to cover, the course does a very good job at providing a danatasyic survey of those topics.",
    "I think the strengths of this course lie in the way it presents Latinidad in a way that is engaging for those who think of themselves as Latino and those who do not. The class was interesting and the readings were very engaging.",
    "For the most part, the lectures were amazing and I was always excited to go to class. Especially the ones about media representations, bananas, and the Puerto Rican debt crisis really changed the way I looked at things, which I think is what a good American Studies\/ER&M course should aim to do. I thought a few of the lectures the ones about intellectuals in the beginning, the guest lectures, and the ones on music were much less strong.",
    "This will probably be a common criticism, the course covers too much material. Covering much of Latin American history on top of American history on top of analyzing cultural production and learning the language of race, gender, sexuality and class is too much for one class. Granted this is a survey course. One way I would fix this is to offer Latinx studies across 2 semesters, maybe divided historically or geographically. Another thing I would change is the way students engage with their responses to readings. Sometimes their responses get brought up in section but sometimes it feels like writing into the void. Maybe having students respond to eachother's commentary would lead to more collaborative learning.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting readings, engaging lecture content, great use of media!! Weaknesses: Please take out Enrique's Journey and find a better book to examine Central American migrant workers!! Sometimes too much time was spent analyzing novels",
    "This course covers a lot of material in surprising amount of depth for the time we had. One of the weaknesses was that sometimes the lectures summarized the readings and made the readings irrelevant.",
    "Maybe split this survey course into a \"part 1\" and \"part 2\" across an entire year? There is just so much information to cover, it would be nice to be able to spend more time on topics.",
    "I feel like the slides were very fact based and he was just reading off of the slides at times.",
    "Albert Laguna's lectures are great! Interesting course with manageable workload, which is a dream come true.",
    "I think Laguna is a very flexible and communicative teacher. The class does a nice job of bringing in audience comments throughout lecture. I think the midterm was a little too long to be completed during the allotted time.",
    "The strengths include how Laguna adapts the course to current events and student concerns. As a survey course I was exposed to many lenses I can later come back to. This course also made efforts to privilege marginalized voices. This course would be improved with more structured sections.",
    "Too literature-heavy especially with essay assignments.",
    "This class did an amazing job drawing from a diverse set of materials (film, song, cartoons, television, novels, and articles) spanning over the past 150-ish years. Professor Laguna made sure the classes flowed and answered an overarching thesis so every lesson remained relevant.",
    "Being a survey course, of course not all the material will be examined in depth fully, but for a survey course, it does the best it can to get plant the seeds for further research. The course does a good job of explaining and showing the perspectives of those within marginalized communities (Queer POC, Queer Women of Color, Trans POC), but could always use more exposure.",
    "No weaknesses for me. The survey\/theme format of the course was perfect for me, and the mixing of history with the modern day world was also so important to why this class resonated with so many people. It connects histories that were never really taught and that is phenomenal. The only weakness I can come up with is the need for more time, because I truly wish some of the topics could have lasted longer and been discussed more deeply.",
    "The class was very interesting. Professor Laguna was so knowledgeable about all of the topics and presented all of them in a very unique way. He also modeled what he wanted in terms of papers during lecture, which was very helpful.",
    "The strengths of this course are in allowing one to complicate one's understanding of Latin America and Latinx people in their relationship to the United States. I thought it was valuable to discuss various Latinx groups in the United States, and in their relationship to the United States, bringing into discussion various themes present across Latin America and the world with regards to race, gender, sexuality etc. I appreciated the use of various forms of cultural production, from music and film to literature and news to learn more about Latinx studies.",
    "The course was strong in terms of organization and interesting topics. The weaknesses were the weekly sections and the the assigned papers. The weakness in the assigned papers is that there was no concrete rubric and the class expected you to be able to write in a slightly different style for the course, but did not teach us how to write in this style.",
    "This was an amazing course! I loved the variety of different sources that we used each week to highlight the point we were studying. The fact that we used articles, novels, movies, shows, and music made every class unique, exciting, and different from all the other classes I was currently taking. I feel like I learned so much, but in such a meaningful way that will stick with me!",
    "The course analyzes media very well, and I have no complaints.",
    "Laguna is an engaging lecturer who put together a fantastic syllabus and compiled a wonderful team of TFs to lead sections. Overall, I was very engaged with the material because of this setup, though I did not always have time to finish all readings and assignments. I think slowing down the pace of lecture would benefit many students; lecture was definitely more stressful than it could have been. Maybe posting slides would ease some of this stress as well, though I understand reasons for not doing this. In addition, maybe splitting the three larger essays into four shorter essays would allow more topics to be delved into and put less stress on those three large grades. The structure of the midterm was also not conducive to expressing one's knowledge. There simply was not enough time to write out all of my thoughts, and though I scored well it was a very stressful experience.",
    "This class is very fun and engaging. Professor Laguna is a great and funny lecturer, and the content of the lectures and readings was very interesting for the most part. Some lectures seemed more prepared\/spell-checked than others.",
    "Strengths: Great professor and very interesting content. Weaknesses: n\/a",
    "I appreciated the course's focus on cultural production and personal resistance, it made the material more engaging and enjoyable. Course could have done a better job addressing intersections of blackness and queerness with latinidad--I appreciated that it was talked about in the first place, but there is always room for improvement.",
    "I cannot speak highly enough of this course. It's one of the few classes I've taken at Yale in which it was effortless to be engaged during class. I found the lectures very well organized and designed. I also loved section, which gave me an opportunity to discuss the course content in a small setting. The reading list was also fantastic. I can't name all the pieces that I found impactful because there were so many of them, but a few highlights that come to mind off the top of my head are The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar War, Down These Mean Streets, How To Leave Hialeah, In Cuba I Was a German Shepherd, Urrieta's work on identity, and Roth's work on racial schemas. All things considered, I feel extremely grateful to have been able to participate in this course - it was extremely fulfilling and has provided many tools that help me understand the world.",
    "strength: range of materials and ideas presented weakness: sometimes there were too many readings per week- would have been better to focus on fewer readings than barely touch on several in section",
    "Because this course is a survey course on latinidad, we did not go into great detail into the topics we covered. I think that Professor Laguna did a great job in touching on complicated topics and encouraging us to look into them further. He taught through example how to approach complex events or productions through contextualization. I think that being said, there were certain topics that were more superficially touched upon, such as gender and sexuality. I think the course would have benefited from more explicitly including women\/queer histories. It would have been interesting to learn about the ways that latinidad interacts with sexism, homophobia, and transphobia and the ways in which individuals and groups have mobilized to resist societal oppression in the US and latin american countries. Unlike the other topics we covered in class, there was hardly any contextualization of conceptions of gender and sexuality beyond basic definitions. It felt lacking. I think another weakness were the text heavy slides. I know many students who felt they could not keep up in their note taking."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to any and all students. Everything we learned is really important and relevant, but often not covered in middle and high school history classes. Everyone at Yale should definitely take an Ethnicity, Race, and Migration class, and this is a great one. Professor Laguna is very cool and keeps the lectures interesting and fun. The readings are also easy to read. Overall, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Professor Laguna is an engaging lecturer and the lectures are the best part of the course. The course material was interesting and allowed me to look introspectively at how I view cultural objects. It is a fantastic course that I cannot recommend enough, easily one of my favorites at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with even a passing interest in the US relationship with Latin America.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Even as a fifth class, this information is important to take with you before leaving Yale.",
    "Honestly it was a great course, and Laguna is a fantastic lecturer. I would highly recommend for the corny puns alone tbh.",
    "Take it. The lectures are well organized, engaging, and you will learn important things about American history.",
    "Yes! Very well taught, and informative. Very relevant information for everyone.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student because it is a rewarding and thought provoking course that incorporates a wide variety of issues and topics pertaining to the Latinx community.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Latino culture and how Latinos have impacted the cultural landscape of the United States.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to a Latino student. Laguna is an amazing lecturer, and you'll learn so much in a fun and non-stressful way.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. By taking this course you will be constantly switching from the general to the specific. You will learn about the big terms and analyze the small moments with a strong focus on cultural production. This course was a great complement to my Yale education.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this course to get an overview of various Latinx communities in the U.S. It was a great survey course with some of the best readings I've done at Yale.",
    "He material is very interesting and professor laguna is great! I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes. This course should be required for all Yale College Students.",
    "Yes I would the material was very interesting and a broad overview which was nice.",
    "Take this course!!! It is so interesting and the work is not overwhelming at all!",
    "Yes, everyone, but especially Latino students would greatly benefit from taking a class that opens your mind to new histories and perspectives.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is a very important subject given the current political climate. I think this class does a wonderful job of taking modern trends and showing how they are not so recent.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in cultural studies. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone navigating their own Latinx identity.",
    "Absolutely. This class is extremely interesting, Laguna is a fantastic lecturer, and the assignments are engaging without being overwhelming in terms of workload. If you want to know more about Latino-American relations or Latino populations in the US and if you appreciate analyzing pop culture \/ works of fiction by Latinx authors, the class is perfect. I looked forward to it every time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any Latinx student as well as those seeking to learn about the struggles people have gone through regarding poverty and transnational migration.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "The class is very interesting but it is a lot of work. There is a big focus on literature, and a lot of reading every week, especially in the second half of the semester.",
    "Probably a hit or miss class depending on what you're into. I wasn't a huge fan but I think I would have enjoyed it more had I been more engaged in section. Material is really interesting, but you talk mostly about historical overviews cultural and representational issues, and not any kind of problemsolving or political action.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Latin America, the United States and American Studies, and people interested in ethnic studies in general. One can't talk about and learn the history of the United States without taking course to further your understanding of Latin America, Latinx people and their relationship to the United States. Laguna is a great professor, and will teach you not just about Latinx studies, but about themes and ways of thinking through an ethnic studies lens. The course work is varied and interesting, ranging across a wide selection of historical and cultural production from all kinds of Latinx subjects. This is a very important course for understanding the United States, Latin America, and the world we live in generally, and everyone should be required to take an ethnic studies course. If you take this one, you won't be disappointed.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are not familiar with the field, otherwise it is simply a broad overview.",
    "100% YES. TAKE IT. It isn't a lot of work, but it has a huge intellectual payoff. Plus Professor Laguna is INCREDIBLE.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who has an interest in Latin America or Latinx culture, society, economics, literature, and politics.",
    "Would definitely recommend; it's a manageable workload for most, and the materials are great and engaging. Laguna is a good lecturer and a very accessible DUS. Section was really positive and I'm confident Laguna will put together a great team of TFs again.",
    "Professor Laguna is a very good lecturer, the lecture is fun and very interesting, the reading is a bit more hit or miss but the majority of it is wonderful and helps support and enrich what you learn in lecture. It's fun, interesting, important, and low-key. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "YES. Very interesting course to take especially with other friends. Just make sure to get help on papers as they are the majority of the grade.",
    "Yes! This was one of the most interesting and rewarding classes I have taken here. Workload was considerable but fun. Overall I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Absolutely! I cannot speak highly enough of this class - it was hands down one of the best that I've taken at Yale. Professor Laguna is a phenomenal professor, and the course material is very important, interesting, and well organized. The lectures, the readings, and discussion sections were all phenomenal. The class was extremely fulfilling, and I feel very fortunate to have been able to participate.",
    "Yes! A great class for learning",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I felt that the knowledge I gained about how to contextualize latinidad was incredibly valuable. Learning the history of US-Latin American relations and how that has shaped how the US views latinx people and how we view ourselves was valuable. I gained a lot of insight into how capitalism and white supremacy are interrelated. The course also taught me histories which made me proud and which gave me hope for the future."
