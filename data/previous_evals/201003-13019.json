    "I would recommend it if you really want to study French. Also make sure you take the teacher you controls your homework because otherwise it is not worth it- you have to do your work to improve your French and do well in the tests.",
    "French 130 starts off at a fairly basic level and advances pretty quickly through grammatical patterns. However, I had no particuar problem following along. Most of the literature&film is depressing, but so is almost all French culture, so c'est la vie!",
    "Take this class if you enjoy reading French texts. The entire course is based on French novels and movies. Lessons are vague.",
    "Great reading material at a fairly fast pace and a fairly large spread of grammar to learn. I would recommend the course. I really enjoyed it. The workload was consistent, so there weren't any moments that I felt like I was drowning in an unexpected influx of work for the class. The structure of the class makes it fun and manageable and because it's small, you get to know your classmates quite well.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because of the amount of work and time needed. The extra videos with class 5 days a week is an absurd amount of time that someone needs to donate to one class.",
    "I don't think French 130 prepared me to go to France and speak french, so no.",
    "Not a killer course -- if you do the work, you'll get a good grade."
