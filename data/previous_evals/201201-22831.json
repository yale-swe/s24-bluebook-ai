    "3 theory books to start, then 10 or so ethnographies. The theory books are much better than the ethnographies. 2 4-page book reviews and a final 15-page comparative book review. Class is 3 hours long, and we had class during reading week and finals period.",
    "This is a great class where you read a book a week, then discuss it in class. The workload is not high, and the class discussions are amazing. The professor is so knowledgable and kind and really encourages illuminating discussions. You learn about so many nuances of the healthcare system in the US, which makes this such an important class to take. Highly recommend.",
    "I learned a lot from this course and it really has changed the way I see the world.",
    "I would recommend ANTH 451 for anyone interested in medicine, public health, women's\/sexuality\/gender studies, and anthropology. It was an open forum style course where all of these different perspectives were considered, and I really enjoyed hearing voices from outside the anthropology department that could contribute to conversation in equally important and nuanced ways.",
    "Yes",
    "The discussion and ethnographies in this class do not merit the three-hour time slot. Marcia Inhorn is lovely, but I wouldn't recommend the class."
