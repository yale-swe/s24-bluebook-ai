   "comments": [
    "ECON 408 covers economic models that deal with the effects of trade policies (tariffs, export subsidies, import quotas, quantitative restrictions). Overall a well-taught class, with well-prepared lecture notes uploaded to ClassesV2 before each lecture. Workload is relatively light compared to other Yale courses. However the class can at times feel very theoretical and not that applicable to the real world.",
    "A solid class on international trade. Problem sets take a bit of time but are straightforward. The group presentation on an international trade dispute at the end of the class is a big part of the course. The professor provides great notes for his lectures. The class isn't easy, but it isn't super hard! All in all a rewarding Econ class.",
    "I would only recommend if you are a senior with a hard schedule looking for a relaxed advance econ course that you will not need to think much about. There are definitely better econ course out there, no question. Material is actually super interesting (especially if you loved Peter Schott's course), but is delivered in not-the-most-exciting way. Very few people seemed to pay attention during lectures (and they are lectures--this is definitely not a seminar), which made problem sets somewhat challenging.",
    "This course integrates everything you've learnt up until now in the Econ department - micro, macro, econometrics and bit of game theory - as you learn about international trade policy. The material appears tricky but Prof Maggi does an incredible job explaining everything.",
    "A great, not super fast-paced seminar on trade policy. The final project was fun and not work-heavy.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's fairly relaxed and includes a good follow up to international econ, going into practical case studies beyond the theoretical models. The professor is fun and wants to help.",
    "I would caution a student that was interested in taking this class. It's not a great deal of work but I would say that the psets can be very confusing and hard. It's very different than Peter Shotts class. You less on models and graphs and more on political implications and things that are in the background. This made it kind of hard for me because I liked applying models and getting a clear answer and the answers generally weren't that simple to arrive at in this class.",
    "An easy senior seminar. Take it if you don't want to do a lot during your senior year.",
    "Anyone who wants to further his or her knowledge in Trade should take this class. highly recommended!"
