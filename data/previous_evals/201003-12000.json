    "You have to put a lot of work into it. I was thinking about dropping this class but then I put in a lot of hours before the midterm and got a perfect score. The exams are tough because they are meant to be done very quickly, so you HAVE to learn the patterns and do a lot of problems to do the proofs. The problem sets aren't a good teaching mechanism because you can play around until you get the right answer without really understanding it. The software for the problem sets is very good, though, and it helps you learn way faster than by hand. It's important to practice problems by hand for the exam though. It definitely took me two weeks to get used to Sun-Joo's accent, but she's great and cares about her students. It's hard to get an idea of what first-order logic is until you do it, so talk to students who have taken it to get an idea of what it's all about. It becomes challenging but I must say that the problem sets are enjoyable once you get the knack of them. The final is 50% of our grade, which is pretty rough. Study hard and you can do well (I hope!).",
    "Yes!!!",
    "This class is not as hard as everyone says it is. The majority of the class is proofs. By Yale standards I have extremely weak math skills, and the class has been more than manageable for me. It is not a gut QR, but a nice alternative for those of us who would not feel comfortable with a legit calc class. Professor Shin is hilarious, and knowledgeable. Don't expect this class to teach you any actually logic applications to improve your arguments or whatnot.",
    "First Order Logic is a great QR if you are looking to take something that is not Math or Econ. If you like solving problems and puzzles, you will enjoy Logic. It's not a super easy class, but it's very manageable. Don't be scared away by Professor Shin's accent - lectures are clear and she has a good sense of humor. And I actually found myself looking forward to the problem sets, especially once we started doing proofs. It was a good class to balance out a schedule otherwise full of reading-heavy classes.",
    "Really interesting material, and homework was generally easy. Translations can be somewhat difficult, but none of it is too bad once you get the hang of it. Really, it's a hit or miss class -- either you get it or you don't.",
    "Very specific material, didn't really learn much about logic in general, more about how to use these specific computer programs.",
    "it's tough...not a gut QR whatsoever...prepare to sell your soul to your problem sets every now and then (which are every week)",
    "Yes! Professor Shin is awesome and the class rocks. Seriously, you should take it because Professor Shin is amazing.",
    "Yes. The subject is really cool! Just be careful not to let yourself fall behind; since it's such a huge lecture class and sections aren't required, it can be really easy to slip up. The material, while not difficult, can definitely be tricky and it's not something you can cram for. That said, the textbook is written REALLY well and the TAs are very helpful and approachable. And the homework assignments sometimes just feel like a game!",
    "Take this course and keep taking it until it is done, even though it is difficult at times. The benefits may not present themselves immediately, but it will definitely pay off in the end.",
    "This class was an emotional rollercoaster. Overall I LOVED it - Sun-Joo is absolutely amazing, and the material was actually really fun to learn. But it was really hard for me, and I have no idea how I'll end up doing. Wahh. GO TO SECTION but shop around for a TA who is helpful and actually follows the rules they teach you when solving example proofs.",
    "This course was very hard. I spent late nights working on seemingly impossible proofs, and the curve (when there was one) was not very forgiving. However, it was extremely useful training for philosophical thinking, so if you're thinking of majoring or are just interesting in learning how to better evaluate arguments, this is probably a good (thought not fun) idea. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN EASY QR! Believe me, there are worse things out there than numbers.",
    "Logic is a class that often gets a bad reputation because people take it thinking it'll be \"an easy QR\" since it's in the philosophy department and have a hard time. It's an easy QR if you're good at QR. Any QR will be difficult if you're not. It's basically math (along the lines of geometry) without numbers -only words and shapes. It's a problem set every week, which you should be able to do very well on since there is an automatic grader online that you can send your solutions to before sending them to your TA. There's a midterm and a final, and those are the only grades. They were both fine and they give you a sample midterm\/final from previous years. Again, this is a great course if you're into this kind of thing, but don't just take it thinking it's going to be philosophy, though I imagine the class will help me with philosophy papers (no holes, etc.). Weekly section was optional.",
    "It is an interesting, but dry class. It is very theoretical and there is no way to really \"study\" for this kind of class. It teaches you how to think rather than asking you to memorize facts or history.",
    "If you need to, you can take this class and do well in it, so don't worry.It's technically a Philosophy course, but it is more like a formal linguistics class like Semantics. You learn First-Order Logic language (how to say names, predicates, connectives, etc.), and then you pretty much do translation, truth tables, and proofs for the whole semester, at varying levels of complexity. The lectures are more simplistic than the homework is (there's one problem set a week, for which you use a computer program), and section isn't required. Great choice.Plus, a couple of the lectures are actually fascinating (if you've taken Philosophy of Language or Pragmatics - it's that kind of thing, a little)!",
    "If you're QR-shopping this is the one to take. It'll be more palatable than almost any other option.",
    "A good course that is not too difficult to master with the appropriate amount of time.",
    "If don't like to work with computers, this class isn't for you. If you don't like dealing with fine details, this class isn't for you. With those caveats, I'd recommend this course to just about anyone who was interested in a QR that didn't use numbers. This class isn't a gut, but you won't be in the library for hours working on problem sets. The material is interesting and the software makes working on homework relatively straightforward.",
    "Just by taking this course you get to learn a whole new language. It's truly interesting new experience and is worth the amount of work.",
    "This course is great! The homeworks usually don't take very long (save some of the proofs toward the end). Most of the time it's like doing a puzzle- it's really fun and you learn a lot about logic, even though it may not seem like it at first.",
    "I really enjoyed Logic. It's fun and challenging-- I often found myself working on the problem sets well before they were due as a way to procrastinate on my other work. Also, Sun-Joo is a wonderful, hilarious woman.",
    "Interesting subject, difficult, there are easier QR's out there, but if you like philosophy and want to give it a try--go for it!also, an excellent class for people interested in computer science, many similarities.",
    "Yes! Logic is something that everyone ought at some point to study. It sharpens your view of people's arguments and makes you think about questions you most likely never thought to ask before.",
    "No! Make sure you know what you're getting into, it was hard and a lot a lot a lot of work.",
    "This class is not really the gut QR that it might seem. It is more a QR for people who enjoy thinking about mathematical concepts, but who do not want to continue with calculus, etc. The problem sets become much more challenging as the course progressed, but they were also fun (in the way that a challenging puzzle is fun). Professor Shin tried to make lecture both enjoyable and informative.",
    "A class that's not terribly difficult and that will make you smarter after you take it. I think everyone should, especially since it's not too difficult and you'll learn a lot from it.",
    "I would recommend First-Order Logic to another student for sure. It is just a very interesting subject, and Professor Shin teaches it in a way that is very clear. It's not particularly difficult, but (especially toward the end) the problem sets are a bit challenging. The problem sets are actually really fun to do, though.",
    "I took this as an easy QR and it was anything but; The material is actually very interesting, however at times it can be difficult to understand.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this class to other students, especially if they're looking for an easy QR. But I do feel that I learned something very unique that might change the way I think in a way that math would not have. The proofs were pretty satisfying when I was able to figure them out, but so frustrating when I couldn't!",
    "The material is important and it is even fun - especially thanks to the good computer program.",
    "If you expect logic to transform the way you think, prepare to be disappointed. if you're looking for a fairly interesting class that will offer a very different kind of work than any other class, prepare to be reasonably satisfied. Not thrilling material, but new and interesting -- the exams end up being totally fair even tough material can be challenging during the semester",
    "It's an interesting class that builds upon basic concepts through the semester. Proofs are either fun or frustrating. It definitely exercises the brain and is a different approach to getting the QR credit out of the way.",
    "Take it! Great course, interesting topic, entertaining lecturer, fun homework.",
    "So some people seemed to really struggle with this class, and others just kind of got how to do the problems. Luckily, I fell into the latter category and I really enjoyed the class. I was only taking it to get a QR, but I really enjoyed the kind of thinking and approach to problem solving that this course requires. Some of the homework was pretty tedious, but the proofs were really fun (can't believe I'm saying this about a math class). Take this if you shop it and enjoy it, AND it seems like something you can understand. One of the better lectures I've taken.",
    "Great course for understanding basic logic and argumentative maneuvers.",
    "This class is summarized in that it is the treatment of deductive reasoning through sentential language -- it serves as an excellent introduction into the world of logic. I would definitely recommend this class to another student as it has real world application in that it is excellent preparation for that LSAT and is a genuinely enjoyable subject.",
    "Professor Shin is an expert at what she does. I took this class last year with a different professor, and couldn't follow along and dropped out. Professor Shin teaches it very step-by-step, clearly, in a way you can follow and understand. The special software she uses also helps you learn it. If you're going to take logic, I would recommend taking it with Sun-Joo, because this is clearly her field.",
    "An interesting way of thinking about logic arguments quantitatively. Once you get the hang of it, there can be an odd therapeutic grace to the proofs. If you don't get the hang of it or if you half-ass the assignments, it's easy for this to be a nightmare. I would recommend this if you need a QR and you can stomach some (occasionally frustrating) busy work. If you find a good support group (i.e. friends in the class to do the problem sits with), this course is really pretty easy.",
    "This class really expands one's ability to appreciate different perspectives one the world- namely a very logical and rational perspective. I really enjoyed the material and thought overall it was fun and a pleasure to take.",
    "This class gives a solid understanding of First-Order Logic proofs and translations. The weeklyhomework assignments reinforce the lectures and give necessary practice with translations and proofs. Working with the software is super cool! It makes learning proofs and understanding things three-dimensionally in Tarski's world so much easier! Section is not mandatory, but attending makes a big difference because the TFs are so valuable when you have questions on homework assignments. Planning ahead when doing the problem sets is important because often the proofs can be challenging, especially the first time you have to do them.",
    "I actually found myself really enjoying parts of this course. It's a fun way to think, and you learn a about the logical structures already embedded in your own mind and your language. Sun-Joo is really nice and funny, and it's not too hard. Take it with some friends so you can laugh about it and put funny sentences into logical notation.",
    "If you are allergic to numbers but need to take a QR, take this course. If you like playing around on the computer, take this course. It is hard material, but the workload is not overwhelming. If you bomb the midterm, no worries because it is not worth much and they will weight the final even more heavily if you do well on the final. Also, you get a strange satisfaction out of successfully completing a proof...you feel like you've accomplished something, like you're actually making connections up there...like maybe, just maybe, a class can actually make you smarter.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you already know you are really interested in logic. I found the lectures a bit boring and the professor's accent is sometimes difficult to understand. I also thought sections were not too useful. However, the organization of the class was good and homeworks could be really fun sometimes.",
    "A tough but relatively enjoyable QR credit (if that's why you're taking it). Expect to spend anywhere from 2-8 hours a week on problem sets and have the final count for (I think) too much. On the other hand, the professor is hilarious and accessible -- stick with her for at least two meetings during shopping period if you are unsure -- and you will gain competence in logic, which is pretty cool.",
    "This class is great. Understanding and manipulating the underlying logical structure of thought is really, really cool. Don't be fooled by the people who try to dissuade you from it by saying it's boring or not good. It is true that you will enjoy it more if you have a brain that is suited to studying logic, but I think anyone can learn how to think like a logician by listening to Sun-Joo. Sun-Joo is very funny, adorable, and extremely smart and clear-headed in her explanations of logic. If you take this class, GO TO LECTURE! I don't understand people who refused to go to lecture. It was essential to teaching the general strategy and approach to proofs, and when I did proofs I had Sun-Joo's voice in my head, which was delightful. Plus, if you go to lecture you don't need to go to section as long as you get it. It's also pretty easy to get a good grade; you can check your answers to the problem sets before you send them in, and the midterm and final don't really do anything squirelly. Take it, especially if you are a humanities person looking for a QR that is actually cool and interesting rather than taking a gut you don't care about.",
    "This is a course where you either \"get\" the material, in which case things will be fairly straightforward, or you really have to work for your grade. This does help the curve if you're in the first camp. Also, the course gets much more difficult after the midterm, so pay tention then!",
    "Very unique course that one should take if intersted in logic, reason, or related topics.",
    "You learn how to put logical statements and arguments into formal language. It's pretty simple, and the fact that a lot of it is done on the computer helps a lot. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I liked the course. Understanding basic deductive logic will undoubtedly help you in constructing formal arguments and avoid common fallacies. I feel better equipped to tackle tougher philosophy classes after this course. In fact, I think if you're considering the philosophy major, logic is one of those courses you should take earlier rather than later.",
    "took it for a QR, and because I heard it helps with the LSAT's. turned out to be a great class. really fun and challenging.be prepared to work a lot, but if you do it's very rewarding.",
    "I can imagine that this course does provide you training for the lsat - endless logic exercises. It's basically deduction; derive conclusions from premises. I personally realized one or two things about the nature and limits of logical thinking, but I'm not sure if this course helps you think about that; maybe a little more emphasis on how logic connects to philosophy and knowledge and life in general would have been more illuminating. Also wish we had a one or two less psets!!",
    "This course is all about learning HOW to do formal proofs and as Sun-Joo puts it, \"formalizing our intuition.\" You will mostly be DOING formal proofs, although you will be expected to understand the concepts so that you can present an informal or formal argument. That said, it isn't very heavy on philosophy, although Sun-Joo at times points out where a philosophical problem or topic might arise. A lot of the time, it's implied that the more philosophical aspects will be discussed in a future class in the 'logic sequence' like Math Logic, etc.I feel like there are easier QR's if you're just looking for that, but if you feel like you would be into logic, it's a satisfying course.",
    "Philosophy 115 is a great course. The material is interesting, although it can be difficult at times.",
    "This is a good class for students interested in philosophy or logic. It is not good for students who need to fulfill a QR but have no interest in either subject.",
    "I would recommend phil 115, it is an interesting class with a manageable workload. It helps you to think in a logical and rigorous manner. Problem sets are fun if you like puzzles and brain teasers.",
    "I would recommend this if you want a relatively easy QR and to understand basic logic. If you already understand logic, it would probably not be too hard to take a more advanced course, but if you're looking to cover your bases and learn symbolic logic, this is the course for you.",
    "Sun-Joo is an excellent professor. This class is great if you're considering majoring in philosophy or another major that requires analytic thinking capacity. I found myself more able to make clearer arguments in my papers for other classes. It may be difficult, but practice will do you well. Sun-Joo has a Korean accent, but I never found it difficult to listen during lectures, and she often tells funny jokes that make class more enjoyable. This was the only class of mine that I did not once miss this semester.",
    "This class provides a straightforward, engaging, not-too-strenuous introduction to understanding and using a particular formal language to solve logical problems systematically, and then back up the solutions with rigorous proofs. Absolutely take it if you like solving puzzles or methodically thinking through a problem to get at its logical roots. Sun-Joo is fantastic (don't be scared off by the accent, which can be nearly impossible to understand at first -- it doesn't take long to get used to it, and once you do, you realize pretty quickly that she's a really excellent teacher who communicates the material clearly and effectively, and keeps things eternally amusing during lecture). Section meetings are optional, more like weekly review sessions for whoever needs them, problem sets never take more than two or three hours and are actually a lot of fun, and exams aren't bad at all if you've been keeping up with the material. If nothing else, take this class for a genuinely fun and different QR credit that will actually introduce you to a new way of thinking about the world.",
    "A great class that sets the logical foundations for all of logical thought.Definitely easier for a math\/science major than a liberal arts major, but generally the TAs were accessible and everything was great.",
    "Logic is one of those courses you either love or hate so it is very individualistic and depends on your personal interests. I personally liked it but know people who hated it and dropped it.",
    "Good course if you keep up with the work. Make sure to understand and do all the homeworks."
