    "This class is a great way to become acquainted with certain specific areas in the scientific field. Be sure to look at the topics that will be covered. If you really have an interest in them, take this course. It will provide you enough information to decide if you want to delve deeper into that field.",
    "It is dedicated to many interesting science topics. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to another student, especially those who are not majoring in science.",
    "This course is great for those who would like to learn about a myriad of scientific topics. The modules are very brief, but provide enough information and activities to get a grasp of the subject. Very intriguing and not only for those looking to pursue a major in the STEM field.",
    "If you're looking for a course that will give you a great variety from the wide scope of scientific topics, then this is your course. Not only does it help you delve into many different topics within science(look at the syllabus), but the topics are all taught by Yale's professors in each respective field(no TA's). The course is also very small(for me it's been about 14 students!). You won't regret taking this course. Yes, it's a year long course, and yes, it seems unfortunate that you have to take both semesters to get the the full credit, but in retrospect, this course hasn't been heavy in coursework at all. The small class size has also let me become good friends with my classmates. In addition, Professor Kankel, the primary professor for this course, is a particularly charismatic guy who's more than willing to further explain whatever it is that you have questions about. You'll enjoy this course! Good luck!",
    "SCIE 030 allows students to learn about aspects of science that directly affect their daily lives in a fun seminar environment. I would recommend this course to students who want to know more about current issues that are being discussed in science without having to take many of the advanced courses that discuss these things."
