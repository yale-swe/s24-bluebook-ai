    "Overview of the current topics that are relevant to Asia, including BRI, Asean, Arctic, human trafficking, cyber surveillance, and business practices.",
    "A good survey of ASEAN, surveillance in china, China's arctic policy, business\/corporate responsibility, human trafficking, and other current events in China",
    "more in depth examination of china's Belt and Road Initiative, china's plans for the Arctic, use of AI and surveillance tech and ways to evade, human trafficking in southeast asia, rule of law and the ASEAN charter",
    "deep understanding of some key issues in asia (particularly China and Southeast Asia) and how they affect human rights",
    "I learned so much about East and Southeast Asia because of this class. I really liked hearing from the guest speakers, in particular. Because of this class, I want to take a lot more classes on this region.",
    "I learned that ASEAN decisions have to be unanimous, and that BRI is important, and that artificial intelligence is big in China's surveillance of its people. Not much else stuck, honestly, due to the haphazardness of the course.",
    "Long readings sometimes feel disconnected from the issues. More of a lecture than a seminar, but we cover interesting topics.",
    "A human rights view of SE Asia + a lot of China-based current events.",
    "I learned about a variety of topics like human trafficking, economic development, the fragmentation of ASEAN.",
    "Although the class was marketed as one which required extensive background knowledge of Asia, the knowledge gained in this class is definitely shallow and somewhat rudimentary. The content covered was very similar to other classes and not enough time was spent on a topic to really gain much insight. In fact, many topics seemed repetitive. I feel like I can count off the total number of things I learned with my fingers.",
    "An overview of Human Rights issues with particular regards to East Asian and Southeast Asian politics.",
    "I learned about ASEAN. Vaguely.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very interesting and relevant topic, covered some issues that every Yale student should know about, always dynamic and interesting because of all of the speakers (I don't think professor Tsu ever taught 2 classes in a row) Weaknesses: it was unclear how we were being evaluated - literally all of the grade seemed to be this final paper for which we had insufficient guidance",
    "Strengths: good way to get a survey of current events happening in asia (mostly east asia and southeast asia) Weaknesses: the class is a bit disorganized. we jump from topic to topic, and we don't really synthesize the ideas enough. I think the class would benefit if there were more structure. For example, how do China's Arctic Policy, BRI, surveillance all come together to explain China's past and trajectory into the future? Or what about ASEAN? Overall, I feel like these examples would be good as case studies or examples in showing a larger theme about Asia. Prof. Tsu is obviously an amazing professor and knows a lot. It'd be good to see how these fit into her thesis about asia",
    "guest lecturers were really great",
    "strengths: very engaging instructors, good mix between lecture and seminar-style, interesting guest speakers weaknesses: no overall, overarching narrative to the course, and no feedback throughout the semester",
    "Strengths: good readings, awesome guest speakers. I learned a lot. Weakness: I'd love to have supplementary readings that cover some of the history, since I bet the history can explain a lot.",
    "The course felt thrown together as we went along, despite the fact that it's been offered a couple of times in the past. The readings did not have much of a common thread, and topics \/ class format tended to jump around, so it was often difficult to know what to expect. Some weeks you'll be assigned an entire book or two, and some weeks you'll have a total of about 30 pages of reading, and you'll often not even discuss readings you spent a lot of time on. It is hard to be critically engaged with a course where it doesn't feel like the professors are matching your engagement, and the fact that the course was co-taught (not advertised at first, I should add) makes this all the more egregiously bad. If you're interested in Asia, there are better courses at Yale.",
    "weaknesses- a bit of a Leminar this year and maybe too many guest lectures. Strengths- insights of classmates and interesting material!",
    "Strength: the course covers a lot of interesting topics Weakness: the class felt like a series of guest lectures, the small essay assignments Professor Tsu assigned were never graded (we didn't get feedback)",
    "The course can introduce you to certain new topics that can be interesting, but it doesn't delve deeply enough into the material. Furthermore, the topics are organized somewhat arbitrarily and vary depending on the availability of the speakers. Not enough analysis or insight is offered, even with the readings. Discussions don't truly discuss the readings, but end up pivoting around these random and vague discussions that continue to occur. The greatest weakness was the absence of an instructor. There were too many \"guest lecturers\" who weren't aware of what we were learning and offered superficial amount of knowledge. At one point, class consisted of a video that we had to \"watch.\" Any form of discussion was then relegated to email correspondence.",
    "Strengths: The diversity and somewhat depth of the topics discussed. It is one of the few classes where I can see both breadth and depth being integrated into the lectures. Weaknesses: The course feels a bit disjointed, at times hard to navigate. This is especially true when it comes to assignments.",
    "Honestly, lots of room for improvement. It just wasnt engaging, and everything could be learn by reading news headlines about China.",
    "smaller class size would be better"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you are sick of taking history classes on epochs that are long gone. The biggest appeal for me was the fact that this class is relevant right now and deals with issues that we read about in the news.",
    "If you want to look at contemporary issues in Asia, this is a neat class. Overall, it is a bit disorganized. It's more of a series of guest lectures than it is a streamlined course though.",
    "yes! the final paper at the end really forces you to dive deep into a topic of your choosing, and the coursework prior to that helps lay down some foundational knowledge for topic you might be looking into",
    "yes!",
    "Yes, especially one who doesn't know much about East and SE Asia but is curious about it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this, not even if the topics addressed interest you. It was supposed to be a seminar, but Prof Tsu accepted around 35 people, so discussion was hardly ever productive. Take courses where the professor seems to care a bit more -- there are guest speakers for almost half of class meetings, which I saw as incredibly lazy teaching. However, it's worth noting that if you're interested in Southeast Asia and human rights specifically, the professors organize a summer workshop in Asia that you might have the opportunity to attend if you write an outstanding paper at the end of the course.",
    "This is a good course to learn about current social issues in Asia, specifically Southeast Asia and China. There are a couple of short position papers on readings (graded for participation) and one long 20 page final essay. It's not a huge workload aside from the final paper",
    "Yes- it was easy and straightforward, but maybe dont go in expecting a rigorous and engaging course. The material is fascinating but if it remains a leminar, the large size somewhat disincentivizes doing and engaging in all of the material\/readings",
    "Yes if you want to have a survey course.",
    "Unless you really want to work with the instructor, I wouldn't recommend this course. You can cover the same material in one of the instructor's other lectures rather than in a seminar. There is no increased engagement or knowledge to be gained that can not be picked up from the internet.",
    "Yes, but especially if you are not familiar with East and Southeast Asian politics already. If you are, it might be a bit slow-paced.",
    "Not really, no.",
    "YES, great professor!"
