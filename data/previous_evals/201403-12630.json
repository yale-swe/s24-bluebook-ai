   "comments": [
    "It comes down to this question: Is is worth taking Oceans, Atmospheres, and Environmental Change when you are forced to take this tedious lab along with it? My answer is Yes. The main course is interesting, and although the lab reports are very tedious, the lab is interesting too.",
    "EVST 201 is a fantastic class, and this lab is required for it. I'd say the lab is worth it for that class. You do learn some useful information (like using instruments, working with data, 4-minute speech to your section on global warming) if you're interested in geology or the environment, though it's not particularly enthralling. The field trip to Qpac river was cool, and setting off the weather balloon. It's not a hard lab class and lab reports are only every other week (though lab is every week for 1:50), for a total of 5 labs. Don't be put off by the class just because of the lab.",
    "Wouldn't take it for fun, but if you are taking Atmospheres, it is a helpful supplement (and required).",
    "If you take EVST 201 then 202L is required. If you want to major in EVST, you must take 201. It's that simple. In general its a pretty practical and interesting half credit with out a outrageous amount of work (4 lab reports, 1 debate, and a final).",
    "Frustrating but necessary; the class is worth taking even with the mandatory lab, luckily!",
    "Obviously obly take it if it's a requirement, but it will be an easy half credit.",
    "Take it if you have to for EVST\/GG but you wont really learn stuff that is applicable for majors other than those 2.",
    "Not bad. take it.",
    "not if you don't have to. too much work for a half credit.",
    "EVST 202L is a straightforward lab: 10 meetings, 5 lab reports, and a small number of experiments. A lot more qualitative info on the final than expected. I would recommend this course if you are taking EVST 201. If not, don't take it.",
    "I thought it was a fine lab, some of the activities (like the field trip and the weather balloons) were pretty cool, but the labs themselves could get tedious. Not super difficult or time consuming though.",
    "This is a really annoying part of EVST 202",
    "So this lab is super easy--only five lab reports, and it only meets for two hours a week. That being said, it was the most annoying credit or half credit I've taken. The lab reports are incredibly tedious (just a lot of excel) and the lab final was frustratingly difficult. Unfortunately, the lab is required if you're taking the class, so there's not much you can do about it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "You have to take it if you're taking EVST 201. It's not terrible, and it's not much work, but it's not particularly interesting at points. The last lab is a good time (climate change debate).",
    "The lab is OK, fairly interesting. The field trip is great!",
    "Definitely take the lab if you are taking the course--it will help you conceptualize a lot of the topics brought up in the lecture! Also, it's a true half-credit course, with lab reports due only every other week.",
    "EVST 202L does a good job of illustrating some concepts discussed in 201. It can be kind of boring at times, but going exciting is exciting, and it's much shorter than a normal lab.",
    "A required accompaniment to the 201 course, the lab provides supplemental material in a simple, manageable format.",
    "Honestly, it's rather dull (although it has the potential of being exciting and interesting) and inefficient. However it's required if you take the class. It's not an overwhelming amount of work as long as you don't save the lab reports for last minute.",
    "Somewhat painful but required if you want to take the lecture.",
    "If you're taking EVST 202, you can't not take it without the lab. If you are unable to spend time outside class on the lab and not an EVST major, you'll have to think carefully about whether or not you can commit."
