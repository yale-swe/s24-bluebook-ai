    "A great intermediate spanish course. Definitely recommend it to fellow students.",
    "Best Spanish class I've ever taken, which isn't saying a whole lot, but I had fun and got better at the language. How much you improve is dependant on how much work you put in, but Sebastian Diaz keeps things interesting. He is an amazing teacher, very fatherly and good-natured. If you are going to take Spanish, try to take it with Diaz.",
    "I loved it. Then again, I've loved taking Spanish at Yale in general, so take that with a grain of salt. If you can, TAKE IT WITH SEBASTIAN DIAZ.",
    "I think the important thing is to have a good teacher, so take it with Diaz",
    "If you need a language you gotta do it",
    "Definitely. Especially recommend picking Prof. Diaz.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 130 if you want to improve your fluency in the language.",
    "It's a good course if you want a lot of practice in grammar, reading and listening comprehension, and basic speaking. I feel like I learned a lot and my basic skills are a lot better. Diaz is a great teacher and I would definitely take L4 with him. There's a lot of daily homework, but it's never more than one or two worksheets. There's a lot of homework and practice in listening skills too, like listening and responding to dialogues and monologues.",
    "I would say that Spanish 130 06 covers the grammar of the spanish language very well, and introduces a little bit of vocabulary. Yes, I would recommend this course, with a specific recommendation on having this professor.",
    "An intermediate level Spanish course that will force you to master mostly high school concepts. Yes, it greatly aids in your ability to control the language."
