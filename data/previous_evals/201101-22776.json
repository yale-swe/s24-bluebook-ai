    "DS spring philosophy is an excellent course. The material built on itself and was directly responsive; the questions the material posed were on the highest order of importance; and, true to the purpose of DS, we could very much watch the intellectual tradition unfold before our eyes. The Kant\/Hume divide, which sits at the heart of the semester, opens the course up to a lot of personal development, as well. Paul Grimstad is an excellent professor: engaged, dynamic, and extremely responsive--and all around good guy.",
    "DS Philosophy is great, and with Grimstad, it's even better. He's a great professor and was always incredibly nice and helpful, and ran a great class. Whereas other DS sections you were expected to make certain contributions every class, he definitely understood that Philosophy had to be a little different, and would do his best every class to elucidate the philosophy for us and to answer all of our questions. He was a decently easy grader as well.",
    "If you're into philosophy, this would be the ideal introduction to modern philosophy. The focus is almost 50\/50 on metaphysics and ethical philosophy, so you get a good taste of both.",
    "Long and hard, especially the Kant. But philosophy was definitely rewarding and mind warping!",
    "I would absolutely recommend Directed Studies. It is about as much work as you can assign yourself freshman year, but more than worth it. Also although it is time consuming the work itself is not particularly strenuous-- a lot of reading, that's all, and a 5 pg paper that you whip out by the end of the year. The professors and the small seminars make it all worthwhile. The Directed Studies environment is incredibly intellectually stimulating and makes you feel part of a community instantly at yale.",
    "If you're reading this, you are probably already through a semester of DS and know the basics. If you like learning during section, this section is for you. If you like class discussion about the material, this section is great. If having an excited professor is critical for maintaining your attention during class, this one is for you. All in all, a phenomenal course taught by a very cool professor.",
    "DS Philosophy second semester benefits from its impressive breadth, depth, and diversity of opinion, whereas the first semester could get a little monotonous what with reading the same two writers (albeit important writers) for the majority of the time. So if you enjoyed first semester, or even if you didn't, I would wholeheartedly recommend continuing. As for Grimstad, you couldn't possibly side with a better teacher. He knows his stuff, and knows it with such warmth, enthusiasm, and adventurousness, that I looked forward to class every Tuesday and Thursday. Take this class with Grimstad!",
    "YES! The works are amazing!!!",
    "It's like finishing your veggies for a student who's not predisposed to philosophical thought and rigorous exercises in logical argumentation -- not altogether unpleasant given the benefits but not a treat either. For the philosophically disposed, I imagine it's like dessert.",
    "I would recommend that students take DS Philosophy in the spring. I found that in relation to the fall, the works we read in spring DS Philosophy felt much more relevant, which I appreciated. The amount of reading seemed more manageable, and having knowledge of ancient philosophy to relate to modern philosophy made me feel well-equipped to contribute in section. I had much more fun in the spring course than I did in the fall."
