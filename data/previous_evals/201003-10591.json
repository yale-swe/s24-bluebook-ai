    "Theorizing Racial Formations is a great introduction to the resources available to students among Yale's incredible faculty. I would recommend it to undergraduates potentially interested in pursuing a graduate degree in African American Studies, in addition to first-year grad students.",
    "I would only recommend this course if someone wanted to have a sense of African American studies as a discipline, in general and at Yale specifically. Otherwise, its scope might be to wide to make it truly worthwhile. It could serve as an interesting introduction, but it is also very challenging for some."

    "This course made me familiar with work from faculty members and others with which I was not previously familiar.",
    "I would be tempted to say that this course has broadened my knowledge of African American Studies, though it did indeed deepen it. Both class discussion and our readings gave me a deeper understanding of a variety of topics related to the discipline. I might re-name the course, however, since it did not always relate directly to Theorizing Racial Formations."
