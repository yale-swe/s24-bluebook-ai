    "You should have a good command of the language already and be able to express everything you want to say, not necessarily with very complex words, in French. This way you can really participate in the continued conversations\/discussions\/enactions on which the course is based. Prof Schneider is a great instructor and you will benefit and enjoy this course on many different levels: language, culture, personal interaction.",
    "If you're looking to work on and improve your French, would highly recommend! The class was very small so we got a lot of personal attention, and Professor Schneider is always very enthusiastic during class and easy to approach for questions or extra help. Keep in mind though that the course is a lot of work, and you usually don't find out what essays\/exercises\/quizzes will be due week-to-week until the Friday before.",
    "I would say it is a great continuation of previous French courses and clarifies areas of confusion that may have arisen in previous years of studying French.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who have previous knowledge of French, because the level is not easy.",
    "I would summarize it as a rigorous review of French in preparation for advanced levels. I would highly recommend the class to anyone interested in improving their language skills!",
    "Fren 150 is a difficult class that focuses on improving speech and grammar skills. The class uses literature and films to better increase comprehension and listening ability. The class has a heavy workload that often involves lots of grammar exercises and reading, but overall, the class was definitely great and rewarding."
