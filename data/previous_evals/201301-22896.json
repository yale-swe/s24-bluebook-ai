    "Very interesting! Eye opening and really changes the way you think.",
    "Yes, absolutely! It was a great class with a lot of intriguing discussions, and the professor is awesome. She can be intimidating at first, especially when it comes to writing papers, but she's a really fair grader, and really cares about the material. Each week, we did \"Race in the News\" updates, and shared with the class. ~1 book per week, but the books could sometimes be quite long and abstract or repetitive. Overall, this was a great class.",
    "Interesting class about an important topic. Take it!",
    "An overall great class. Great mix of historical and contemporary issues. I really feel as if I came out knowing how to talk about race, a skill that's so crucial to have nowadays. Workload is a bit heavy with a book a week most weeks, but it's manageable. Lauren's great!",
    "I would highly recommend AFAM 318 to other students, especially those who have not had the opportunity to discuss racial issues in an academic setting and would like to read the literature on the topic. Although it can be tough to keep up with the reading, it is well worth your while to do as much of it as you can each week. It also helps enhance the discussion when everyone is on the same page.",
    "Yes, I would recommend AFAM 318 to another student, although I resist giving an overzealous recommendation. The workload tends on the heavy side, and weekly reading responses can become annoying quickly. Professor Pearlman is wonderful, and she is definitely the strength of the course; however, you might get more out of the material by skipping the class, taking a syllabus, and simply reading the books on your own. Not much added benefit to taking the course, unless you're writing your senior thesis on a relevant topic."
