    "This course provided me with a great deal of raw information about the Progressive Era, the New Deal, and the Great Society. On a very basic level, I learned a lot.On a slightly higher level, I feel like I am much more interested in politics qua politics much more than I was before, and I can see it playing a much larger role in my future research than I had previously anticipated.",
    "This is the first time I've taken a course in American politics \/ American political theory, so it was mostly new to me. However, I was astonished by the amount of overlap between (particularly) early 20th century American political thought and the areas of Continental philosophy that I study (particularly German theories of state and legitimacy)."
