   "comments": [
    "French 140 is difficult but if you want to learn more grammar and have the opportunity to read more, I would recommend it. Definitely take it with Madame Koizim if you can.",
    "I would recommend this class for students looking to get proficient in French.",
    "A good follow up to French 130. Koizim is a great teacher but this class is a ton of nightly work and can be hard to get excited about, in its nature. She really cares and tries to alleviate that, and your class will rarely be dull with her.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, but it is a time commitment. The grammar becomes slightly more arcane and obscure, so I don't think it is necessary to achieve merely conversational French. However, if you do like reading in a foreign language and discussion, you will like this class (as long as you are willing to put in the work!)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone wanting to continue their french studies. Warning: the movies you have to watch are depressing so bring tissues.",
    "TAKE THIS WITH KOIZIM. It's not easy, and everything you read is incredibly sad, but definitely worth it if you're interested in French or need a language requirement.",
    "Constant and very heavy workload, even compared to prior French courses, but I definitely felt like I learned a lot. Films and literature put the grammar lessons in context, and this course is especially strong in teaching history and culture of francophone lands in addition to the language itself. Didn't enjoy Symphonie Pastorale, really enjoyed Diversit, Un Sac de Billes, and most of the films. Definitely don't take this course for \"an easy 1.5 credits\", but if you're willing and able to put in the work, French IV with Ruth is great."
