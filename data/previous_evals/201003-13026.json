   "comments": [
    "French 150 was a combination of grammar practice and reading comprehension. We read many novels and watched good films both of which sparked great in class discussions as well as analytical papers. The intense grammar practice really transformed our writing. The class is a fair amount of work, both reading and writing but definitely worth it.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. The workload isn't huge and the reading is enjoyable, but there's never more than 30 pages between classes. The movies that were chosen were fun to watch and because they are modern, they allow a certain aspect of current French culture to be studied.",
    "It is a course that overviews French grammar, introduces the understanding and reading of French novels and plays and watching of French movies, and focuses on conversation and discussion skills. Definitely worth taking.",
    "French 150 is a class for those wishing to brush up on vocabulary, grammar, and oral French skills. It does a good job of hitting on major categories of French: written, aural, and oral, as well as enriching a student's vocabulary. After taking the class, I feel I have a greater fluency in the language. In addition, I found the texts and films in the class very apropos and interesting.",
    "Yes, this is a good class. Lots of conversation, which is really the most important thing, and good films and books on the syllabus. I think it's better than 130 + 140 in terms of my actual interest in the material."
