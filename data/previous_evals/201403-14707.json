    "Only take it if you are going into finance. For example, if you took Financial Theory with John Geanakoplos and liked the parts about callable bonds and credt default swaps, and want to learn more, take this class. Otherwise, don't bother; you'll learn how to price a dozen kinds of securities, and although Black-Scholes and the binomial pricing model are interesting, you probably won't ever need this knowledge in your career\/life.",
    "I would recommend this class. The workload is reasonably light - the homework is optional and the cases don't take too much time. The first midterm was easy, but the class average was 112\/197. If you study the material, you should be able to do significantly better than this. The second midterm was harder in my opinion, but if you prepare for the exams in this class, there is no reason to get a below average grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is already somewhat familiar with capital markets or someone who is taking this as a Credit\/D\/Fail course. For an undergraduate, the coursework is very hard to balance with the other courses you are taking.",
