   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class! It's a lot of work, but it is incredibly rewarding. As an English major, this class entirely changed my understanding and outlook on language in general, and has improved my writing ability drastically.",
    "Beckett is a hefty course, one that is worth taking if you're into critical theory and heavy literary analysis.",
    "This course was unbelievable--Sam See is an absolutely gem. I learned such an extraordinary amount about a very difficult author, and left with a strong grasp of Samuel Beckett's work. DEFINITELY take it and do not be intimated by Beckett--the way that Professor See teaches the course is one that makes it accessible to everyone!",
    "This is a class that basically covers all of Beckett. Three papers (two little, one big) and a bunch of random assignments like secondary source analyses and peer reviews, etc. It's a hefty undertaking, but very worth it if you have any interest in Beckett. I loved this class. If I had to start over I would take it again, and I would highly recommend it.",
    "If you like Samuel Beckett, it's definitely a good class to take. I think you get a lot more out of taking the class than you would reading by yourself. In addition to class discussion, there are student performances, frequent connections to other artworks and critical theories, and close attention to details and patterns in Beckett's work (it would be worth it to take the class just for discussions of negation and holes, I think.)You read his major novels, pretty much all of his theater, a lot of his short prose and miscellaneous writings, and his poems (though they are sort of skimmed over and not discussed much), as well as secondary articles and essays about them. I don't think it was necessarily way more reading than you would get in another English class, but it felt like a lot, especially on weeks where you read several short works, letters about them, and a couple of secondary essays. We usually didn't discuss everything, and sometimes it felt like we didn't discuss anything very thoroughly (the professor was very clear about this at the beginning of the semester-- there really was too much reading for thorough discussion of everything to be possible.) There were weekly forum posts as well, which were meant to be in conversation with each other like an extension of the class discussion, which sometimes made limited discussion time less frustrating.",
    "TAKE IT. It's a packed reading list (we covered basically all of Beckett plus some pretty heavy secondary source readings) but totally worth it. A really diverse group of people, too - lots of theater majors, but many others as well. Sam See is by far the best professor I've had at Yale. He expects so much from his students but gives back so much more. It was such an incredible privilege to work with a teacher who cares so much about actually teaching.",
    "Samuel Beckett is a very demanding and very rewarding course. By the end of the semester, you will have read almost all of the author's work. Secondary texts, contemporary artwork, and student performances are intermixed with Beckett's texts to provide a variety of analytic springboards. The in-depth and interdisciplinary discussions that result are more than worth the heavy reading load. I would recommend this course to anyone willing to commit themselves to the reading and ready to explore the many fascinating and destabilizing paradoxes that abound in Beckett's oeuvre.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this class. Great professor. There's a significant amount of work, but it's incredibly fulfilling.",
    "An absolute avalanche of work, but one that will open your eyes not only to Beckett but to modernism and postmodernism as well."
