    "This Spanish class is perfect for fulfilling the language requirement; it's kind of fun and not too much work. However, even though it's not very hard you might not end up with a stellar grade. This class is good if you have fairly proficient Spanish and just want an opportunity to speak a bit, but it's not good if you really want to improve. I don't think my Spanish speaking skills increased at all over the course of this class.",
    "I would recommend the course but make sure you find a professor that you like.",
    "This is not just a conversation class; there is a significant amount of reading as well. The class is not an easy A, but will improve your Spanish if you do all the assigned work. One of the fun projects of the class was that was that we had a trial and students were assigned characters from a book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The class was more fun than Spanish 4. Since the class is a conversation class, you definitely have to speak Spanish; I would not recommend the class to people who are hesitant to speak up in every class.",
    "It's a great class and a lot of fun. The work is not too bad, and anyone who wants to speak Spanish better should take this class.",
    "If you are interested in improving your Spanish, this is a great class for it. My conversational and written Spanish has improved from taking this class."
