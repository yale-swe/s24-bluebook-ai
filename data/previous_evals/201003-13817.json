   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed and Fred were good critics who allowed us to develop ideas on our own. They questioned many things and helped the broader discussion. I wondered how such a diverse group of students with different backgrounds would be put together into studio. I think Ed and Fred balanced the class well.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0It was much more difficult for our instructors to be effective since we had a bad student-teacher ratio. As post-pro students we come with various strengths and weaknesses. In the situation as it was, the instructors had to spend more time with students who really needed the attention, and those that were able to pace themselves effectively did not get the same time. Again, this is not a critique of the instructors. The times in which I was able to have good conversations, they were very helpful. I just wish it had been more consistent.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0I particularly enjoyed his ability to easily fluctuate between the various theories and critiques of both the past and the present, and find their critical application within my work. This being the Post Pro studio, I had come in with my own presuppositions, prejudices, and concerns, and was more than adequately confronted and challenged therein. This was due in no small amount to Ed's consideration of such a myriad of architectural criticism, and distillation of it into an applicable practice.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed was strong professor and I ultimately felt that the studio was very rewarding. However, I think it would have benefitted the studio to dive into the project sooner because I feel that the final result was closer to a midterm quality presentation across the board, rather than truly completed ideas. Also, reviews should have been set up better to reflect the progress of the studio.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed was overloaded. Too many students and not enough resources for him to address them all. Fred was wonderful when present, but his availability is limited and he should be put in a role that better suits that availability.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0I am very unsure as to how to write this response because I am of two very distinct minds. I am very appreciative of how the studio allowed each student to investigate what they thought was meaningful about architecture and I for me it brought back into focus why I think architecture is important and what it can do.But at the same time you removed (intentionally?) many of the disciplinarycrutches that architects rely upon. We had no true site (a region, sure, even cities in which we were interested, but no site that we could react to), no program (in many ways you seemed hostile to the notion of program driving a project - and you have probably converted me to that viewpoint), and no client or as is usually the case in school a professor with a strong pedagogical viewpoint. In one sense this is good because it forced us to determine what we think is important about architecture, but on the other hand it gives us very little to react against.I think the scheduling of the semester limited our ability to create meaningful projects. The fact the our mid-semester review was our third crit is a little strange. Although I\u0092m interested in the project and I would be excited to see where it would head, I feel like this is the worst collection of work I have ever pinned up for a final review and I don\u0092t know if I\u0092ll ever put it in a portfolio to show a potential employer or client. I\u0092m embarrassed by the lack of sophistication of what I\u0092ve produced.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed Mitchell can be an excellent critic, but the size of the studio often left him stretched for time and focus. One suggestion would be to structure the studio to include more desk critiques. While group pin-ups at the beginning of the studio are helpful for theoretical explorations, some projects fail to fully develop without adequate one-on-one interaction. This is recognized as a teaching style choice, but many students find desk crits extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0I understand that both Professor Mitchell and Professor Koetter wanted to challenge us by being \u0091cryptic\u0092 in the comments they would make during desk-crits. However, it would be more helpful if they could be a little more direct in their critique throughout the semester- not just the last 2 weeks of class.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0The M.Arch II studio has the reputation of not being the \u0091crown jewel\u0092 of the Masters programs at Yale. Professor Mitchell\u0092s conduct as de facto director of the program further reinforces this already widespread perception.Mastery of the subject:Undeniably, Professor Mitchell is aware of the breadth of topics, but having completed the semester I would wonder if given a survey how manyof his students could recall the four urbanism themes he stressed during the course of the term.Receptivity:Professor Mitchell did not seem very receptive to challenging ideas or processes, and after hearing or seeing explorations would often offer not encouragement or discouragement and thus, perhaps added no value as a critic. At the beginning of the semester he clearly directed students to not pursue challenging architectural projects and then at the end of the semester complained that the studio projects turned out too conservative.Ability to communicate ideas:By only casually and at seemingly the last minute announcing that all project needed to be a train station and \u0091something else,\u0092 it gave the impression of grasping for a direction of the studio. Further more, after repeating the four styles of urbanism Professor Mitchell wanted the class to grasp he would then discourage the deployment of these ideas in certain projects, which seemed confusing.Ability to encourage exploration:Professor Mitchell is more negative than encouraging, and if not negative.Availability:Professor Mitchell was not available, despite advertising the post-pro studio as an introduction to the program and himself, as the de facto program advisor.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Perhaps what I found most valuable about this studio, even more important than a final design I can put in a portfolio, is the way Ed and Fred forced each of us out of our design comfort zone and tried to break the design habits we had depended on in our undergraduate programs and professional experience. I learned as much about architectural history in this design studio than I have in past architectural history courses, because Ed and Fred were constantly encouraging me to looking at different architects and recommending that I look at certain projects as precedents. This studio broadened my knowledge of contemporary and historic architecture and broadened my design vocabulary. I feel this studio was an appropriate stepping stone to advanced studios, and made me feel prepared and interested to take studios outside my comfort zone.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0I particularly enjoyed our discussions of theory. Both of the professors encourage students to come up with an idea and go after it. This was a very important part of the studio and I found it to be a liberating and rewarding experience."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "The content of the studio was very much as I expected, but I wish I received more direct feedback from the faculty.",
    "I didn't know what to expect but I did end up working hard and being pushed. Grad school to me shouldn't be about being comfortable and doing the same thing over again so I am happy to say that I learned quite a bit about things like urbanism and computer applications.",
    "I expected to improve my understanding of the theoretical implications of architecture and urbanism. I expected better work and a more critical dialogue. I also expected greater investment in my own research interests.Unfortunately, with 17 students fighting for attention it seemed difficult to get better feedback in the studio time allotted, and it becomes more difficult, without resistance, to improve. Although I learned a lot, this knowledge was never manifest in a clearer, and more theoretically interesting design exercise.",
    "I went in with not a lot of expectations. But I do feel that the course was effectively challenging on all scales and in all media that I have a good understanding of my strengths and weaknesses that I can continue to work on in the upcoming studios.",
    "It would have been more useful to have a clear delineation between the urban and architectural portions of the studio. As is was, the urban design crept forward into the semester not leaving time give the architecture its due attention.",
    "Not really having a choice as to whether or not to take this particular studio, I had no expectations as to what it might entail. Thus, nothing was either met or missed. Rather, I was terribly delighted by how well the course demands encouraged me to keep working at a consistently high level. The scope of the studio worked from the urban down to the architectonic with rather ease, and was a nice segue from my undergraduate studies and concerns to those of a more critical approach as graduate school is concerned.",
    "I expected students to be encouraged to push their own ideas through original research and design. I feel that as a whole the studio was not nearly aggressive enough in pursuing original design strategies and many students fell back onto what they are comfortable with. While I understand it is each student's own choice, more explorative projects would benefit everyone's learning experience.",
    "I had very high expectations and was disappointed on many levels:1. group work - coming from working in an office I was excited to explore my own work and the first half of the semester is focused on group work and I see this being a trend within the school and other advanced studios. This is definitely valuable for M.Arch I students but I will have to start selecting studios based on who will actually let me work on my own.2. resources and attention: I was consistently let to work with little professorial oversight. I was later told that this was because I was one of the stronger students and that the professors efforts had to spent helping the weaker students. I could have been ignored at other schools with shorter programs. I came to Yale because I was promised small class sizes and more personal attention.3. As a married student, I found it frustrating that I was called a 'leader' by the professor and then subsequently told to spend more time in studio late at night to help the other students.I think this culminates in realizing that if the school is going to have 17 students in a class then they should provide the necessary resources to ensure the success of the students.I will be following up my concerns personally with the dean.",
    "My expectations for this studio were probably unrealistic, but Fred and Ed make the studio agenda very clear from the beginning. This is one of the strengths of the studio, although it may be challenging for some students to reconcile.",
    "I can firmly say that this studio was a challenge. Yet I feel that I have gained valuable insight about urban and architectural design, as well as my own abilities as an architect and how I can push myself to achieve a more thoughtful expression of architecture.",
    "I expected the studio to address urban issues pertaining specifically to real problems within the United States or to problems in other contries experiencing dramatic urban change. I expected, as a mandatory introduction to the post-pro program, that the studio would facilitate the introduction of other faculty and courses to the incoming post-pro class.",
    "I expected to be more intensely directed by the studio professors. The benefit to a more self-directed approach is that there was less of a focus on approval from the professor, and more of a focus on learning, thinking about what my goals were for the project, and thinking about what my goals are as an architect going forward. The downside of a more self-directed approach is that more than once I got stuck in a rut with my design, and more critical evaluation by a studio professor would have been helpful in getting out of that rut.",
    "I expected it to be as difficult as it was and was happy to do the work.This studio was one of the great pleasures of my academic career."

   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you-library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the work assigned?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, all of the resources were very adequate.",
    "yes, the facilities are great. however:1. Please don't turn off the main lights at midnight, it makes it more difficult to work (especially if you had to build a model).2. Those waterless urinals in the 7th floor bathroom are pretty terrible.3. Couldn't this post pro studio be moved to the 4th floor? I enjoy the enclave and protection but the isolation from the rest makes it difficult to be involved with the school. we are already disadvantaged by having one less year to get to know people, it would be great to be in closer proximity to the others. Grad school is about people too.",
    "Generally, yes.",
    "The resources of the school are excellent.",
    "One day check out policy in the library presented an issue.",
    "My only suggestion would concern the RenderFarm's ability to work with the Brazil render engine (or lack thereof). Having my computer's processors dog down on a final rendering more than inhibited my ability to continue any concurrent digital work.",
    "Everything was made readily available. However, the amount of design work necessary for urban and architectural projects left little time for intensive fabrication. I think that for an intro studio it would good to reach a level of resolution that allowed time for a wider use of the school's facilities, many had to design up until the review, which leaves no time to use the tools.",
    "yes.",
    "We had all of the resources we needed and that is not to be undervalued. It's also the first time I have ever been able to say that.Not being able to check books out of the library is kinda silly.",
    "Resources are never a problem at Yale. Fantastic.",
    "If there can be any way to increase personal pin-up space for the aisle desks, it would be a great help.",
    "Software and fabrication tools were adequate, as was studio\/desk space. The double computer monitors were very helpful in using multiple programs simultaneously.",
    "We basically didn't have a TA, which could have been useful. Thankfully, the other students had very diverse skill sets I was able to learn a lot of the computer programs from them.The library needs to make an exception for books being used in studio. Can we at least get two at a time?Space was adequate, but the architect is always pining for more. It could be nice to have some shelves so that students have a place to preserve their study models over the course of the semester.",
    "I had access to almost everything I needed. My only small complaints are that many of our desks in studio do not have access to any adjacent pin-up wall space for individual use, and the restrooms are often out of order on our floor."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "The most valuable part of the studio for me was when Professor Plattus came for a review at the end of the semester, I wish that had occurred sooner in the semester. The initial research and precedent study took too much of the semester and didn't allow us to devote enough time to the studio project itself.",
    "I don't think we needed to spend as much time on the instant city\/precedent parts. They were important but it really made it hard to develop anything in time.",
    "There needs to be more face to face time for desk-crits, or there has to be more rigorous, regularly scheduled pinups to solicit more feedback.This studio seems to have too many variables and would benefit from the introduction of some parameters. While the attitude that \"everything's on the table\" is a very positive stance taken by the professors and could, for some, lead to more speculative work, there are benefits to limitations and the ingredients of friction and resistance.",
    "With so many students, pin-ups were challenging. It was hard to get engaged with all of the work as spending just a little time with each project as a group became very tedious.Desk crits were much more helpful as the class could work while the discussions were taking place.The best improvement would be a very engaged studio assistant that could help organize and coordinate the studio while providing desk crits.",
    "More interaction with professors from outside the studio earlier might have been useful. The informal review with professor Platus was exceptionally useful but came perhaps too late in the semester.",
    "Being a Post Pro studio with students of various backgrounds, I found pin-ups more than helpful, being surrounded by such a diverse group of persons and opinions really helping to open discussions as wide as possible.Desk-crits had the tendency to slow down throughout the day, benefiting those in earlier positions with longer and more attentive critiques. While I understand this is a natural effect of the human condition and weariness, any attempt at rectifying it would no doubt be beneficial.Of all the activities we engaged in, I found the reading discussions least helpful. While I understand their place and role within the course, I did not feel that they in any way encouraged me to reconsider my work, or approach the problem fundamentally different.",
    "The most valuable aspect was the desk crits and small group pinups, where projects were intensely looked at. The least useful aspect were full studio pinups, I think this stemmed from a difficulty of Ed and Fred to stay focused when reviewing students together, as each were very quick to get off topic and reviews became extremely repetitive.",
    "See above for the some of the concerns.some of the juries seem to be so large that the student is left out, thus negating the process. It would be interesting to see a progressive institution like Yale actually focus on the jury process.",
    "The studio was well run in terms of it's mix of activities. It would have been nice to have access to more outside experts or supplemental critics, but, in my mind, this is a minor issue and should not distract from the main problem. The student to teacher ratio is out of wack. With 17 students we need more then 1.5 critics (Ed full time and Fred on Thursdays). At the bare minimum we needed two full time studio critics and it would be nice to have . I feltlike the critics were stretched too thin to give meaningful feedback to every student twice a week.",
    "Pin-ups at the beginning of the semester were helpful for group projects.Desk-crits are the best experiences.The midterm review was excellent, especially John McMorrough and Andrew Brenner. Excellent critics.My only suggestion for improvement would be to reduce the number of group pin-ups. Keep the studio broad and wide-ranging, but focus a bit more after midterm and reduce the burden of \"group networks.\"I think the group network concept could emerge more organically. After site selection, a two to three week charrette before midterm could focus on individual project siting and program. At midterm, the critics could focus the discussion on what certain project's \"agenda\" might be, and how that may align with other projects. These connections could establish an emergent network that the students would be left free to decide if they want to \"team up\" for the remainder of the semester. This type of structure may encourage new network concepts beyond obvious, contrived relationships.",
    "Overall, I thought the studio introduced an interesting design problem. As the semester progressed, however, the project became more and more overwhelming because there were so many aspects to tackle in such a small amount of time. While the precedent research was helpful by introducing me to various aspects of city making, I don\u0092t feel that the instant city exploration really helped me conceptually. The time saved could have been used towards actual design work.",
    "I would have preferred more desk-crits and fewer pin-ups. I spent a lot of time preparing presentation level images in order to clearly communicate my ideas to Fred and Ed so that they could weigh in on the design, when that time could have been spent developing the design more fully. I particularly liked the pattern we got into towards the end of the semester where we had more desk-crits, and signed ourselves up in order depending on whether we wanted to meet right away or get a little more work done first.",
    "One way that this studio was criticized by students was that there was not enough direction given by the professors. I enjoyed this very much, though. We were given a lot of freedom to explore an idea and the professors encouraged this exploration by not funneling us all into a certain methodology. By trying to bring out the best in each student's personal methodology, I found the work to be incredibly diverse and interesting.We could have used more desk crits, but the pin-ups were also useful. It is a delicate balance that leaned a little too far to the pin-up this semester.The critics were all pretty great.Last, but not least, Professor Koetter was a perfect counterpart to Professor Mitchell. Prof. Mitchell encourages students to go outside of their comfort zones and search for an architectural idea (which inevitably leads to many failures along the way) and Prof. Koetter is able to then get to the heart of the problem and help find a solution. Great teamwork.I think we could have spent a little less time on the precedent analysis. The Instant City turned outwell and we were only given a weekend to throw it together. I think this same attitude could have been taken with the precedents. In the end, you always need a few more days. I think that these could be days cut from the beginning and added to the end.It was difficult to visit the sites in such a short amount of time. When visiting New Bedford, I was only able to see a small portion of the city. While the premise of the networked cities is strong, it makes it difficult to really get to know the site.",
    "The reviews we had with guest critics were by far the most insightful sessions for the semester. Because there were so many of us, it was often difficult to keep everyone engaged through an entire pin-up without the input of additional critics. It would have been helpful to have 2 or 3 more progress reviews with one or two critics at regular intervals through the main project.I found the initial analysis studies, Instant City exercise and the Views exercise to be valuable additions to our primary objectives, however the first weeks before travel week could have been better spent starting sooner on the design project and considering the sites and approach before we visited. We found by the time we formulated an approach for a city it was a week or two after our trip and we needed to return to cover the right ground in our selected site."
