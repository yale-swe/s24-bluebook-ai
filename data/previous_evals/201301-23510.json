   "comments": [
    "yes.",
    "I honestly just hate math and only took this because that's what pre-med students do. It's nowhere near as terrible as people like to say it is, but it's also definitely not enjoyable. Those P-sets were a nightmare; it helps to do it with friends, especially if those friends took calculus before. Professor Rolf made the class slightly less terrible because he's just a great guy, but I definitely would not recommend MATH 115 to anyone unless they absolutely have to take it or they have an abnormally strong love for calculus.",
    "Good math class; especially nice if you've taken Calc BC in high school. Moves a little quickly but not unreasonably so.",
    "It is challenging, and you will work in this class. Take it if you like math or if its a requirement. If you do not like math, find a gut QR, this class may be the equivalent of a BC calculus course, but it is definitely harder than one.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "If you have to take it I would recommend taking it with Rolf. Be ready for a bunch of kids who have already taken BC to sneak into the class. If you do the problem sets and go to class you'll be fine. If you take advantage of the peer tutors you will probably have a solid grasp of what's going on.",
    "Take this class if you are unsure about 120 but still want a standard Math credit.",
    "Math 115 is a challenging class but well worth taking. You will have to do more work in this class than for your average class, but it is definitely possible to do well in this class.",
    "would recommendtough but necessary",
    "I would recommend it if it helps you for your major or if you enjoy math. If you enjoy calculus, it's not a horrible class.",
    "Good course that is pretty much necessary if you haven't taken Calc 2. I enjoyed learning the material, but be prepared-- the exams are difficult.",
    "This is a very difficult course. From what I've heard from friends, although it is supposedly the equivalent to Calc BC, it is much more rigorous. The class moves very quickly, the psets are ridiculous (often stayed up until 4 am the morning of to finish them), and honestly, I don't think the professors give enough resources in class to reasonably expect us to complete what we're asked to with the problem sets. Yes, there are outside resources (peer tutors, problem solving sessions), but I hear those aren't too helpful either. This is not to say that you shouldn't take this course, however. Chances are, if you're looking at these reviews, you need to take the course for some reason or another. So if you do, definitely take it with Rolf, Tryniecki, or maybe Miriam. I sat in on all of these professors, and these are the best. Also, Rolf started a series of youtube videos at the end of the semester which I think he might continue which are SO USEFUL! Good luck",
    "The quality of the class depends a lot on the professor you have. Rolf is the best, so try to get him. If you don't, you can still get a lot out of the class, but you'll need to keep up the work.",
    "Its easy for people who have taken Calc BC or higher because it covers series and sequences for half the semester.",
    "A very intense math course. I would highly recommend taking this course with Rolf",
    "It was a course filled with enough material to last the entire semester. The material was mostly interesting if math is interesting to you, otherwise it was like most other math classes. It's weakness is definitely the exam; a lot of what is on the exam isn't exactly gone over in class or p-set problems, it's a combination of it all along with a twist. Strengths were that the professor was enthusiastic about the material. Rolf's teaching style is not for everyone. He does not go over everything that will be in the exam, rather he emphasizes that you have to read the textbook to get all the material. He does not write a lot of notes on the board and he does plenty of practice problems in class. Most of the time he is on top of his organization,on occasion it seems to get away from him and he misses some minimal things. He definitely doesn't teach to the test, so there's a lot of self teaching.",
    "It's calc II, under Rolf, it stresses learning he principles and ideas behind equations and theorems, in order to apply them to many different problems.",
    "quite time consuming",
    "No. I think it is pretty poorly taught and without inspiring instruction the material is not captivating enough.",
    "It was definitely a challenging course. I took the same course in high school and I feel like I got more out of it because it was a smaller class size and a more hands-on learning experience. This time taking it felt more rushed. It took it for a premed requirement, so in that sense, I would definitely recommend it because taking calculus is necessary."
