    "Be prepared to read more than you read in the first semester, especially towards the end. Over Spring Break, we read the 1200+ paged War and Peace, on which we spent two weeks in class, and then we read another three novels, one per week. That said, the second term of DS is still fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this class! I enjoyed every session.",
    "Honestly, I loved the literature track throughout DS, and particularly this semester with this professor. If they ever get round to switching Flaubert with any female 19th century author and adding in Toni Morrison at the expense of Tolstoy, I'd say DRST 002 06 would be a very, very fine course.",
    "I would recommend this course; I felt that I not only learned a lot, but truly liked the works we read as well."
