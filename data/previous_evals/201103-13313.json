    "I would highly recommend this class. The class material is very interesting, and the professor is unbeatable. The work is challenging, but it is all worth it.",
    "Concerning the course itself, make no mistake that this is a survey course. Most of the class discussions will be centered around various themes presented in the multitude of works read and these various themes will be tracked through the texts of American Literature read in the course. Close textual analysis will be limited - such is the nature of the course. Authors read included Chesnutt, Crane, Douglass, Dickinson, Whitman, Emerson, Melville, Elizabeth Alexander, O'Connor and Diaz (these readings vary somewhat between sections - Professor Goldsby's selections, for the most part, are fantastic).Professor Goldsby's section differs from other sections in that only three 4-6 paged essays are assigned, rather than the four that most sections do. Correspondingly, Professor Goldsby mandates that the class completes weekly reading responses (ranging from one to two double-spaced pages), due either on Monday or Wednesday (these are not done the majority of other sections). While this results in the class writing more than most other sections, I feel that this is a reasonable trade-off, as it both forces you to complete the reading and think about it before coming to class.Concerning grading, Professor Goldsby is more than fair, providing more detailed comments on essays and reading responses than I have ever seen. While it can be difficult to understand how these comments translate into a letter grade, Goldsby grades reasonably (I never thought that I deserved a grade different than I received, even if all of the grades were not an \"A\").Professor Goldsby did show some favoritism in class and there were a few people that tended to dominate class discussion (and not due to an apathy in other students, or particularly illuminating comments given by these students), this wasn't as bad as several professors I have had in the past.The class would also benefit from changing the hand-raising method to comment to a freer discussion mode and ensuring that students can leave on-time (the class was often let out ten minutes late). Goldsby always seemed well-prepared in class, and would give a review of the author, their time period, and the history of the book (such as Moby Dick's initial lackluster sales) before each discussion. Her comments within the class discussion were also helpful and pushed students to look deeper into what they were saying. Goldsby also provides many opportunities to meet during office hours.All in all, however, Professor Goldsby was a fabulous instructor and I will miss the class next semester. She made coming into class at nine in the morning on Tuesdays and Thursdays worthit.",
    "This class was a lot of work, but it was worth it. I am better at reading and analyzing than writing numerous papers, so this was the perfect class for me. Despite weekly reading responses and sometimes long reading assignments, there was not too much work involved since it is only 3 papers. The final is also not too bad so long as you keep up on the reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It encompassed a lot of American themes with literature and poetry and it was fascinating to compare times in American history through the different texts we read. It was also a nice mix of prose and poetry, and was able to pull from both well-known and lesser-known writers and poets.",
    "Take this class if you have an interest in American literature and you enjoy reading and writing. You receive a thorough grounding in many classic works and and the small class allows you the ideal environment to discuss and analyze those works.",
    "If you like to read and don't mind writing a lot, this is a good course. The books you read are really interesting, and Professor Goldsby did a good job at directing us through them. The workload can get tough, especially just before papers or do or when you're reading something heavy like Moby Dick. We had to do one-page reading responses once a week as well, and an extra paper based on a mandatory trip to the Beinecke. This course is a really good way to delve into American Literature, but don't take it unless you're interested. You talk a lot about the place of the books amidst the genealogy of American Lit, in addition to regular literary analysis.",
    "Goldsby is definitely worth taking this class with.",
    "Yes! This class is a really great class--it covers a lot of readings, but in general spends just enough time on them such that you are just ready to move on when you actually do change texts. I'm sure it also depends on the teacher. Really enjoyed the class, and wished that I had had more time to devote to it.",
    "It was a good class that challenged and improved my writing. It was an interesting English class and had a nice variety of readings. I would recommend it.",
    "A fantastic course with an extraordinarily diverse reading list - everything from 21st century poetry to staples of the American literary canon. Lots of reading, of course, but the work load isn't too bad - three 4-6 page papers, a weekly reading response (usually fun to write because of Professor Goldsby's interesting prompts), and a final exam. Though Professor Goldsby occasionally spent too long lecturing about a book or topic that interested her without asking for any student input, she was generally very good at stimulating discussion. She also left a full page of comments on each essay we wrote - very helpful. If you're looking to be introduced to some of the great works ever produced by American writers, take English 127. If you want to really enjoy class every day (even at 9am), take it with Professor Goldsby.",
    "If you are interested in American literature, take this class! You might want to read the syllabus to check whether you've read most of the texts, but Professor Goldsby is really excited about what she teaches, and classes are interesting and fun.",
    "Yes I would my writing definitely improved.",
    "American Literature is a great class. It was well-taught with illuminating discussions and intriguing paper topics. There is quite a bit of writing involved, but one receives helpful feedback on each piece of writing. The reading list provides a good overview of various periods and movements in American literature, and Moby Dick is one of the most incredible epics you will ever read."
