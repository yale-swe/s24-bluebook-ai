   "comments": [
    "This class was fine. Neither best class ever nor worst. Prof. Mahler is very balanced, and he's passionate about the material, but class can drag at times. The first half is better than the second. The course taught me how to think about politics differently. Lots of reading, but just a midterm paper (6 pages), a final paper (10 pages), and 4 2-page reflection write-ups on a current event article.",
    "I learned a lot about how the media and politicians work together, which was very interesting given the current political climate in the United States.",
    "We learned about the intersection between politicos, journalists, and the public. We focused on intersubjectivity the objectivity ideal, and the actions journalists and politicos must take in order to best engage with the public. I have a whole new appreciation for journalism - and the difficulties involved. The same goes for political life - we studied how hard it is to maintain the balance between public and private life. I learned more in this class than I have in most classes at Yale, and it was incredibly relevant to what is currently happening in the world.",
    "I have a thorough understanding of the intricacies that go into the production of political news; framing, tone, access, accountability, etc. I also have a better understanding of how the public must be interfaced with in order for politicians and the media to get the \"correct\" message out.",
    "I learned very in-depth aspects of the making of political journalism and the relationship between politicians, the media and the public.",
    "I learned about the complicated relationships among the political, public, and journalistic spheres. the challenges that face politicians, journalists, and the public audience which make media in society so difficult to manage. I also learned many different sociological perspectives on the meaning of truth and how we contemplate a shared world.",
    "This class dramatically changed the way I think about the relationships between politicians, journalists, and the actors. I feel substantially more equipped to approach the media and political headlines as well as our current political climate with an understanding of what has come before."

   "comments": [
    "The essays were assigned perfectly. The RtN assignments were also fine. However, class would sometimes drag, so that was unfortunate. Also, the reading could get heavy and too boring\/philosophical. Mahler is a fair professor though!",
    "This is essentially a small lecture course. While structured like a seminar, there is not a lot of room for discussion or debate, just comments that are interspersed throughout Professor Mahler's lecture.",
    "Strengths: covers very interesting course material, very relevant, and interesting course work, for the most part. Weaknesses: professor spends more time talking than students, impossible to ever cover all of the course material, paper questions seem rather unconnected to the course, slow response time from professor, and some readings are rather dry and uninteresting.",
    "Good class. Reading the news assignments are interesting. Would have liked to see them incorporated more into discussion, perhaps every person presents their. With one or two people going each week for a few minutes.",
    "This class had many strengths. The professor was fantastic, and his style of teaching was very productive. Discussions were the perfect amount of student driven but professor controlled. It can be difficult to stay engaged for a 2 hour seminar, but the teaching style allowed it to be very manageable. The material of this class was another strength - we focused on many current events and current societal issues. All the reading felt purposeful and it was a good balance between theoretical articles, current news articles, and sociological literature. The assignments were another strength - there were four short writing pieces which were interesting and very do-able, and two long essays which were difficult but reasonable and fair. The only weakness was the amount of reading - I wanted to do all the reading to stay engaged, but some weeks it simply wasn't possible. There a was so much.",
    "The readings were good, but the reading the news asssignments didn't really seem helpful. The in-class discussions were really helpful though, and times when Prof. Mahler lectured complemented the readings really well.",
    "Professor Mahler was excellent-- very engaging professor that really had an agenda and got across important ideas that were critical to the course. he gave lots of feedback on our work, which was very helpful and he was also very understanding.",
    "Very strong course with a high level of interesting readings and class engagement. Only weakness may be the repetitive nature of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Great class! Really makes you interact with news and politics in a new, better and more informed way. Adds to your cynicism at first but then chips away at it toward the end.",
    "It was a good seminar; very standard.Neither best class ever nor worst. Prof. Mahler is very balanced, and he's passionate about the material, but class can drag at times. The first half is better than the second. The course taught me how to think about politics differently. Lots of reading, but just a midterm paper (6 pages), a final paper (10 pages), and 4 2-page reflection write-ups on a current event article.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yes! On content alone, this is one of the best classes at Yale. It's relatable to anyone with even a modicum of interest in politics and public discourse. And Prof. Mahler is a great instructor--hilarious, brilliant, understanding of student life. Take it!",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, this class looks at a very interesting and important relationship -- that between the media, politicians, and the public. Very relevant information that's interesting to read and interesting to discuss.",
    "Yes, Prof Mahler is a great guy",
    "Absolutely. It's incredibly interesting, and the professor is awesome. If you have any interest in journalism and politics, take it! One of my favorites, and definitely one of my most worthwhile classes I've ever taken. It's a class that I think about all the time, and I\"m so glad I took it.",
    "I would recommend this class, and advise people to stick through with it. The answers that I was hoping this class would answer were answered around week 10, but the groundwork getting there was important too. Also, start on your assignments early.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to any student interested in politics, journalism, or simply developing a greater understanding of the media that we are constantly bombarded with."
