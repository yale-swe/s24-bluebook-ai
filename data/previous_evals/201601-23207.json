   "comments": [
    "Overall, it wasn't as intimidating as I thought it would be. I learned a lot and I didn't feel like the work load was unreasonable. I would recommend take this course if you're interested in transmission lines, magnetic and electric fields, etc.",
    "This is a pretty standard vector calc-based e&m class with some new material on transmission lines and radiation. Material can be a lot sometimes, but Prof. Rakich does an awesome job of making it very manageable. He hands out the notes at the beginning of each class so that students can focus on absorbing the material instead of copying notes down, and the psets are actually based on the lecture notes, which I feel like doesn't happen often in physics classes.",
    "Definitely take this class. Don't be scared of all the math. It's just calculus. You'll learn a lot. By the end of this course, you'll have a good understanding of electrostatics, maxwell's equations, phaser analysis, transmission lines, and plane waves. The professor is great and the homeworks are helpful and manageable. This is an excellent physics course",
    "A class with a lot of potential and many strengths but still manages to fall so short. Although most of the students who take this class are EE ABETs who need it to graduate, the class is not tailed enough towards the EEs in terms of what is taught (too much circuits review for example) and this hurts the class. The exams are very fair, the homeworks are very fair, and there is a lot of support, but somehow you are probably not going to have a very good time in this class. That said, after taking this class I appreciate the importance of E&M as a part of the EE curriculum a lot more and think that an E&M background beyond PHYS 201 can be important, interesting, or useful."
