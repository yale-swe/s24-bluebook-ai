    "Difficult QR. Take Cr\/D\/F.",
    "If you are used to logic\/problem solving, the class will probably be the easiest class in your semester, yet will still be fulfilling. If not, the class will be good practice.Take this class if you've never taken any computer science. Otherwise, startwith 201 or 223.",
    "it is not good. the subject matter is interesting, but the lecture is extremely unorganized and the professor teaches it terribly. the problem set is also not well designed, it is wordy and not insightful. but what else can u take as an intro to computer science?? no other choice, uhh",
    "OK Don't listen to all the haters out there. Drew McDermott is the man! He is freakin hilarious! OK Seriously, though, if you're into figuring out puzzles and stuff, you'll like this class. I know I did, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's itchin for it. Don't expect much out of lectures, you'll figure it out on your own. But i think that's the way it should be for programming at least, you know, trial and error.",
    "I recommend it if you want to learn about computer science and plan on taking higher levels of it. Don't take it simply for a QR.",
    "The first few weeks are great, problem sets are rewarding, and programming seems fun. Then it goes downhill fast: class becomes unbearably boring, problem sets become impossible (because you haven't learned anything for weeks), and you must become your TA's best friend.",
    "I wouldn't take this unless you plan on continuing with computer science. I took it hoping to learn the basics of programming, but \"the basics\" are not particularly useful in a practical sense. Professor McDermott was not very helpful, either. He tends to ramble in lecture, and generally not make things very clear, so plan on learning from the textbook.",
    "You probably won't be surprised about whether you'll think tinkering with programs is fun or not.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject. It's relatively harmless if you don't worry about going to class. you can just turn in a problem set once a week and be done with it. it was a nice 5th class for my schedule.",
    "Only take it if u r sure",
    "This is one of the more useful classes here. That said, it's also quite difficult--computer science requires a whole new way of thinking. If I were to give advice, I would suggest taking it in the Fall; the Spring course isn't particularly well taught, and it got really confusing for me.",
    "CPSC 112 is a good intro look at programming, which focuses less on the language and more on the concepts.",
    "It is a decent introduction to programming, but the course is not very good. It doesnt really teach you too well. It might be best to try to learn on your own.",
    "Good intro class that goes over the basics of Java, I would recommend it for someone interested in programming languages.",
    "Don't take it. Learn programming on your own or through the online intro to programming lectures from harvard, stanford, or mit, then take the next level course in the CS department at yale.",
    "CpSc 112 is a good course. I would warn you that the problem sets are pretty difficult; however, if you have prior knowledge of the subject that would definitely help. Nevertheless, you do not need to know anything about the subject in order to enjoy the class. I personally think that those who do not knowanything about the subject, take more from the class. The material not only helps with understanding programming, but, also, helps one think logically about results in a step-wise fashions.",
    "DO IT BEC I FELT LIKE I ACTUALLY LEARNT SOMETHING!PS. Psets take about 10 hours. (still do it)",
    "Fine course for those looking to learn a little Java, though not necessarily anything you couldn't learn out of a Java book.",
    "It's a pretty good course but the lectures are pretty boring."
