   "comments": [
    "The course provide great opportunities for students to gain experience on \"real world\" public health research. However, the time schedule is tight.",
    "Weaknesses: Level of expectation for one semester is unreasonable. Many of the skills needed for the projects were not necessarily taught in class. Many of theories taught were abstract and not applicable to any of the projects. Strengths: Great communication and enthusiasm. Nice range of projects to choose from.",
    "This course should be a two semester course. The first semester should cover course material and planning for the community health project. The second semester should entail the work necessary to carry out the project.",
    "Strengths: Perfect hands-on practicum for those who have not had experience working. Weaknesses: The partner organizations we worked with did not seem to understand that we are full time students. Perhaps there should be a separate orientation for them so they know the daily routine for students and the amount of work they also have on their plates.",
    "I really liked the course and the opportunity to work with a real organization. I think that this type of learning experience is very valuable and not easy to get in many other courses at YSPH. I think that Debbie has a lot of experience teaching it, so while the book we read this year didn't always seem relevant, I think she had the big picture in mind...which I can appreciate. Overall there wasn't too much I would change.",
    "Strengths: This was a great course for putting the public health skills you have learned over the course of the MPH to the test. This class also provides in depth knowledge about what community health research is. Weaknesses (suggestions): I think it would be helpful to have more group working sessions in class, as I believe this would ultimately contribute to a better overall product at the end of the course. There were several classes, especially the 5 hour classes, where I think discussions\/activities were incorporated that while important, did not need to go on as long as they did. By shortening certain discussions, I think it would keep the class more engaged and allow for more productive group working time. Groups are a necessary but challenging part of this course. I think it might be helpful if there were group evaluations halfway through the semester as well as at the end, so groups can more easily discuss issues that people are having and so the professor\/TA is aware of these difficulties. It would also be helpful if we could provide comments on group members instead of an overall ranking. One thing I will note in terms of groups, is that with quizzes groups can really make or break you. There were some groups that had six people to take a group quiz, while others had as few as four, and if there were members who consistently did not do the required readings, then some groups were put at a distinct disadvantage.",
    "Too time consuming. Could be divided into two courses or take 1.5-2 credits.",
    "Great course.",
    "Need to improve lecture contents",
    "This is a unique opportunity to do real public health work. You learn new skills and hone what you are learning as an MPH student. It is a lot of work and very frustrating at times but the experience is invaluable. There should be more courses like this tailored to all of the departments.",
    "This course was an excellent opportunity to practice public health outside of the classroom. Being able to conduct research and see it being put to use in the community was extremely rewarding, and we gained valuable skills in regards to data analysis and learning how to work with different people (preceptors, stakeholders, etc.) The class was a lot of work, but I would say it really depends on the project given. Weaknesses include the class lectures and assignments; I thought the class assignments were not necessary and that the time spent on the many assignments could have been better used focusing on our projects.",
    "The course is a lot of work, depending on the project that you work on. Unfortunately, I felt a dichotomy between what we learned in class and the actual project. Even though, we tried to apply some of the concepts to the project, it was difficult at the time because most of us did not fully understand the project at the time. If these assignments could be pushed back a little, or a information session was set up with the preceptors during class time before the assignments are due, this would be very helpful. The course is such a great opportunity to work with local community organizations and really does give you training in how to interact with others and how to handle a real project.",
    "This course is a great experience for students and allows them to utilize skills they've learning in the MPH program. The workload of completing an entire community health project in one semester is a bit too much. I felt that we didn't have time to do a complete job, and felt that there was much more to do at the end of the semester. If possible, turn this into a two semester class. IF not, the course needs to have limits placed on the projects at the onset of the semester. The course instructor should tell preceptors at the beginning that there is only so much that the students can accomplish in the semester. This would allow students to be less overwhelmed and feel that they did a more complete job on the projects. Preceptors need to understand we are full time students, and that we have limited time each week to work on these projects. I think more group evaluations need to be implemented throughout the course, and with more detailed questions, allowing space for comments, since this is a group-oriented class. I gained communication and professional skills, and felt I learned so much about working in a group and with a community organization. I am proud of the work we accomplished but also felt bad we couldn't get to more.",
    "This class was the most time-consuming and challenging course I've taken this semester. It was also my favorite. Working with certain community organizations through a particular research project proved to be a learning experience my team members and I found difficult but we persevered. In addition to the curriculum components with required readings, assessment tests, and other assignments, we were expected to complete a research project from start to finish. I recall many times being so overwhelmed and stressed but was able to pull it together to get the job done. This was amazing, practice-based experience I am glad to have acquired. However, I believe the class could be improved. Suggestions: --Allow for more working sessions. We already do so much work for the project outside of class and it would be great to have more working sessions during class time. --Some of the classes were too technical and didn't apply to what our community-based research project revolved around. I found myself at times working on the project during class instead of paying attention to the class material. --There needs to be better communication between preceptors and students. It's important that students meet the community organization leaders beforehand so that they can go over the responsibilities list together and establish a good working relationship from the beginning. A lot of my peers including myself expressed exasperation at the countless demands our preceptors demanded of us and we didn't know how to mitigate that potential conflict. Preceptors need to understand we are students first and their researchers second.",
    "Pros: Great professor,good textbook, good teaching materials (quizzes), great speakers Cons: NONE our preceptors for the project was not the best yet it has nothing to do with teh course",
    "strengths: hands on, instructors and TA support, interesting class discussions, team work skills weakness: new preceptors don't always have realistic expectations of student team; while class discussions were interesting (especially those about models), it wasn't clear how to incorporate them into our projects. one of the biggest challenges (that I wouldn't list as a weakness) - keeping each team member motivated through the process was difficult and peoples' commitment levels seemed to fluctuate, even from their initially declared commitment levels. suggestions: encourage front end work of really understanding research question and determining whether methods really get you the data you're looking for. more communication with preceptor and within team about expectations for the semester.",
    "Excellent - practical, hands on skills acquired, team work skills developed. Learned a lot about community based research, the IRB process, working with community organizations. Thoroughly enjoyed partnering with the organization we worked with and seeing that our work had practical implications in the lives of others. Excellent course, project, and opportunity.",
    "This course was an excellent way to learn about community health research, and challenges with this type of research. It was great to have the opportunity to work with a community organization on a project, however, because of the short-time frame of the project, it was difficult to get all the work completed by the end of the semester."

    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is great! She is very responsive and attentive. She is helpful when there are problems with preceptors and she is very passionate when speaking about community research.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries has a lot of experience working with community organizations, and brings a lot of knowledge to share with the class. She kept classes dynamic and interactive. I thought she could have intervened a bit more when things weren't going well with the project. And as stated about the course overall, I think the instructor should be responsible for placing limits on the project, and communicating these limits to the preceptors before the semester begins so that both the preceptors and students have a better understanding of what can actually be accomplished in a matter of a few months.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is great! She is an incredibly intelligent and passionate woman. This is easily conveyed in her teaching. However, it is sometimes difficult to understand the concepts that she's trying to convey to us because of the way she words things. I think there could be less technical jargon, especially when it comes to theoretical aspects of our class. However, she does a great job of teaching overall. In addition, she is very considerate of our academic workload and helps us find ways to manage everything.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Amazing, passionate, intelligent professor. Very keen on listening to students opinions. Gave excellent lessons on topics that would have not been covered in any other public health class",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0excellent instructor - ability to offer many perspective, which is wonderful for teaching and problem solving",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Great professor. Thoughtful, constantly looking for ways to incorporate discussion and new perspectives. Tried very hard to meet the needs of the students.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries did an excellent job of teaching us about community health research and sharing her experiences in the field. She also did a great job of supporting us through frustrations and helping us with challenging situations in our project which came up throughout the semester."

   "comments": [
    "It is a great course for students to gain experience on project-based research. However, it takes a lot of time and commitment. So if you decide to choose this course, spare enough time for this course.",
    "It's a great course that applies the concepts of participatory community-based research. You definitely experience a fair amount of what you learn in the class.",
    "This should either be a 2 credit course or spread out over 2 semesters. A significant amount of planing, learning and communication is needed to thoroughly carry out the assignments which is not realistic to have done over the course of one semester.",
    "I would not suggest this course for fellow students because of the workload outside of the classroom.",
    "If you are interested in engaging with a local CT organization on a project related to health, then this is a great class to get hands on experience. I think that you need to look carefully through the prospectus that is posted in the fall and make sure there is a project you are truly interested in because the workload is very high and group quite intense\/requiring time investment.",
    "This is a great course for putting your public health skills to the test and I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Too time-consuming.",
    "It was a tough semester-- but I learned so much and am proud of our group's final project",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK AND SOMETIMES REALLY ANXIETY-PROVOKING BUT SO WORHT IT!",
    "If you really want to be involved in a real world project, take it",
    "This course is going to be a challenge for one reason or another but your MPH curriculum is not complete without it. This course is where you will learn to provide professional, quality research that you are learning to do at Yale, but work within a community where public health is in action every day.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course to another student but I would preface my recommendation with \"Be prepared to work your butt off and dedicate hours of your time and weekends to this course.\" Although this course was very challenging in terms of workload, it was an extremely unique and valuable experience that I do not think you would receive in any other courses. Being able to apply skills learned in the classroom to the field is so important in helping a student realize what true public health work is like, and you learn skills that help prepare you for your internship.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but very beneficial for someone who wants to work in community health in the future. There is a lot of \"outside the classroom\" work that needs to be done and you won't be given time to work on it in class. I think more working sessions would be helpful. The course also teaches you a lot about team dynamic and the importance of working with collaborators and community partnerships. It's a great opportunity to learn about some of the challenges that community organizations face and to learn about their process. It's also a great way to contribute to a project that truly matters!",
    "This class gives students real-world experience working directly with a community organization, and is a wonderful opportunity to learn how to work collaboratively. That being said, it was a lot of work in an already busy graduate program. I would definitely recommend the class for students seeking a challenge and some truly useful experience in the field of public health. It is a unique class, and I am glad that I took it.",
    "One of the most life-changing but time-consuming classes I've taken yet. I definitely recommend it to future students but be aware that the workload is intense and to not take it with other classes that may be just as time-consuming. I survived it while taking other hard core classes and you can too!",
    "great learning experience highly recommend this course",
    "Recommended for people interested in research or those interested in working in the community with researchers. applicable for those interested in qual research, program management\/development, coding.",
    "Excellent opportunity to gain hands on experience working practically to influence public health outcomes through research. Does require quite a bit of effort, but it is all worthwhile. Draws out of you the professionalism, compassion, and willingness to work collaboratively if you are open to the experience.",
    "This course allows students to learn about community health research and work with a local community organization. While it was definitely a challenging semester, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are considering doing this type of work in the future."
