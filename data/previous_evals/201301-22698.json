   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in welfare states I would recommend this class. It covers a lot of information, but even if you don't know much about welfare states Professor Kahl will clarify it for you. The readings are interesting and class discussion is really thoughtful due to the essay format of the class. Also, because there is no final paper it is easier to focus on the topic at hand each week and not be stressed about the final paper.",
    "The class is a comparative analysis of the welfare states in developed nations, with a focus on the US system. The material is largely theoretical in nature, with extensive discussion on why things are the way they are. The course was adequate, but I would not recommend it to another student. The workload was too high, with an essay due nearly every week and lengthy readings. I felt as though the level of effort I committed to the class was not fully worth what I got out of the experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students seeking to further investigate the intersection of religion, culture, and public policy. Fantastic!",
    "Good overview course. Yes, I would recommend the course to other students because they can get a flavor of the different topics, issues, and dimensions of welfare states.",
    "Great class! Really comprehensive overview of the development of social provision in the US and Europe. The class design was great as well - though the constant papers and commenting seems a lot of work, class discussions go like a breeze because everyone was on top of their material.",
    "It's an enjoyable romp through the nuances of welfare provision. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "You learn about welfare states in the developed world, the theories in understanding them, and have interesting discussions along the way. Take it.",
    "Take it if you are willing to put in the work! It is an intense and demanding seminar. The material is really rewarding though!",
    "Welfare states is a great class, and you should definitely take it if you get the chance. At first an essay\/comment each week may seem like a bit much, but trust me, it makes class discussion sooo much more worthwhile. Professor Kahl is great at leading discussion, very approachable, and has a great sense of humor. She also gives useful and thoughtful feedback on student work.",
    "Great way to fulfill the requirements of the core -- Prof. Kahl is one of the best professors in the department, and the class is great. There's a lot of work, but it's actually worth it, and you'll end up wanting to do the reading, anyway (it's very well chosen). Kind of depends on the other students, but we had a great class environment and it was one of my favorite seminars of the semester!"
