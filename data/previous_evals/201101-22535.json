   "comments": [
    "The professors are great, but somehow the class is less than the sum of its parts.",
    "A weird, unfocused class. Introductory level difficulty with advanced-level texts. Don't recommend.",
    "Well, it isn't the \"Eastern DS\" that they promise you --it is more like a \"greatest hits of Asia\" that doesn't really follow any recognizable order but, hey, that sounds pretty cool to me.",
    "Any students interested in methodology should take this class. After a semester, he will better see how to look at visual arts and interpret texts. This class is not to be forgotten for it propose more than just books and articles. It inspires people in pursuing a study on Asian text and art in the future.",
    "Interesting material but poorly structured class, and the professors did not seem to put a lot of time\/thought into organization or preparing lectures. The lectures often did not provide a structure for understanding the text, historical background, significance of the texts, most important points to know, themes, etc.",
    "This course, though I think it is a valuable one for Yale to have, might have benefited from a little more organization. The advantage of a humanities survey -- such as DS -- is that it allows for intertextual thought, and unfortunately it seemed to me that where there was rich opportunity for such thought in the texts and objects studied, the connections weren't made explicit enough for the students to really grasp. The Chinese and non-Chinese portions of the course seemed rather disconnected."
