    "We looked at the Aztecs (aka the Mexica), the Romans, and the Ottoman Turks, and then did a comparative analysis of the United States and the current international system.Good amount of reading, reading responses every 3-4 weeks, but it's interesting if you're into this kind of stuff.",
    "It's a great class, especially if you are interested in the topics of primacy, unipolarity or historical empires. Its a great view and critique of many traditional IR theories and a solid choice for anyone interested in international relation",
    "It's ok. Reading list seems interesting but is too much and kocher isn't super fun to be in a classroom with for 2 hours.",
    "Exactly as advertised. A shit-ton of reading, but you don't totally need to do all of it. Prof Kocher is a somewhat dominating figure in the discussion, which has both its benefits and its drawbacks (he WILL hold students accountable, which I love, but if he doesn't agree with something, he may also dwell on it for a long time...), and, as he admitted on the first day, no, even he has not read many of the books - meaning they are unpredictably hit or miss....Your call... I thought it was OK, but each class was either great or painful, depending on the quality of the book being discussed, and how well my classmates prepared.",
    "I had a great time in this class. A lot of reading but very worthwhile."
