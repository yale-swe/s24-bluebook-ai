   "comments": [
    "Yes, enjoyable.",
    "Yes--very good introduction to Yale English classes.",
    "I would only recommend English 115-03 to students who feel they need help on essay structure and integrating quote evidence. If you can already write a good high school paper, this class will not be helpful.",
    "It's a bunch of pointless talking and musing on a ton of reading that not many people finish that ultimately culminates in assignments that don't have much to do with the assignments. I would not recommend this class because I always dreaded going to it and felt it was a big waste of my time.",
    "English 115 was okay; nothing too special. Most days in class were boring and it's extremely difficult to get an A.",
    "Take this class. Probably the best English 115 course. Though the class discussions are quite irrelevant from the writings you do, you learn a lot separately from the readings and the writings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The reading load can get heavy, especially with Faulkner, but it is definitely worth it to read everything! Papers will really push you to improve your writing as well. Certainly not a light class but well worth it, and I would particularly recommend taking this section on nostalgia with Sam if it's offered again.",
    "English 115 03 was an excellent course that both improved my writing and provided an excellent selection of readings. I liked how the course was held together by a theme, specifically nostalgia, but was not solely focused on this topic. Class discussions touched upon many different topics and were very enlightening. I wholeheartedly recommend this course!",
    "It is a great introduction to college essay writing, especially since there is a literature focus that could be applied to other subjects. The nostalgia section is a very interesting twist, and the reading is highly engaging. I would definitely recommend it. It has improved my writing tremendously!"
