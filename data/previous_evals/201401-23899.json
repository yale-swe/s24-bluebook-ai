    "Prof. Ashton's lectures did not prepare you for the tests and his tests were not comprehensive (or very good). The readings are poor but the field trips are worthwhile and the TFs were great in the field and the review sessions.",
    "NA",
    "Overall I learned a LOT from this course. The lectures, readings, field trips, and various tests all really helped me synthesize my understanding of silviculture. Here is my general feedback:1) I think all the readings should just be posted online; there were several books that were on hold in the library, but it would be so easy to just get these online.2) There are, in my opinion, too many field trips. I think it would be better to concentrate the field trips into 2-day excursions instead of having all these 1\/2 day field trips. They also inevitably always ran several hours behind schedule, and although the TA tried to keep things on track, I felt that more consideration could have been put into making sure things stayed on track time-wise. I also think sometimes the field trips were too crowded.3) This course is a lot of work overall and very logistically complicated; I know it's worth 4 credits, but I felt like it took up more time than any other course I've had at FES - maybe this could be rectified by figuring out a more strategic way to condense the various field trips.",
    "Course content and structure were great. But lectures were often hard to follow. A lot of information was presented, but it was hard to assimilate without a big picture schematic (of say the relationship between shade tolerance and regeneration methods). Half of the field trips were very useful, but the lessons from the first few were a bit unclear. Also, since the lectures were filmed, the lecture atmosphere was a little odd\/formal, and there wasn't as much conversation that would have been useful.",
    "Must-take class at FES- well taught, good TAs, great fieldtrips.",
    "Best class I've taken here at Yale.",
    "Question 8--Field trip times could pretty much be cut in half. Mark tended to talk for too long. What he said is definitely useful--it just could be said much faster.",
    "5-6: the teaching fellows (Marlyse and Julius) were outstanding. They were both incredibly knowledgeable, prepared, and helpful.8: I was always incredibly cold on field trips, which made it very difficult for me to concentrate and learn much. Shorter field trips would have been much appreciated.",
    "Field trips - I think some of the trips had too much talking in them which could have been done in the classrooms where it would have been easier to pay attention. I aslo think more practicing applying prescriptions would have been really helpful and enjoyable, even if it was just on campus.",
    "The instructor and teaching fellows were fantastic! They were always willing and excited to answer any and all questions. As someone with no background in this subject this helped me feel comfortable learning about a subject I was interested in but completely out of my element.",
    "Although the field trips are numerous, they are extremely helpful in synthesizing conceptual material discussed in lecture.",
    "This course was incredibly interesting and valuable. A great mix of theory and application, I felt that it synthesized and tied together many interests of mine. I really appreciated Mark's teaching style and felt that the way he presented materials worked well for me."

The field trips were a great learning experience. The readings are overall really helpful, especially the Silviculture book. Marlyse and Julius were really open to questions.",

This allowed us to think in a divergent way when it came to application, much more useful than memorizing prescriptions for certain scenarios. Mark encouraged a diversity of \"answers\" to his questions, emphasizing the highly contextual nature of applied ecology. This is a great service to students who may be used to being spoon-fed answers.",

    "See response to question #15.",
    "Additional hands-on exercises.",
    "Some of the lectures feel outdated. Also, it would be great to cover a little more forest ecology and delve into structure-based management like what the USFS and BLM are transitioning to in the Pacific NW (maybe assign more of the critique of silviculture book, or talk about franklin \/ johnson ecological forestry?)",
    "In lectures, plant and location names are often not printed on the slides. Although I tried to record important names as well as possible, proper spelling would have made it easier to study before exams.",
    "Although the field trips were excellent and crucial, it would be better if they could have been more evenly spaced throughout the semester so that we didn't end up out in the field every single Friday after Spring Break.",
    "The lectures can ramble, but that didn't bother me.",
    "Lecture time could also be cut down. Mark tends to talk for half an hour on the first two slides then misses out on telling us valuable information at the end of the lecture. It's hard to pay attention after the first hour.",
    "Field trips were too long and cold!",
    "More opportunities for practicing prescriptions. Just seeing it once is not enough.",
    "The field trips were great. They helped me to conceptualize in class materials. I would recommend doing a few example prescriptions before the midterm and then full prescriptions before the practical.",
    "It was a little unclear on a couple of the field trips what their specific objectives were. That being said, they were all interesting.I think being a little choosier with the assigned readings may have created a situation that was a little less intimidating to those debating whether to do them. I did most of the readings and found them valuable, though they took a substantial amount of time (the silviculture text was especially useful).",

    "Awesome- they work well together.",
    "It would have been nice had the discussions with the TFs been a bit more structured.

    "It was helpful to review for exams in a group because questions I hadn't thought of were raised by other people.",
    "Approaching problems from different perspectives really added to the field work.",
    "I did a little studying in a group. I could have done fine on my own, but felt that it would be more fun\/interesting to study in a group. Not totally necessary, but I also kept up with the readings and felt prepared for the exams on my own. I did get some critical help with the quantitative element of the course from my study group."

    "It's a really great course if you want to learn the basics of silviculture, and its great if you don't have much experience.",
    "Go on the field trips! They are very helpful for visualizing and understanding much of what is discussed in lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in forest management.",
    "Take it!",
    "Audit it.",
    "This is a great class! Take it! You will never ever regret it!",
    "Keep up with the readings, go on as many of the field trips as possible, and study in a group for the mid-term and final because a lot of what you need to know comes from talking through different scenarios and that's much easier to in a brainstorming session.",
    "Do the readings! Draw your own schematics along the way to integrate the wealth of information into something comprehensible for you.",
    "Review lectures in early stage",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially if taken in the first year. The time requirements are somewhat hefty, but the course and all of the field trips are worth it.",
    "Do the readings before class, and study in groups.",
    "Absolutely take it, even if you're not an MF. You'll look at forestry and the forest products industry in a totally different light.",
    "Know that it will take up a lot of your time. And that going on field trips will significantly help you on the exams!",
    "Take it.",
    "Ask all your questions!!",
    "I would recommend participating on all field trips. They are extremely helpful and fun.",
    "Take it! If you're at all interested in linking the theoretical to the practical, this is essential. Also, if you do or don't have a background in basic earth sciences, botany, and the connections between ecology and land management (and you want to make these connections) this class can help in a big way. I had lots of experience with plant ecology and I still found the holistic way in which material was presented to be very satisfying. I've taught basic landscape design courses before and I now feel like I know a better way to present material thanks to Mark's excellent teaching.Take it!",
    "Since all concepts being taught are not so easy to follow, previewing and reviewing texts and given materials are necessary. Also group studying is the best effective way for following the class."
