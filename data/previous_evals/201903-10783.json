    "A handle on basic Japanese.",
    "Japanese 110 is an introductory course to the Japanese language. Throughout my time in the class, I learned a plethora of Japanese vocabulary, grammar, and culture, the topics of which ranged from personal introductions to travel. I learned basic communication and ways of expressing interests and routines in Japanese.",
    "",
    "I absolutely learned a lot of Japanese and was interested in how the grammatical structures and mannerisms differ from English. Since the workload was quite heavy, I also learned how to manage my time and work efficiently.",
    "In this class, we practiced a lot of speaking and conversation and also learned the stroke orders of Hiragana, Katakana, and our first kanji."

   "comments": [
    "This course does a good job of introducing students to Japanese without delving too deep into the complicated aspects of the language too quickly. However, the pace of the course is very fast and can at times be overwhelming, given the amount of material that is covered. I think that a bit more structure to class--as far as pacing, the cataloging of learned vocabulary, and review lessons--could be beneficial to combating potential confusion.",
    "The course covers a lot of interesting material and helps students grasp the fundamentals of Japanese. The course moves quite fast however, especially when trying to learn and adjust to the different writing systems. I feel that I was only able to keep up as well as I did due to previous background knowledge of some Japanese characters and vocabulary.",
    "This course was excellent for teaching vocab and basic conversation and also writing. I wish that there was a little bit more focus on pronunciation and intonation patterns."

   "comments": [
    "Im not sure. It is a lot to take on so I believe some thinking is needed.",
    "I would definitely recommend Japanese 110 to another student. However, prospective students must be willing to commit a significant amount of time and effort to the class, as learning a new language requires a lot more than simply doing the assigned worksheets. There is a heavy demand for practice outside of class, as well as an appreciation for the Japanese culture.",
    "",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn a difficult new language and isn't afraid of a heavy workload.",
    "Yes, the speaking practice in class helps a lot with getting comfortable with vocabulary and the projects we did were not only fun but also helped us to get connected with classmates and study outside of class. Furthermore, there was focus on each of the components of language."
