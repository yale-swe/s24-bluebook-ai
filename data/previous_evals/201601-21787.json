    "You get to read incredible literature, and Duval is amazing and so kind.",
    "Would recommend wholeheartedly",
    "I took this course at the same time as DS and did an independent study, which was A LOT of reading every week, but if you like what you're reading (it's likely that you will), it is manageable. A fifth class might present difficulties if you truly want to get the most out of your reading without spreading yourself too thin. While not incredibly challenging in class because of the fairly slow pace of discussion, the readings do require several hours per week, often more because of the challenge of the language than the quantity of reading. However, I highly recommend it because it is very fulfilling, in that it makes you appreciate your learning in DS and exposes you to a variety of great works in their original language. In addition, the class is often very small (mine was six people), which gives you a lot of personal attention and support from one of Yale's hidden gems, Edwin Duval.",
    "Take this class! It offers a mini-DS for the French canon, where discussions focus mainly on the texts themselves, but also include conversations about how they relate to the texts read in DS. Professor Duval is an amazing professor--he always has thoughtful and thought-provoking things to say, offers in-depth comments on papers, and really cares about his students. It's a whole new experience reading Proust and Flaubert in French, after reading them in English for DS. I learned a lot about the texts, and I definitely improved my ability to read and write in French--even if I didn't particularly improve my ability to speak French."
