    "It is a very good upper level bio elective. Take it!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a pretty laid back class that is based on discussion of the readings. I haven't taken MCDB 205 (Developmental Biology) so I don't know if there's much overlap, but I feel like this is a good course to take to get familiar with the recent developments in developmental biology as it relates to evolutionary biology. I think it would be helpful to have taken an intro bio class (AP bio, MCDB 120, or MCDB 200) and also genetics to get the most out of this class, since the papers can be fairly involved. A presentation, several short quizzes, and two midterms was all that was graded for the class. Be warned, though--there are quizzes for almost every class, and this class is at 9 in the morning. Those missed quizzes can add up!",
    "This is a wonderful course. If one is interested in the material there is really no downside to taking it.",
    "I loved this class!!!! Seriously awesome. Low pressure, learned a ton, and Antonia is really great. If you screw up the quizzes, she lets you write a proposal and make up for it to some extent."
