   "comments": [
    "I learned about the building blocks of microeconomic theory through a rigorous introduction to neo-classical axioms, followed by an intense look at the decomposition of movements through various forms of the Slutsky Equation. From there, I gained a valuable insight into applications in development economics through a thorough analysis of rural labor markets, inter-temporal consumption and its impact on savings, and an introduction to the case where firms may not seek to maximize profits, or simply can't measure their profits and only report revenue.",
    "Microeconomic theory--theory of firm, consumer",
    "I really enjoyed this course! I always loved Microeconomics a lot, but this course helped me learn even more about my interests and apply the models to development topics. I especially enjoyed the things we learned about the labor market and the motivations of the firm. Even though I had seen some of the models before, all of the material we studied was challenging and gave me new insights.",
    "This course was really exceptional. I learn how to take my foundations in Mircoeconmics and apply them to more complex topics though this course.",
    "Microeconomics theories on both consumers and firms' sides",
    "The course provided me with the opportunity to adopt an analytical approach to Microeconomics. I was able to learn the quantitative background to concepts. The course greatly increased my interest in Microeconomics as a field.",
    "Although I was in an unusual position as a non-IDE student, I developed an understanding of the important role math plays in justifying and applying microeconomic theory. The course provides an excellent foundation of key microeconomic principles; each is applicable beyond international development.",
    "good introduction to micro",
    "- Better understanding of slutsky equations and models where goods are in partial supply",
    "I have learnt a lot of new microeconomic theories and analytical framework which can be used to analyze observed phenomenon and make economic predictions. These microeconomic tools can be used to evaluate government programs, analyze the economic behaviour of individuals and firms under different market conditions and determine relative prices as well as how resources are allocated. Furthermore, the analytical tools taught can be used to solve very human problems. I enjoy the study of the individual and the firm, the study of the hicksian and slutsky substitution effects as well as policy analysis.",
    "The course was a great review of micro concepts learned in undergrad but the intuition learned was the real strength of the class. The class broke down what we had learnt in undergrad and then built it back up. Understanding the intuition really helped cement the concepts (as opposed to memorizing them which meant I remembered little from undergrad). It was a survey course but Mike was always great about pointing out areas of interesting research or papers if we wanted to learn more about a particular facet of the field. It gave a great overview of what was out there, with guidance on how to explore more that in which we were interested.",
    "This course was great at explaining the models that explained the decisions made on an individual and firm level when faced with a constraint to resources.",
    "Strong conceptual framework of consumer and production theory; intuition for mathematical concepts; various real-world applications",
    "I learnt how to fit simple frameworks from microeconomic theory into applied fields. This course has encouraged me to think about development problems using the tools discussed in class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It covered a lot of key material and did have a flow through material but overall it lacked structure in terms of breaks between lectures, and the theoretical explanations made it difficult to see how the material could be applied.",
    "Overall, I think the approach of the course was excellent. The professor emphasized developing our economic intuition and critical thinking over presenting the material as facts to be memorized. Perhaps because I have much less prior experience with economics than many of the others in the class, I felt that the derivations and proofs presented in lecture often went over my head, even after reading the lecture notes. I felt I had to supplement my learning by studying other textbooks with differing levels of mathematical detail. I think I would have benefited from more of a \"dumbed down\" explanation of some of the equations as they were being presented in class, but I can't say that this would have benefited the other students.",
    "I cannot find many weaknesses with the course. It was certainly challenging and I learned a great deal through class lectures, problem sets, and critical introspection and reflection on the material. Having no prior economic background, I don't have any other courses\/syllabi to compare, but I will say that this class exceeded my expectations in terms of the variety of material covered and how much I was able to learn.",
    "I think it's a great course! If there was more opportunity for us to apply the model to actual data, that would be great. I know that there clearly is not enough time for that during class, but maybe there could be a problem on each problem set that allows us to work with data and use a model we studied to explain what happened in reality! That would be great! That's really my only idea on how to improve the course, because I really enjoyed it! I learned so much and it always challenged me intellectually!",
    "The strengths of this course are the in depth look into different Microeconmics topics, such as consumber behavior, labor supply, and theory of the firm, as well as it's interactive nature. This class is definitely more of a discussion and if there is something that you want to talk about that is even semi-related to the curret topic of discussion, we talk about it even if that means we have to push off what we had planned to talk about that day. The weaknesses of this course is that there is generally no structure, due to class discussions. Often time we will discuss a question for an entire class that is only of importance to 1 or 2 students. I feel that sometimes these discussions are better left for office hours or section, so that we can get though all the class material, which we were not able to do this semester.",
    "The way microeconomics theories can interact with the real world like the example on the food subsidy program It'd be better if the course contains more of the real-world stuff.",
    "The lecture notes for the course are very helpful and clear. The concepts are explained very well. The problem sets are challenging and thought provoking. The course can be improved if a little more time is spent on explaining the theory of the firm, with emphasis on the difference between market structures.",
    "The key strengths are Professor Boozer's enthusiasm and flexibility, as well as the clarity and guidance of Martin Mattsson as teaching fellow.",
    "on certain topics, the depth seemed to be similar to that of an undergrad course. failed to cover as much scope as we could",
    "- Provides good foundation of important micro concepts e.g. consumer theory and how they are applied in different cases - Could have covered greater breadth of topics like game theory",
    "I think that this course is highly well-organized and this is also one of my favourite courses. Furthermore, we can apply and experiment with the economic knowledge and use the graphical techniques to conduct economic analysis. The courses also lend me insights into how we can analyse relevant issues including personal affairs, politics, society and global issues. The course could be further improved if more help can be provided with respect to the examinations as well as assignments as these tend to be very challenging. I also face many difficulties in tackling the assignments. The examinations are also exceptionally tough and challenging.",
    "My only criticism is that it is a survey course- we look at a lot of things but with less depth than I would want ideally. However, that is more a function of the semester time constraint than the instructor or curriculum. I liked the way micro was taught, we spent a lot of time really understanding the intuition and the way different theories were built up. (Even though I was sick of Axioms, I will likely never forget them.) The amount and depth with which we studied the consumer side made the firm side really easy to pick up. We ran out of time to do oligopolies but Mike's notes are great, so it was good to at least get those.",
    "The course notes were not concise enough. The illustration by the professor could have been clearer. Sometimes the instructor deviates from the topic for too long. The course runs too slow for the first half of the semester and too fast for the second half, with the final exam focusing on the materials taught in the last three weeks.",
    "Teaching on individual decisions before firm decision-making was a great strategy because it made the later part of the course easier to understand.",
    "Strengths - Very good build-up from elementary concepts onto more advanced theory helps students from all backgrounds follow classroom teaching easily. Lecture notes, assignments, TA resources and exam preparation is very helpful.",
    "The course is wonderful in that it teaches us to fir theoretical frameworks into applied work. That said, I think we could have delved a little more into the research work that incorporates these frameworks. Given time constraints, I think it would be great if these papers were included in our problems sets to some extent, or in the form of a writing assignment which could be useful in applied work."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is interested in a wide variety of microeconomic topics. This is a terrific foundation from which students can learn about areas in which they may decide to specialize. This course was challenging and extremely rewarding.",
    "Yes. This is a core module for IDE students.",
    "Yes!",
    "I loved this class and would highly recommend it to any graduate student that wants to learn more about Microeconomics. It is a good basic class. It will move fast if you have had no Microeconomic training before but it is entireally doable and very interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "I highly recommend the course to students who want to pursue their interest in Microeconomics.",
    "For me, the heavy use of math (multivariate calculus, systems of equations) was a tremendous challenge. Non-IDE students should avoid taking this course if they have only a basic understanding of college-level calculus. At least two or three courses in calculus are recommended.",
    "if you have not taken much microceonomics, this will be a good course to take as an introduction",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I will strongly recommend this course to another student. The study of microeconomics at graduate level can lead to many interesting career choices, which might include public service, finance or business. The economic tools taught here can be used to design business models or shape government policies.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Yes. If the student is interested in microeconomics, it excellently covers the major topics.",
    "Yes. The curriculum is well suited for those with a background in Microeconomic Theory and prepares us for an intuitive understanding of the subject for future understanding."
