    "Professor Bloom was always phenomenal. It was a true honor to be his student. As for weakness, I wish we could do the class in-person, i.e. without video chat. Even though the technological set-up often worked flawlessly, it hardly substituted for the original experience in his living room."

    "Medium class. Bloom now teaches via Skype, which is not an ideal classroom setting. Relatively low-key just one paper, and most focus is on class discussion.",
    "It's Shakespeare, with Bloom. If you get the chance to, take it.",
    "Must take before graduating yale",
    "Take this class if you want to go through the main tragedies and romances in Shakespeare's corpus with Harold Bloom. Bloom has some pretty specific readings and opinions of Shakespeare's plays; this will be the only interpretive framework for the course. If that is off-putting to you, you may not learn much. If it is not, this is a great opportunity to learn from probably the greatest literary critic of their generation in a relatively chill, low-stakes seminar environment.",
    "Definitely yes, if you get in. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
