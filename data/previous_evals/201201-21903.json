   "comments": [
    "This class is all about learning the differences between the varying mammalian taxa. If you do not enjoy memorization I would suggest you do not take this class. Half of the course is lecture and the other half is lab, which is quite enjoyable. You get to touch and inspect different skins and skeletons of different animals. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in mammalogy, animal diversity, paleontology, etc.",
    "I would recommend the course. It was very interesting and in the lab you get to see many mammals species from around the world that you won't get a chance to see in any other class.",
    "Lots of memorization, but you get to play with cool skulls, skeletons, and stuffed animals!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even for a non-science major. I am an English major and not particularly good at or interested in science, but I found this class engaging, fun, and unlike anything I ever thought I would study. While I definitely felt somewhat at a disadvantage not coming from an evolutionary biology background, it is still possible to do well and enjoy this class even as a humanities student.",
    "Take this class if it is taught again and you are interested in mammals! I loved this class! It was so interesting and I felt like I learned so much about mammals. The lab portion was probably my favorite part and one of the reasons I learned a lot during the class. The structure of the class was smart- half lab\/half lecture. All the orders were covered were taught well, besides rodents,which I thought were covered very cursorily compared to the other orders. My perspective on mammals has been fundamentally shifted based on this class and I am glad that I took it.",
    "The course was great. This class is a general overview of mammals, and I say general, because there really is no way to delve intensely into mammals in one semester. But it was great, because we learned about the different orders and families and just got a good overview that did go somewhat into specifics. Each week would consist of 1 lecture on the order we were learning about, and then 1 lab on the same order. The labs were pretty awesome, we got to study the skulls\/bones\/pelts of many different species, and had to learn how to identify them. In terms of work, there was a midterm (written + lab practical), a final (same format as midterm, but non-cumulative), and a paper. Not that work intensive, and am overall cool class.",
    "I would recommend Anthropology 310 to anyone interested in getting a good foundation in mammalian diversity, whether it is for evolutionary biology, archaeological faunal analysis, etc. Preparing for the exams requires enough attentive participation in lab and enough review time that it would probably not be a worthwhile pursuit for someone who was only passively interested in the material.",
    "Only take this course if you have already taken a bio anthro course and are comfortable with the terminology, doing labs, etc. It is EXTREMELY difficult if you have never taken a bio anthro class before. You don't learn how to do labs properly until the third or fourth one, and by then you've missed a bunch of critical information that will be really important on the first midterm. This class also requires a ton of memorization of very dense material. Basically, it's really hard and don't take it unless you're absolutely captivated by the subject matter.",
    "It is a great survey course of mammals. The workload is definitely manageable and Professor Sargis makes lectures enjoyable and makes the diverse world of mammals come alive. The best part of the course and what sets it apart from the other courses I've taken at Yale and why I would definitely recommend it, is the ability to get hands on with skulls and skins of the animals you are learning about. The specimens from the Peabody are amazing and you get to touch everything from bats to bear skulls to red panda fur.",
    "Hope that this is seriously reworked to have a slightly better structure, 'cause the subject matter is awesome and you there aren't many other places for non-science majors like myself to get to poke around in some of the Peabody's finest collections. But be prepared to memorize a lot, without a whole lot of support.",
    "This was a really unusual and interesting course. If you're interested in animals, definitely take it--you will know EVERYTHING about them. Professor Sargis made the material really fun--I really cared about learning each order of mammals, even rodents! It's a lot of memorization but since you're allowed to bring in notes for the practical, it's not overbearing.",
    "The course was an amazing way to learn about mammals. Lab was awesome, handling skulls and pelts. Exams were harder than the course might lead you to believe but are not that bad if you study well. Don't be fooled by what Prof Sargis or anyone else tell you: the exams are not all that general. If it appeared on a slide, it is fair game.",
    "Mammalogy is a great course for students interested in (cranial) anatomy and for those who want a broad overview of all mammal species. About half of alloted lecture time is spent in the lab studying specimens from the peabody; very cool, but make sure you quickly learn what to do during lab time so you don't miss out during the first few lab periods and lose points on the first exam. Not much time is spent on animal behavior or cognition; the course really is heavy on skull morphology. Also, I wish I was walking away with a greater contextual understanding of general phylogenic relationships within Mammalia as opposed to many details about individual families.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this class. It'smuch less inspiring than Ornithology as an organismal course. Lectures are pretty repetitive and lab is boring. It was definitely my least favorite class this term. It was just \"OK.\" Very few videos of animals if that's what you're into. Lab = looking at hundreds of rat skulls.",
    "This is a fun course, although it's much more about morphology and skin\/skull identification than about the ecology or behavior of the different groups. But you get to see tons of awesome specimens (skins, skulls, skeletons) from the Peabody collection and the workload is minimal.The written exams are easy, but the practical can be a little bit tricky. Overall, though, an interesting class that is unlike most you can take at Yale.",
    "This class is super fun, and not too much work. Eric is a great professor and the material is fascinating!",
    "You get a pretty good overview of all mammals. Lab is incredible- you get to examine a bunch of mammal skulls and skins. If you're interested in mammals, I would definitely recommend the class, though if you have no biology background, you will probably find it difficult. Even though the class was a bit of a struggle for me, I enjoyed it very much.",
    "A great class to learn about the general phylogeny of mammals! It is not easy, though; requires work and memorization",
    "Mammalogy was an enjoyable course, providing a very detailed exploration of the mammalian clade. The tests were rigorous but fair. The lab work was a nice addition to the lecture, providing a unique and interesting hands-on component. However, the lab often ended up being a mechanized following of the taxonomic key. The phylogeny and extensive taxonomic jargon included in the course (while necessary) was often cumbersome, and the amount of material in this course can be daunting. However, these critiques are far outweighed by positives. Professor Sargis continues to be one of my favorite professors at Yale. Despite the amount of time he declares he is \"not an expert\" on certain topics, he always seems to have the answers to just about any question he is thrown. He is clear and is genuinely passionate about the subject he teaches. Further, he extremely relaxed and down to earth, knowing just when to mix real life experiences, humor, and wit into his lectures. He is always approachable. Take this class just for him alone. Additionally, the curriculum is packed with interesting stories and fun facts about each clade. The graduate students and guest lectures added a wonderful flavor to the course as an undergraduate The classes flew by, both because of the break-neck speed and fascinating material being covered. On the whole, Mammalogy was a great class. Consider taking it credit\/d, as a fifth class, as bio major or pre-med, or even as a non-science student looking for an immersive look at mammals."
