    "If you want to learn spanish then yes.",
    "It's a pretty fast pace course but not a hard one. I would recommend taking this class because it was not a hard course, but I did learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class because it gives you a firm base of knowledge that you can build off of in the coming years.",
    "Definitely take it - Spanish is a wonderful language, and the coursework is well balanced in terms of teaching reading, writing, and oral skills. You will have quizzes, compositions, oral exams, in addition to daily homework that will help you retain all the new information you learn. I will say, however, that if you have no prior experience with the language, it will require more effort on your part, because many of your peers will have had years of Spanish under their belt. All of the instructors are knowledgeable and experienced, but try to get Sebastian Diaz in particular - he made class humorous and enjoyable.",
    "You will most likely have to take it for a requirement. If you've seen the language before, try to take L2 or higher.",
    "Take this class and take it with Sebastian! He is absolutely AMAZING and the reason why this class was so great. The workload is very reasonable and all the quizzes\/compositions\/exams aren't too bad at all.",
    "Spanish 110 is a good class to begin your language requirements. Be warned however that if you have not taken spanish before, this class would be challenging.",
    "Get Sebastian if you can...he will change your attitude towards language.",
    "intensive elementary spanish that is not too much work, and enjoyable if you like your teacher. I would recommend this class and Sebastian.",
    "Standard introductory Spanish class, but take it with Sebastian if you can. He is the man! He made 9:25 Spanish so much more bearable and even fun.",
    "Take it if you are good at languages or have taken Spanish before. If not, take a language that people do not take in high school."
