    "Yes. But only if you have to. Because it's hard.",
    "I would recommend Gen. Ecology for E&EB students, math people, or science people, but would NOT recommend it for non-science majors. The tests were too difficult. I thought, upon reading older reviews, that I could handle it, but I really couldn't.",
    "NO.",
    "I have mixed feeling about this class. I think in large part it's a missed opportunity. It's the first exposure to ecology for many EEB, EVST and possibly the only ecology course other undergraduates will take. Yet, the course provides no real over-arching introduction to the subject and eschews the use of an ecology textbook, focusing instead of the use of mathematical models in ecology (using a primer on these models as a primary text). Thus, one can leave the course with a decent familiarity with various equations, but little larger appreciation of ecology overall. For all its emphasis on mathematical models, the course has no real problem sets beyond the basic questions at the end of each chapter in the primer. The professor is enthusiastic but without a textbook to follow, slides that generally offer cues for his teaching rather than outlining the material to be covered in any detail, and quick drawings of graphs and tables on the chalkboard, the course tends to collapse into abstraction and generalities. The strengths of the course are the practical written exercises--the cemetery demographic project and a short paper--which force students to grapple with the practical applications of what they're learning. The exams are a mixed bag--mathematical exercises pop up and one must be able to extrapolate from the general discussions in class or from the equations in the text to answer them, but with little ongoing practice in these kinds of exercises during the term, those with strong math skills and exposure will succeed better than those with less math background. In general, for those interested in ecology, this is the only taste of it you'll get at an introductory level at Yale, but it could be better conceived as a course than it is now...",
    "A simple ecology course that is pretty straightforward and presented well in lecture. There are 2 midterms, a 10-12 page paper and a final. The midterms are fair and the paper can be a lot of fun if you do the work in section and pick an interesting topic. Take the course! David Post is awesomeee.",
    "Great class!!!! A good science-y science credit, but not extremely difficult!!",
    "EVST 223 is an OK class. It's by no means a hard class, but the math behind ecology such as predator prey dynamics, metapopulation limitations, etc, isn't particularly interesting if it's not something that you care about. As an EVST major, this was a required class, and I don't think I would have taken if I hadn't needed to fulfill my major requirement. Professor Post tried his best at making the course interesting, but general ecology just isn't that interseting when learned in a class room setting.",
    "Take it. Even if you're not EVST or EEB, it's important knowledge to have - very illuminating and will give you a new perspective on the way the natural and political world works.",
    "General Ecology. Very mathy, but don't be scared, he gives you the equations on a sheet for the exams (he doesn't tell you what they're all for, but they're still there). Professor Post is a little scatterbrained, but good to talk to one-on-one. Just pay attention in lecture, especially to the graphs he draws on the board. Grading is very fair, I don't know how the averages on both of our tests were in the 70s (without a curve, relax)! Mildly interesting subject matter - competition, predation, population growth, global climate change. It is great that the paper is due before Thanksgiving, trust me, you will be very happy about it.",
    "Yes. It is a required class for some majors, but is alsoa good course to take if you are comfortable with basic calc and want to learn about population dynamics and ecosystem interactions.",
    "If you need it for EVST or E&EB (like me), take it obviously. If you're interested in ecology, you probably know enough already to take a higher level course. If you're not particularly interested in the subject material and are looking to take a science class, I think there are better options.If you're not a science major and want to learn about nature\/the environment\/how the world works take ATMOSPHERES, OCEANS, and ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE with Rob Smith it will change the way you think about a lot of things.",
    "An interesting topic presented in a flat manner. Maybe when it is team taught it is better, but for now avoid it unless required to take it.",
    "I would say only take this class if you are required to (i.e. you're an environmental studies or E&EB major). It was poorly organized, with no emphasized overarching themes or synthesis and no problem sets for a moderately mathy class. The sections were largely a waste of time, the paper assignment was well-intentioned but poorly executed, and I know that I would have learned a lot more if they had just put some time into organizing the course better.",
    "This class was hard to do well in with no ecology background in my opinion. There were no problem sets so it was hard to practice the kinds of questions given on the tests. I would recommend it if you are good at math and like science, but if you struggle with math, especially using graphs, I would rethink taking the course.",
    "Yes, general ecology is fascinating, I only wish I had taken it earlier. It's a bit more quantitative than your general bio classes (at least the first half of the semester) but the math is key to understanding the concepts, and is not overwhelming by any means. Professor Post is a good lecturer, and the concepts are pretty common sense. Take it if you're an EVST major or just want to know more about the subject. My favorite class this semester.",
    "This was an interesting class--it's a survey of ecological principles from a mathematical standpoint--you learn how to model population growth, predation, competition, etc. with differential equations. You also have to write a very open-ended paper. The class is a lot harder than it sounds, but worth it if you're really into ecology and don't mind a lot of graphs and math.",
    "This is honestly one of the worst classes that I have taken at Yale. I would not recommend it at all. However, most of the people in the class have no choice and are taking in to fulfill EEB or EVST requirements. But if its not required for your major, DON'T take this class.Ecology has the potential to be a very interesting subject. But, David Post ruins it. His lectures are extremely confusing and hard to follow. All he does is throw up random formulas and graphs on the board and talks very quickly, leaving the entire class in the dust. He is inaccessible and doesn't really seem to care very much about the subject or the students. There are no problem sets or anything, so the test problems come out of nowhere.",
    "A good course--important stuff to know if you are EVST or EEB or just interested in how the environment functions. A lot of mathematical models--nothing hard, but math nonetheless. Not fascinating, but important, and not extremely difficult. The tests can be tricky.",
    "General Ecology is a great class -- but it may not be what you expect when reading the course description. While it does give a good overview of many topics in ecology, it is much more quantitative than you would expect. The course spends a lot of time going over population dynamics and how to graph and use equations to model competition and predation. Personally, I thought that this was a GREAT way to study ecology (much less wishy-washy than I expected from ecology). The reading is moderate, and the textbook is WONDERFUL (I actually really ENJOYED reading the textbook and found it super helpful). The tests are not difficult -- as long as you are prepared for the quantitative questions and understand how the graphs and equations work. There is one major paper, but you have a lot of time to work on it, and many sections are devoted to working on the paper. Overall, I thought that this course was a good introduction to ecology and would recommend it to anyone who wants a more quantitative approach to ecology (which, for the record, I really enjoyed and thought was very interesting).",
    "The material in this course is very interesting and relevant to anyone interested in biological processes on any level. The structure of the course could be stronger though. If the course were given a required text, and had problem sets rather than an essay only vaguely related to the lecture topics, then I would highly recommend it. Otherwise, the exams can be quite difficult to prepare for.",
    "It's ok...Post was a good lecturer and very clear and a cool guy, but for some reason I didn't really like the class. Not really sure why though...I just didn't.",
    "No, don't take this class until its syllabus is restructured. Take a class with Professor Post, take classes in E&EB, but don't take Ecology 220.",
    "Yes. EEB and EVST majors have to take it so no choice there. IF you have any interest in Ecology you should definitely take it. If you're expecting to learn only about animals though you are in the wrong class.",
    "If I hadn't already been inspired by other professors to major in EEB, I would absolutely have tossed out the major after having met such an annoying professor. David Post is just a major tool. I learned so little in this class, but it wasn't for lack of trying. The lectures were awful, the final exam was poorly written, and the schedule for the class was careless. It's amazing how such an intrinsically interesting topic can become so soporific. Do not take unless it's a req for your major.",
    "Good introduction to ecology.",
    "I took both General Ecology and Political Ecology this term. I was initially worried that they would either overlap too much or contradict each other; on the contrary, they complimented each other. General Ecology gave me both a context for learning about conservation and an intuitive feel for how ecosystems function that certainly helped me in Political Ecology and probably helped shape my view of how all sorts of things work in the world.",
    "I would not take this class if you are expecting an easy science credit- it wasn't particularly exciting, and as it was a prerequisite for many different majors, most of the people didn't apply themselves as much.",
    "don't take it for an easy science cred or unless you have to -- there are loads of more interesting science classes out there. also, if you want to be an ecology or environmental studies major, take this class EARLY on in your studies to make sure that's what you want... or to get it over with! it's not cool that this class also has a paper."
