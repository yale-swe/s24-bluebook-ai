   "comments": [
    "It is a hard class, so take if you're really interested in G&G. Seminar format, so you have to participate. Won't slide through the class: be ready to work a decent amount.",
    "It was a struggle (emotionally), but it was worth it for the science credit. Hauling my sad self up to RKZ at 9 am twice a week sucked, and the class atmosphere was pretty tense sometimes. It was not fun to be sure, but it sucked less than I imagine orgo would have, so it has that going for it.",
    "This is a good comprehensive introduction to geology - the class mainly consists of reading a chapter of the textbook before every meeting and talking about discussion questions, so it feels like there is fairly little work on a regular basis (especially since there are no exams) but you walk away realizing you've actually learned a lot. The research papers are long, but not bad at all if you start them ahead of time. Professor Park is a really quirky guy, and his sense of humor definitely isn't for everyone, but if you vibe with him he's pretty cool. It's a consistent course, so if you like it during shopping period you'll like it for the rest of the semester and if you don't, you probably won't. Attendance is also required and taken, so if you have a problem waking up for a 9am on science hill then you might want to reconsider.",
    "Can be relaxed and interesting for an intro science class!",
    "I would recommend it! Professor Park is great and passionate about teaching. Just be sure to get a heads start on the final paper and to write about something you care about, as otherwise it can be a lot of work at once.",
    "EVST 200 should be a class to take if you are in desperate need for a science credit. The workload is pretty light, but classes are boring.",
    "The final paper is A LOT. If you're not a science person but you want to take this class, you may be a bit intimidated to participate - I would advice to just participate anyways and show that you are engaged. If you have the time to put into this class you'll learn a bunch (and you learn a lot from giving 5 presentations on a science article over the course of the term) - but if you don't have the time, don't make the mistake of taking a seminar science class with two papers because it's not something you can blow off.",
    "Accessible science credit. Excellent professor. Engaging material.",
    "Take this class. Get ready for reading lots of academic Geology papers, presenting on those papers, discussing those papers, and writing papers on those papers. This class in pretty unique amongst into science courses at Yale in terms of really making you engage with the literature as well as having small class discussion. I loved it and felt that it really showed me so many new things to be curious about (I ended up reading a large portion of a 400 pg book on permafrost for fun during reading week.) Professor Park is also pretty fantastic. He is really happy to talk to you about his research and tell stories about things he has worked on.",
    "A geology\/earth systems class taught in an interesting way! Seminar format means no problem sets or tests, though you will be asked to make a lot of presentations and write two long papers. Only take this class if you need it for a requirement or have a real interest in these issues, but look forward to a good class environment and lots of dialogue (if you can stay awake at 9 AM).",
    "It is the best option for your geology requirements for Environmental Studies, but still not ideal."
