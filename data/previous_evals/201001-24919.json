   "comments": [
    "A lot harder than I thought. It is not a GUT. Open note tests are very difficult. VERY fair grader though. Expect to work hard. Not an easy QR. Trust me! I learned the hard way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for anyone who is frightened by QRs- you can do it! You cover a broad field of topics in geometry and you will find it overall enjoyable.",
    "Take it!!!",
    "It's not an easy class, persay; it's designed for people who have poor math backgrounds, not people who don't want to do any work. Problem sets are relatively easy but exams are tricky and you'll have to study for them. The professor and the curriculum are great, but, at least when I took the class, the other people (those who came in looking for an easy QR and spend most of the time texting) really bring the class down.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It has weekly assignments but the questions are nothing that really blow you away as they are gone over in the week of classes. The teacher is great which i think is a very important part in enjoying the class",
    "All in all, this course was an overview of many different concepts that are directly reflected in the way our world is structured, such as fractals and Einstein's relativity theories. i would recommend this course to any student who is not a math major but is looking for an interesting math course to take.",
    "Math 101 is a great course for students who are not interested in a math major",
    "yes i would, the math is enjoyable and very doable.",
    "Geometry of Nature is a great course to take if you are terrible at math, like me. It covers some really interesting topics and often leads to interesting conversations about time and the universe and stuff. I would recommend this course to anyone that qualifies taking it. Professor Frame(who hopefully continues to teach) is a great Professor and even more amazing person who will definitely help you out. All you have to do is ask. The TA is also especially helpful in getting you to understand the material. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.",
    "Mathematics 101 is an interesting and informative class for those of us with little previous math experience. Professor frame is excited about the subject, eager to teach, and understanding of the fact that math does not come easily to everyone. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "a course for those who don't want to take calculus"
