   "comments": [
    "Pretty good course, comes as promised. Freedman is a good lecturer, and the material is usually very interesting, if somewhat scattershot. The final research paper is pretty rough due to the course's survey nature - there's nothing about which you'll have much background. Overall a worthwhile class.",
    "Solid course on the Middle Ages. One 5-page paper, one 10-page paper, a midterm, no final.",
    "Take it if you love the Middle Ages. Or even if you don't. Prof. Freedman is fabulous, and the subject itself is great.",
    "Decent class. I took for a pre-industrial credit so often it was a struggle to get myself interested in the material (outside my time period and region of focus within history), but the final paper gives you a good chance to explore a topic you're more interested in.",
    "Great class. Freedman is a really good lecturer; he made history class feel like an educational story time with a couple of jokes thrown in there. One doesn't have to go to class every time, but it is so worth it.The class is very straightforward: 1 midterm, no final exam, 1 short paper (~5 pages), and a final paper (10-15 pages).",
    "Yeah. You learn about history that is overlooked by virtually every other class at Yale.",
    "Paul Freedman is lovely, this period is fascinating, it's a well-structured survey, and the work is on par with your typical history lecture. They're putting it online, but I promise you it's better in person.",
    "Take it. This is the kind of history you've never learned about elsewhere, and Freedman is the perfect guide to take you through it. He's an excellent, engaging lecturer with a clear focus in each lecture that makes note-taking easy and has you leaving each class with a feeling that you really learned something new.The workload isn't heavy, but the readings you do have are really good and perfectly supplement the lectures.",
    "The Early Middle Ages is a great overview of an era that you would probably otherwise know nothing about. It goes through the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, the rise of the Goths and other barbarian tribes, the kingdom of the Franks, the spread of Islam, Charlemagne, and (very briefly) the Vikings. It's not that much work: the weekly reading load is not onerous; and there's a midterm and two papers (one five-pager and one ten-to-fifteen-pager). And Professor Freeman is a great lecturer. I found the sections to actually be useful, unlike most I've experienced. The one big problem, in my opinion, was the TAs' grading. It was nitpicky, and our TA seemed to assume that none of us knew how to write an argumentative essay, which was a bit patronizing. An unfortunate blemish in an otherwise great class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Very interesting.",
    "Great class. Great lecturer. Reasonable reading. Pretty good. Would take again.",
    "Take this course if you are in interested in the fall of Rome and general medieval history",
    "TAKE IT! A hidden gem in the history department. Freedman is as good as they get. The class has minimal requirements - one short paper, a midterm, and one final paper. Lectures were a joy. The reading wasn't overburdening, even for a history course. And on top of it all, it's a really interesting time period that still informs the present day.",
    "If you want a fun course on a really understudied and entertaining part of history, take this course. Know that a lot of it will focus on the rise of religion throughout the lands of the former Roman Empire, so if you don't like heresies or the church, you are now warned.",
    "I would definitely recommend History 210 for everyone. The class gives a whole new look at the middle ages and covers everything from Constantine until Charlemagne. The work load isn't too bad - a short essay, a midterm and a final paper. The final paper can be a lot of work or almost no work, depending on what you want to do with it. Lectures are worth going too, even if you might think that it's early in the morning. Freedman has a lot to share about the middle ages, makes sure to cover every part of the Europe, and even includes the beginning of Islam. This is a great lecture, definitely worth it!",
    "HIST 210 is a fun and engaging \"under the radar\" history lecture at Yale. Expectations are incredibly straightforward -- two papers (one short, one a bit longer research paper), a midterm, and no final. The requirements for the research paper are eminently reasonable, and you will have a ton of guidance at your disposal from Prof. Freedman and his TF's. Prof. Freedman's lectures were engaging, relevant to the present day, and often funny (eggs Benedict in Rome, anyone?). If I could offer any criticism, the material covered in the latter half of the course was a bit confused and less interesting than the earlier material on Rome and Christianity. But that may just be my bias. Overall, a solid class, and a good way to knock out that pre-industrial requirement for the history major.",
    "Take it. Right now.Professor Freedman is absolutely wonderful. He's funny, charming, an absolutely brilliant scholar and lecturer, and has an obvious and infectious love for the subject. The course gives a broad overview of Europe and the Mediterranean world from the end of the Roman Empire to the Vikings. The reading includes fascinating primary sources and insightful historical works, and is not at all overwhelming. The work gives students remarkably free rein to explore their own interests. Definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course, though not as strongly as I might recommend some other introductory history lectures. This course covers interesting material, Professor Freedman is a good lecturer, and the assignments are generally interesting and rewarding rather than onerous. However, the volume of material covered in this course means that very little time is spent on any one location or time period. This creates the feeling that one is getting only a very cursory overview of the time period. If giving students a broad understanding of the trends of the middle ages is the goal, the course accomplishes this. Students looking to delve into one of the relevant cultures in particular, however, might do well to try a different course.",
    "Absolutely recommend it. Particularly good if you need a pre-industrial history credit, but worth taking no matter what.",
    "I probably wouldn't. Professor Freedman is GREAT, but it wasn't for me. That said, I didn't realize the course material didn't appeal to me until about 1\/2 way through, so I think if you're really interested in the time period and religious history, then it might be a good bet.",
    "This class is a pretty good review of history from the decline and fall of the Roman Empire through the Early Middle Ages. If this is a period that you know little about, you might want to consider taking this course. However, it certainly was not the best history course I've taken at Yale. Professor Freedman's lectures are good, though they can be slow at times, especially towards the end of the course. The course also does not give too much work, so it's manageable in that sense as well. Overall, I would assess this class as good but not great.",
    "Great class! Really interesting time period, and Professor Freedman does a great job investigating it!",
    "If you're interested in the time period, it's an enjoyable course. The lectures were generally well delivered, but frequently were quite jumpy and without any discernible \"main ideas\". The course progression itself was also a bit too disjointed for my liking. Still, it wasn't a whole lot of work, and I had fun. A good way to understand what happens between the fall of Rome and the Middle Ages.",
    "An overview of a neglected slice of history, connecting the fall of Rome to the rise of medieval Europe, looking at all of the petty kingdoms that rose and fell in between. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, even to those who aren't history majors - the material was fascinating, and I found myself applying things I'd learned (events and people) to the classes I was taking in my major (English).",
    "You probably don't know a whole lot about the Early Middle Ages. So you probably need to take this class. There isn't much on the Middle Ages at Yale, and this, though a survey, is at least a very good one.",
    "I would recommend this course to any history major not only for the quality of the instruction but for the importance of the subject to the course of western history. It solves the disjunction between medieval europe and the civilization of the roman empire.",
    "The class attempts to overview a large period of history, almost 8 centuries worth, and this may be an over extension of what a semester can do. Additionally, the nature of the period covered makes it difficult for a survey class. We really do feel the need to ask \"what happened?\" at the end of the term, and it's hard to find a good answer to this. The class may be too broad in topic as well; I felt as if the section on Islam and the Middle East was important but detracted from even more important parts of the time (i.e. Charlemagne, his empire's decline, and the crystallization of feudal culture). However, the portions about the fall of Rome, Justinian's era, and the Merovingians were thorough, and even though the class seemed to lose some of its steam 2\/3ds of the way through, it was a great introduction to a study of a frustrating and puzzling era in human history. Freedman is a good lecturer, and if you can get Lauren Mancia as a TF do it! Don't expect a class like you'd get for Roman or Medieval History; this is a unique time.",
    "This is essentially a religious studies class tied in with the history of the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. You have a midterm and two papers. The homework is a bit lighter than other history classes."
