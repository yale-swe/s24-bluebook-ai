    "However you come in, you'll be smarter and tougher when you get out. Take it.",
    "This course is amazing. He's incredibly demanding, and some people don't like his teaching style, but I thought I learned a lot from it. He pushes back on you and pushes you to do really well. He's also really nice, underneath it. He lays out expectations, and if you meet them, then you will do well, and if you don't then you won't. It's very straightforward.",
    "This class is fantastic training for anyone who wants to be journalist, but take this only if you are seriously considering journalism as a career. For the final feature, pick a topic that you're REALLY interested in, and be prepared to put in 110% of your effort. You get as much out of this class as you put in.",
    "Great course, take it if you want to be a journalist or even if you're simply interested in the industry and willing to dedicate substantial time and effort to writing a large reported piece.",
    "I loved this course. You don't only learn about writing and interviewing; you learn about the business of journalism and how to make a career out of a \"dying industry\". Professor Brill is really cool and a great teacher\/mentor figure\/ person to know in general. Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in journalism"
