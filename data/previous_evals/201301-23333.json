    "If you're considering taking this course, DO IT. It was a lot of reading and a lot of work, but it's 110% worth it. Getting up at 9 AM to takeNeuman's section is worth it, too. You can't be half-hearted about this class.",
    "I highly, highly recommend Epic with Professor Neuman. The syllabus is phenomenal, and Neuman was a fantastic seminar leader to guide us through it. Be forewarned - the reading load is extremely heavy: this is the class in which I invested the most time this semester. Six fat books and four (fairly short, about 6 page) essays makes this a commitment. Neuman is a very fair grader, though. If you have interesting ideas about the books, he will reward you for that. A necessary part of a liberal arts curriculum, especially if you considered and rejected the idea of Directed Studies (like me). Take it!",
    "It is a class with a lot of work, but very worth it if you want to major in English.",
    "This is a MUST take course at Yale, it includes all of the books that everyone should read at some point in their life but may never get around to",
    "This is a great course - one of those rare courses that feels like a \"project.\" It defined my semester. It's tough, but that's the point."
