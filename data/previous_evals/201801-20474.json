    "The best chemistry lab I have taken at Yale so far. I've developed data analysis and synthesis skills for inorganic chemistry. Skills such as reading NMR and IR spectra (review from orgo), as well as crystal structures and advanced synthesis techniques are taught.",
    "This course offered a broad introduction to inorganic chem labs. It reinforced basic lab skills, like IR and NMR analyses, while also focusing on teaching us how to write formal lab reports, like those which would appear in journal publications.",
    "I learned how to approach writing for chemistry and science, as well as how to keep a well organized and documented lab notebook. I didn't learn particularly many hands-on lab skills, but I think the class was more focused on the report side, from which I learned a lot.",
    "How to carry out inorganic experiments, how to write effective reports and communications.",
    "Great course for learning how to write a scientific paper, as well as good practice of experimental technique.",
    "Great way to learn how to write a scientific paper, also a nice experience in learning experimental techniques.",
    "This course taught my a lot about chemistry lab skills, as well as writing an actual inorganic chemistry lab report.",
    "I learned that Jonathan Parr is an absolute savage.",
    "This class taught me how to write a real report on scientific findings. I also learned basic lab techniques.",
    "I learned how to write a proper journal, beyond the usual lab reports I would write for other lab classes. This class also got me interested in inorganic chemistry.",
    "Improved in laboratory techniques and learned more about inorganic chemistry and the concepts behind the reactions. Also learned how to use a variety of computer programs associated with chemistry, and how to analyze chemical data effectively."

   "comments": [
    "This course had very interesting experiments and it was very well taught.",
    "The course was structured so as to roughly keep pace with the content covered in CHEM 252 - this arrangement reinforced my understanding of key concepts in inorganic chemistry. As far as the weekly timeslots permitted, I thought the course managed to cover a wide range of fields in inorganic chemistry. The experimental methods used in this class, however, were largely familiar to us. Perhaps, more advanced techniques specific to inorganic chemistry could be explored.",
    "Honestly, this was an all-around well designed course, with a nice balance of breadth and depth.",
    "Honestly, this was a very well designed course with great breadth and depth.",
    "This class is very good. There is nothing I would change.",
    "This course is wonderful and should not be changed at all. The labs were easily understood and taught so much within a small time frame. Perhaps some of the computer programs used could be a little more explained for people who are not fantastic with computers, but the professor was always available and willing to help."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if he\/she is a chemistry major. This course also fulfills the WR credit if necessary, and it's a great way to get that second WR out of the way if you need it. Dr. Parr is fantastic and guides you along the way to becoming a successful scientist in the lab space.",
    "Great chem lab to take for majors and other STEM fields.",
    "This is a good class to take if you need a lab or a writing credit. The experiments are fairly interesting, and Dr. Parr is very helpful both in lab and during lecture, when he outlines what needs to be done on the reports. There are only 4 reports, and while they can take a while to write, I felt like I improved as a scientific writer.",
    "Yes. It is a useful class to learn to write chemistry papers.",
    "Absolutely - great course, Dr. Parr is awesome, also a nice WR.",
    "If you're a chemistry major, this is a fantastic elective to take - useful skills, relaxed, and Dr. Parr is great.",
    "Yes. This course was very interesting, very hands on, actually informative about how to write a real lab report, and Dr Parr is an awesome teacher.",
    "Yes! Its a great lab and you should def take it! Also if youre doing it, take the writing credit! All of the writing assignments are graded on completion which is super clutch and theres only one extra full paper.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you are a chemistry major. It is wonderful. You actually learn a lot, and it is not too stressful. The workload really is not terrible, even with the writing credit."
