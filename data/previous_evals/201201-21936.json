    "yes, if you need a methods class. the assignments were fun :D",
    "The class is a great introduction to anthropological research methods. I took it as a methods requirement for the sociology major and it was very interesting to approach ethnographic research from an anthropological view. Kamari Clarke is an excellent prof and was very helpful especially in the ethical issues of ethnographic research. Everyone in class is pretty laidback too so there's no pressure but it's pretty easy to participate and offer opinions. The outside research exercises are pretty fun too though they can take a bit of time."
