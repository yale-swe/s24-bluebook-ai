   "comments": [
    "A really great introduction to the region. Can be a bit unfocused at times, but worth it.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the region but it's probably a little to general for a more serious study of the Middle East.",
    "This course is a good introduction to history and current topics in the Middle East. Emma Sky is wonderful and very knowledgeable of the region. Guest lecturers towards the end of the course make it very interesting. However, many of the lectures contain youtube videos, which might not be of interest to some learners. Also, the course is exam-heavy, as there is only one opportunity for writing (a bummer for those who enjoy writing policy memos). Overall solid course.",
    "This was a fantastic class and a great introduction to the politics of the Middle East. I thoroughly enjoyed both the materials and the lectures. It would have helped tremendously if the lecture slides were put on Classes V2, but otherwise, everything was great. Professor Sky was a great professor and extremely knowledgeable, having traveled all across the Middle East and having professional experience there. She has a lot of interesting, first-hand stories and she definitely knows what she is talking about. She is also very nice and easily approachable. One of the better professors I've had at Yale. The workload was not bad at all, with a midterm, policy memo, and final, all very manageable. Take it if you're interested in the topic, not for an easy A though.",
    "GLBL 271 was the perfect way to gain an understanding of the Middle East and why it is the way it is today. It combined the history of the Middle East with current problems and discussions in a way that allowed me to make informed arguments and detail reasons for conflict by the end of the course. It did not teach many hard skills, but it was a great overview of the Middle East that became relatively applicable and comprehensive to the situation today by the end. The guest lecturers were all very informed and interesting but made the end of the course feel a little bit disjointed.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the class and if you'll pay attention and do the readings. It's not a very engaging class but you'll have to know the material regardless and it's instrumental for foreign policy knowledge. The guest speakers are also really cool.",
    "A general introduction to the international relations of the middle east. Each lecture focuses on a different topic or country and by the end of it, depending on how much of the reading you do, you finish with a broad overview of all of the most salient Middle East talking points that there are. I would recommend it to anyone looking to understand the region a little better and to get a foundation for more involved and deeper investigation, or to just be a more informed consumer of news.",
    "Global Affairs 271 is a study of a political history of the middle east and, more importantly, the themes and forces that guide politics in the region. Overall, it was a decent course. I am delighted I took it and I have gained a much deeper understanding of the conflicts in the Middle East. The first half of the course was excellent. Professor Sky well balanced videos and pictures with insightful lectures. The second half, while it sounded great in concept, bringing in some of the players in middle eastern politics to talk about middle eastern politics, was poorly executed. The lectures were disjointed and lacked no standard form. Many of them were just figures talking about their points of view and opinions, and overlapping heavily. Some lectures were way over my head, others were much more basic. The exams were fair and decently challenging. I am a freshman with some background in middle eastern politics and I found this class very manageable.",
    "A great survey course on the Middle East. Provides an excellent foundation for more focused studies of the region. Awesome guest lectures, interactive Q&A, expert professor. Course load is manageable.",
    "A class where you'll learn a lot about the Middle East situation if you knew nothing before. I remember this class being advertised as a class that would allow you to carry conversations at dinner parties about the Middle East, and I believe that really holds true. The class is interesting and intimate despite the fact it is a lecture. However, it felt very disjointed at times. It was hard to figure out what would be covered on a test\/what was important to know, and there were often errors in communication between TA and student. Make SURE you do the readings as they are really what is covered in the class and on tests in the second half of the semester.",
    "Look at the topics on the syllabus. If it interests you, take it. Professor Sky is pretty neat. Also lots of guest lecturers, most of whom are pretty neat.",
    "Everyone should take this course. It gives you a basic understanding of the history that has shaped the modern Middle East. That being said, the course is a bit disconnected.",
    "Take it for the information, but take it C\/D\/F if you don't want to freak out about the exams and memo.",
    "Good introductory course to modern politics in the Middle East. This course gives you a better perspective on the current political situation in the region and a better understanding of the US and international interests in the region.",
    "This is a great overview course of the Middle East. If you are interested in the region at all, or are a global affairs major interested in international relations, it is imperative to have more in depth knowledge of the Middle East and this is a great overview course. The readings help understand contemporary issues and the videos played in class are good. The lectures are somewhat slow, but the guest speakers are incredible. You will gain a lot of insight into this region and will comprehend contemporary problems.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a friend. You're guaranteed to learn something."
