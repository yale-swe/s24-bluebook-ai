    "Yes I would recommend it",
    "Covers behavioral and institutional economics in a nutshell and with as few technicalities as possible; a perfect fit for undergraduates and law-school students, though perhaps a bit too unchallenging for economics graduate students; though there are quite a few readings which are not completely covered in class",
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes. Anyone interested in changing the traditional mathematical point of view of economics to something more psychological an human should take this class. It's not that hard and most of the readings are pretty interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to another student. The lectures and readings are easy to pay attention to because they are so fascinating",
    "You should compare this to other courses in behavioral economics before necessarily taking it. Nonetheless, if you come from a quantitative or neoclassical bent of economics, you should absolutely take this course as it will give you a very different way to look at the study of economics, and more broadly, human behavior.",
    "Very interesting, but difficult.",
    "Yes. I think the course is very useful if you are interesting in the public sector, and it would explain a lot of question in institutional design and policy making.",
    "I do not recommend this course if you want to get a deep understanding of behavioral economics, but a gentle introduction."

   "comments": [
    "Broadened my perspective a great deal; endowed me with new knowledge, though less so with new skills...",
    "The material of this course has contributed a lot to my preparation as an economist. It is just what I needed at this point, because I was too deepened in the mathematical part of the economy. I am not doing a dissertation right now but the ideas from this class will accompany me for the rest of my life.",
    "Behavioral Economics is vastly different from the other Economics courses that I haven taken before, and it has explained observed economic phenomenon in a non-traditional way. The course to me is very subversive and informative.",
    "Somewhat, but again--most subject were addressed very superficially."
