   "comments": [
    "This class taught me the importance of developing writing habits by reading and thinking, rather than just editing a lot. The readings were excellent for appreciating how writing techniques work, and were just interesting on their own. I definitely feel that I've become a better writer, or at least much more aware of how I'm crafting effects in my writing.",
    "Extensive writing and reading-for-writing skill development",
    "I have always enjoyed reading and writing but this class really introduced me to reading with an eye for writing. It was interesting to note different techniques that writers used to make their points and then learn how to incorporate that into my own work to make subtler arguments and more oblique analysis.",
    "Learned how to read as a writer and how to lower the emotional temperature of my pieces so that they do not alienate readers.",
    "Knowledge\/skills - Reading and analyzing short works, usually essays, for macro-strategies in order to discover successful essayists' techniques and common strategies between essays. Learning to write in a variety of genres loosely under the \"personal essay\" umbrella, and to write in a less traditionally \"academic\" and more effective manner. Insights - Good writing shouldn't be formulaic at all, and instead is an utterly creative yet mentally rigorous process that requires constant, thorough revision and attention to detail on the level of the single word. Also, a well-written personal essay can bring just as much introspective pleasure to a reader as can a piece of art, or a work of any other creative medium.",
    "The readings and writing exercises in this course helped me develop skills for writing readable modern essays, as opposed to literary analysis, fiction, or other types of writing. There is emphasis on \"reading as a writer,\" i.e. reading essays and thinking about their structure. It was very satisfying to learn the mechanics of writing essays of the type that are fun to read in the New Yorker, the Atlantic, etc.",
    "This course totally changed the way I think about essay writing, making me see it as a genre full of creative opportunity and influential force. I learned a lot about how to make powerful points obliquely but clearly. My writing improved immensely because of this course.",
    "I think I gained a stronger mastery of various writing techniques in my own writing. I feel like I grew as a storyteller in that class.",
    "To read analytically with a writer's eye",
    "How to read like a writer and how to write essays in tone that does not alienate the reader, but still keeps authorial distance.",
    "English 120 taught me to read as a writer. I learned how to write things that people want to read and how to truly craft a compelling piece of creative nonfiction."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was a fantastic and enjoyable introduction to writing well. I loved how organized it the class\/readings were, and the spread of topics\/techniques for the papers. I think the course could benefit from more, smaller (maybe optional?) writing assignments to practice the techniques in-between the larger, graded papers.",
    "Strengths: great seminar and workshop format Cons: a fair amount of writing, not for every student",
    "I thought this was a strong class that was taught in a perfect setting. The majority of the readings were enjoyable and the workshops were fun.",
    "I really like the seminar atmosphere and the discussion based classes.",
    "I felt that this course really exemplified the benefits of seminar style, meaning that the class benefited enormously from each others' insights in picking apart each essay for the macro-strategies, and creative \"moves,\" that each author was using to create specific effects. I also felt that the balance between new material and material used primarily to reinforce a concept was very good, and that the coursework was sometimes heavy but generally not unmanageable. I also really enjoyed the group revision process on essays, especially for creative material (as well as technical advice). There were no significant weaknesses with the course as a whole that I ever wished to address.",
    "This class could be improved if it were a little smaller (although 18 students was a pretty good size) and if there were more short writing exercises. The emphasis was on learning writing by osmosis, which was largely effective, but it often felt like there was a big gap between understanding the techniques used by the writers whose work we read and actually applying those techniques to one's own writing. Professor Shirkhani incorporated a few short (~1 page) and ungraded writing exercises with the goal of practicing a certain skill or two, and those were much more helpful than just reading the essays and then trying to apply the techniques to one of five much longer and higher-stakes papers.",
    "Excellent course! Learning how to write from the examples of the greats was effective, compelling, and a lot of fun. Great readings, fun and instructive discussions, and compelling essay topics. The workshop process was really helpful and not too intimidating.",
    "The strength is that the readings are often very interesting and the class provides good feedback. However, I fee like the class is too fast paced for an introductory level writing credit. I also disagree with the philosophy that students learn how to write simply by reading, since I think most students would've benefited with an actual ongoing g dialogue on how to incorporate advanced techniques into our own writing.",
    "Seminar style, lots of healthy discussion, nice connections to present day",
    "The course is really shaped by the different students in each section, which makes it very personal and diverse - this was a great advantage. One thing that could be improved is that it wasn't always clear - especially at the start - what kind of things we were supposed to focus on while reading the assigned essays, I think reading less essays but with a more focused eye might benefit the course (as we did towards the end of the semester).",
    "The strengths are the personalized feedback provided by the professor. The weaknesses are stringent grading and ambiguous expectations."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This course was a fantastic and enjoyable introduction to writing well. I loved the organization of the class\/readings, as well as the spread of topics\/techniques for the papers. It takes a little more effort to get the most out of the class, but it's well worth it.",
    "Yes, absolutely, but be prepared to write 5 essays (1,500 words each) during the semester, with draft and final stages for each one. Some of the longer readings can be skimmed and you can get a sense for which readings are less likely to be discussed in class, but you do need to read for every class session.",
    "YES! If you want to read some fun stuff and learn how to improve your writing and learn about why some essays can appear frivolous on the surface but really matter on a deeper level, then take this course!",
    "Absolutely. I loved the format of this class because it allowed you to read great writers, discuss strategies and techniques used in their pieces as a class, then implement those techniques in your own pieces. Everything in the class is set up to help you succeed as a writer.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who feels they already have an aptitude for and an interest in writing, especially as a professional skill. The course readings are generally very interesting and always very well written, and I always enjoyed class discussions. Prof. Shirkhani was a wonderful instructor and I enjoyed the class very much. I would, however, emphasize that the style of writing required for this course is not likely to be of much practical use in purely-STEM fields, and that the coursework can at times be quite a lot to deal with. I do feel much stronger as a writer as a result of this course, and I'm very glad that I took it - when considering course selections, just be sure that it's exactly what you want.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Even if you didn't like English class in high school, consider taking this. There's no analysis of themes, motifs, and author intention. There's no Shakespeare. The essays you read in this class are really fun to read, and there is a lot of freedom given in choosing which topics to write about. Professor Shirkhani is very willing to meet outside of class to give additional feedback, and these meetings were very helpful. Definitely reach out. I don't think this class transformed my writing ability; it's not as groundbreaking as many people have said it is. But almost all parts of it were very enjoyable, it did improve my writing, and it got me thinking about writing in new ways. Take this class.",
    "Definitely would recommend. If you want a fun, compelling course that will also challenge you and improve your writing, English 120 is the class for you. The readings were engaging, the discussion was fun, and the essays were interesting to write. English 120 will change how you think about writing-- if you're exhausted with the 5 paragraph essay, take 120.",
    "Highly recommend this course! Best class I've taken at Yale! Really encourages you to experiment with your style of writing, self-reflect, and make improvements. The readings that are selected by the instructor are also extremely engaging and helpful in learning how to be a better write.",
    "Absolutely - I found myself growing as a writer and a reader",
    "If you are interested in learning how to write a good personal essay, or want to improve your own writing skills you should take this course. However shop several sections during shopping week to find a section that you click with, because it really matters a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as a great introduction to collegiate writing."
