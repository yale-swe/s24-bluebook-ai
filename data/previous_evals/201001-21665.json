    "You should take General Ecology (E&EB 220) first before you take this class because you'll get a lot more out of it if you already have a decent background in ecology. Sure, you can learn the stuff in this class without any prior ecology background, but you'll find everything way more interesting and be able to understand things much better if you've already taken General Ecology before taking Ecosystem Patterns and Processes. That said, if you an aspiring ecologist undergrad, don't be scared away from this class because it's cross listed as an F&ES class--it just means that there will be more people like you who like ecology.This class is very well taught and has a nice balance of terrestrial and aquatic systems. I felt like we had a nice balance of topics and learned about a lot of patterns and processes that occur in both types of systems. The lectures were well organized and Pete and Mark did a good job switching off and complementing each other's styles and interests. Both did a great job of getting people actively engaged in the subjectmatter by stopping to ask questions now and then. I especially liked the paper discussions where we read recent papers from the primary literature and then discussed them with our professors and classmates. The presentations on topics that we were interested in were also fun.",
    "it's a class with weekly problem sets (which can be a drag) a group project, which was a drag, and material that may be hard for an undergraduate. I was a senior, so maybe i was just lazy, but i did not look forward to class at 9 am",
    "I would recommend this course to all EVST majors. It is so helpful!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. You don't learn a bunch of useless facts that you will forget, you learn a new of thinking when approaching scientific problems. You also learn how to properly read and critique a scientific paper, which is very useful.",
    "Solid course",
    "A basic introduction to ecology. Quite helpful if you have never taken an ecology course before, as was the case for myself. It emphasized breadth more than depth when covering material so be prepared for fast paced lectures which do not necessarily tie into one another in a clear manner. You will learn a lot, but it will leave you with many more questions requiring deeper investigation (maybe a more specialized course). Bring caffeine if it is taught at 9am again."
