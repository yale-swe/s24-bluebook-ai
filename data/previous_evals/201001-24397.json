   "comments": [
    "Great Econ seminar if you have an interest in health care. Fair amount of reading, but the material is not overly Econ-heavy. My favorite of the 3 Econ seminars I've taken.",
    "i'd recommend it, but only if you're interested in the subject material or want to know more about the us health care system. there are basically five page papers every week, so it's a lot of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you don't understand the health system well. The economics behind it are fascinating and it is absolutely pertinent to every single person. Everyone should take a class like this, but you'll definitely enjoy it if you like medicine, or behavioral econ.",
    "If the student had a sincere interest in learning about the economic principles behind healthcare, I would likely not recommend this course. I feel it was a bit of a disappointment.",
    "It is much less work than some of the other seminars. Some lectures were interesting, but overall very repetitive. There are weekly readings and write-ups which are arbitrarily graded, a presentation, and final paper.",
    "Definitely. This is one of the better Econ seminars that I have taken.",
    "take it if you want to learn about healthcare",
    "Overall the class wasn't bad for an economics seminar, that is if you're looking for an easy class and don't care how much substantial knowledge you get out of it. There's not a lot of economics theory or information about the health care system. The professor is nice and flexible though, and I never felt stressed about this class. If you really are trying to get a goodgrasp of the healthcare system though, I'd recommend Howard Forman's health economics seminar over this one any day.",
    "Econ 464 is a good class, though you will probably get more out of it if you have some knowledge about healthcare going into it or if you're willing to do some extra digging on each week's topics. The 3-5pg reading responses each week could get a little annoying, but they definitely helped you form your thoughts on the week's topic before going to class. Professor Epstein is very knowledgeable and nice.",
    "It's a mixed bag: the prof is very knowledgeable and funny, but the class consisted mostly of him lecturing to us, instead of us talking (like a seminar should be). Granted, this might be due to this particular mix of people and the fact that most of us were not well-versed enough on healthcare topics to engage in deep conversation about it, but it's just something to think about. Weekly 3-5 page reading responses got old really fast, and the grading is unclear."
