   "comments": [
    "This class is a lot of work. You'll have translation to do for every class; sometimes only a little, sometimes more than forty lines. Crito is kind of boring. Lysias is difficult. That said, Lysias is both funny and interesting, Crito is very comprehensible, and Herodotus tells great (and funny) stories. If you're up for the workload, it's definitely worth it. You'll get a lot of reading experience, including some sight translation, and you'll learn a lot about Greek in a different way than in more grammar-focused class. And in case you've forgotten your grammar and syntax, you'll get review of both of those as you read. If you're on the fence about continuing with Greek, as I was, I would recommend taking this class. It convinced me, at least, to keep going, and I feel like I'm ready for Homer in the spring.",
    "Lysias, Plato, Herodotus - read 'em and weep. These are not the most exciting texts but you've got to read something besides the Apology to realize how fluid Greek is. The course is worth it in the overall track. The students who only knew Biblical Greek had a little trouble but if you've done L2 you're more than ready.",
    "Greek 131 is L3 Greek. A wide variety of students were in the class, from freshmen to grad students, though this should not be of alarm. We went over some major works of prose, including Plato's \"Crito,\" Lysias, and Herodotus. All were quite worthwhile to explore in different ways. There was also more grammatical build-up as well. It was a step better than the lower level classes.I would recommend this class to another student if they wished to explore the subject, or just need the class for whatever reason. The workload, though normal for such classes, can get heavy at times, but is manageable overall. I can truly say that I have my skills have greatly matured as both a translator and Classist, and this class has set the base for even more growth in those directions.",
    "A good third year Ancient Greek course. I would recommend it.",
    "A great way to review your grammar and\/or become familiar with classical Greek (I took koine first) while expanding the breadth of your read authors, covering the principal genres of classical Greek literature. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has been through the basics of Greek grammar but wants to acquire more precise grammatical knowledge and read additional authors."
