    "Definitely take it! Printmaking is a kind of obscure subject and I don't think a lot of people think to take it, but it's amazing how complex this field is. There's so much opportunity to inject your personality, and the vibe of the class feels way less restrictive than many other art classes, in the best way. The printmaking studio is like a glorious science lab full of colors and materials and cool new things to experiment with - just like a science lab, if you avoid the bad chemicals and stay safe and careful, there's so much to discover. I'd recommend it to anyone who's willing to give it a genuine effort!"
