When presented a problem I will have very little idea of how to answer it, but once I'm presented with the solution it's not hard to understand.",

    "Strengths: Lecture notes provided in addition to the very terse textbook; custom homework problems. Weaknesses: grades and HW solutions took a long time to come; rather inconvenient office hours (but I often was too busy to attend).",
    "Very good course",
    "I think the class was taught well. It was well organized and covered a lot of material without going too fast. The biggest weakness of the class in my opinion is that it was taught at too high of a level for me, but I think that I would have done better in the undergrad version of the class.",
    "Very helpful and clear lecture notes",
    "Strengths: - Covers many fundamental derivations that are important for a good understanding of statistical mechanics - Online notes are great when they're posted - Did a good job of emphasizing what components of the course were important Weaknesses: - I don't think Kardar is a good book for this; I think Pathria or a more comprehensive text would be more useful. - The course in terms of problem sets could do with an increased density. There was at least one problem for every topic discussed, but having multiple problems that are only slight variations, and making it explicit how these problems relate to each other (something not always obvious to someone attempting a problem for the first time) would further develop our appreciation for the nuances between them, making problem sets more productive. I suppose you could also",
    "The homework was very helpful for learning material. The notes were also really good."
