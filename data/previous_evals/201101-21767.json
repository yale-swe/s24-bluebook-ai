    "If you need to know what finance is, you absolutely need to take this course!",
    "important topic, bad lecturing, great credit\/d class if your mildly interested but not wanting to get too involved",
    "Econ 252 is the best class I've ever taken at Yale. The course goes over every aspect of financial markets in quite a bit of depth. I was familiar with a lot of the stuff but taking the course really solidified my understanding and taught me the specifics.Professor Shiller was wonderful. His lectures didn't have much to do with exams, but I thought there were many cool stories and bits of history in the lectures. The guest speakers were very amazing, especially Hank Greenberg.There's a LOT of reading for the class, and it's in depth reading. I remember some exam questions referred to a paragraph or two on a certain page, and just that. Nonetheless, I think that really helps build your knowledge of the subject.Overall, I learned a LOT in 252 and I think it's essential to anyone who wants to understand finance at even a moderate level. This was my favorite class all year and without a doubt the best I've ever taken.",
    "Think you want to go into banking? Think you might. It's early but it's worth it. Take it with a friend or two for problem sets and sharing reading notes to lighten the load.",
    "Great class to get a basic knowledge of the markets.",
    "It's not an easy class, but definitely one of the most practical \/ applicable in the econ major. Shiller teaches you the finance you need to know to be a real person -- it's not just for would-be investment bankers.",
    "Only if you have to",
    "It's an interesting class if you're interested in finance. but you could just learn all the stuff on your own. taking it Cr\/D would not help since you will just slack off and not learn any of it. Take it for a grade, but be prepared to memorize like 700 pages of finace of the final.",
    "Great class. You learn a lot. Both lecture and syllabus readings are absolutely essential.",
    "Don't take it. It's underwhelming. Don't be tempted by the fact that it's Shiller. He's really nice one on one and quite helpful, but the man cannot teach. The things we go over in class are so unbelievably basic compared to what we're expected to know for exams. Also, TA review sessions on Friday are huge downers. I like finance, but the Fabbozzi textbook makes it interesting, not Shiller (although his books are good).",
    "I wish there had been more overlap between the math and the qualitative parts of the course, so it seemed like a lot of memorization of terms and figuring out how to do math problems rather than genuine learning.",
    "If you take this class, you'll be taking it with a lot of wannabe investment bankers. You'll probably learn a lot about the financial markets, though, which is great because finance is something that's pretty important. You'll know what's generally going on when you read things in the newspaper after taking this class. On the other hand, you won't really be learning this from Shiller. He is quite pedantic during class, usually talking about unimportant things, and you'll just be learning everything from the textbook. The workload isn't bad, there are six problem sets, and readings every week (which you can just do before the exams).",
    "The class is easy, memorizing for the tests is not easy though. Take it if you intend to do the reading because the lectures do not help much even though they are great fun to listen Prof. Shiller's stories and analysis.",
    "Material that is incredibly useful taught in a mediocre fashion. 90% of what I learned came out of the textbook; this was reflected throughout all the students in the class by the extremely poor attendance- perhaps 30-50 students would come to lecture, and then 130+ would show up for the exams.No, unless you truly want to learn this material, which was true for me, and even then the lectures were disappointing. Be prepared to read the textbook front to back and dedicate a lot of time cramming for the exams.",
    "Sure \u0097 if you don't mind memorizing minute details for an exam, or listening to Shiller go on irrelevant tangents at 9 a.m. In my opinion, it's not worth it \u0097 just check out any finance book from the library and you'll learn about as much without wasting a credit on it. If you decide to take this class, get Oliver Bunn as a T.A., no questions asked.",
    "Most people would benefit from taking this course. It provides a good introduction into several important, real life topics in finance which is an important topic for anyone, not just bankers. Take it for Cr though because it's much less stressful that way. The exams are not difficult, but they cover a lot of material. Also, try to get Oliver as your TA. He really makes a difference.",
    "You will learn a lot from this course if you put in the time and read everything. If you are not actually interested in finance, it won't be worth it.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in obtaining a broad overview of Financial Markets. That said, this is definitely not Intro to Investment Banking, so just be aware of that.",
    "Very useful knowledge about the finance industry, which has increased my interest in current events. Good general knowledge for anyone interested in business.",
    "This is by far the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. Do not be fooled by Shiller's fame as he is a horrible lecturer and spends every class talking on tangents and none of what he says is relevant to the course or finance in general. He might be very successful in the field, but does not have any clue how to teach, assign reading or write exams. You basically teach yourself the course from a 700 page boring and dry textbook (which you are expected to read in one semester) and he asks random questions from the middle of the book during exams. SO there is no understanding of material in this course but a test of your memorizing capabilities.This is not an intro to investment banking so do not feel obliged to take it if you are thinking of going into finance. The class meets for 75 minutes on three separate days (at 9 am) and also has a section, way more than any other class at Yale. The math in this course is completely taught by the TA's and it is the easiest stuff that you can learn in a day. It does take an excessive amount of number crunching and you are not even provided with a formula sheet in any of the exams.This class is really atrocious. Do not take it. You will learn nothing and hate every minute. The curve isn't particularly easy as there are people at Yale who manage to read 70-80 pages of drab economic reading every week. So there are really no positives to this class. Take Financial theory in the fall. It is far superior.And if you don't believe me, watch a lecture of his on open yale. You'll see what I mean.",
    "Take it if you want to learn more about financial markets, but expect to devote a lot of time to reading the textbook and learning the formulas.",
    "Take it if you are curious about finance. Professor Shiller likes to give examples from history and talk about the opportunities and instances of finance as a visible force for good in the world. He really gives a great general overview of finance, and his exams demand that you know specifics from many facets of finance. Hhis course has a ton of reading, from which you will be likely be tested on small details.",
    "I would recommend taking the class if you are thinking about going into finance.",
    "do not take this class",
    "Not worth it. Lectures are useless and there is a ton of dense, boring reading that is impossible to complete. I did not get what I wanted out of this class and neither will you.",
    "Alright. To do well you must do a lot of outside reading. It may be wise to take this Cr\/D\/Fail. This course is also on Open Yale.",
    "i would recommend it",
    "Tons of work, impossible tests",
    "Definitely. This class is so relevant after the financial crisis.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in finance or anyone trying to figure out if they're interested in finance. I was the latter and figured out that I wasn't, in fact, interested, but I'm definitely glad I know that now. You will get bored during lectures, they are early in the morning, and you'll get sick of doing the somewhat repetitive problem sets. You'll get annoyed with memorizing formulas for the exams (no equation sheet, but honestly there should probably be one). You'll also get sick of trying to figure out how many readings you should actually do. You really don't need to do many of them. There will be questions on the exam from the readings, but not very many, and you get to pick something like 8\/10 questions to answer, so you can mostly get away with not doing them.",
    "Absoultely take it!",
    "Take it. If you are an Econ major you have no excuse not to know about and understand financial markets. This course will teach you A LOT, probably more than you ever wanted to know, about financial markets and how they work and why they are so important to our lives.If you aren't an Econ major, you should still take it for all the same reasons. If you want to rail on our government for bailing out the banks, it would probably be a good idea to know why they did it, what really caused the problem, and why they thought bailing them out was the appropriate response. This is especially important at a place like Yale, which is supposedly a President\/Politician factory, and yet most politicians don't know squat about real economics, especially financial economics.So in short, take the course if you want to be a responsible citizen.Be warned however, Professor Shiller is a bad lecturer, period. He's a nice guy with a crazy reputation who clearly knows his stuff, but he just comes across as a rambling senile man during lectures.Also be warned, the midterms and final are not that hard if you study. BUT YOU NEED TO STUDY, THERES A LOT TO KNOW. There are a bunch of readings and lecture information to know for every exam, and you just gotta do the work and study if you want to do well. They grade fairly anyways, so it's usually pretty straight forward if you know your stuff.",
    "Oliver Bunn, while a good man, sent out over 130 emails throughout the course of the semester, averaging at about 1.4 emails a day. Poor class...wayyy overhyped.",
    "Economics 252 is the organic chemistry of Economics. I would recommend it to someone who wants to go into investment banking, but not to someone who has a passive interest in economics.",
    "I would recommend it. Definitely take it. I never realized the potential positive effects that financial innovation could have on the world. For example- if homeowners could hedge against their property by taking bets against a housing index in their region in the futures market.",
    "If you really want to learn the basics about financial markets take it, but it will be hard.",
    "Yes, be prepared to do all the reading. But take it for a great practical background in finance.",
    "If you want to go into finance, then you should probably take the course so that it is on your transcript. Yale only offers a handful of finance related courses and I suppose it looks good to have taken them.That being said, this is a pretty awful course. Professor Shiller is arguably the worst lecturer I have ever had at Yale. Also, the tests are absurd - it is impossible to study for them.If you are going to take it, take it Credit\/D. The curve is great. Literally no one fails.",
    "I learned a lot from this class about financial markets, and the class was a strong incentive for me to educate myself about this essential sector of our society. That being said, Professor Shiller was an awful lecturer, who rambled on about irrelevant things at 9 AM Mondays and Wednesdays. I simply gave up going to class after a while. The Fabozzi textbook was interesting, yet dense, and you'll have to get REALLY intimate with it to do well on the tests. The other students in the class are usually very interesting people; make many friends in the class and you'll do well (form pset study groups, note-sharing groups, because there's a LOT of Fabozzi to read). GET OLIVER AS A TA IF HE'S STILL THERE. If you don't manage to sign up for his section, go there anyway and get to know him. What a badass. Buyer beware: this class is important, but not easy. If you're not an Econ major, take this Credit\/D\/Fail, though by doing so, you may not motivate yourself to really learn about finance. Use your judgment.",
    "Take it if you want a rigorous introduction to the financial world. Do not take it if you've got interviews with ibanks coming up, and you want this class to make your resume look good. Also, only take it if you're wiling to go to most of the lectures and especially the guest lectures, otherwise you might find yourself unable to answer the qualitative questions on the midterms and on the final.",
    "Robert Shiller is an econ beast and the brains behind an ingenious idea called trills, but unfortunately while lecturing this guy is in a pitched battle with Ray Fair for the title of Yale\u0092s worst lecturer. Take a look at some of the lectures online, if they seem boring to you, don\u0092t go to class. But you should still take this course! Even if you\u0092re not an Econ major the things you learn in Financial Markets are actually incredibly useful (what the difference is between various types of insurance plans, what exactly an annuity is, what is the best way to structure an investment portfolio for retirement, etc). The only time that I would actually bother going to class is for the TA review sessions (which unfortunately sometimes ended up being on Friday mornings at 9AM\u0085) but they\u0092re actually useful and they explain how to do the math. They end up posting all the notes though online so if you can\u0092t drag yourself out of bed don\u0092t worry too much.Your performance in financial markets is evaluated through two midterms, a final and six psets. The psets are easy but they grade punitively so make sure to show every step and explain why something is happening even if the math tells you that this particular state of the world must be. The tests are difficult and time consuming to prepare for it\u0092s true but none of the math, save for the material on the final, is tricky. That said, you do need to memorize formulas and understand basic things about statistics. The hardest part is memorizing all the terms. Shiller is big into \u0093details\u0094 and likes to pick obscure terms from the textbook (a three hundred page beauty that is my single favorite textbook after my Mankiw econ book) so get ready to answer questions like \u0093what is a convertible bond,\u0094 \u0093what is rule 144\u0094 and \u0093describe how a syndicated bank loan works.\u0094 Finally, the head TA when I took the class was Oliver. Oliver is a very friendly, very excitable, very smart and incredibly nice human being. Definitely the best TA I\u0092ve ever seen--I wish he could have delivered the lectures instead of Shiller. Get him if you can.",
    "Great, thorough introduction to financial markets. You will learn a great deal, but you will have to work hard.",
    "Problem sets aren't too hard, but the course requires a decent amount of reading. You'll also find that you learn the majority of the material by reading the textbook which isn't really covered in lectures. The morning lectures are also pretty tough to sit through.",
    "Credit\/D it. You will be less stressed. A lot of people don't go to class because the lectures can be very muddled. I had a friend who didn't go to a single lecture the entire semester. You can do this, but the midterms still test random facts that Professor Shiller mentions in class.Now that the class is over, I know infinitely more about the financial markets than I did before the class (due to about five straight days in the library studying for the final). I'm glad I took the class, but make sure you are aware of how boring the lectures\/reading can be and how random the exam questions end up being.",
    "Yes, this is a great class and I recommend taking it before finance interviews if you are going into finance. If you are just taking it for fun I recommend taking it Credit\/D.",
    "Take it if you genuinely are interested in how financial markets function. Even if you aren't interested, you'd be surprised at how much you learn.",
    "As someone with minimal pre-exposure to finance, I found the course to be agreat crash-course in the world of finance. That being said, most of the learning in this course comes from the readings, so if you take the course Cr\/D\/F and don't do a majority of the readings you won't get the same experience that I did.",
    "the class is hard, but you should take it if you have any interest in finance or want to go into finance. there is a ton of reading, and the exams ask for specific facts from the readings so the exams are pretty hard.",
    "Terrible class. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT take this class. Tests are horribly written and tests on minute details that pertain nothing to the lectures. Overall, it was just a drag, and a sore spot for my otherwise great semester.",
    "No. This class is literally a \"read the entire book and memorize the terms.\"All the math in the class is \"memorize these formulas and plug them in\".Awful class.",
    "Overall, I thought this class gave a general picture of the \"good side\" of finance. That said, if you are interested in learning about finance for banking or consulting purposes, then I would not recommend this class. Just really disappointing and poorly structured. I think there are better ways to learn about finance, instead of this class.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student if you are really interested in the finance world, otherwise you might be bored to death or seriously turned off from ever pursuing a career in finance.",
    "You basically learn any concrete financial knowledge from the Fabozzi textbook (so, so much memorization. but useful knowledge). You learn \"why should I pursue finance as a career?\" and other real world applications from the guest speakers and from Prof. Shiller. And a few largely irrelevant historical facts from Shiller.",
    "I would only take Econ 252 if you want to force yourself to memorize the lingo of the financial world. Indeed, in this respect it is a good course: you acquire a basic knowledge of how various markets work and that knowledge will be helpful in the future regardless of your career. Moreover, this knowledge is hard to gain through self-study or through osmosis.However, the course is poorly taught and poorly assessed. The tests consist of random IDs - terms that were not emphasized or never discussed in class - and math problems. The former make you memorize the entire textbook and every random term mentioned in class; the latter are simply a regurgitation of math problems in class.It is pretty easy to get an A- in the class, but it is hard to get an A. If you want to get an A, plan to study hard, and even then, nothing is guaranteed.",
    "This is not a corporate finance class, yet should be informative for anyone interested in finance.Anyone who does the readings esp. textbook should learn a lot, particularly on issues which concern ordinary citizens eg. financial stability, democratization of finance eg. mutual funds etc.",
    "Yes, take it, no matter what you plan on doing in the future. Everybody should understand mortgages, the stock market, mutual funds, etc. This is real life stuff with particular relevance to today, given the financial meltdown. Doooo it.",
    "Hard? Yes. But you learn a whole lot. I would take it as a junior or a senior with some Econometrics background. It's a very robust class.",
    "You learn a lot, but mainly through memorizing things in the book. Also if you've done an equity sales&trading internship, I would not recommend this class. You learn the same thing essentially. Tests are really luck of the draw - not only with the terms you get, but also with the way the TA's grade. Would just be really careful with qualitative questions and try to answer as thoroughly and excessively as possible to avoid mark-offs.",
    "Take only if you are willing to put the work in. If so you will do well, and get a lot out of the class.",
    "Economics 252 was an excellent course that provides an thorough overview of finance. As someone who did not know much about finance coming into the course, I feel that I have learned a ton and am very happy that I took this course. This is one of the few courses at Yale that has a pre-professional feel to it, exposing students to not only financial theory, but also life after Yale. Definitely a must-take class, for all students!"
