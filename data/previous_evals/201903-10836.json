    "learned about microeconomics and how it describes behaviors of people in everyday life",
    "I gained an understanding of the labor and capital markets, as well as other basic microeconomic processes and structures.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The fact that the note slides were posted was very helpful.",
    "It wasn't a bad course, but I'm just not that interested in microeconomics.",
    "the pace of the class was really fast, so it's hard to retain a lot of the information. the psets and professor were helpful in helping me understand the material",
    "I think the course would benefit from explaining the mathematical concepts behind certain microeconomic concepts better (marginal rate of substitution and derivative for instance), rather than trying to maneuver around the math.",
    "The class as a whole was great, however, I feel the implementation of a practice test or two would be extremely helpful.",
    "A strength is the help that is offered. A weakness is having entire grade made up of homework and exams - it became a bit stressful.",
    "There could be practice problems for exams.",
    "The buzz groups were definitely very helpful. As someone expecting a seminar, I was still happy with the lecture-style teaching and learned a lot from it (the lectures were well done and the content was fairly well presented). I would only point out, as a weakness of the course, that students who aren't well versed in economics and\/or pick it up more slowly find it harder to understand the content quickly and follow along with the lessons as they build on \"learned\" content.",
    "Strengths: my instructor meant well Weaknesses: the class was a false seminar. Office hours limited (one day a week tiny room most of the time not enough room for everyone). Lecture style but no lecture safety nets I.e. sections or TAs. Limited material given to practice. Was especially challenging for those who were never exposed to subject prior to college.",
    "I like the straight forward and easy to follow structure. It could have been more engaging but Im not sure if that would have benefited the class.",
    "Lectures were very slideshow-based and went by very quickly.",
    "Strengths: Solid textbook, Straightforward exams, Prof. Simmons is very pleasant Weaknesses: Poorly written and confusing p-sets (the grading scheme was very particular to wording, not based on comprehension of the concepts), Unhelpful peer tutoring office hours (the hours were entirely based on solving - or simply giving out answers for - the p-sets), Lectures slides are inconsistent and are not self-explanatory (the professor's explanations are often confusing as well).",
    "strengths pretty informative Weaknesses instructor poor, unorganized",
    "It is well structured and I like the flow of the course.",
    "The course requires a lot of engagement with your classmates, which is good. I also think that Prof. Simons has a very good lecturing style. One thing that I would improve about the course is a more spread-out office hours schedule. Prof. Simons' and our TF's hours were on back-to-back days, and it would be nice if they were more spread out.",
    "Strengths: Professor Simons and her depth of knowledge and enthusiasm for economics. Weaknesses: although advertised as a seminar, the class is really taught more like a small lecture.",
    "Strengths: reasonable amount of work, Simons explains concepts well in lecture, and seminar style makes it more approachable and easier to ask questions. Weaknesses: content can be really tricky and has a lot of nuances, and the \"seminar\" title in the class is a bit misleading, because it was more like a smaller lecture than a seminar.",
    "I found it pretty difficult to learn well in this class, if Im being honest. The slides were often rushed through in class and many of the examples we did in class werent on the slides so it was more difficult to study them later on. In addition, peer tutoring\/office hours were incredibly unhelpful. By a few weeks into the semester, you just went to office hours to hear the answers to the PSETS. Another thing I found frustrating was that the professor\/grader didnt seem to care whether or not you actually understood a concept, as much as they cared that you wrote the exact right answer. Overall, despite the fact that it was a seminar I didnt feel that it was an environment especially conducive to learning.",
    "This course was not well taught. I learned far more from the textbook than I did in class.",
    "strength is manageable work load. Weakness is not enough examples used to teach material"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I learned a good amount while the workload was very manageable. The professor and TA were both very accessible and helpful.",
    "Yes, but be aware that you should study for the exams and go to office hours. It's a good course to understand the world a little more and get a QR credit along the way.",
    "take this course if you really have an interest in micro, otherwise the material might feel dry",
    "Not really, I was not very interested in the material.",
    "Yes, professor Simmons was amazing at explaining all the concepts and made sure to apply the concepts as opposed to merely stating them.",
    "yes, it is a good class to increase your basic econ understanding.",
    "Yes for people who needs microeconomics as their prerequisite.",
    "Yes because it's more personal",
    "Yes; I definitely would pick this seminar-style again over the larger lecture, and I had no qualms with the Professor. She knows what she's doing and teaches well.",
    "No the structure of the course meant a lot of it is self taught with limited resources for guidance. This is especially challenging if you dont have a strong school background to begin with i.e. I graduated from an underfunded public school.",
    "Yes I think this is an important thing for most students to know.",
    "Yes if you 'd like a solid foundation to microeconomic theory.",
    "Yes it was a good starter course in econ",
    "Many students take this course without intending on pursuing a degree in economics. To those students, I would recommend an Econ elective (Ex. Health Economics). Introduction to Microeconomics does not provide any particularly exciting concepts, nor does it do a great job at teaching students to think like an economist. The course serves its purpose as an entrance to the Yale Economics track, however it is not a particularly enriching 4th\/5th credit for non-majors. *all that being said, prospective majors have no fear. Economics spans far beyond the realm of introductory micro and the concepts outlined in this course will be very useful in future courses.",
    "would not take the lecture!",
    "Yes",
    "100 percent. If you want to study econ, this course is a must. Even if you don't, it's a generally interesting course that you can keep up with pretty easily.",
    "Yes, but only to a student who has a strong conceptual foundation in math and\/or has already taken economics.",
    "I would recommend the course. I learned a lot about econ and really enjoyed Simons' classes. Compared to my friends who took 115, I believe 110 was much better, specifically in its environment and course structure.",
    "I definitely would not. There are so many great classes here at Yale that taking this class would be a waste of a student's time worrying and stressing about a poorly taught course like this. Misleading in its title, this was not an introductory course but rathe expected the students to teach themselves such novel material. This was one of the most disengaging courses here at Yale despite my efforts to constantly feel excited about the class material and learning. This class can be pinpointed as one of the reasons why Economics major has such a terrible reputation. It perfectly embodies the \"Econ Snake\" image where no one in the class is willing to help each other or talk in general to avoid receiving any suspicions of them struggling. However if intro-micro is indeed as prerequisite for your major, take this course with another professor not with Simons.",
    "If you are considering majoring in Econ, I would say youd probably still learn more in this class than you would in the lecture. But it was not incredibly stimulating or well taught, so if you dont need it for any reason, Im not sure I would highly recommend taking this course.",
    "I would never recommend this course to anyone. It was poorly taught, there was no framework to help students to reinforce understanding, and I really felt let down by this course.",
    "Only if you need to take economics. Do the lecture instead"
