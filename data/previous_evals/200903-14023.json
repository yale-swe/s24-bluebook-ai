    "This course featured some great guest speakers and provided an excellent introduction into occupational medicine. I enjoyed the small class size, since it allowed for discussion. The range of topics was interesting and we covered a lot of material.",
    "Good overview of all of occupational medicine although I would have preferred more environment medicine included.There was a little too much covered in terms of breadth with three different organ systems being covered in the same 2 hour lecture. Perhaps some chapters of the reading should be omitted to achieve greater depth of understanding for the more common events.",
    "The course was excellent and able to break down a diverse array of information into coherent and managable lectures. The vignettes offered in class were particularly instructive for me as well as a good way to engage the students with the practical applications of the subject matter. Exposure to relevant studies from the occupational environmental medicine litterature were also very helpful in better understanding some of the contemporary applications of the course.",
    "Good, a little redundant on topics covered in other EHS classes. Dr. Mobo was good and knowledgeable, but tended to mumble, which took away from a clear presentation of the class materials.",
    "The class was really great. Interesting material covered. It was offered a bit early in the morning though.",
    "good introduction to occupational health",
    "covered topics wellvery broad, however...not the fault of anyone, just the field is broad",
    "Strength - Great teachers with multiple viewpoints. The instructors literally wrote the book on this topic! I really enjoyed the real life experiences that the instructors brought in.Weaknesses - Because of the instructors were different it was sometimes difficult to predict what the instructors were going to emphasize. This effected some of the preclass preparation.",
    "Strengths - Course gave me groundwork in occupational medicine, which I had not be exposed to prior to this course. Also, this course help me strengthen my background in epi methods.Weaknesses - Sometimes the information lacked cohesiveness from week to week.",
    "A lot of time spent on a very important topic but not very efficiently or well. It was a waste to be trying to teach basic epidemiology in this course - nearly everyone in the course was an MD or had been through summer session Epidemiology, and all students are required to take basic Epi anyway. This course should focus on its specific subject matter.I'm not sure the best way to organize the heterogeneous group of diseases, but I don't think the organ-system method was very meaningful. I think it would make more sense to focus on the key, common, major issues or types of industries thematically: e.g. air pollution, water pollution, ergonomics, industrial hygeine, workplace safety, radiation -- or something like that.My impression is that each year this course is mostly AP students, who are all MDs, etc. -- and would probably respond well to a course taught like a med school course, with pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, etc."

    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Prof. Mobo is also a great lecturer and I feel that I learned a lot from him. He was very receptive to student needs and made the information interesting and easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Jay is a wonderful teacher. Very kind, considerate and attentive to our needs.",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0the greatest!!",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Very good teacher.The only negative point is thar Professor Mobo has the tendency to use tons of abbreviations (in class and in the slides) that are not always self explanatory.",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Dr. Mobo did an excellent job of presenting a tremendous amount of information in a very structured manner. He was very good about providing prompt feedback oncoursework and very willing to provide answers to questions regarding the course material as they arose.",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Great teacher! Gave good feedback throught the semester.",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0very enthusiasticexplained topics well",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Strength - Enthusiastic about the topic. He is also realistic and a reasonable minded instructor.Weakness - This is his first time teaching the course and some refinement would be beneficial.",
    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Very nice but again fairly basic.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith is a great lecturer and brought a lot of personal knowledge and experience to the course. I appreciated her perspective on health issues and her stories of personal background in the field.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith seems to have a problem with the AP MPH group. She often made bitting remarks in class, gave dirty looks, and generally made her presence a negative situation. The class is geared toward MDs who are fulfilling their Environmental Epi requirement and she seems to instead wish it to be a class for people dedicated to environmental epi, preferably without clinical experience.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Awesome.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0good teacher",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe was very organized in her presentations and she was very good about providing prompt feedback to students regarding coursework. She also was very good about addressing questions concerning the coursework as they arose.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Great- very approachable and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0n\/a didn't directly interact with her",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Strength - She really understands the real time adaptation of the material. The lecture she gave was excellent and one of the best of the class.Weaknesses - None.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Very nice but very basic in lectures. We did not need basic epidemiology taught in this course."

    "Yes, good overview of occupational medicine. Interesting outside lecturers.",
    "Excellent class very interesting class. Absolutley would recommend- interesting, you learn a lot and it isn't a huge amount of work outside the classroom.",
    "i recommend the course",
    "worth taking if you have a relevant interest in occupational medicine",
    "The coure is a great introduction to occupational and environmental medicine. The enthusiasm by our instructors were great. Real life practitioners consistently emphasize the techniques and way of thinking rather than forcing straight memorization.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a background in occ med and wanted to learn how to think differently about occupational and environmental health issues.",
    "Covers important and interesting topics but not very well."
