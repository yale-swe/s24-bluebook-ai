    "Watershed science was new to me and I really didn't know what to expect thought I knew I like aquatic ecosystem topics. The course absolutely exceeded my expectations and I really loved it. I was challenged, learned a ton and simply liked it very much. I know I still have a long way to go but I felt I got an extremely sound foundation in watershed science and why it is important. What I learned went even beyond the class subject matter as I saw how certain concepts connect to others that touch upon other systems and environmental issues.",

    "I developed valuable knowledge about fundamental issues in watershed science. Most notable are the different ways in which various environmental and weather conditions can alter the ways a stream will be impacted by activities in its watershed.",
    "Watershed processes, thinking about water management holistically. I gained the ability to think critically about water usage and human impacts within watersheds.",
    "I have a decent understanding of extreme significance of a watershed to an ecosystem.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Material is interesting, especially towards the end. Weaknesses - The professor truly did not care about this class. He seemed bored hearing himself lecture. He took forever to grade the exams and I'm not even sure he graded them himself. He didn't grade the homework. He did a midterm evaluation and didn't change a single thing from our feedback (I'm not even sure he read it). The material he used in class was basically just his own research and he went into way too much detail about that. It was so obvious he really didn't care at all about the class or our learning. He didn't have an answer key for the exam and was annoyed that we asked for one even though the grading could have been pretty arbitrary. He failed to stick to the syllabus in terms of his lectures especially towards the end of the class where he literally just did not present on what he said he would or bring in a different presenter and those lectures were why a lot of us took the class. Without even asking us what we wanted and whether we wanted to hear those lectures, he just continued talking about his own research and things that we talked about all semester. Little innovation or creativity in the class. The out of class papers were way too technical for some of us and uninformative and I was lost in that material. He admitted the readings were poor but didn't change them. His demeanor was uninterested, unapproachable, and like he was teaching the class only because he had to. Minimal effort put in from the professor.",
    "Strengths: Great TA, great classmates, teacher knew a lot about what he thought. Weaknesses: Teacher did not care about the class, and actually complained to his own students (not in the class) that he had to teach it. It was really frustrating to have teacher that didn't care about our learning, and it made me and my classmates less interested in the class. Each class was the exact same format - besides a few that the teacher didn't even show up to and instead we went over homework assignments in class. He didn't expect us to do the reading and told us the reading he had chosen to assign to us was bad. The class was basically for PhD students given the way it was taught, but everyone in the class was MEM students and could no access the course material. Although he asked for feedback on our midterm (This was attached to our test and our name, which I found problematic), he did not change anything about the course or even mention that he had read it to any of us. I doubt he even read it. He did not grade fairly. We had long form questions and got a 1-10 grade on them. He didn't even have a key and when we asked for one 2 weeks after the test was taken and when he finally handed them back, he said \"I'll have to make one\". This leads us to believe tha the didn't use a key when grading the tests. The key that he created after our request was very short (1-10 words) while our answers were long-form paragraphs.",
    "I found the lectures to be clear and well organized, and Dr. Raymond was accessible. I think because this was the first time the course was taught, some aspects were a bit disorganized - in the future, tests and assignments could be distributed more evenly throughout the semester, rather than clumped at the end.",
    "Very much enjoy Pete's teaching style. Relaxed but brings home the main concepts, discusses more to help us understand and apply the knowledge. I liked the variety of assignments from readings to problem solving to class discussion to written exams to final paper. I liked how Pete also linked certain concepts to broader subject matter that went beyond watershed topics. Like nutrient cycling in general, climate change issues, etc.",
    "Some of the material may be conducive to more hands-on laboratory or field experiments. The course is just Powerpoint lectures and two in-class laptop exercises. We did have one field trip to the analytical lab, but it would have been great to see the Experimental Watershed and see what kinds of projects students have undertaken there. Course was well organized and knowledge progressed in a reasonable manner.",
    "The course offered straightforward exams and reasonably challenging homework assignments however the limited opportunities for assessment in the course made it challenging to track my progress\/understanding.",
    "Great class, but could be more structured and go a bit deeper into scientific concepts. I wish tests had been partially mathematical, as pure short answer felt a bit too subjective,",
    "I like the ecological approach and the nested spatial scales. The concept of the final project is alright but could be strengthened. I would propose a report that is built up through each unit or the course, the end-product of which is similar in content and tools used (though not in depth, perhaps) to a report that we would write as practitioners or scientists. The idea would be that we learn a concept and then apply that concept to our watershed, building towards the final report piece by piece. I have to say that I absolutely loathe sitting in a room with everyone on computers trying desperately to follow along in a multi-step process. One hiccup and you are totally lost, and one person even burst into tears (I thought about it, but it wasn't me). The tools are totally usable and useful, but that format of showing how to use them flopped. Perhaps having videos people watch and follow along with, and then have a class where people bring questions and problem solve together on portions of their report with TA and Prof available would work better? Loved having Jim as a guest lecturer. Would also suggest Eli for the math bits, and Shimi for pretty much anything because he's wonderful. Maybe have Kealoha in to talk about wetlands? She's the only female teacher I've had at FES and as much as I love most of our male professors, never seeing women up there (or when I do having them do the math wrong-wince) is a little tiring. The lab field trip was SO awesome. The YEW would also be a good easy one. If you wanted to dream bigger, you could do a watershed transect to see the different concepts in action.",
    "A professor that really take cares about the students, with adequate feedback",
    "This course was excellent and I don't think it needs any improvement. The lectures were interesting and engaging; the homework assignments and final project challenged my understanding of the material and forced me to think through it further on my own; and the exams were a fair, strong assessment of my grasp on the material. The in class activities were another great way in which this course gave me introductory, fundamental skills which I will now be able to use in my future career.",
    "Overall the course was well taught and organized to promote our learning. I think the homework\/activity days could have been given with a better context. It was also easy to get by in the course without doing the readings at all. Assigning more primary literature as opposed to textbook chapters would have made for more interesting readings. This would then pair well with some group discussion of the readings to get a better sense of the current research across the field.",
    "Toward the second half of the semester, I felt the class became more of an overview of current scientific literature rather than a synthesis of watershed science and management. Would be better to make it more applied and practical. The homework assignments were well designed.",
    "The strengths were it followed a very linear progression to the syllabus. There was no unpredictability and there was a medium for considered for all types of learners. The only weakness was Pete's humility. He is an amazing professor."

   "comments": [
    "Not much work, not super interesting subject matter, bored and uninterested professor that takes forever to give any feedback on exams. TA was great though.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone. However Jim Saiers its supposed to teach it next year and he is way more engaging and interested in teaching. Perhaps that would help.",
    "If you are looking for a good overview and introduction to watersheds with the aim of better understanding the unit as a future land manager, this is a good course to do that.",
    "Be ready to learn scientific theory of watershed system functioning and apply it. Be ready to link theory to practical applications and every day problems. Work load it not overwhelming but is pretty high between readings, being prepared for class discussions, exams, homework and final paper. Pete has a quite relaxed and enjoyable style but don't be fooled into thinking he is an easy grader. I think he is a fair grader but his standards are pretty high.",
    "It was a good introduction to watershed science. It did not have an overly demanding workload, so I was able to absorb the readings and lectures.",
    "If you are new to watershed-level thinking this class is a good armchair review. If you are looking for something more involved, WRM or Ecosystems and Landscapes might be a better fit.",
    "Don't take any class with Raymond",
    "Do it! If you have no background in environmental science, ecology, geology, hydrology, and other related fields, you will probably find this course very difficult, but I imagine that you would still gain a lot from it.",
    "This class is very much basic science focused. It covers less on watershed management practices.",
    "It is great for almost any area of interest."
