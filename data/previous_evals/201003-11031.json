    "Sure, it is interesting and enlightening. Great course!",
    "I wil definitely recommend this course for others. Even though I couldn't do well in this course because I haven't had enough background knowledge, I can learn many things.",
    "Yes!I think it is really beneficial for me to take the course, thus I understand another aspect of biological research besides the pure molecular approach.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interesting in learning about how pathways are discovered using a genetic approach.",
    "I would say, \"Just like the course description says, it's a nice overview of analytical genetic techniques and technologies. However, be prepared to spend a lot of timeon flies and worms. For me, the course didn't really get interesting until we departed the 80s and 90s and got into some of the more modern advancements. At the end of the day, however, I did appreciate knowing the history behind some of the pivotal discoveries in the field.\"Overall, I would recommend this course to my classmates (non-geneticists).",
