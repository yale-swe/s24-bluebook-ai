    "I would recommend it if you want to learn Spanish because you do a learn a substantial amount of material. But you have to be prepared to put in the time and work because it does move at a pretty fast pace.",
    "I recommend Spanish to anyone interested in the language and the culture. Professor Sab is great. She is very patient, understanding, and passionate about the course. She tries very hard to make the class fun and help us get the most out of it. Great class.",
    "Fast paced, but you learn a lot. If you've taken Spanish in high school, it won't be too difficult.",
    "A lot of work, but usually steady, always fair, and oftentimes fun! I had absolutely no Spanish beforehand, and coming away from this class, I feel like I have a clear understanding of everything we learned, even at the quick pace at which we learned it. My instructor, Prof. Sab, was fantastic."
