   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a traditional introductory math course here at Yale. Students go to lecture and take notes, do the homework in the book, and then take midterms and exams. There really is no way to improve such a standard math class- it was taught well for the purpose that it served.",
    "It is a little bit easy, though I would not regard it as a weakness.",
    "The homework assignments are straightforward, as is the first exam. The second exam, however, does not mirror work done for homework and comes as a bit of a surprise. The weekly quizzes help in preparing for exams, as they encourage the student to dedicate extra time each week to reviewing recent material.",
    "Well taught, Strong way to teach via quizzes. I believe location in the Watson center at 9 AM was an arduous winged walk.",
    "Strengths: What material to learn is very clear if you come to class. Weaknesses: Material that is easy gets a lot of time, while some difficult things get glossed over too quickly.",
    "I felt like the professor's teaching style was not all that helpful and that I was not learning for the sake of learning, just to pass an exam. His classes were quite boring.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it builds a thorough understanding of linear algebra. The weekly quizzes rather than homework were really helpful in making it possible to stay on top of content throughout the semester. The textbook was great, and both the professor and the TA incredibly helpful in answering questions.",
    "Strengths: weekly quizzes were great. Made me learn the material. Weaknesses: Lecture was uninspiring, and wrong. Prof. Rosenthal often would make mistakes on the board, come into class late, unprepared (he would forget his notes many times) and would consistently say that everything he was teaching was \"obvious\" or \"basic\". I get it that he may believe that this is obvious or basic, but if it was, I wouldn't be taking this course. He forgot to give us a quiz once, and did not allow us to take it and go over class time, but made us do it next week where we would have two quizzes. The final was fair, but the midterms were not, and the quizzes were not either. They would often cover material that was covered in chapters that we were not responsible for knowing. Our midterm that was supposed to be over 2 chapters really covered 1 subsection of 1 chapter in depth. Prof. Rosenthal apparently does not curve, and when the class average (POST 7 point curve) is failing, there is clearly something wrong here.",
    "The course was generally well organized, but I felt like the inclusion of weekly quizzes added unnecessary stress\/anxiety.",
    "The strength of this course was how the instructor showed an immediate interest in what he was teaching and brought that same level of attention to each lecture. The weakness of this course was the fact that we did not learn many applications of linear algebra, just theoretical concepts.",
    "The course jumps around a lot. More cohesiveness",
    "The material itself isn't bad\/difficult, it was mostly the teacher. Also be careful of which section you are in because we had weekly quizzes and those sucked.",
    "This course is poorly organized. Also, whoevers idea it was to have weekly quizzes instead of problem sets is dumb. It really damages students learning. I dont understand what advantages it brings (aside from perhaps allowing the course instructor to be more lazy than he already is).",
    "The strengths were that the model of weekly quizzes helped us stay on top of content, and I frankly liked that more than weekly psets.",
    "I found the lectures a little boring and not informative and ended up learning a lot from the textbook.",
    "Strengths: - The TA, Wenyu Pan, is a nice, smart, and really helpful TA. I never went to the Professor to seek help (see below) and instead went only to Wenyu as did most of my peers. Weaknesses: - Lectures unhelpful - Course instructor, Rosenthal, was condescending and unable to teach class. - I didn't show up to lectures and instead I used the textbook - It is my understanding that they Yale administration thinks it has fixed introductory quantitative classes by hiring \"specialist\" teachers and lecturers. This is wrong. The teacher for this class refused to answer questions in class, saying the answers were either in the book or on Canvas. He also had a propensity to start yelling in class which was a bit concerning. I did not feel comfortable asking for help or going to him during office hours because of his condescending, aggressive and often hostile demeanor.",
    "Strengths: Quizzes on Thursday are a really good idea and honestly help me stay more engaged with the material than problem sets. The exams, in my opinion, were appropriately challenging and did a very good job assessing our understanding of the material, and pushing us with more challenging applications of what we've learned. I also really liked the textbook for this course. Prof. Rosenthal is also very easily accessible. Weaknesses: Just about everything else. Prof. Rosenthal seems like a very good teacher, but I get the sense he just isn't comfortable with linear algebra. Most classes were mere recitations of the textbook, and he'd make errors on examples nearly every class. No one shows up to class because of this. One way to fix this would to be to move through the material quicker. In this case, people would rather go to class for an hour than read the textbook on their own to catch up. Additionally, Prof. Rosenthal could use more challenging applications in his examples and focus less on proving theorems during class-time. Finally, this class hardly had any applications of linear algebra, which is disappointing for a course with \"with Applications\" in its title.",
    "This course helped me to get a deeper understanding of linear algebra and how different concepts relate to each other; however I felt at times questions were worded a bit too vague for the concept to where one would get confused if they didn't know what the teacher meant by the way it was written.",
    "Didn't find the quizzes every thursday to be a valuable use of time, especially when balanced with the added stress associated with them.",
    "Strengths: the course is fairly straightforward and goes by the book. The textbook is clear and well-written, especially as math textbooks go, and is available for free online. The professor knew a lot about linear algebra and was clearly passionate about the subject. Weaknesses: the course grade was 100% quizzes and tests: 40% for the final, 20% each for two midterms, and 20% for quizzes. Instead of homework\/problem sets (these were assigned weekly but never collected, and not intended to count for a grade), there was a quiz every week, and it would quiz us on the ungraded homework material. Though the quizzes were generally fair, they were not easy, and it was stressful having to study for one every week. I would much rather have the opportunity to do homework to demonstrate my understanding instead. The tests are already very high-stakes, and this only makes it worse. Note that the policy of having quizzes instead of homework varied from professor to professor. Also, the tests frequently asked us to prove things (not in a formal proof format, but still by carefully laying out theorems and the process by which the hypothesis could be proven), which I thought was unfair. Since a) this is not supposed to be a proof-based class, as you are supposed to take MATH 225 if you want proofs, and b) the homework and quizzes did not test proofs, this seemed somewhat unreasonable. The second midterm and the final in particular were 30%-40% informal proofs.",
    "Not well taught",
    "Strengths: practicality of material, ability to be rigorous without proofs. Weaknesses: see weaknesses of instructor.",
    "The course purports itself as one that will teach you linear algebra well, but without the added time\/complexity of the proof. However, Prof. Rosenthal's MATH 222 didn't teach us theory and proofs, yet we were tested on them nonetheless. If a class describes itself as more calculation-based and less theoretical, it would be more consistent if the exams fit the description.",
    "The material in the textbook was easy to understand and the homework was very useful to improving comprehension. The professor could have done a slightly better job at explaining some concepts.",
    "Strengths: weekly quizzes make you learn material as you go Weaknesses: 9am and kind of disorganized",
    "I really enjoyed the weekly quizzes even though I didn't always do as well on them as I would have liked, I thought that they were a fairer way of gauging understanding than graded p-sets (which I often didn't have time to do out formally, given that I was taking 4.5 other credits). A weakness of this course, I thought, was definitely the difficulty spike between exams 1 and 2 I would have preferred that each be tough but fair, whereas we got a relatively easy, misleading first exam and then an extremely difficult, proof-heavy second exam.",
    "I liked the course. I think it's good for the group it's aimed at. If students want something more theoretical, they should take Math225. The textbook is great and I thought Rosenthal was a good lecturer. The major downside was that Rosenthal didn't plan for the fact that classes don't meet during reading week, so the last week of material had no lecture component or quiz.",
    "This class felt as though the first two thirds of the course was just laying the groundwork for the last third, which meant that we did not go in depth into much of the topics. I also left the class with a weak conceptual understanding of the concepts.",
    "Quizzes were fine. The midterms were not represented by the homework or the quizzes. One of the midterms was quite proof based, the final was mostly computations. I would not recommend this course with this professor overall.",
    "Lectures were confusing, things written on the board were often incorrect (just like numerically). Reading lessons from book and doing the homework was sufficient. Weekly quizzes kept you on track. Homework problems were well chosen.",
    "The textbook is very good and Dr. Rosenthal is a clear lecturer. I can't decide whether I prefer taking weekly quizzes to turning in homework, but that method does at least give you an incentive to learn the material correctly. I wish we had covered more topics related to eigenvalues and eigenvectors and done more practice with the methods we learned to use, although I understand why time constraints made that difficult.",
    "The course content was presented in a very clear way. The professor's expectations of students was clear. However, the course it titled \"Linear Algebra with Applications,\" and the most applicable content of the course was presented in the last two weeks of the course. Also, we didn't go over applications of material. I felt that the course prepared me to answer textbook problems in Linear Algebra, but not applications of Linear Algebra. The course also was disorganized in that the exam dates were not set ahead of time. We found out exam dates throughout the semester. To improve the course, incorporate engineering and computer science applications of linear algebra, and create a more concrete and detailed syllabus."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend this course to any student who is relatively interested in Mathematics, Computer Science, or Engineering. It provides a strong understanding of linear algebra concepts.",
    "If you are interested in math, then take it. If you are really really interested in math, probably take 225 instead. This is pretty easy. Can be a good fifth credit.",
    "Yes. It's the basis of all math. Must take",
    "Take it if you have a hard semester and need to take linear algebra. MATH 225 is much more interesting, but much more work. If you have time in your schedule, do that instead.",
    "I would not recommend this course with this professor, he is not a good teacher and his tests are badly written.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who does not need to take it for their major. It contains interesting topics, but the textbook proved much more valuable than the course itself.",
    "DEFINITELY DO NOT take this class with Prof. Rosenthal. Whatever you do, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Lecture was uninspiring, and wrong. Prof. Rosenthal often would make mistakes on the board, come into class late, unprepared (he would forget his notes many times) and would consistently say that everything he was teaching was \"obvious\" or \"basic\". I get it that he may believe that this is obvious or basic, but if it was, I wouldn't be taking this course. It's really great to hear your professor say this every day (heck, I counted once in class - it was more than 30+ times). Plus, 9am Watson Center is also not the best place to be. The final was fair, but the midterms were not, and the quizzes were not either. They would often cover material that was covered in chapters that we were not responsible for knowing. Our midterm that was supposed to be over 2 chapters really covered 1 subsection of 1 chapter in depth. Prof. Rosenthal apparently does not curve, and when the class average (POST 7 point curve) is failing, there is clearly something wrong here. He also does not read your answers to your tests that thoroughly, so make sure to check when you get it back! He might have stopped reading and taken points off from you, even though you deserve a good score. The only saving grace of this class is Wenyu, the TA. She saved me multiple times with her weekly review sessions. And, at the end of the class, Prof. Rosenthal offered a review session in which I learned more than all the lectures combined. Whatever you do, don't take this class with Prof. Rosenthal.",
    "Depending on your interest in understanding mathematics and linear algebra as a whole, you may want to look into Math 225. Otherwise, I felt like 222 and especially the textbook were enough to help me grasp the most basic linear algebra concepts.",
    "Go to office hours",
    "Sure but don't take it with Rosenthal.",
    "Nope, take a section of 222 that isnt taught by Erik Rosenthal or take 225. However, it is suuppeeer easy\/low workload though, so maybe if you want a gut QR? But if you care about your learning, don't take this class please.",
    "Probably not. You won't learn a ton, and if you do learn a lot it'll be because you're teaching yourself. Also, Erik is kind of a really mean person. Not a very great person to work with. Furthermore, the class is rather memorization oriented I found, and not very fulfilling. Not the worst class you'll ever take, but it's certainly not fantastic.",
    "Only take this course if you have to. Useless for engineers, has zero applications, and is mostly just basic arithmetic.",
    "So you have to take linear algebra (222 or 225), here's my recommendation. MY EXPERIENCE: Was in 225 with Auel for 6 weeks, psets were too long (~15 hours\/week) so i dropped into 222. 222 was a terrible class but pretty easy. 225: 225 is not easy, you're surrounded by unbelievably smart kids. Psets are ridiculously long and usually take between 15-20 hours on average, sometimes longer. Take this if you like theoretical math or want to major in Math. Midterm is easy, quizzes are easy, final is brutal beyond belief. 222: The easier of the two for sure. Take it if you're thinking more Applied Math or Econ or just need to take a linear course. ROSENTHAL: The man is a legend, but really doesn't know much about linear algebra. He constantly messes up examples on the board, and most kids don't bother showing up to class. THURSDAY QUIZZES: After a late night at woads, the last thing you want to do is show up at 9am to take a quiz in Watson. That being said, they're pretty easy if you just do the homework (takes 2 hours max\/week) EXAMS: Not the easiest but if you're generally good at math you'll do fine. Decent curve. OVERALL: If you're gonna take 222, don't do it with Rosenthal. Not worth getting up at 9am and most kids won't show up. Take a later class.",
    "It was ok. I wish I took 225, but didn't have enough time in my schedule because of extracurriculars to complete the long problem sets",
    "No. The exams are much more difficult than those in other sections- and involves tons of informal proofs despite the fact that this is 222 not 225 which is officially proof-based. The instructor is not encouraging even when one goes to office hours (e.g. comments said such as at your level you should ignore this type of problem on an exam or I don't think you have what it takes to pass this course). Instead of clearly stating exams are ultimately over the instructor just leaves the room. It is not mentioned whether there is a curve despite exam averages of 77% and psets not counting toward grades. Weekly quizzes are incredibly stressful.",
    "Its not incredibly interesting, but linear algebra does not have a reputation as an exciting class at any university. The class is certainly easier and less work than MATH 120, but the theory about vector spaces toward the end can get complicated. I would definitely NOT recommend the course just to get a QR, but its not bad if you need it for your major. If youre not sure whether youre into pure mathematics, chapter 4 of the book in particular (we spent about a month on it), should give you a good taste without getting you so deep into proofs and esoteric theory that you regret even trying it out. As many reviewers stated in past years, the With Applications portion of the title is a complete misnomer: we never did a single applications problem the entire class. Just go into the class understanding youll learn some theory you might have the chance to apply later, and its not a problem.",
    "An all right education in linear algebra if you like the subject. Instructor seems sort of mean (at least to me) in front of the class but then is pretty helpful in office hours.",
    "I would not. MATH 222 should have been easythe concepts are not too difficult after coming from MATH 120. Unfortunately, it was not. If the teaching were better, I would recommend it. See the \"instructor section\" for comments on this. Further, the TA was very unhelpful in explaining concepts, and the peer tutor I went to often did not know how to do entire types of problems, and I was unable to get a tutor for the class despite turning in a tutor form to the office in CTL.",
    "No, I would not. I feel like this professor made the material a lot harder than it needed to be (i.e. his final was 19 pages long and we were given no practice material, whereas other professors of the same course had finals that were one page long and students were given helpful practice tests). The professor made it VERY hard to do well in the class.",
    "Do not take if you have weekly quizzes and if you have Rosenthal.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Rosenthal was very available to answer questions outside of class and I thought the subject was very interesting and was taught in an engaging manner.",
    "This course is useful for a whole bunch of different STEM majors, so definitely take it if you need to brush up on your math skills. For humanities majors like me, it's less fun, but definitely worthwhile if you'd like to develop your capacity for logical reasoning!",
    "Depends what you're looking for. It's a good course to revive your mathematical expertise (it's not too challenging and you don't really need math120). It's not very theoretical, but if you read the textbook with care some interesting conceptual aspects of the material are emphasized in somewhat more detail than in lectures. Rosenthal is, I think, essentially a fair grader and good teacher, but I found him difficult to interact with in person. His overbearing style might throw some students off-guard. Nevertheless, he's a good professor and cares about the success of his students. He will grade you fairly and help you as needed -- but you must ask, and you must know what you need!!",
    "I would not recommend any linear algebra class to another student. The coursework is dull and the professor is not the strongest professor that you can find in the math department. I think that a differential equations class, or another 200 level math class would be more intellectually challenging and more engaging.",
    "Not really. Shop between the linear profs. An annoying course.",
    "Definitely nothing you couldn't learn on your own by just reading a couple lessons in the textbook. Good to get comfortable with computation and terminology for CS purposes, but overall not a good use of a class since all the learning was done through homework and reading the textbook. Lectures were completely unhelpful.",
    "Not especially. If you're very interested in math, 225 will probably be much more satisfying, and if you don't have to take it but would just like a fun math class, there are probably others that give you the opportunity to do more entertaining topics. That said, however, don't be reluctant to take it if you need linear algebra. The class covers some interesting material.",
    "I would recommend taking a Linear Algebra course. But if the student is looking for applications of Linear Algebra, I would not recommend it. I took it because I am a Computer Science major and I wanted to learn applications of Linear Algebra, and did not get that."
