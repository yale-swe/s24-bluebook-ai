    "I would recommend it because by your senior year, you know how to write a paper answering somebody else's questions (that's to say, your professor's questions). It's time to learn how to answer your own questions, and create a thorough and extensive body of work.",
    "I would absolutely recommend writing a thesis, but only if you're willing to put in a lot of work. Your essay can fall anywhere on the spectrum from Most Stressful Thing Ever; Written in Three Nights to Most Rewarding Academic Experience of CollegeI feel like pretty much the only determining factor is how much time and effort you put into the process.",
    "Yes! You have to take it anyway and the AMST department does a good job of making sure that you get draft pages and research done long before your final deadline. It can be a bit dry at times, but it's nice to work with your senior peers as you all complete your theses.",
    "A one-semester thesis is a particular kind of hell, but the existence of this seminar made it much more manageable. Plan your topic early, choose an advisor you love who is not overwhelmed with advisees, and try to pick something involving sources you enjoy working with this major allows for such a range and this is the time to take advantage of that. I recommend this independent senior project over a thesis in a seminar, unless one of the seminars is of particular interest to you."
