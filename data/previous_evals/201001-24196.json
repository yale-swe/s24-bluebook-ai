    "If you want to get an amazing grasp of critical theory and how to think about thinking about art, this class is indispensable.",
    "A broad but well-taught introduction to critical theory with special attention to artistic production. Highly recommended.",
    "I would defintelly recommend this class, if someone wanted to spend time with basic texts that could generate new understandings.",
    "I loved this class. Jeffrey is a very good seminar leader. Take it if you are prepared to read a great but challenging set of texts. Put time and thought into the reading.",
    "I took this because it was required as part of the art major and I couldn't take the junior seminar. I think that I learned a ton of new things and was exposed to many new thinkers, but I was very skeptical about some of the ideas. If you are taking this for pleasure, then make sure you are ready for abstract ideas that you might completely disagree with (but feel as though you don't have the proper background to argue against them)."
