    "Overall the course takes you through a hundred years worth of arts and crafts progression. It is very interesting, but at the same time can be quite dry at points. Would recommend it though.",
    "course is well worth it... Prof Cooke's lectures are always interesting, lots of helpful prep provided for tests, class is great way to access American design\/craft in 20th C and beyond",
    "If you are interested in design, architecture, furniture, or craft, you should take this course. I stumbled into it during shopping week and am glad that I stuck with it throughout the semester. It is neat to see how an object like a fork or a plate, something that we normally disregard, can speak to the cultural and politicalcircumstances of the time of its creation. The lectures are interesting and the object study sessions are really cool. But this isn't a gut class, so be prepared to memorize a lot of images for which you will have to know the dates and designers.",
    "This class was a great overview of the 20th century in the context of objects and furniture that were often very familiar. It lays out all of the objects and examples in a clear story of the way that design and craft changed through the decades.I'd absolutely recommend this class because of the perfect combination of a great professor and captivating material.",
    "Take it! It's really informative and deeply interesting. You'll never look at Yale the same way. (It's astounding how many people covered in class left their mark on campus.)",
    "Yes, I loved learning about modern furniture design.",
    "Really wonderful course with a wonderful professor. Decorative arts is pretty different from painting and sculpture, but it's just as worthwhile- if not more so. I learned a LOT and will certainly apply this knowledge to my everyday life.",
    "I think you need to go into the class with at least some interest in the decorative arts, otherwise it would probably be boring. If you are interested, Professor Cooke is a great and very knowledgable lecture and the \"Object Study Sessions\" and review in the furniture study were especially enjoyable.",
    "ABSOLUTELY"
