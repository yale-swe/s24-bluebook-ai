   "comments": [
    "Russ 155 is a great course to take if you want to learn language implicitly, by learning history. No English is spoken in the class. There are readings for every class, but all of them are relevant to the course, and most of them are interesting. I gained a deep understanding of the events of 1917 from this class.",
    "It is a great course that will not only improve your reading and writing skills significantly, but will also inculcate you with love towards 1917 Russian history. The reading of texts written by the greatest 1917 Russian politicians, including Kerensky and Milyukov, helps understand the ambiguities of the political struggle that eventually led to the Bolshevik Revolution. Overall, the course constitutes a great intellectual experience and should be taken by everyone with even the slightest interest in Russian history.",
    "Hard class but very interesting. Really makes you improve your reading skills.",
    "I would recommend RUSS 155 to another student interested in Russian or history (having prior knowledge of Russian). The student should definitely be comfortable with a medium-sized reading load.",
    "An amazing course that everyone interested in studying Russian should take. It offers a fascinating foray into Russian history through the lens of those directly involved in it. This was my first academic course taught in Russian, as opposed to a Russian language course, and the semester left me eager to continue my academic exploration of the Russian world. The readings are tough but rewarding, and our classroom discussion helpfully illuminates the nuances of these primary texts from 1917. The workload is manageable, with four vocab quizzes and oral tests throughout the semester, with an optional 10 page paper that can replace the final exam. You really get what you put into the class, but if you're interested in improving your Russian and putting in the effort, this class is for you. And Costya's a brilliant professor who skillfully presents the material in an accessible and engaging way. Can't recommend it enough."
