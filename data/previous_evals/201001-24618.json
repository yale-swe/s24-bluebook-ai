   "comments": [
    "A a german language class, the level of german is manageable and you will find you improve a lot as the class goes on. There is quite a lot of reading in german, but it goes at a steady pace. HIGHLY recommend this class - the works and theories are interesting, and the teaching is wonderful.",
    "Super fun and helpful German course! I highly highly recommend it for anyone who wants to improve both their oral and written German skills!",
    "Take it! It's a great course. Very much fun and informative.",
    "This is a great introduction to German theater. The readings are interesting and the course load is never overbearing. I feel like GMAN 172 has really helped me improve my German skills.",
    "GMAN 172 is a broad survey course in German theater. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic and is at least conversant in German. Students leave understanding not only a handful of German plays, but also the broad movements within German drama over the course of four centuries.",
    "Yes, take it because it's a focused German class and Prof. North is engaging.",
    "Not a bad course. We got to read a lot of good stuff, but sometimes the discussions were not very productive--in a literary sense, that is. Spending a lot of time speaking did help my German though, even if the intellectual content was not very well expressed.",
    "Highly recommended with appropriate language skills"
