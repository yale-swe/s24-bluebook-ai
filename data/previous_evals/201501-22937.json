    "A class where you read key texts of theory and talk about how it can relate to art. Don't worry if you don't have familiarity with theory-this is the perfect introductory course. It will give you ideas to think about in your art making practice. Joy is also a wonderful teacher, so if she is teaching it, take it!",
