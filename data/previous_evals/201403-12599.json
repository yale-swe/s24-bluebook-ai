    "yes but be prepared for lots of work",
    "Simultaneously the hardest and funnest class I have taken at Yale. Your experience in this course is heavily influenced by the TA you have. I had an amazing TA who really pushed us. This took up a lot of time and effort, however the rewards of becoming a better writer and worker in lab were worth it. Dr. Moreno is engaging, interesting, and well organized. In this lab you work with the basic model organisms: Drosophila, C. elegans, E. coli, etc. It's very hands on and a ton of fun!",
    "Yes! This is a great lab course to really get into research- you can't do research without model organisms!",
    "A hearty introductory biology lab course with a wide coverage of fundamental biology concepts, you leave feeling well-equipped to do any type of benchwork but also exhausted because of all the different components of the course including lab report, notebook, video project, website FAQs, and pre-lab quizzes.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I would be sure to tell them that it is a very cool class where we get to work with some very cool things (fruit flies, worms, e. coli, sea urchins, etc.). I would also be sure to let the fellow student know that they just need to tough it through the first couple weeks and that the lab definitely just keeps getting better and better.",
    "A TON of work lab reports out the wazoo. Only take this lab if you have to, otherwise look for another one.",
    "This class has very interesting material, but the lab reports are ridiculous. Expect to spend a disproportionate amount of time on these lab reports relative to any you've done before, and especially more than 0.5 credits is worth.",
    "Good class if you're looking for a bio lab, you do get assigned a lot of reading though. Not all of it is necessary.",
    "A pretty good lab; lab reports take 5-10 hours with only quizzes very week that require you to look over labs beforehand. Would not take this after taking genetics as there is a large amount of overlap.",
    "The work load is like that of a 1 credit class.",
    "Take it!",
    "This class is A LOT of work, but the material is incredibly interesting, the research methods\/equipment are near-identical to what one would find in a real biology research lab, and the instructors are very dedicated to what they do.",
    "I thoroughly did not enjoy this lab, but it fulfilled the requirement while giving me the flexibility to take a bio class that did not have a lab attached. This lab is actually a lot of work (full lab reports most weeks), but it is not very interesting work for someone who has any experience in research labs or even someone who did a fair amount of bio labs in high school. If you really don't have much experience in labs, this class will probably be great for you.",
    "Really cool labs. Loved the ipad and technology emphasis. The handouts were interesting and I loved getting to work with different model organisms. I especially liked working with the rest of my lab section on experiments. The assignments weren't too lengthy (there were only 4 or 5 full length lab reports we had to write out) and they were actually interesting to do. I loved getting to use different lab techniques. Take this course if you've never taken a bio course!! The labs themselves are pretty long (be prepared to stay in lab 4-5 hours) but you learn a lot and get to know pretty cool people. Great lab req for pre meds and bio majors!",
    "Learn a lot of commonly-used biology lab techniques and about the organisms used in these labs. Lab reports are time consuming and there are a number of them.",
    "This is a very interesting lab that provides an overview of many important model organisms and introductory lab techniques. The lab reports are very time consuming, but there are only 6 of them. The course is a lot of work, but is enjoyable. Just plan ahead with your schedule.",
    "This class was horrible and stressful and disorganized and just awful. There is little instruction given during lab sessions and it is difficult to figure out what to do and how things are supposed to be done because this is an intro bio lab so none of the students really know what they are doing. This class was probably the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. There is far too much discrepancy between the quality of the TAs for each section and my lab section was disgustingly disadvantaged for the entire semester because we had a bad TA. However, Dr. Moreno is kind and so so helpful. She is the only redeeming part of this course. Otherwise it was an utter disaster. The lab reports take a long time to write and the work load for this class is very heavy. I spent more time working on this class than any of my full credit courses. Especially since I had the worst TA in the history of mankind, every lab report was so confusing and difficult to write because nothing was clear because our TA gave us no support or help throughout the entire semester. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! IT IS BAD AND NOT WORTH THE MIGRAINES YOU WILL GET WHILE SITTING IN LAB FOR 5 HOURS AND WORKING ON LAB REPORTS FOR UPWARDS OF 30 HOURS PER WEEK! Do yourself a favor and pick a different bio lab.",
    "Not a bad class overall, but it's a ton of work. I thought that as a lower-level lab it would be more relaxed than the upper-level ones, but I was wrong. Dr Moreno is good, but the expectations for this class are high.",
    "This class can be a lot of work at times, but is welll worth it. You learn a lot of useful lab techniques on very common model organisms. This is one off the few classes that I let feeling like I will definitely be using the content in a real-life setting on a regular basis.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Weekly assignments are annoying but manageable. As long as you follow the guidelines to a T you'll be fine grade wise.",
    "This class is a lot of work. I would not recommend this class unless you have to take it and then e prepared for the work.",
    "A solid amount of work but one of the more informative labs offered at Yale. You get exposed to a whole range of organisms, concepts, and techniques taught in most intro bio courses, and Professor Moreno does a great job of trying to teach students as many practical real-world applicable lab skills as possible.",
    "It is very interesting to work with animal models, but there is little direction on assignments, so be prepared to just figure it out mostly on your own. Lab reports take a very long time comcompared to my other lab experiences.",
    "I would recommend this class for freshmen and sophomores - if you have done many lab courses before, particularly chemistry labs, it may seem a little slow. The work is very doable and interesting, labs are engaging.",
    "Great Course. You'll learn all the basics of MCDB labwork and have a great time doing it. Very fun and not too difficult. I'd recommend it for any student looking for a bio lab credit or interested in becoming a bio researcher."
