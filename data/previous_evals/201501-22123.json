    "The volume and density of work in this class will reinforce what is being taught. Structurally, it's very similar to FREN 110, but a little more is expected now that you've got some French experience. You should be committed to going every day, otherwise it could probably become very difficult. French is great!",
    "Yes I'd recommend it if you really want to learn French. You get what you put in, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "Great continuation of French 110. You improve your grammar and sentence structures and become more comfortable with speaking, reading and writing French.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student if they had the time and interest of learning a new language. This is a serious commitment to make.",
    "hmm yeah if you took FREN 110 this is pretty much the same so go get it",
    "Yes, it is an excellent way to learn french and is an engaging class",
    "A lot of workload, but at the end of the semester, very worth it."
