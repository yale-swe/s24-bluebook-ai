    "I learned so much about Cuba in this course. I like that it was taught by two instructors, because even though the culture side of things is what I am primarily focussed one, learning about the environment and economics helps one get a more nuanced view of the country and understand the cultural products better.",
    "It was my first experience in an ERM course and definitely changed the way I examined things.",
    "This course showed me how centuries of colonialism and neocolonial interference built up the foundation for the Cuban Revolution and how since the Revolution the Cuban government has attempted to push back at U.S.- and Western European-centric capitalist systems of governance and economics. The historical narratives presented in this course were entirely different than those frequently presented to me in high school and by my family - instead of immediately negatively connotating the Revolution \"communist\" or \"anti-American,\" we looked at the historical economic and personal injustices that pervaded the colonial powers' rule over the island. In looking at the post-Revolution history, we looked at what actually happened on the island, not what the U.S. government and my parents said was happening. On the culture side, I saw how rich Cuban cultural production has been outside of just literature, from propaganda films from the second half of the twentieth century to the son music that continues to bring the island to life. Cuban cultural currents were always broadcast to us with history and broader philosophies of culture and human-to-human understanding in mind, which allowed me to more aptly grasp notions of personhood, self, race, and identity throughout the semester. We didn't really read any hardcore theory in this course, but the discussions in class allowed me to think theoretically as well as practically about Cuban culture.",
    "The way I perceived Cuba has completely changed after the class. I learned to step away from my own preconceived perceptions of a country by engaging with its history and culture. It challenged me to see Cuba from several angles, all important to its being. I learned to look at the cultural mediums being produced as a reflection of the sentiments of the people and the state of the country.",
    "This course was described as an intensive survey course on the History and Culture of Cuba, and it was undoubtedly that, taking our class from pre-Columbian times all the way up to the present day in discussing Cuba across many platforms. From examinations of music and cultural production to lectures on everything from Cuban exiles in the 1990's or famous Cuban cows, a multifaceted approach was used to look at how Cuba has functioned and developed, and how Cubans have produced culture across a long time frame. Instrumental to this was the trip to Cuba, a two week experience that allowed us to look very closely at everything we had learned as it actually functioned in Cuba, and confused and complicated understandings we might have had about the island and its people. It profoundly shaped my understanding of Cuba, Cubans and U.S.-Cuba relations, and made the whole class much closer and more active in class in our discussions of the course material."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is taught by two professors, so managing the time between them was a struggle at first, but once we hit our stride I think it got much better. I think it's good that our assigned reading and viewing varied in register and topics to make sure that we had a more well-rounded image of Cuban history and culture. I think the number of assignments was manageable as well. The trip to Cuba was absolutely incredible. I can't believe how much we got done in those two weeks and I truly believe it added to my academic understanding of the material. When I returned I felt that I had a better grasp and was more able to relate to our readings.",
    "The course is very broad, which allows you to cover the arc of Cuban history from colonization to today. This is both a strength and weakness of the course, as it does allow students to get a sense of Cuban history, but it does come off as a weakness when we have to move through the different time periods pretty quickly. My main suggestion is that if this course is to be taught again, and it wants to keep being as broad as it is, there needs to be at least two days of class devoted to each unit. That, or the course should be focused on a small time frame. I think that also given Professor Funes and Professor Laguna's interests, it might be best to devote two separate classes to each of their main areas of study. While it was interesting to link agriculture to cultural production, the jump was a bit far and landed somewhere in between both of their expertise.",
    "Monzote and Laguna are two incredible instructors that each bring a specific facet to the class. Laguna can analyze in depth relations between Race and Ethnicity in Cuba that provides a fundamental understanding of politics and life on the island. Monzote understands the historical events that affected the island's development providing a very necessary background when analyzing any historical period on the island. When they're on they're on, its just a matter of finding the right balance between the two.",
    "This course needs some work to make it more engaging. Although when the professors lectured the material was interesting, the level of classroom discussion was subpar. I think this has to do with the fact that students did not do the reading and were not held accountable for it. Turning this into a lecture might be a great idea.",
    "The course has many strengths, including the variety of the topics covered and the stimulating discussion. However, this may also be a weakness since there are many topics that we only cover briefly. I do understand though that this is the nature of a survey course.",
    "This course really complicated all the narratives that I thought I knew about Cuba - from ideas of race and socialism to actual understandings of the Cuban economy. Being able to see the Cuban economy in action on the island helped a lot. More structure could be helpful for the leminar format (lecture + seminar), but Funes and Laguna got it under control as the weeks went on.",
    "Strengths: great professors who are very engaged with the material and prompt students to do the same. Interesting readings that vary across various topics and fields. The class trip reinforced what we were learning in class and the direct interaction with the country and its people provided us with new insights to discuss in class. Class discussion was always fired up. Areas of improvement: Navigating through the assigned readings better in class would improve discussion.",
    "The undoubted strength of this course was the two week trip to Cuba, which was paid for by Yale. The opportunity to be in the country for two weeks not only brought the whole class and the professors much closer together, and allowed us to explore the island we had learned so much about through the breadth of the reading list that we had, changing and affecting our perceptions of Cuba. It brought the class much closer together, and made the last few weeks of the course function even better, with greater discussion in class based on everything we had been able to see and experience. It was the undoubted highlight of the course and my time at Yale. While the two professors at times was challenging because they occasionally spent too long on one subject or another, or got in each others way, this was due to the fact that they were both passionate about the subject and wanted to discuss their views on it. In addition, it was their first time teaching together and teaching the specific course, and as time went on they worked together much better, to the point that the class functioned very cohesively by the end of the semester."

    "Yes! Material obviously super interesting, the professors are wonderful (and quite different which adds a lot), the class (students) were rad, and the trip was amazing",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student, especially if you're ER&M. The trip to Cuba over spring break was incredible obviously. Cuba also has a really fascinating history and it's very tangled up in US politics, so it's really relevant even if you don't study the Caribbean or Latin America. The workload was manageable with weekly responses, a reflection paper after our trip, and a final paper (with a proposal due about a month before). Laguna is a great teacher, really chill and funny. Funes was also hilarious, and led the trip really well when we were in Cuba.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale College.",
    "I know that this course--if it is offered again with the trip--will be hugely popular again next year. That said, you have to want to be in the course for more reasons than just going on the trip to Cuba--which is amazing, albeit also needs improvement, but that is different--but you're in class for 12 weeks. The course as it stands now is very broad---you're never allowed to go into any one topic that deeply, but rather, look at Cuban in wide strokes. This has its merits and comebacks, and I think what one takes away from the course really comes down to the student. I would recommend this course, but contingent on the fact that the either this course meets twice a week or becomes a lecture.",
    "Definitely take this course you won't regret it. Laguna and Monzote were two of my favorite professors during my time here.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in Cuba, Latin America more generally, or ethnicity, race and migration. The professors are great and the trip is wonderful!",
    "TAKE THIS. FIGHT TO GET IN THIS CLASS. IT'S WORTH IT.",
    "YES this class was the best class I have ever taken. The trip was such a life changing experience.",
    "Yes, I 100% recommend this course. Aside from the obvious major plus of the trip to Cuba during spring break, you learn a lot about one of the most-maligned countries in Western historical and political thought. Funes and Laguna do a great job of complicating the narrative throughout the semester, which is more or less necessary to understand Cuban today, 58 years after the Triumph of the Revolution. The readings and written work are worthwhile, and you get to design your final project in conversation with the professors. It was nice to be able to really hone my interests in Cuban history and culture before and after visiting the island in tandem with class discussions and conversations. Overall, take this course! You will have the time of your life. This was certainly the most fun class I ever took at Yale.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they are very interested in Cuba, and learning about Cuba from a variety of perspectives. The course not only allowed us to think about Cuba, but U.S. Cuba relations, and the relations of the U.S.A. to the Caribbean and Latin America in general, but from the point of view of Cuba, something that is not often taught in U.S. classrooms. I would also absolutely recommend this course for the trip which was paid for by Yale, which was a highlight of the course, and allowed us as students to experience things we had been learning about, giving us fresh perspectives on things we had learned, while bringing the whole class much closer together. It was also great to travel with a group, in a country that has been mostly inaccessible to people from the U.S., to see what a place about which we hear so much is actually like, to the extent we could see these things. It was wonderful to travel to various places in Cuba in addition to Havana, and see more of Cuba, all without having to pay for it. For the trip alone, the class is worth applying for, and you will learn so much about Cuba from the course, which will undoubtedly challenge one's perceptions of the course at some point."
