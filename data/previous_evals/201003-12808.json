   "comments": [
    "Art 114 is a good class but it does take some time to finish the projects. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to have an introduction into art (mainly using charcoal). Be prepared to get your hands dirty though and work hard at times. This class is fulfilling and an art class worth taking.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class, regardless of whether you're thinking of majoring in art.",
    "I would recommend this class to both students with and without art experiences; both can artistically grow from this class. However, this class is only limited to charcoal so be ready to get a little dirty. Other than that, there is no significant amount of work.",
    "It's a great class to really improve your drawing and compositional skills no matter their current level, and you will definitely master this kind of drawing (charcoal, large scale). Definitely take this class if you're willing to work hard and grow a lot, you won't regret it.",
    "Art 114 04 is a great basic drawing class for all skill levels. Even though it is called basic drawing, it helps to have a little bit of an artistic background. Professor Lorenz really throws everyone out there and expects you to develop yourself on yourown. It is not so much of an instructional class as it is covering all the aspects of charcoal drawing. If you are interested in art or architecture, definitely take this class, and even if you aren't really, I would suggest it. It just might be a little difficult and time-consuming if you have never really done any art before.",
    "Basic Drawing with Marie Lorenz is a wonderful class for students of all levels of art skill. There was a wide range of experience in the class, from students who had never drawn in their lives, to others who had taken AP art in high school, and everyone is able to do well and get involved with eachof the assignments. Lorenz is very caring for all students and she does an awesome job of appreciating everyone's work. One thing to note is that all the assignments are in charcoal, but Lorenz teaches a variety of techniques, and by the end of the semester, students are very familiar with the medium. Overall, it is a very relaxing class. The workload also is not bad at all. Generally, there was one assignment per week, assigned over the weekend. They required about 2-4 hours of work on average.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, just be aware that the weekly assignment takes hours to do, but they are usually really fun.",
    "We really explored charcoal in this class, so if you take this class you better be ready to get your hands dirty.",
    "There is a very manageable amount of work. I wouldn't say it changed my art that much, but it's definitely a good introduction to the world of drawing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in doing a pretty easy going art class whether they consider themselves talented or not",
    "Good course; however, the entire course depends on the instructor you get.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and instructor to a student interested in art.",
    "Good intro to basic drawing. Take it even if you have no experience; just don't get intimidated by the half of the class composed of potential art majors. Moderate workload--expect one outside drawing assignment per week, intended to take several hours.",
    "yes i would. it was a great course, especially to get away from more rigorous acedemics."
