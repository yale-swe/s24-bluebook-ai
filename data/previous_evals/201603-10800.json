   "comments": [
    "I learned more specifics of the ecology of farms, forest, and urban cities. A very useful skill was reading scientific papers and then crafting my own. Even though I study a good amount of science, this class was great for getting reintroduced to the writing process of lab reports based on our own field research.",
    "I learned how to write lab reports in this class, which was something I hadn't done since high school. I also learned a lot of interesting field skills, like how to measure trees' DBH, identify trees by leaves and bark, think about ecosystem health based on arthropods, and read the history of a landscape from its physical features.",
    "I learned a lot about how to conduct field research, including study design, data collection, data analysis, and report writing. This gave me a much better idea about what it would be like to work as an ecological field researcher. I also learned a lot about farming, forest composition\/tree identification, and urban ecology.",
    "I learned a great deal about field work in the environmental studies\/sciences discipline. I learned how to produce a lab report, read scientific papers, and do basic lab analysis. So cool!",
    "This class gave me the most authentic insight into how environmental science operates and progresses, from the methods used in the field and in statistical analyses to the way in which findings are written about in scientific journals throughout the 20th century. The lab reports allowed firsthand experience to this aspect, especially with respect to the process of finding what collected data may say and developing the most effective, concise way to represent that data visually and verbally.",
    "This course taught me some very helpful protocols and practices that I will most likely need in my prospective career as an ecologist. I learned about pitfall traps and forestry surveying, and was able to discuss some very fascinating papers about sustainability in agriculture, cities, and forests."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths include getting out into the field, being allowed to design our own methods for the labs, and the discussions of Tuesdays. One weakness is that I would always feel too under-read about the background of an area we would write a lab report that I felt uncomfortable stating conclusions about how the land changed (mostly for the arthropod and forested landscapes labs). I thought we would have talked more about what people view as fact about the new England forests, but lots of the information I ended up having to find on my own. Maybe that was the point, but I had hoped I would have known what were accurate claims going into the labs.",
    "I loved this course! This course taught me a lot about scientific writing and made me feel a lot more comfortable with it, also while learning skills needed to work in the field (and having a ton of fun).",
    "The strengths of this course are the Thursday field trips; naturally, when you're taking a field course, the part you look forward to most is going out into the field. The overnight at Yale-Myers, the farm visits, and going to the Richards property were all great field experiences that taught me about what field work means and different skills needed (i.e. tree identifications) to do field work. I think one of the weaknesses of this class were the Tuesday discussions. While the papers we read were often interesting, talking about them every week sometimes got monotonous and boring as it was often the same people contributing to conversation while the others seemed to kind of tune out. Considering each person submitted 5 reading response questions each week, I wish we would have used those more in discussions as they might have engaged more people. Another strength of this class is its teachers - Kealoha and Ben were a great pair. Kealoha is super sweet and thoughtful (and brought us snacks on big field trip days and for presentations)!",
    "The 3 units that the course was broken into were well thought-out and in a good order, with an appropriate amount of time devoted to each important topic. The days in the field were a bit disorganized, with extra time being wasted in either the very cold or very hot temperatures while we figured out logistical things or planned study design this could have been done beforehand. The free-form nature of the lab reports made them a bit stressful, since it was unclear how broad or narrow a focus to have and what data analysis tools to use. In addition, I wish the lecture discussions of the assigned papers could have been more about content and big concepts\/debates rather than the details of methodology and figures in the papers.",
    "By far, the field science aspect was the essence and joy of the course; by returning to a site multiple times, each visit revealed a different perspective on the importance and urgency of an environmental concept. If at first the assigned task appeared abstract, I learned the way in which to think of the ideas and methods of environmental science through doing, all while developing greater awareness and keener observation skills from other students and the professor and TF. In diametric contrast were the inclass discussions on scientific papers. Although the material itself is thoroughly interesting, and again, urgently relevant, the discussion frequently struggled to take off. Silences were frequent, likely because of the breadth of asking for the class thoughts on a paper. In my impression, everyone had thoughts and points to make, but it is easy to forget to bring them to mind and posit them out of the blue. Because the class is capped at a seminar size, I would strongly suggest changing the room to avoid a lecture hall and opt instead for a large table. Oftentimes, discussion ran like a question-and-answer session about a paper. Furthermore, I would suggest that a student be assigned to start a discussion, taking around 7 or so minutes, to very briefly summarize the intent, method, and conclusion of a paper, and, more crucially, to bring up their own impressions and questions they have about the findings or process. Once one person sets out a framework, many others have some grounds on which to participate, creating a much more fluid discussion. Different students might do different papers, or one might do all three assigned.",
    "Having the field\/lab component built into the course definitely is a strength of the course. For a course about field science, it was a great way to reflect that field work necessitates and is precluded by extensive literature review and discussion. This course is very heavy on group work, and so I could see a potential weakness being classmates who are not engaged, but luckily there was not a problem with that with my classmates."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this is you need a lab credit and if you want to get off campus and explore our surrounding areas here at Yale. By the end, you get a very good sense of how anthropogenic and biological ecosystems are interwoven.",
    "Yes! Take this class! You will learn how to read\/write scientific papers while having so much fun in the field.",
    "I think whether or not you should take this class really depends on your reasons for taking it. If you want a class that goes out into the field and does really cool field projects on farms and in forests, then this class is for you. If you're looking for an easy lab credit, this probably isn't for you. The lab reports are time-consuming and relatively difficult. The pluses of this class are that you get pretty close to the other people in the class since you spend so much time with them during lab days (you even do a camping overnight), Kealoha is a good teacher who's fair, thoughtful, and brings yummy snacks on special occasions, and there's no final exam. The downsides are that this class eats up a lot of your Thursday afternoon, which knocks out a lot of options for other Tues\/Thurs classes and that the lab reports are pretty rigorous and constitute a huge amount of your grade (which can be intimidating if you're not familiar with lab report writing).",
    "I would recommend this course if you are on the fence about whether or not you want to do ecological field research it covers a broad spectrum of field research areas in ecology and really gives you firsthand experience with every step of the process. The field trips to the farms and forests are fun as long as the weather is good, but Professor Kealoha always brought snacks and did her best to make them fun. The lab reports are difficult because the guidelines are not strict and we really just dive into writing them. Aside from writing the 2 big report papers, the workload is manageable, and the guided hike in the Richards Forest and the urban ecology presentations at the end are fun!",
    "This has been my favorite class at yale so far! If you love the outdoors and are considering a future in field ecology (or wish yale offered a field ecology class, in general) TAKE THIS CLASS. I loved it, we had nearly weekly field trips to farms and forests and learned about real foresty methods. Kealoha is a great teacher who is clearly passionate about what she does. You'll learn a lot (especially about trees and forests) in a way that Yale never teaches. The workload was manageable, short weekly discussion questions about the readings, three lab reports (that are quite a bit of work and can take a while, but are worth it), and a final presentation. But no exams or finals otherwise, so that's nice. Anyway, take this class, take it!!!",
    "I enthusiastically recommend the course; not only are the issues increasingly relevant and in a relatively new field, especially urban ecology, but this course provides an escape from a Yale bubble not in the socioeconomic sense, but in realizing the individuals and the universitys role in a wider environment, that has been used and disused for centuries. For me, I learned what environmental science looks like and how it is done, an immensely valuable insight for those who seek to gain firsthand experience. The workload is manageable, and the lab reports are a different sort of writing that emphasizes not only analysis but clarity in presentation of data, visual or otherwise.",
    "I highly recommend this course! Kealoha is a wonderful lecturer and a lovely person (on field days, she'd bring snacks and coffee for us!) and she herself would make the course worthwhile. The course has three modules - agriculture, forests, and urban ecology - and each comes with a project (with field work and lab report). One day each week is spent on a lecture\/discussion, and I highly recommend reading the required papers. They're interesting, and will make the discussion much more interesting. If you're interested in conducting field research in the future as a scientist, I would say this course is extremely helpful, as it teaches a couple of field methods that are widely used in entomology and forestry. Even if you're not interested in scientific research as a career, this is a great course to engage in ecology and its intersection with society, and there's field trips!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in our natural environment."
