    "This was an amazing class with an amazing reading list that gave us an amazing product at the end. You study the craft behind fiction through several genres and time periods and then get to workshop a piece of your own creation with people who learned craft alongside you. Sexton is an amazing teacher and makes you feel so comfortable with your own writing and finding your voice.",
    "do it",
    "Learn fiction writing with help from famous authors. I would definitely recommend!",
    "Simply: if you're thinking about creative writing, you basically HAVE to take this course there's not a single other early-level creative writing course that will be as helpful, fun, and rewarding. If you're not a potential creative writing major, then take this course: you read Beloved, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Faulkner, (hopefully) Austen, and you are given more than ample time to craft a work, with very flexible and broad parameters, that you may be proud of.",
    "I would recommend it! English 134 is a perfect fifth class --- fun, interesting, challenging, but not overwhelming. The syllabus is really good, but a lot of the reading can be skipped if necessary, and I found the assignments, some short prose pieces and a final short story, to be actually relaxing in the hustle and bustle of the rest of my academic life. I also learned a lot about how to better structure narratives and perceive the flaws in my own work, so all in all this class was a great decision.",
    "Overall an okay, not amazing class. It was best during workshops, but sometimes it became a sort of mediocre literature discussion, where students read as readers as opposed to reading for craft. Still, a good place to start learning to write fiction. Professor Sexton is super helpful and available, and really good at helping with the very simple starting points of a story. If writing fiction sort of intimidates you, this is a good place to start.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any and all students at Yale. It's a great way to be exposed to some high quality, but still entertaining literature, as well as give you a chance to explore your creativity as a writer.",
    "Adam Sexton is a fantastic professor. He manages class discussions masterfully and always manages to strike an appropriately positive tone without sugarcoating anything. He offers constructive criticism without ever making a student feel bad. In a creative writing class--especially one centered on workshops, as this one is--that is an essential skill. Professor Sexton is the perfect professor for an introductory level creative writing class. He is also highly approachable and gives useful, if sometimes illegible, feedback on writing assignments. I recommend this course to all students, regardless of major.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any student, whether they think they are a writer or not. It is an interesting class and a class that really teaches a new way of thinking about fiction writing."
