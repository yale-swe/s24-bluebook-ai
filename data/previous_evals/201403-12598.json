    "Devo Bio is a really excellent course to take if you are a bio major needing one of your core requirements, or if you have a solid background in science and want to take a class about a really interesting concept. The teachers are great, the workload is manageable, and you'll be learning about some really awesome stuff. Highly recommended!",
    "Take it to get a broad survey of developmental biology. The topic itself is too complicated for one to get a firm grasp of it in one introductory class, so be prepared to feel a bit in the air.",
    "The course is difficult and I wouldn't take it unless you are interested specifically in studying developmental biology. That being said, I did learn a lot of information.",
    "This class is good. Its small (around 15 people), which is nice. Professor Holley teaches most of the class and he's an excellent lecturer. His material is really well organized and well presented--you learn a lot. Kankel is not as good of a lecturer, though he only teaches about a third of the class. There's a lot of material, and you're forced to keep up with it because there's a quiz every other class.",
    "A fun and insightful course on an interesting topic. Definitely geared towards biology majors."
