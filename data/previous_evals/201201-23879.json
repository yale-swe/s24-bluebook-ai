    "WORKLOAD:-a really short paper (2-3 pages!)-a longer final paper (10 pages)-an oral report at the beginning of one class (10-15 pages)CLASS:-usually just a discussion w\/film clips and screenshots here and there-pretty relaxed-usually about an interesting issue in each film (e.g., how morality\/sexuality\/race\/etc. is portrayed in _____)-the films discussed are usually pretty entertaining and good-Professor Trachtenberg is AWESOME (really nice, generally pretty flexible, and he has a great sense of humor, which helps during the discussions)You do have to watch a movie once a week, but if you don't want to go to the film screenings, you can usually just watch the films on YouTube\/online for free.OVERALL:This class was great--discussions seemed a little dry at first, but once people got to know each other after a couple weeks, they were fun. The movies are interesting and entertaining, and class is incredibly chill (as are the assignments--seriously, the writing for this class only adds up to 12 pages over the whole semester). Professor Trachtenberg is great, too--really funny and nice.",
    "A very good class if you can get in. Watch some great movies, read some fun books that aren't pretentious like the ones you've been reading in English classes. Professor Trachtenberg will remind you of the Jewish grandfather you always wish you had. The discussions are laid-back but generally engaging, and the paper assignments are definitely manageable. Is it *the* most interesting class you'll ever take? No, but it's better than most.",
    "A fun, laid-back class with a really nice professor! Classic movies. Good fifth class.",
    "If you're interested in Film Noir, you should definitely take this class. It gets a little repetitive, but most of the movies are excellent, and the professor is stellar.",
    "AMST 417 is an in-depth study of film noir. The workload is light--one film a week, a short paper and a longer one. Professor Trachtenberg is really a special professor, and you should take a class with him if you get the chance!"
