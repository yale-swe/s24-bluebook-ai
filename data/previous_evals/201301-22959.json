   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a great way to learn about how 2D and 3D animation works and by putting a little extra time in outside of class you can really learn a lot.",
    "If you want to take animation, there is no other class. Just put aside a lot of time if you really want to delve into it and make great work.",
    "I strongly recommend this class. It is split into two main units: 2D and 3D (before and after spring break). The 2D unit has a fair amount of small projects, sometimes even two a week, and you will learn a ton of new software, like After Effects, Dragonframe, Premiere, etc. 3D is based solely on learning Maya, and most of your homework is watching tutorials and working on your final project.",
    "It's a great class--both the teacher and the material are great. Seek him out for extra help with projects if you're interested in learning more--he certainly is willing to make himself available to his students.",
    "A very intense introduction to animation. If you're interested in video\/moving image as a medium for art this is a necessity. Johannes is an amazing resource and you shouldn't pass up a chance to take his class. If you're willing to work through an infinite sea of frustration and learn this new language then this is the class for you.",
    "The beginning is much more assignment driven, and the second half of the semester is an independent project that's entirely up to you. don't expect to learn how to create a Disney animation, but you will learn how to use the software and some basic techniques to get you started. It's really what you make of it. Put in the hard work and you'll walk away with something you're proud of.",
    "An animation class which discusses and applies more of the concept than its tradition\/traditional understandings. You will not take this class and come out a pro at hand-drawn animations. Hand-drawn animation is a rare expectation in this class. Expect to animate objects, images, more unusual things.",
    "Introduction to various ways of animating. Rigorous and time-intensive!"
