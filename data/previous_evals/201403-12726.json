   "comments": [
    "If you need to take 115, then take 115. If you need the distributional credit, there are probably better classes to take, unless you really like calculus.",
    "Math 115 is a standard calculus class with twist because you have to watch videos before class. I recommend taking it. It is a fair class and Dhruv was a fantastic teacher.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, but I would tell the student that he or she would have to work hard to do well in the course.",
    "Math 115 is a good, basic calculus class. If you've taking BC calculus in high school but want a review, or if this is the next step for you, I would recommend the class. However, only take this if you're wiling to put in the time and really learn the math. The class is taught in the reverse-classroom style, with 15-30 minutes of video to watch before each class along with problems to answer to check your understanding. Class time is taught reviewing the material, answering questions, and working in small groups to check your understanding. Be prepared for weekly problem sets as well! And two midterms that are fair but challenging.",
    "I would only recommend the class to another student if they have to take it for their major or if they really enjoy math. The class structure itself was not really effective for me. I would recommend them to take it with my instructor, Dhruv.",
    "It's so much work, don't take it unless you have to!",
    "MATH 115 04 is a solid class on the second-half of calculus, which includes integration, series, polar coordinates and differential equations. Taking it without a high familiarity with differentiation and limit would be painstaking, but otherwise it does a good job in teaching you calculus.",
    "The class consists of simple topics that are easy to grasp but the application of those topics can be very complicated at times, as seen in the problem sets and tests. Overall, I think Math 115 is a good course to take though, and I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Math 115 is great for learning to apply concepts and use them to solve problems. If that's what you enjoy, it's a good course.",
    "Math 115 is can be a difficult class if the necessary time and effort is not put in. However, there are plenty of resources to get extra help so it is completely manageable.",
    "If a student needed to take it to fulfill a requirement, then they should take it. Otherwise, I would say there are probably more interesting classes out there that are a little clearer and better formatted.",
    "Math 115 is a good class for students looking to further their understanding of math past AP Calculus AB. The class is \"flipped\" though, and the online video lectures and prep problems are easy to forget about and can sometimes be a pain to complete the night before class."
