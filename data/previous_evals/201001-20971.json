   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. It is a very interesting and useful course for those who aspire to understand the post-communist states in Eurasia.",
    "It provides a helpful overview to those students with a regional interest in Eastern Europe \/ the Caucasus.",
    "Recommended for students interested in learning more about the Caucasus.",
    "Yes! Definitely worth knowing about the region covered and the Instructor was very knowledgeable about it and the issues therein.",
    "Not as a grad student, because of the mixed format of the class. Would have been a much better class if it had been divided into grad and undergrad sections.",
    "International Relations 540 01 is a very interesting course about conflict and cooperation in post-communist Europe and Eurasia, with specific focus on autonomy and secession. I would strongly recommend this course to serious students of international relations, and especially to students who study the regions mentioned. The syllabus is quite unique- it has an eclectic collection of books and articles that allow for a comprehensive examination of the subjects at hand.Furthermore, this class is complemented by Professor Siroky's support of his students' academic and professional goals. If a student is willing to contribute the necessary time and work this course calls for, then he or she will certainly stand to gain very much from it."

   "comments": [
    "The course was focused on my main field of research, which is the post-communist transition in the former Soviet Union and it did significantly deepen my knowledge of the region. In addition, I learned a lot about the Balkans.",
    "The course helped me gain more substantive knowledge about politics.",
    "Contributed to my knowledge of what I had always thought a fascinating region.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline greatly and has helped prepare me for my profession. As a student who has specialinterest in the Europe and Eurasia, I found the readings, most of which I had not encountered prior to this semester, as useful additions to my other coursework. Furthermore, this significantly contributed to my research, as Professor Siroky helped me navigate my study of comparative secessionist conflict. I am thankful that I was able to benefit to such a great extent through my participation in International Relations 540 01."
