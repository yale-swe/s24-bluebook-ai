   "comments": [
    "I learned how to better conduct\/rehearse",
    "Building off the basic techniques I learned in the introductory class, I expanded my gestural vocabulary and gained some rehearsal experience as well.",
    "MUSI 324 taught me the expressive use of the baton along with the analysis of musical works and introduction of orchestral rehearsal techniques. A review of physical movements was instilled at the beginning of the course, from which the personal study and musical interpretation of Tchaikovskys 5th Symphony-Mvt.1 followed. From this analysis, I understood the simple organization of the piece that plays into a conductors visualization and roadmap of the music, whether it be a small passage of the piece or a whole movement. As the course provided this time for study, it most notably allowed me to conduct a small orchestra every week and to apply those skills manifested from instruction and practice. Learning to control the interpretation of the music, notice mistakes and recover from them was accessible with this weekly rehearsal. Additionally, being able to play with the full score in mind spurred a different perspective in my musical playing which lent a more overall security toward the music. Along with the developed confidence to stand in front of an orchestra and perform, I learned to be more comfortable reading a score with multiple instruments having different parts, oftentimes having multiple time signatures and tempos. Though I was not even partially mastered in any of these, the introduction and re-introduction to these things encouraged my growth in conducting."

   "comments": [
    "Group conducting was very very helpful",
    "The course was overall very good. Toshi is a great teacher. At times, it was unclear on exactly what day we would be conducting; a few times, I prepared a piece for a class only to learn that we were starting conducting the next time. Also, it was frustrating when people didn't show up for classes, since they make up the orchestra that you aren't conducting. Nonetheless, it was a very good class and my conducting improved greatly.",
    "Strengths: good professor, supportive peer group. Weaknesses: lack of detail in performance critiques.",
    "The strengths of the course are the availability to work with an orchestra and use a conductors baton to direct it. MUSI 218, most certainly was a hands on-type course, allowing students like me to practice the actual methods taught, instead of recounting them in their mind. The professor himself is very accomplished in the art, and his methods are meant to re-introduce the main techniques to the student but also encourage personal expression, as with a poem or creative essay. The only weakness of this course, in my opinion, may be the scheduling throughout the semester, which conflicted with some occasions of both the students and the professors commitments."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend if you enjoy\/understand music",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in orchestral conducting. Toshi is a great teacher and, if you come prepared to class, you will learn a great deal. Study the scores before it's your turn to conduct; what you get out of this course is proportional to how much you put into it. I put in a lot, so I got out a lot.",
    "I'd recommend this as a low-key fifth class for musicians to get their feet wet with conducting. However, I would not recommend this for someone who's really serious about conducting and wants to explore orchestral music in substantial detail. Toshi's a great guy and an incredible conductor, and you will definitely learn from him. However, the rapid-fire masterclass format of the class (in which each person conducts for 4-5 min and gets 2-3 min of feedback) means that each student gets only the most general of feedback. To be sure, it's very good general feedback - but some detail would have also been nice. So, even though I'm glad I had the experience of this class, I don't feel ready to stand in front of even an amateur orchestra and actually conduct anything. Having said all of this, the course has potential: If (a) there's more substantial homework, (b) there are clear-cut objectives for every class, and (c) Toshi prepares more for each class, this course could be really transformative for students and improve their conducting abilities dramatically.",
    "Yes, the Intermediate Conducting course is a great course for all to take if interested in the art of conducting, or interested in the analysis of scores requiring a personalized musical interpretation. However, those who would most benefit from this are musicians, as the course additionally provides a new perspective of musical performance that usually is not available: the conductors perspective. This perspective allows the musician to better understand the intertwining sections of the orchestra and the correct balance, to which the player must carefully contribute when part of the orchestra. Please, do not take this course to satisfy a credit. The course does not count toward anything but your growth in conducting."
