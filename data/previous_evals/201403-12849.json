    "FREN 150 is a great class if you're looking to improve your reading and oral skills in French. This class also covers a lot of vocabulary which we continue use throughout the year so as not to be forgotten. This course also goes over a large range of basic grammar structures, solidifying them in writing.",
    "A very well structured, time-tested course. Homes in on every grammar pattern and skill needed, and the mix of books and films is refreshing. Lots of good vocabulary learned, and Madame Skorupa is one of the most caring teachers I have ever had.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 150 to a fellow student. It's a goo course - not too much work, interesting books and films, and great professors. It's focused pretty intensely on grammar so if that's not your thing beware, but otherwise it's a pretty fun class. There's lots of room for participation, and though the tests are sometimes hard and they make you memorize a lot of vocab, its a really good class and if you like French and French culture I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course: enjoyable material, and great professors (I had Skorupa, and spoke with the other professors a few times, who all seemed really cool and on top of their shit). Go to French class, good times, God Bless!",
    "Good, take it but be prepared for as much work as L3 and L4",
    "Good for grammar and writing",
    "I would definitely recommend French 150 for another student at the appropriate level of French."
