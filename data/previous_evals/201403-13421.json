    "Great intro class. Lots of hours but worthwhile.",
    "ART 136 is a great course for any student with an interest in photography, analogue film, and developing an eye for aesthetics. It's a fairly work-intensive course, especially around critiques, but the payoff is wonderful. You'll emerge from the course with a deep understanding of shooting film, developing, curating and printing, and you'll have a great portfolio to show for it. My one word of advice, though, is that you get as much out of it as you put in. Put in a lot.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class! It's crazy how little we actually see in the world each day. Taking this class forced me to look and actually notice the little things that I missed each day. This class allowed me to understand the aesthetics of photography and film much more. It's a lot of work but a sense of camaraderie develops as you spend hours in the darkroom. It is pricy, 400 for supplies in addition to 150 in material fees, but totally worth it!",
    "I would most definitely recommend ART 136 to another student for anyone interested in trying something different or genuinely interested in enhancing their eye for photography. Black and white film is the foundation of modern photography and is a great way to start the building blocks of getting better. My only two cents are that A) one must spend 10 hours every week outside of class working on photography and usually it ends up being about 20 hours. In class no work is done it has to be all on your own and you have to make time for it. B) it is very expensive to participate because materials are expensive. that must be considered if you want to take this class.",
    "Exposure to the film and developing process as well as personal development of understanding of composition. Would recommend.",
    "yes definitely.",
    "Great class for anybody looking to learn a new skill and\/or try a new for of art. It was my first art class ever and I loved it!",
    "You learn how to use a camera, then how to capture the world! Great class. A lot of work, but totally worth it. You learn a lot about yourself and how you relate to the people and places that make up the world around you. For these reasons: 10\/10 would recommend to a friend.",
    "Yeah, but know what you're getting yourself into. It's a large time commitment."
