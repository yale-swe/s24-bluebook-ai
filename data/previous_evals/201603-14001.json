    "The course's largest strength was how interesting and unique the material was and how well the authors=s' works could be connected to each other. I also thought it was ideal because there was a perfect amount of time spent on each work and author and it was not just a cursory analysis. I would have liked to hear more about the motivations behind certain plot points in the material, but I understand that some of the books were very detail-heavy."

    "I would recommend this course to any student who has interest in any or all of the authors, as they are amazing and similar in certain ways. Professor Jackson is very kind and knows so much about lusophone cultures so it is always captivating to hear him lecture on these authors. He also went over the material well and I often found myself noticing more of the intricacies of the texts in class. The works we read are amazing."
