   "comments": [
    "This won't run again in this form (i.e. about the Parfit book, or probably with these two professors together), but if it did I would recommend it to anyone with the requisite background and even a passing interesting in philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student as a great opportunity to learn with two very different professors about something very topical and very interesting.",
    "I would recommend the course, although the subject matter will vary in the future. But this approach to significant and new works is important, and helps students gain perspective on what's presently going on in the field, which is doubtlessly pretty important.",
    "If you want to have an extremely long, dense, frustrating book explained by two great professors, I recommend it. However, I think the book itself was poorly argued, at points inconsistent, and extremely dogmatic. The course would be best for students with a background in both normative and meta- ethics, and then only if they are interested in a slightly marginal and somewhat reactionary figure in ethics. Also, students ought to find non-naturalist cognitivism in metaethics at least a somewhat plausible or coherent position, lest they get frustrated by the style of argumentation in its favor.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "It deepened it greatly. Almost anyone - even someone not working at all in ethics - would find something relevant to their work in such a long and wide-ranging book.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of my discipline by giving me the chance to engage in a sustained fashion with some important recent work in the field. In addition, the detailed feedback I received on written work helped me develop both my thinking and writing skills over the course of the semester."
