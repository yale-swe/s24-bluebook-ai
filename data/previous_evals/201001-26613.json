    "Kurt was really capable in framing the subject and unfolding its research in any possible direction. There was no real order in the lecture material, but there was no need for it either.",
    "The course was a bit too loosely defined. Kurt has an incredible wealth of knowledge but at times it was difficult to understand from what angle we were attempting to approach the subject matter. Likewise in the end it was hard to define the exact purpose of the paper\/project since the course had seemed not to have a particular agenda.",
    "The syllabus was very thorough with the idea behind the seminar and additional texts to be read. It did not spell out the order of the course and when assignments would be assigned or do but I think for this class that was fine.",
    "The syllabus and sequencing could have been more clearly defined at the onset.The material is fascinating and thus could be presented in a more deliberate or systematized way.",
    "It was a very interesting class. However, the direction of the class was never completely clear and it seemed like we could have benefited from having more time to develop the kind of database Kurt was interested in.",
    "A sequence did not really exist, nor was there a syllabus. The class consisted of us sitting in the seminar room while Kurt basically told us amusing stories and anecdotes, sometimes related to the subject of the course, and sometimes not. I am not necessarily taking issue with this method, but I think the class would have definitely benefited from greater structure. Although each class, Kurt did have an architect in mind he wanted to discuss, his notes were often disorganized and rambling.",
    "Very interesting and great presentations"

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I was hoping for the course to be a chance to interact with Kurt in a seminar setting, and to be challenged with discussions, questions, etc. The course fell a bit short since most of it was spent with Kurt lecturing to the class rather than allowing for discussion. When questions wee posed no one seemed willing to interact with the subject matter.",
    "I did not have any expectations for this course. While I find this subject to be extremely interesting and I feel I only touched the surface of what could be learned about this topic, I mostly took this course to listen to Prof. Forster. He is an amazing mind.",
    "The general subject matter met my expectations, in terms of the course description lining up with the material that was taught. However, it could have been grander, more milestone-oriented, a bit larger in scope.",
    "I am still unsure exactly what Kurt was trying to get at with the idea of the autobiographical house. Although he kept urging us to come up with generic \"categories\" under which the architects we chose would fall under, he never made these categories clear. He should have pushed his agenda more and provided us with clearer guidelines about what he meant by autobiographical and how this relates to the house. In fact, many of the examples he gave us in class were not even houses..."

   "comments": [
    "This class was a great way to understand a great architect in a more intimate way.",
    "This course was really valuable for me. Besides my personal research, really engaging, I had the chance to learn a lot also from the teacher's knowledge (amazing) and my classmate's work.",
    "It was an opportunity to better understand how Kurt approaches topics and thinks about topics. Less interaction than I was hoping for but in the end still valuable.",
    "Overall the course was very interesting and I looked forward to each meeting.",
    "It was valuable, but not as strong as it has the potential to be with only a few tweaks.",
    "The greatest value I received from the course was from my final paper. I put a lot oftime and effort into it, and I found that to be an extremely rewarding experience. Although I complain about the lack of structure in the course, Kurt does give us the freedom to write a paper on anything we chose and to present it in any format, which I certainly appreciate.",
    "I think this course is amazing to see the caveats and connections with architects and their dwellings. It was always an energetic topic and discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Forster is an amazing and entertaining lecturer. The TA never came to class.",
    "the instructor has enormous teaching skills. Lectures and discussion always interesting and enjoyable",
    "Kurt has a way in which he can talk about any number of subjects. While sometimes he would lose me in his stories, I always enjoyed listening to him. I learned a lot from him and he has inspired me to look more closely at this subjust of the autobiographical house.",
    "Kurt is an incredible lecturer.Like, awe-inspiring.But I think the enthusiasm for the ideas at the core of the course has the potential for interfering with scheduling, milestones, goals etc.",
    "Kurt is a great and incredibly knowledgeable professor. A bit more direction in the course could have been helpful.",
    "Kurt's style is difficult to follow at times, especially at 9AM. Although I appreciate the vast amounts of knowledge he has and tries to impart on the students in the form of witty anecdotes, since they do not pertain to a greater structure, the memory I retain of them often evaporate just as quickly as they come. I also believe that he should try to be more engaging with the students. A good seminar teacher, at least in my past experience as an undergraduate, is supposed to incite discussion amongst the students, rather than going off on endless monologues, which is precisely what Kurt does.",
    "Probably my favorite course at yale. Kurt was amazing with his presentations and discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Weekly Assigned readings would help to focus the class\/ improve group participation since students would be more able to pose questions ahead of time and involve themselves in discussion.",
    "Perhaps to be more ready to present more case studies as lectures.",
    "More specific (as opposed to suggested) readings; more milestones or marks working towards an end result; a clearly-defined end result; more hardline scheduling towards the beginning and middle of the semester.",
    "Again, as mentioned above, I think the class's main weakness is that Kurt does not engage with the students enough. The more we are incited to participate, the greater the likelihood that we will stay awake in class.",
    "I think more emphasis on class discussion would have been helpful."
