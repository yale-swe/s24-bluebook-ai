   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially one interested in music in a general sense. It really helped to give new understanding to a lot of music that I had already listened to before.",
    "Take this class. Prof. Kane has taken it in a new direction this year. Instead of focusing on part writing and analysis, the class covers all the material of the old 205 and 210, but focuses solely on analysis. I came away with a great understanding of how to dig into the harmonic and formal structures of music. Expect lots of Beethoven. It's a lot of work (expect at least 2 hours for many of the assignments), but worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Music 205!! Take it with Brian Kane if at all possible. He's super passionate about music theory, and the way he talks about it, you really start to get a sense of the nuances of it as a discipline, even though the course is fairly introductory. Rather than just laying out all of the conventions as definite rules, he explains interpretive differences\/gray areas, why they matter, and how theory relates to other important aspects of the music. He also structures the class really well - there's homework due every class, and it often includes challenging excerpts that are meant to stretch your understanding of what was just covered. We started each class by going over the homework and talking through the more challenging problems as a group. Afterwards, we would cover new material, always in a very interactive way - participation was definitely encouraged, and Professor Kane's explanations were often driven by our questions. We started off with first and second species counterpoint, then did chord-based analysis, applied chords, etc., and then learned about larger musical forms (sentences, periods, small binaries, small ternaries). We ended with sonata form and got to analyze some really interesting pieces. Also, I know the class isn't advertised as being for music majors necessarily, but it's still perfect for prospective music majors who haven't taken enough theory yet to skip straight to 210. A lot of people in my class were experienced musicians who hadn't had tons of formal music theory training.",
    "I would summarize Music 205 as a basic survey of the ways in which music is constructed, both melodically\/harmonically and structurally. We started with a review of the basics - key signatures and scales - before moving on to counterpoint and other harmonic structures (including significant practice with Roman Numeral Analysis). We ended the class with analysis of full length pieces, which was a serious feeling of accomplishment. This year the section with Professor Kane was \"experimental,\" but it is the structure that all classes will use in the future (to the best of my knowledge). If you've got some understanding of basic music theory, I would especially recommend taking this class. Professor Kane is a wonderful professor who actually cares about his students and is concerned with making sure everyone really grasps the concepts before moving on. There are homework assignments due nearly every class, which take some time (especially once you get into significant analysis), but it is definitely worth the effort.",
    "This course will briefly review the basics of music theory and then move on to a section on counterpoint. The majority of the class was spent on analyzing increasingly large segments of music; building from short harmonic progressions to mid-length sentencial and periodic structures and eventually up to sonata-sized segments.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course, especially if (like me) you have been playing an instrument for years without understanding anything about music theory. Professor Kane was wonderful, and this was one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale. My piano playing has vastly improved as a result, and I understand the pieces I play so much better.",
    "MUSI 205 was a great class and I would recommend it. However, be aware that each section is a little bit different. I shopped many of the sections before deciding to take the one with Brian Kane. You should definitely take it with Kane. This year he decided to go a different route than most other sections of 205 by focusing less on part writing and more on analysis of forms (periods, sentences, theme and variations, sonata, etc). It is definitely more useful and interesting, as part writing and such is covered in 210. I only took MUSI 205 because it is required along with lessons for credit, but I would still recommend this course to someone interested in music.",
    "Yes, take it."
