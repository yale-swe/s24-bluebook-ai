   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in the readings, take it. If not, you'll be bored. That's pretty much it. Professor Jackson is very caring and knowledgeable about the literature we read so if you aren't into it then you'll be bored and feel lost. Good and relatively easy way to get a Writing credit--you can write the papers on any topic you want.",
    "Great course to take in order to balance your schedule with a class that is more relaxed, but from which you will learn a ton.",
    "It's an interesting, low-workload literature class, that is taught more like a lecture than a 15 person seminar. If that interests you, go for it.",
    "Take it. Professor Jackson is wonderful. But if you only get the chance to take one course with him, this is not him at his best.",
    "This class will introduce you to a good variety of otherwise obscure Spanish and Portuguese authors and provide a strong basis for literary analysis. The workload is very manageable and not very difficult, although Professor Jackson emphatically cares about style and a lot of variation in grades, especially in the A-B range, is based on how much he likes how you write. However, he's a very approachable professor and cares a lot about the material. To note: the 'psychology' of this class is very much based in literature, not in more scientific psychological analysis, so don't be expect an interdisciplinary lit\/science course, because that's not what you're getting. If you like literature and are looking for a class that does allow you to find a strong unifying thread of theme in the works you read, then by all means take this class.",
    "It was a good class. I liked the reading. But I wouldn't say it's one of the best classes I've taken.",
    "Portuguese and Spanish literature is definitely underappreciated here at Yale, so this is a good chance to review some of the more intriguing works. The only problem with the class is that it's really small. Sometimes this is an advantage, but it sometimes feels awkward.",
    "For the most part."
