   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes, if you can get in absolutely take it. It is useful for both educators and policy makers because they need to be able to talk to one another.",
    "If you get in, you have to take it.",
    "Yes. You need to take one of JBS's classes before you graduate. I personally enjoyed PLSC 260 a bit more just because of content, but this class was still absolutely incredible.",
    "This is a class that truly lives up to the hype. Absolutely take it if you get in \u2014\u00a0even if you don't have a ton of experience with education policy coming in, you will acclimate very quickly and find yourself deeply interested in issues in education. In a sense, it's also a very \"meta\" class. What I mean by that is that the course often taught me just as much about collaboration and the learning process as it did about the country's most pressing educational issues, especially during our focus on evaluation in the first half of the course. JBS is a fantastic educator, professor, and facilitator \u2014\u00a0his attention to detail and his frequent feedback are notable and appreciated. The class sessions are some of the most unique and interesting at Yale: you work mostly in small groups on a variety of tasks including debates, policy proposals, and simulations. To some this may seem like a turnoff, but it's really not because of the dedication that every student has to the class. It's a wonderful learning environment, and I sincerely feel like I've come away from the course with new friends and colleagues. Be sure, however, that you're ready to make the commitment. Between a 150-to-200 page casebook every week (which is almost always fascinating), a weekly 500 word response with revisions, a weekly out-of-class small group meeting (which is a great time), an oral midterm (a unique and worthwhile experience of its own), and a final case study paper, it's plenty of work. But it's manageable, and my best advice is to let yourself dive in to one of the best experiences at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. You will probably learn more from your fellow students than you have in any other academic setting.",
    "Amazing as always. JBS is without a doubt the best and hardest-working teacher at Yale. I like PLSC260 a little better but both are the best classes Yale has to offer.",
    "Forces you to think creatively about the real challenges schools and districts face.",
    "If you're able to get in, take this class. There's nothing like it at Yale. JBS is brilliant and kind, and you'll be with some of the best minds at Yale. The workload is significant, but JBS is a fair grader, and you'll want to do the work, anyway.",
    "Absolutely! It's hard to imagine a better course than Public Schools & Public Policy, or a more dedicated teacher than Professor Starr ('JBS'). It's a demanding course, with high expectations from both the professor and your peers, but worth every bit of effort. I highly, highly recommend that everyone who is admitted take PLSC 240.",
    "I learned a lot in PLSC 240. If past years are any indication, the other evaluations will sing the course's praises, and for the most part I agree with those praises. I share with the other students a great respect for JBS: he cares about each student, he thinks about his pedagogy, and he selects readings carefully. But, given a little time to reflect, there are a few things I wish I'd known going into PLSC 240. First, as someone who is not used to taking policy classes, I found tackling complex issues through the simplifying lens of \"what can be done about it, at a policy level?\" to be somewhat frustrating. Previous evaluators have praised 240 for giving students the opportunity to \"try your hand at policymaking\"; I found this to be a relatively ineffective pedagogical tool. We would often be broken into groups and given 15 to 20 minutes to come up with a policy that solved some incredibly complex problem. Generally these discussions took the form of discussing a few policy alternatives we had read about, and picking and choosing our favorites. These discussions, I thought, ended up being pretty shallow, staying near the surface level of policy (what percent of funding should come from here vs. here; how often do we do school inspections, etc.) and rarely delving deep into the ideological bases of those policies. I also think the model of policy-making we were following (by necessity) was an elitist one. We, a class of mostly white (and all non-black) students, would try to \"solve\" racial integration in half a class period, based on research done mostly by white economists and consultants and academics. Sometimes, in aldermanic campaigns in Ward 1, people accuse Yalies who are running of trying to use New Haven as their \"political science playground,\" a place to try out all the cool ideas they've gotten from class. Sometimes this class felt that way. (Which brings up another point: with some really awesome exceptions, the readings lacked diversity in perspective, not racial and class diversity, but also diversity in terms of from what professional angle the writers were dealing with an issue. We read work from relatively few teachers, preferring academic papers by economists and sometimes education studies scholars, government publications, and consulting firm reports.) So, do I recommend this course? I think so. In any course that is 'hard to get into,' there is a certain psychological shift that happens: classmates think of each other as being part of a community, and are unafraid to take the work and ideas seriously, discuss them outside of class, and so on. That's really valuable. I also do think that despite the caveats mentioned above, the casebooks are the result of very well-done research -- I learned a ton about everything from standardized tests to rural school district consolidation, and it was often fascinating. And JBS is really nice and knowledgable, about (it seems) every aspect of the public education system in the U.S., even those aspects that don't make it into the course.",
    "Yes! This class is excellent. JBS is a phenomenal teacher who knows so much about education policy and politics. The class is structured so that you are usually working in small groups, which means you are always engaging with the material and talking out real-life problems\/scenarios with your classmates. You have to read about 200 pages every week for this class, and meet with your study group for an hour before every class, which sounds like a lot of work, but really isn't. Study group is what you make of it; my study group was the highlight of my time in this class. It is important that you actually do the reading and come to class prepared, but most of the reading is interesting; JBS makes all the casebooks himself so they are actually tailored to what you will be discussing in class. In this class you not only learn about public schools and education policy, but you become friends with the people in your class. It is a highly unique educational experience, and if you can get in to the class you should absolutely take it.",
    "Much heralded, the JBS courses are definitely worth taking. Excellent professor, good material, and smart classmates. Apply early, apply often.",
    "Everyone has said it before in these evaluations, but I'm just writing to add something that I didn't see. When I first saw the syllabus, I was intimidated by the amount of work. But the midterm evaluation does not require that much work, and the stuff leading up to the final paper is negligible. So basically, what you're looking at is 200 pages of reading a week, a weekly 500 word reading response (which can be revised forever, and which most people just get As or A-s for turning in), and a 20 page term paper. It IS a lot of work, but it is not an impossible amount -- which it looked like to me when I enrolled.",
    "One of the best courses as Yale, take it if you have the chance. Your classmates are incredible, JBS is incredible, the readings are incredible, you get the picture. The workload is bigger than most courses, but is not massive, and it seemed like less than it was to me because i so looked forward to doing it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. JBS is a fantastic professor!"
