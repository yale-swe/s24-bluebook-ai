    "Very good overview - good workload balance.",
    "The lectures were SO STRONG. Keep up the excellent lecturing. That said, grading is unfair because Craig Buckley and Eeva-Liisa have different standards and priorities. I received comments and grades like two months ate and there was no explanation for what was wrong with my submissions. I saw compliments and then an A- or B+, and three of the five were graded after the last lecture of the semester. The TF was probably symbolic and was just as confused about discussions on canvas as the professors and students. The Canvas discussions added little value to the course and were never consistent in where they were located. I didn't do them sometimes because of that reason. Please be more organized or don't try to add complexity if you can't grade it.",
    "The class is co-taught by an architecture professor and an art history professor. It is great to see two points of view in one class and I really appreciated the structure of it.",
    "Strengths: the lectures were interesting Weaknesses: the workload (2 exams, a paper, regular writing assignments, weekly reading responses) was intense given the class structure"
