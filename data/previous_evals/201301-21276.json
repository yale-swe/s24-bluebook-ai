    "It gives a thorough background to the laboratory methods, mathematical principles, and structure-solving methods behind X-ray crystallography.",

    "Although there is a lot more to learn about using X-ray crystallography in a practical sense and we did not go too deeply into the math and physics behind the technique, it was a very solid introduction and I think it will be massively helpful if I end up using the technique during my PhD work.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of crystallographic structure solution.",
    "Highly prepared me to be comfortable with structure solving for my future thesis work."
