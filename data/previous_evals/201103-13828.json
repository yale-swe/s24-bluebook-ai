   "comments": [
    "the class is a valuable experience, and some people say 120 is a must take course. but dont waste your time in Hopper's section. You will do more and learn more from one of the more famed professors i.e. Deming and Striebe, otherwise it's not worth it. There are better ways to get a wr credit",
    "English 120 is a class that teaches you how to write about yourself, about topics you are interested in, and about society as a whole. This non-fiction writing class improves your writing ability because you are constantly turning in papers every week and seeking advice from your teacher and the fellow writing tutors to make your papers better. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone that wants to work on their writing and learn how to write non-fiction.",
    "It's the best class I've ever taken. If you want to become a much better writer or if you have any interest in writing at all, you need to take this course or you will be missing out on a truly memorable experience.",
    "In English 120, you study the best contemporary essays through seminar discussion, and then try your hand at writing your own creative nonfiction. There is a lot of personalized feedback on your writing from professors and classmates. By the end of the semester, you'll submit a piece for publication. I loved experimenting with a variety of structures and styles for different essays, and definitely gained a new appreciation for the continuous process of editing and rewriting. Writing or revising an essay every week was definitely time- and labor-intensive, but paid off in noticeable progress. The material and structure of the class depends a lot on the individual professor, so shop for a section that you like. Overall, I strongly recommend this course as an enjoyable and worthwhile writing credit!",
    "120 is challenging but definitely worth taking--I came out of the class a much better writer and enjoyed writing many of the essays. Hopper is a fair grader, and I found individual meetings with her to be very constructive and helpful.",
    "I would describe it as nonfiction reading and writing and would recommend it because the writing is personal and interesting.",
    "Definitely! A great introduction to creative non-fiction writing, and Prof. Hopper is excellent.",
    "English 120 is a good class to take if you want to become a better writer in any field. The texts that we read are often engaging and very manageable. I took this class to help me improve as a writer and to help me get over my fear of writing big college essays. If you take this class, you will be very prepared for writing at Yale and beyond.",
    "If you have any interest in creative non-fiction, take this course!",
    "I would say that it is an enjoyable course, but a lot of work, especially for a student who does not naturally enjoy writing. One will be writing a lot in this course. I would also tell a fellow student that it requires a lot of work to earn a higher grade. I was advise a student who is genuinely interested in writing to take the course. However, those who are less interested in this area may find it difficult to keep up with the amount of writing and work required for this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are relevant, and the work is hard but worth it. The work is constant but predictable."
