   "comments": [
    "This is a great course in learning how to write for a Western, academic audience. This means that the placement of the main claim, structure and style of the papers are quite fixed. So if you want some more freedom in your writing, try a creative writing class instead. That said, if you need to work on your writing skills, take this class early in your Yale career so you can apply the skills you learn to other classes.I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Lynda Paul. She is enthusiastic and accessible. You can tell she really cares about the students. Plus, Disney is a great topic, which makes the papers much more bearable and sometimes enjoyable!",
    "I would summarize it as a course were we look at Disney through many different lenses and the societal impacts it has while improving our essay writing skillsI would definitely recommend this course. I am not a good essay writer and I feel like this course really helped me write better. Not only that but it was a really fun subject matter making it a lot easier to write about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The professor is fantastic! The subject material is intriguing, but above all, you will learn how to write.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in Disney. Don't expect a class about Disney conspiracy theories but do expect readings that will make you analyze Disney's influence on society from their methods of portraying various cultures to their ways of selling merchandise. Discussion with the Professor and the student is always very, very interesting and the class is very helpful in improving how you write.",
    "Great class! I never thought I would get to take a class on Disney, but this is exactly what I would have dreamed about. This class improved my writing but was also fun.",
    "Would definitely recommend. A good intro writing course. The readings are reasonable and usually interesting. Teaches basic academic writing formats while still starting to get away from the standard high school five-paragraph essay. Only four papers for the semester, with a lot of peer revision along the way. Lynda is super helpful and nice and easy to talk to for any advice. Plus, it's Disney.",
    "I would recommend it because it covers the basics of writing by covering material on The Walt Disney Company.",
    "Lots of writing that may not seem worth it in the now, but is very redeeming after the fact.",
    "English 114 does a great job at bettering your writing and analysis skill, but the class is only enjoyable if the instructor and section theme are interesting. The Disney& Society section is easily the best in my opinion because the writing prompts are both fun and really challenge you to look at popular Disney media in a whole new way. We discussed everything from colonialism to gender to race to religion to history in the context of Disney films, musicals, parks, and merchandise. Highlights of the class were seeing The Lion King on Broadway (paid for by Yale) and the discussions about the best readings. I highly recommend this class to anyone who enjoys Disney and would love to dig deeper into its messages.",
    "I would summarize English 114 as very helpful but very time consuming and a lot of work. I would however still recommend the course because it helps your writing skills.",
    "An amazing class! Definitely take this--it may sound like an \"easier\" class since the focus is ostensibly on Disney. However, the workload is that of any other constructive writing class, and you learn a lot about writing. Also, you get to see The Lion King on Broadway.",
    "Professor Paul is the best. We explored the myth-making process behind Disney and the way that Disney has changed popular history and culture in America. I would definitely recommend this class. Be prepared to enjoy writing.",
    "If you like Disney and don't mind being disillusioned about the films, this is a great class. It improves your writing and introduces you to original research and how to analyze various academic writings and media. Perfect for a writing credit, useful for freshmen."
