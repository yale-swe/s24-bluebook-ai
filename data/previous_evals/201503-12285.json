    "The decision to incorporate the critical approaches curriculum with the YUAG collection, with each essay handing a specific work in the Gallery, was pivotal to this classs unique success. The theoretical readings came alive when we debated the theories in the context of artistic examples in the Gallery. I also found the (nearly) weekly writing exercises incredibly fun, and their improvement, by the end of the course, was incredibly rewarding.",
