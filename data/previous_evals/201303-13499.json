    "This class is without a doubt made by its instructor. While the core texts are the same for each section, the material that each professor chooses can really inform the rest of the class' discussions. For me, Eng 127 was not just an introduction to \"American literature,\" but also to different critical approaches, and a huge lesson in different methods of finding a path through whatever \"text\" you find in front of you--not necessarily a book. In other words, I learned how to think in a different manner and articulate my thoughts in a concise, critical way. It is paper-writing-intensive, but I was able to improve dramatically.",
    "This course was great. The readings were fantastic and eye opening and the themes discussed highly relevant. It was a good introduction into American literature and its issues. The short exercises and paper topics were also great at probing more deep thought on things discussedin class. Discussion was a little weak, but that's arbitrary. My only reservation was the amount of work - three essays plus a revision, AND an exam was a little overwhelming, and I found myself with not enough time to do justice to both the exam and the revision during the short reading period we had, so both turned out regrettably lackluster. I would suggest perhaps two essays and a revision, since a revision requires arguably just as much work as a whole new paper, and having the revision due earlier so that one can adequately prepare for the exam. Professor Cecire was great, witty and clearly intelligent, and very very well prepared. I really enjoyed everything she had to say and she illuminated the context behind the texts very well. Very attentive to needs of students, and has a lot of great advice and handouts to help, as well as many techniques to address whatever students need. She has high standards, but they are fair, and ensure you learn from the course. While I personally enjoyed the humor and snark in class, some might find it a little deflating and discouraging. You will however learn so much from her, and for that I recommend it. One of the books in this class was literally eye opening\/life-changing for me."
