   "comments": [
    "First time ever I took Intro to Macro. Aleh was an ok teacher, very funny and smart, but not a great communicator. I mainly read the textbook (by Mankiw) and it helped me a lot.",
    "If you are interested in Macroeconomics this is a good place to start. Pretty broad spectrum of material and decently challenging to stay up with.",
    "Please don't take this if you're not actually interested in economics. I took this class because I thought I should have a general knowledge of macroeconomics in order to understand the news and politics, but it was honestly so boring that I don't think I've gotten much out of it at all. But I guess you can't expect much out of a huge intro macro lecture. The midterm was almost nothing like the PSETS and I really wasn't sure how to prepare for it. The TAs are generally helpful, but I felt like I had to teach myself most of the material even though I went to every lecture and most sections. Don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "Great class if you like the material. It is what it is. Classic Yale experience that will help you understand the world in a very real and practical way. Absolutely top-notch guest speakers. Not hard if you can do math.",
    "I wouldn't suggest it.",
    "Only if they needed it. I don't think people should take it just to have taken an econ class.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to - so if you're an Econ or EPE major. End of story. Intermediate Macro is more interesting\/applicable, or so I hear",
    "I would recommend ECON116 01 only to students who have to complete this class as a requirement.",
    "Sometimes the information is not presented critically, so that's on you to really engage with the material and assess whether you buy it.",
    "Macroeconomics is an important class to take because it teaches you a lot about the economy and the world. I would recommend the course for this reason but would not recommend it for the professor or the sloppy way in which the material was taught.",
    "Boring material but necessary to be an informed person in the world. Take the class but be aware that unless you put the work in on your own time, you will not learn anything.",
    "b b b boooooorrrrrrrrrinnnnnnnnngggggg. but seriously, it was quite dull. if you don't need to take this course for your major, don't. you'll thank youself.",
    "If you are dead set on being an econ major (and I mean dead set), take it, because you have to. Otherwise, there is no reason - meaning there is no reason to tae the course, not that there is no reason to learn about macro. Save yourself the time and do some reading in your free time.",
    "An attempt to cram years worth of learning into one semester. Take it if you know what you're getting into.",
    "You're probably going to have to take this class anyway. That's sucky. The lectures are boring and very hard to pay attention to. Do the reading and make sure you fully understand the chapters and you'll be fine. Section and homework isn't worth it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to my worst enemy who I wanted to slowly bore to death over the course of 24 lectures. It was so boring. I should have just skipped every class and read the book and then shown up to take the tests and probably I'd have gotten the same grade.",
    "it's not something that you take for fun; if it's a prerequisite, take it",
    "It's a solid intro course. The subject matter is a bit dry and there is a lot of memorization of trends\/equations, but it is clear why it is necessary in order to move on to more advanced ECON classes. The textbook was extremely useful, and I would recommend this class to another student if they need it as a prerequisite for another class or for a major.",
    "If you have to\/want to take intro macro you should take it with Aleh. He is super hilarious and super chill. The midterm was much harder than expected but after a ton of people complained he made the final super easy. Lectures were kinda boring due to the subject matter but Aleh made them as engaging as possible. You learn a lot of material and definitely in a short time which is mildly challenging but also very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to most yale students (the intro macro\/micro sequence). The knowledge in this class should be required for all graduates.",
    "While an introductory macro course, Econ 116 is much more in depth and covers a slightly different array of topics than high school macro. Take it with Tsyvinski if you can. He's an extremely accomplished economist and always ties in interesting bits of research at the end of lectures to elaborate how the concepts we learn take shape in today's economy. He also gives his personal assessment of each topic discussed, explaining for why a concept does or does not hold true in the actual economy. Without Tsyvinski as professor, the material would have been much more dry and boring.",
    "It is a good class with a fairly small amount of work. I would highly recommend the optional section as it is a very good way to learn material.",
    "Go for it! A lot of material is crammed into this class, which means that the lectures are often confusing, but Aleh is a skilled professor and its an enormous class so youll definitely have friends around to help you along. As far as I know, most students take this course because its a prerequisite for something else, or because its the introduction to an important subject, and there isnt really a better alternative. I do think the subject can be a really interesting one, if macroeconomics sounds like something that might appeal to you I wish I had tried harder to really internalize the content, rather than simply relying on the generous curve.",
    "Would not recommend Intro Economics courses unless you want to major in Economics not worth it otherwise.",
    "Good course",
    "Take it if economics is your thing. If it isn't, then you'll be very bored. I wish I hadn't taken the class.",
    "ECON 116 is a huge intro macro class, so you can expect a very quick survey of macro within a large lecture system, with all its pluses and minuses. Prof. Aleh does his best with great slides and introducing current research for those actually interested in economics. On the other hand, he covers a LOT of material, so it is easy to get lost.",
    "Not as interesting as I initially thought, but Professor Tsyvinski does his best to make it interesting and fun.",
    "Take it if you need it or if you want an introduction to basic econ. Take it with Aleh. He is entertaining and will make you laugh. But beware because he cold calls a lot so try to wear dull colors so he can't call on you by the color of your shirt.",
    "Take it if Tsyvinski is teaching it. He tries to make the course as engaging as possible and brought in some really interesting guest speakers.",
    "Take it if you want macro - or a basic understanding of the economy but otherwise not really worth it - read the newspaper or watch kahn academy.",
    "The whole campus already takes it, so I don't know why i'd have to. I didn't love the class overall, but everyone whose into Econ takes it, and everyone who isn't doesn't. It's at a pretty good place in terms of enrollment, you don't need my help.",
    "It is a great couse to help you better understand global events and world news.",
    "Fine class. I basically skipped every single lecture and never went to section because it was really pretty boring. There is almost no work - just one very short problem set each week along with textbook reading, but the reading is the same as lecture so if you go to lecture theres no need to do the reading. Aleh is pretty good. Funny guy, but he is easily distracted by people sleeping\/leaving his class and he calls on people in the audience which gets very annoying after a few days. Take it if you need to, but its not anything special.",
    "It's a must-take at Yale.",
    "Not bad",
    "Pretty much what you would expect. Vast impersonal lecture, mediocre staright-from-the-textbook teaching. Try to get a good TF",
    "Tsyvinski was pretty disorganized. The workload was light, the final was easy, but the midterm was surprisingly challenging",
    "It is a very fast but manageable intro to macroeconomics. It is also very good. But is is important to stay on top of the work and the concepts so as to not lose sight of it because then it becomes really hard.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to",
    "I would recommend this class. It was very helpful.",
    "I would recommend ECON 116 to another student because I think the info is necessary to living\/working in the real world. However, I would warn them that it is very difficult and requires a lot of working on your own.",
    "Take it. Good critical thinking. You will understand the world around you much better and the workload is not that bad",
    "Into macro is a fairly standard course. It's sort of a must-take for a Yale student. I would recommend it because I believe a rudimentary understanding of economics is fundamental to being an educated person.",
    "You'll learn many different economic theories, mostly Neoclassical but some Keynsian. If you're further left (i.e. Marx), this is probably not the course for you unless you appreciate the maxim \"know thine enemy.\" That said, it's a good introduction to what I understand Economics to be at Yale, and if you're vigilant about your understanding of things, you'll fine other implicit lessons about what it means to study the discipline and what each economic models' assumptions have to say about how conservative and liberal policymakers view the world.",
    "Yes, if you ate interested in econ. It provides all the foundations.",
    "ECON 116 was okay. Aleh is hilarious, but his perspective is very conservative. I wasn't thrilled with introductory macroeconomics, but that's the nature of a broad-based survey level lecture course.",
    "Not great. Aleh rushed a lot of stuff and I had to self teach a lot.",
    "The course is a straighforward into macro course. Sensible all throughout. The instruction was great and engaging. Aleh has made intro macro as painless as possible while still keeping us asking the larger questions.",
    "A MUST-TAKE regardless of your major",
    "Econ 116 was an amazing course. It really gave a broad look at what macroeconomics is all about. We covered interesting topics from finance to the 2008 crisis. Aleh made macroeconomics seem very applicable by giving real life examples and connections to at times abstract theories and models.",
    "An interesting class that is great for general intelligence and citizenship, and not overly taxing.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who does not have to take it for their major requirements.",
    "Take it only if necessary. Moderate workload. Aleh Tsyvinski was not the best lecturer.",
    "If you want to do Econ... Otherwise take something better taught.",
    "You're going to learn a lot of information. Some of it is rather boring but its manageable.",
    "Not too much work, very few people attended lecture.",
    "I would recommend, for it covers a pretty wide range of economic subjects that could be interesting.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IF YOU SIMPLY WANT A BACKGROUND IN ECON. If you are SURE you will major in Econ, be my guest. Otherwise, try for an economic history class or something more relevant to economic policy.",
    "Hard course, yet extremely important for everyone to take! Teaches you a lot about how the world works",
    "I think that intro macro is a valuable course for anyone to take because it helps you understand how the world works better. Aleh, who taught it this semester, was really engaging and tried to make every lecture interesting. He's really busy, so he's not very open about meeting up with students outside of class, but he tries to get to know people anyway. He recognized all the students outside of class, even if he didn't know them personally. I found it very difficult to learn the material in lecture because we went through the slides so fast, but all the info is on the slides he posts, so you can just go over them after lectures. Aleh brought in a bunch of guest lecturers, and they were all really cool. Also the psets got easier as the semester went on. If I could go back and take the course again, I would go over each lecture the day after it's given. It's also totally not a big deal to miss the lectures in terms of learning the material for the exams, but if you skip the lecturers, then you miss Aleh's opinions on the material and the awesome guests.",
    "I would only take this course if you have to. Lectures are pretty boring because Professor Tsyvinski usually just reads off slides. He does bring in interesting guest lecturers, which was great. However, because we were only asked to know the course material on the midterm and the final, we didn't learn as much as we could have.",
    "I would recommend econ 116 to a student interested in studying econ at Yale. It gives a very good overview of a lot of different issues and areas that macroeconomics deals with.",
    "Good intro class. Would recommend.",
    "I enjoyed the material in 116. It's all important to know in terms of how the world works. I would try to take it with another professor other than Prof Tsyvinski because his classes were neither motivating, nor helpful. I stopped going eventually and just went to section and read the textbook--I am going to get a good grade, but I didn't like his teaching. His final was fair, midterm was hard. Great things to learn, not the greatest class experience.",
    "Take it if you have to. Not particularly enjoyable, so if you're looking to get a good background in economics just to make conversation about it\/understand world politics, then you'd probably have a better time just reading the textbook, because that's what the class mostly was.",
    "It is a pretty large lecture class.",
    "Econ 116 is definitely an introductory Macroeconomics course. Professor Tsyvinski really did an amazing job in applying the content to real-world situations, which made it enlightening and informative. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain a broader understanding of the economy and get an overview of the Economics field and major.",
    "I mean it's intro macro, so it's interesting and relevant (MUCH more so than micro so if you're not that into Econ that's not applicable I would take this because it is applicable to life - financial system, Great Depression, etc). That said, it's an intro Econ class. So there is some boring stuff.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student as a broad survey of macro models and relevant, current research.",
    "I think introductory macroeconomics is an important course to take. It is a large lecture and is not always the most interesting and it can also be difficult to focus and understand all the concepts. If you keep up with the problem sets and study ahead of time, the examinations aren't too difficult.",
    "If you are on that track, do it. Good to know",
    "Well you have to take it you're gonna be an econ major so take it, but make sure to take it with Aleh. The past professors turned the class into a clusterfuck.",
    "Its a good intro macro class, the curve isn't too hard although the final is cumulative and the syllabus is vast.",
    "I would recommend it with Aleh because he definitely tried to keep it interesting. I would recommend the course only if its necessary for your major. If not, its not worth taking such a large lecture. There are a plethora of other SO courses that are much more interesting.",
    "As a field, macro is much more loosey goosey than micro. They say that micro means taking one model and applying it to many questions. Macro is taking one question and using a ton of models to describe it. It can be frustrating to have so many different models and theories for approaching the topics, and the class feels like it jumps around a lot. By the same token, it's pretty cool to be studying a field that is still searching for empirical support for its foundational principles. If you can take it with Aleh, be sure to!",
    "It's an intro macro course.",
    "ECON 116 is the basic intro macro course. The lectures are guided by the slides that come with the book. It is relatively easy to follow. Anything missed from lecture can be made up for by reading the book. The midterm was relatively difficult but the final was much easier. The Psets varied in length and difficulty, but they weren't especially time consuming.",
    "If you are planning to major in economics, don't take this class. Try the intro to macroeconomics seminar instead. I think this class does not give you a solid foundation for economics as a major. However, if you want to take this class to fulfill your distributional requirement or just to get a general idea of what macroecon is, it is worth it. Because it gives you a broad overview of the subject and the curve of the lecture in not too bad compared to the seminar.",
    "It gets very difficult to pay attention after a while. During every lecture, the material is very dense and the teaching style is monotonous. Aleh is very competent in the macroeconomic field and brings in great guest speakers. Unfortunately, the lectures were very long and dense with material. The topics are very interesting at times. Macroeconomics is overall a very important field to be knowledgeable in.",
    "Econ 116 was not the most interesting or fulfilling class I've taken. I found it frustrating that we have to learn about models that don't actually describe how economies work and are outdated. The professor did a good job of bringing in guest speakers and spending lecture time on current topics to keep the course relevant though.",
    "Survey econ course, if you want to do well find a good TA and read the book",
    "A good introductory class that is not too difficult if one stays on top of things. Prof. Tsyvinski adds a level of humor that makes the class far more enjoyable. If you have to take intro macro, do it with Prof. Tsyvinski.",
    "Yes I recommend this class to anyone who might be an Econ major or wants to have a better understanding of the monetary and fiscal policy decisions that effect us everyday.",
    "Most people take this class because they have to, so it really does not matter whether I recommend it or not (although if you want an easy credit\/d class, this is a good choice). The professor is amazing and hilarious, he really makes boring material tolerable and brings in a lot of guest speakers\/real-world examples. The PSET's are fairly short and manageable (1-2 hours a PSET max) and the TA\"s make themselves very available if you want help. Exams vary and the curve can be brutal at times, so be aware of that.",
    "I sincerely recommend not to take ECON 116 with Prof. Tsyvinski. This is one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. Tsyvinski spent a lot of time trying to be funny and cold call people in lectures. To be honest, I feel he is not a very humorous person, and his jokes only got me distracted. I understand he wanted to get people involved in class, but spending time cold calling in a 300+ people lecture just does not work. It would be better if he can focus on course materials and try to make the lecture content interesting. He followed Mankiw's book closely and you can just read the textbook. For exams, he told us that 25% would be extra-reading and current research, but it turned out that only 1-2 problem in the midterm questions were research. (I think he just tried to motivate people to read extra materials.) The midterm questions are not very clearly stated and I spent a lot of time just trying to figure out what he is really asking. Overall speaking, I think macroeconomics materials are very interesting, and it would be great to take it with another professor.",
    "It provides an overall depiction of macroeconomics. I would absolutely recommend the class to another student because the class depicts the interaction between firms, households, and governments in the world economy and an understanding of this interaction is vital for many different field.",
    "A broad intro to macroeconomics an what is wrong with the current models.",
    "Definitely.",
    "The course covers a lot of material very quickly. In order to do well, you have to be willing to put in work outside of the syllabus in order to understand the material well.",
    "Quite honestly, I prefer micro to macro so my answer might be biased. I found macro to be dry, and the models to be too simplistic. That being said, the class is a good introduction to basic macro principles--so that when you're listening to the news you can actually understand what is being said about the US economy!",
    "Long in terms of lectures yet interesting",
    "Take it because it's a prerequisite for pretty much everything but know that it is not easy, Intro Micro is WAY easier and has a way better teacher and way better professors. Make sure to do the reading or read over the slides and take notes (if you can't pay attention in lecture, which is probably going to happen). And spend the first couple of weeks going to different TF sections to find the best one - TFs were overall pretty bad but there were one or two who were absolutely fantastic. Find them early and go to their sections, whether or not you get placed into them (section was optional this year). Aleh takes into account student feedback which is super useful because the midterm was awful and the final was not nearly as awful, however he's not as great at teaching as everyone says he is in other reviews. I went in thinking he'd be amazing but he really was not. Overall my friends and I had to teach ourselves most of the material.",
    "I'm not sure if there are any good Intro Macro classes at Yale; but if you want to gain a solid foundations in the field, don't take this class with Prof. Tvyvinsky. It is one of the largest lectures at Yale (over 300 students this semester). Moreover, it is tailored to the student who is not at Yale to actually learn, but who wants simply to jump through the hoops and go on to get a job on Wall Street. The material is not taught well, and too much of each class is spent cold calling on students who are not paying attention, or going over material that is not appropriate for the scope of the class (new and unpolished research that attempts to counter all of the classical principles, more appropriate for a higher level class) - thus, I left this course lacking a true foundation in macroeconomics. And since no one really is learning the material, and everyone knows that this is the case, the class is treated like a joke.",
    "This is a course I would not recommend. I do not think that it gives an overall understanding and narrative for what macroeconomics means",
    "Aleh may be very esteemed in his field of research, but he is a poor lecturer. He essentially read directly from online slides provided by the textbook's company. He also emailed the class his lecture before each class, so there's no incentive to attend. Basically, it is most important to have a good TA for your section.",
    "Very large class with lots and lots of memorization. All of the material was covered in the book, so buy that and read it. Aleh is a funny guy, but added very little to the material. Some of his case studies and examples were interesting though. I would probably not recommend this course.",
    "Econ was an excellent intro to Macro, I learned a lot and absolutely loved the guest lectures. Aleh is very knowledgeable about macro, and is often humorous. He usually just reads straight off the power points though, and many students found him unhelpful. Overall, great intro course, would recommend even if you aren't an econ or poli sci major.",
    "ECON 116 teaches the fundamentals of macroeconomics (GDP, inflation, the Solow Growth model, the Keynesian cross, aggregate demand and supply, etc). I would definitely recommend this course, since it is so important to future study in the field.",
    "Yes because I think it is very informative on how the economy works.",
    "Aleh is a great lecturer and professor, but I didn't like the way the course was handled logistically. The exams are easy but there's a preset curve, so a silly mistake on even one question in an exam can affect your grade for the course. There's a minimal workload, but it's very stressful around exam time. Cr\/D\/F it if you're not an econ major and just want to learn about macro.",
    "I do recommend this class. I think it is important for everyone to know the basics of our country's economy and how it works, even if you aren't planning to continue down the path of economics.",
    "Take it and make sure to read the textbook!! Recommend to majors in any field, economics is essential"
