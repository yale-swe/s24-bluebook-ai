   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, if you like Lorca",
    "It's all about Lorca, nothing surprising. There's 3 short papers and a final long paper. All of the topics are on the syllabus, so you can think about them far in advance. There was a midterm and a poem recital in class, plus we watched a couple movies. It's a lot of reading to stay up on, but it's fun reading. No final exam either. I'd recommend it, but I just took it for my major.",
    "A not-too-work-intensive class with some of the best works from one of the greatest writers in world literature.",
    "I recommend it if you have a strong interest in Lorca and are good are writing papers in Spanish.",
    "Take if you like Lorca!",
    "It's a class about Lorca's works, and its very interesting. Unfortunately, it is a LOT of work to keep up with the readings. And almost everyone in the class has theatre experience, so keep that in mind if you don't. Your essays will be compared to those of people who have been analyzing this stuff for years. Some of them have even performed the stuff that I'm trying to understand.I would really recommend taking it if you're interested in the material, but I would recommend taking it credit\/D.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who likes Lorca's work. Profesora Valis isnt too difficult, and there are only three small papers and the final paper. Valis is passionate and class is interesting!",
    "The class gives a wonderful and significant introduction to the poetic and dramatic works of Lorca. I would absolutely recommend this class to any student interested in drama or poetry who has studied enough Spanish to be able to take the class. Profesora Valis is wonderful and I would urge anyone who has a chance to take a class with her to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This was one of my favorite classes I've taken so far at Yale. Throughout the semester the class reads Lorca's most popular plays and tons of his poetry. Also, Prof Valis includes scholarly articles about Lorca's work and poems about Lorca or inspired by Lorca's style in the course packet. After reading, we discussed everything in detail and completing the few short writing assignments and the final paper was a pleasure. As part of the participation grade, each student memorized, recited, and commented on a poem for the class, and that was my favorit assignment. I don't think I'll ever forget the poem Ichose and it's wonderful to know that I'll always have it with me.",
    "This class explores Lorca's literature, themes, passions, and legacy. The reading is varied, from Lorca's early poetry tohis great surrealist plays. Noel Valis has an wonderful love and connection to the topics in the class, and really encourages discussion of the deep themes in Lorca's work. It is a great class that gives you the opportunity to read a large amount of the work of the great Spainsh playwright. If you are interested in Lorca's poetry and plays, I would definitely recommend this class."
