    "I would recommend it.",
    "This Spanish course was great and I would definitely recommend taking this professor's course. Professor Ramos-Ruano was apassionate, though at times somewhat crazy, instructor who taught the course well and made the class more interesting than honestly I thought a Spanish course could be. She also seemed to genuinely cares about how students did in the class, which created a very good class environment.",
    "I would say that the course covers a lot of material over a short period of time, but the textbook and instructor make it doable and enjoyable. I'd recommend the class to another student because I feel more confident in my Spanish now than I did at the beginning of the semester."
