    "1) knowledge of the historical trends in the discipline 2) awareness of contemporary debates within the literature and areas for future research 3) methodological approaches of ethnobotanical research and available resources 4) ethnic dilemmas of scientific research on LEK (and research in general in marginalized communities) and how ethnobotanists are engaged in these wider disciplinary issues (and how we should be too!)",
    "I learned so much about ethnobotany and associated topics, along with the ethics and practice of ethnobotanical research.",
    "I learned how researchers across the discipline of ethnobotany elucidate the relationships between people and plants.",
    "This course taught us how to study, but also think critically about the way we study the relationships between people and plants. We learned about different communities and cultures and the way they interact with plants across time and space. But we also learned what it is like to be an ethical ethnobotanist."

    "Extremely well. I was not entirely sure what the course would look like when I initially signed up for it--I was unaware how much pure botany would be involved--but I am very happy with Ina's structure and layout and see this course as foundational to my research.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes, and the lectures and discussions were perfectly in line with what I hoped to learn from this course.",
    "I expected more time to be spent on concepts in class",
    "It was well aligned! I took this class out of curiosity and interest, and it was always illuminating and never failed to spark thought-provoking discourse.",
    "The critical thinking skills we learned in this class exceeded my expectations in a good way. I was pleasantly surprised to find the class simultaneously learning about a field while also examining the ethics of the field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Ina is such an incredibly passionate and dedicated researcher and educator. Her research and ethnical questions are thought-provoking and difficult to answer--a sign of their significance and our need to engage with these issues more regularly as academics. The readings complement the lectures but are not redundant and really gave a well-rounded representation of the field. I also really appreciated the lecture\/discussion format of each class and the fact that we always had more than an hour to discuss all the readings, the lecture material, as well as related questions\/experiences from the students. The trip to the NY Botanical Garden was also a wonderful component of the class. In addition to getting a better sense of the work of botanical research, I also learned a lot about online herbaria resources for research. Weaknesses - The fact that Ina does not teach an Ethnobotany 2 course. I also would have liked more time to explore NYBG during our field trip, but this might be a logistical impossibility.",
    "Strengths: -reading assignments and leading discussions were the perfect amount of work and preparation for class discussions -I loved that the class was a mixture of lecture and discussion, and that it left me with more questions than answers (in a good way) -Ina is fabulous and brings such a wealth of knowledge to the course -the social science side of ethnobotany was a great compliment to the very natural sciences- heavy curriculum at FES Weaknesses: -none",
    "Strengths - Participating in class discussions was a good way to learn how to respond during group discussions, sharing of real-world experience of projects related to Ethnobotany was useful Weaknesses - Could have ensured that readings were more linked to class topics and assigned small assignments to ensure that key concepts were clear, may have been useful to have a few assignments during the term",
    "Ina's lectures were very well-crafted and delivered. I so enjoyed learning from her work, as well as her analyses of the discipline. The guest lecture from the researcher from the NYBG focusing on the Amazon was less fruitful. His approach was more indicative of past approaches to ethnobotany and he failed to facilitate engaging dialogue with the class. He talked \"at\" us more than \"with\" us. I would consider replacing that guest lecture with someone else (or another lecture from Ina) next time the class is offered.",
    "Ina Vandebroek does really cool research and it would have been cool to interact more with her research in a hands-on way somehow. However she is based in NYC which makes that challenging. Ina brought in some really cool female guest speakers who shared their research with us. It was awesome to learn about the work of folks that we might not have heard about otherwise. Ina emphasizes working on the real-world application of ethnobotany work which is really great. For example, she works with medical practitioners to help them understand how immigrants in NYC use plant-based home remedies. I really enjoyed that lecture and I think it would be valuable for the course to feature more applied work in that vein."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course! The readings and workload are very reasonable and you come away with a strong foundation of the field. I would argue this should be a \"required\" course for anyone interested in environmental management in the broadest sense.",
    "I would recommend taking it!",
    "It's useful to do the assigned readings",
    "This is a thought-provoking course, taught by a particularly insightful, engaging, and knowledgable researcher. It's a great opportunity to learn more about how the field of ethnobotany approaches environmental queries.",
    "I enjoyed this course and found it to be a valuable complement to the other offerings at FES. This course analyzes assumptions we make about people's relationship to plants and by extension, the earth. I find that other classes are lacking in critical analysis of these assumptions."
