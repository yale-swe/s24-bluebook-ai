    "The class with Richard Lalli was a breeze and was very informative, yet interesting. It did not ever feel too boring because of Lalli's charisma and ability to keep things light.",
    "A good intro to music theory, but you might want to take 223 if you've had some theory before.",
    "Fun class, fairly easy, but you still feel like you learn a lot.",
    "If you want to understand the basics of music theory and structure, this is a must. I played an instrument for a long time before this course, but had never payed much attention to any theory, and stopped playing much in college. This course not only opened up the world of real musical structure, but also got me so enthusiastic that I started playing the piano again. Professor Lalli has a contagious enthusiasm and quirky humor that can get anyone excited. There were kids in the class who clearly began simply taking the course for credit and by the end seemed to genuinely love what we were doing. Do it.",
    "Only if you have previous music experience, otherwise, wouldn't suggest it. Take Listening to Music or something"
