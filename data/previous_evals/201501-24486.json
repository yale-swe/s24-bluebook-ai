    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. I wish the entire student body was required to take it, as reproduction may not seem relevant to everyone but it is -- whether you're a male or a female, whether you want kids or you don't, whether you're going into politics or medicine or neither. Prof. Almeling is so passionate about the subject, which reflects in the care she has put into the syllabus and in the deliberate way she structures each class. While she has high expectations, the readings are all so great that you'll be happy to try and produce your best quality work. This class absolutely changed the way I think about reproduction and how I look at the world.",
    "Take this class! It's a typical seminar structure with weekly reading responses and discussion centered on readings. You also have a research paper proposal and presentation, both of which are not stressful and really help with the final paper. The class is incredibly interesting and is a writing credit as well, which means your responses will be evaluated. But you also learn to write more concisely, which is strange to focus on in a junior seminar, but actually very helpful.",
    "I would highly recommend SOCY 390 to another student.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The readings are very interesting and thought-provoking. The format spreads the workload throughout the semester, making it manageable. Great for everyone, not just sociology majors.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Take it if you're a sociology major. Take if it you're WGSS. Take it if you think you know a lot about the topic, or if you know nothing and want a place to start. Do not take it if you're not comfortable talking in class. Do not take it if you don't enjoy reading interviews, ethnographies, and primary-source material. Do not take it if you can't handle a significant amount of reading each week. Otherwise, I recommend this class highly. Take it if you get the chance.",
    "This is a great class that anyone remotely interested in reproduction should take (and everyone should be interested in reproduction!). It is not a class about policy, as the name might imply. Rather it is a sociological look at many of the aspects involved in human reproduction. It makes you think about reproduction and society completely differently. And many of the concepts learned are applicable to other fields as well, not just reproduction. I've never taken a sociology course and really really enjoyed this one! The course load is manageable and most of the readings are pretty interesting. Prof Almeling is very organized and knowledgeable."
