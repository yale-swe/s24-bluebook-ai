    "For me, it was a breath of fresh air - an amazing opportunity to read meaningful literature you've probably never heard of. Professor Phillips is challenging but you will learn a lot from him, and the discussions were always compelling and felt extremely relevant.",
    "A truly interesting English class for non-English majors. The class reads some incredible contemporary works, but the discussion is both historical and literary. Professor Phillips is a great seminar moderator and the discussions were always interesting. I definitely recommend the class!",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. Prof. Phillips is a great professor. He is incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, and enthusiastic, and he does a brilliant job running discussion. This is a great, very informative, very interesting course. The emphasis on historical context is refreshing and interesting, and Prof. Phillips is incredibly knowledgeable and does a fantastic job running discussion. The book list and movies are not the normal ones you would read in an English class and are all thought-provoking, and most are enjoyable.",
    "If you can take a seminar with Caryl Phillips, do it. He is an excellent and intelligent discussion leader, and his unique understanding of British history made this class. This has been my favorite English seminar of my seven semesters at Yale.The class is a really fantastic sampling of works in British fiction from the 1950s through today.Some of the early works were somewhat less than stunning, but by the end of the course I completely understood why they were there: to give us a really strong sociopolitical\/cultural understanding of the broad social movements of contemporary Britain. I learned much more--and had much more to learn--about British attitudes about the fall of empire and cultural progress than I had anticipated. And some of the books we read were absolutely lovely--Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit and The Remains of the Day are now two of my favorite books of all time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Caryl Phillips is not to be missed, and it's really interesting to read novels that are more modern and topical than those in many English courses offered at Yale. You get a survey of literature in post-WWII England, looking largely at the experience of the working class and various minorities (gays, lesbians, immigrants). You spend a fair amount of time in class discussing the historical background for the novels, and it definitely gives you a different perspective to analyze them in context.The one class a week format works out well; you discuss one novel (or play or movie) per week, and you don't really have to worry about it again until the next weekend.Be organized enough to get your final paper started early--your grade is pretty much based on that and class participation. And he'll notice if you don't participate.",
    "YES YES YES TAKE IT. This has been my favorite seminar thus far at Yale, and I only mourn that I did not discover Caz earlier than the fall of my senior year. This class has been an education not just in Contemporary British Fiction, but in how classes SHOULD be taught at Yale and in how to treat others with respect both intellectually and personally. That aside, the class syllabus is both interesting and enlightening and lends itself to intelligent literary and political discussion in many areas. If you don't take this class, you're making a mistake. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
