    "I not only improved in my ability to speak and write German, but I also learned awesome information on how the German language came to be what it is today. The developments that have come about so far to make German what it is are super interesting, and it makes learning the language a lot cooler when you know why it actually looks and sounds the way it does.",
    "A great overview of the history of the German language- something we don't study about sufficiently.",
    "I gained an understanding of the historical development of the language, specifically the types of forces that influenced the spread and evolution of the language. I learned how to contextualize that history within its contemporary form and how that form reflects particular components of German culture. I also came to understand the ways in which dialects play into that history and their contemporary role in German society.",
    "I learned more about how the German language has evolved from its origins, and how the language differs across the German-speaking regions.",
    "I gained an interesting linguistic perspective of German by looking deeper into the history of both the language and the development of German speaking communities."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly I didnt have any weaknesses. It was super fun and I enjoyed it every day. The dialect project at the end was also very fun and taught me things about German that I had never encountered before.",
    "The design of the course was very well-suited to teaching the subject material. I really enjoyed the structure of the seminar but mixed with lecturing, it made for a multifaceted and effective learning environment. The only aspect that could be construed as a weakness would be the sheer quantity of small assignments. At any given moment throughout the semester, I felt as though I had at least three assignments that I had to keep in mind for the class. The individual assignments themselves amounted to a completely normal and expected amount of work, but having to keep track of all of these different moving parts at once was in itself a lot of work.",
    "Enjoyed analyzing the evolution of the German language through texts and other mediums. The work on dialects and German-speaking communities outside of the traditional German area was fascinating.",
    "Comfortable, collaborative atmosphere of working closely with other students"

    "If you want to continue taking German, take any class that Theresa teaches. Even if you aren't thrilled about the topic, she will make the class great. The first half of the class, the readings are much more challenging and therefore it's harder to participate in discussions, if you aren't a heritage or very experienced speaker, but Theresa will make you feel comfortable no matter what level you are at.",
    "If you are proficient enough in German to take this course, absolutely do it. It is a blast and you will improve rapidly in your German.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, as its subject matter is crucial for anyone seeking to develop a more complete understanding of the German language, culture, and society. The course is taught in a way that is very effective in achieving those ends, and Theresa is an absolutely fantastic instructor!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if it were to be offered again, as it was both a great way to learn more about the history of the German language and to improve my German skills.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in improving your German and learning about the development of German through time and various modern German dialects"
