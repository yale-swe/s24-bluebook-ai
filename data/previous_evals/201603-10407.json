    "I feel like I learned basic skills but at times I was lost as to what was required of me in the class.",

    "I learned a huge amount about screenwriting, directing actors and film as a storytelling medium.",
    "Professor Roemer honed our skills not in technique, but in thought. The way in which we approach a script or a scene was not evaluated on its crispness nor its production value, but its thought. With this, he helped build a unique perspective on the idea of film and changed the way I look at dialogue forever."

   "comments": [
    "It's pretty structure-less, but that's because professor Roemer cares about one thing: shoot or write something each weekend. That's it. You do that every weekend, you get incredibly good feedback on it every week--that's all there is to it. I thought that was amazing, and was really glad it forced me to write or shoot every week.",
    "The course was incredibly engaging and involved a lot of creative work outside of class. There were no major weaknesses.",
    "Professor Roemer doesn't shy away from the unorthodox idea and often would put students in uncomfortable positions, but often in a good way. Sometimes not, and if he could create a platform (maybe an office hours?) for the students, I think it would help.",
    "Strengths: you get to make a scene\/short film each week. Weaknesses: critiques can be unbearably long.",
    "Amazing course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, without a doubt. If you want to make something every week, then do it. If you want to get great feedback from a filmmaker who worked in the big leagues, then do it. Absolutely awesome class. Professor Roemer rambles sometimes, but it usually leads to pretty funny\/insightful places.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in filmmaking or storytelling. It is not very focused on the technical aspect of filmmaking however, so anyone looking to develop their technical skills first and foremost might not benefit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in film making. It's extremely interesting, and you'll learn a huge amount about the writing process.",
    "If you ever had an interest in film, but never got truly involved, this would be a great way to begin.",
    "OK, so here is what you need to know if you take this class with Prof. Roemer. You have to make a short film each week. You will have to do this and will receive little to no instruction from Prof. Roemer. The first week he gives you a brief prompt and sends you off on your way, with pretty much no other guidelines about how to write\/shoot scenes or format scripts or set up lighting, which gives you a lot of freedom. However, if you're new to this, it can also feel overwhelming or stressful. It definitely can be, but it also instills a lot of independence in you, which is something you need if you truly want to be a director someday. Huge down side (if you have Prof. Roemer) is that critiques are long and winding, and once he spent an hour giving me feedback for my 3-minute short film. So this class requires patience. I think one great thing about this class is that you will truly learn if you love this or not. If writing and directing isn't for you, critiques will feel like slow death and the lack of structure will be terrible. But, if you love making films, then you will truly love this class. Loved it and gained a lot of confidence in my ability!",
    "I didn't produce anything that I would use again or show anyone, but the skills and way I approach my writing is completely different because of this class."
