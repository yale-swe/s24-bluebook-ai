    "It was a good experience, not an outrageous amount of work, though some weeks can get quite heavy. Our group was very self-directed, which I usually really appreciated, as some other capstones were more like seminars.Group dynamics are HUGELY important, and we got very lucky.Use google docs. And ensure everyone finds a way to plug in.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best classroom experiences I have engaged in here. A big part of that depended on the Professor, my classmates, and the material with which we engaged over the semester. Really take time to bond and get along with your classmates. It makes the work outside of seminar meeting time highly enjoyable.",
    "If you're a global affairs major, you have to do a capstone project. I would recommend choosing a topic that you're interested in but is a little bit different from other things you've studied in your global affairs classes, because this class is a great opportunity to delve deep into something new and applied.",
    "Overall good experience. Probably realistic of a real work experience. Depends on the capstone group. Ours was good. However at certain periods, our advisor seemed very disengaged from the project at large. Took long time to ever give us feedback, and was obvious did not read all of our report for feedback sessions (tracked by Google Docs)",
    "I think Global Affairs needs to improve the capstone experience."
