    "Yes",
    "Yes, especially with Kathleen! She is engaging and funny and the class had a blast and learned more Italian than I expected out of a semester. It was engaging. One piece of feedback: more grade transparency. I didnt know how I was doing in participation, for example, until I asked.",
    "Yes! You will learn a lot in just a semester, and if you are lucky enough to have professor Egan, she will do a great job making the material feel approachable.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student who wishes to learn Italian."
