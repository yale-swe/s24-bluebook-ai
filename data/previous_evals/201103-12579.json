   "comments": [
    "The philosophy itself can be a little dull, and I think enjoyment of the class depends on your instructor. It's difficult to fully engage, since it's everyone's first introduction to philosophy, which is a very different discipline with its own set of rules.",
    "Okay, here is the thing: I don't care if you need to start throwing elbows or whatever - GET ANDREW MARCH.He isn't a great teacher - He is the best teacher (BY FAR) that I have ever had for any class. Brilliant doesn't even remotely describe him.The class is unfathomable - just get him - do it!",
    "A ton of reading, but worth doing anyway - it gives you a nice taste of lots of philosophers.",
    "I would recommend this class as a good way to get a background in philosophy, and it is a very helpful foundation if you have any thoughts about moving onto more specific ethics\/philosophy courses. The most valuable skill you take away from Directed Studies philosophy is the ability to break down and analyze an argument, which I find very helpful outside of philosophy as well.",
    "I would recommend it to other students because I believe everyone should have a decent understanding of the path through which mankind travelled to reach the level of civilization today. And this course can provide a neat beginning to this intellectual journey.",
    "Solid investigation into the foundations of western philosophical thought. Good critical thinking practice.",
    "Everyone should study some philosophy in college if only to practice forming and defending opinions, so if you don't mind spending an inordinate amount of time reading you might as well take DS philosophy. The readings are smaller than HP and Lit but much denser. Whether or not you will find the readings interesting is not something I can answer for you.",
    "If you do your readings and interact with it well before class, you can raly benefit a lot from the seminars. It is good.",
    "I would recommend this course very highly to anyone. Philosophy was amazing. Philosophy is an interactive section environment that requires a higher level of thought.",
    "DS Philosophy was fantastic, by far my favorite class of the semester. Professor March does a great job of keeping the class engaged, as he integrates ancient Greek philosophy into a modern context. There is a lot of dense reading, but the lectures are extremely helpful with understanding each work as the professors outline the argument step by step. I highly recommend taking a class with Professor March.",
    "Professor March is brilliant and has a great sense of humor. Make sure to have prepared the assigned readings for the week before each section meeting. He leads very intense discussion in class that engage with the texts in the assigned readings, as well as other readings in DS Philosophy and philosophical concepts.",
    "It's difficult, but worth it. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Andrew March is a boss.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This course is a very strong foundation for the study of Philosophy. The workload is sometimes intimidating, but the readings are extremely interesting. Also, the small size of the sections allows you to interact with professors and fellow students, thus engagingin really thought-provoking discussions.",
    "Like any other DS track, you learn a lot, but it's a lot of work. It's not really clear if what you learn is worth the work you have to put in though. It's a great overview of Western philosophy, but it's a lot to do in a year."
