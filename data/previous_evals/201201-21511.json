    "French 120 is an excellent course for either those who want a good grasp of the french language or those who intend to become fluent in it.",
    "Great course! Take it! It's well-paced and instructors are very understanding and personable.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend French 120 but only if the student is truly invested in learning the language because otherwise you will fall behind on the work."
