   "comments": [
    "Take this course. If you have the opportunity to, take this course. Y'know when people talk about \"that course in college\" that \"changed the way you see the world\"? That's this course. Professor Maralani is incredible--incredible!--and genuinely cares about her students and take the time to try and get to know them. The class itself got me to totally think about inequality in a new way, really got me to appreciate how multi-faceted and complex the \"tangle\" of inequality truly is. Yes, the class is a lot of work, and you're not going to get much out of it if you don't do the readings. But I guarantee that the work is definitely worth what you get out.",
    "Yes, good class that will challenge you. If you are not a sociology major (or competent in the type of readings), take a look at the syllabus before taking it -- I felt like I couldn't' fully engage in material sometimes.",
    "Wonderful course. I 100% recommend it. Professor Maralani is a dream. You learn so so much, and the syllabus is excellent. I took it credit\/d as a second semester senior, but this course is great for setting up a potential thesis project. There is a lot of work, but the work is pretty creative and fun.",
    "This class will likely be one of the most thought provoking you'll take at Yale, and is led by the incredibly intelligent and supportive Professor Maralani. If you're looking at this eval, you're interested in questions of inequality, justice, and fairness in American society. Take the class! Just do it! The workload is manageable, the readings carefully chosen, and the assignments valuable. Sign up!!!!",
    "Yes. The course is hard work, but it deals with all of the important questions in inequality and it is really fun and interesting.",
    "Yes, take this course! It changed my paradigms of education, race, and systemized inequality.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to a Yale student. It's well taught, professor Maralani is an incredible teacher, youlearn a lot about inequality, and you learn how to discuss these issues.",
    "I would definitely recomend 314 to anyone who gets in! it's a lot of reading, you should hard on the essays (they are called reading responses, but you iwll do WAY better on them if you think of them as short essays in which you should have a clear thesis that you defend using the evidence from the readings--but just cite the vidence, don't say author X says this",
    "SOCY 314 is a class on the types and functions of inequality in this country to try to engage a lot of the tough and unanswered questions about what should be done to alleviate or get rid of inequality. I would recommend to this class to students interested in the subject matter and in this major, but not being from this major it was A LOT of work. Doing the readings were a must to participate and follow along in class. But I did learn a lot and enjoyed the class overall.",
    "Inequality is a great seminar - really interesting and relatable readings, awesome professor (seriously, Professor Maralani is so great), and not too much work. Our class this semester was much larger than the seminar usually is, but it was still a great experience.",
    "If you are able to, absolutely take Inequality in America. It's hands-down my favorite class I've taken at Yale. It's an overview of maybe a dozen different topics in inequality; so we'd spend one week on neighborhood inequality, one week on education, another on health, etc. It was a really effective way to learn about the topics; each week we read around 100 pages of reading (which was challenging, but worth it, and definitely need to do the reading to be in class), and then did reading responses each week. The final project was a lit review, which was also really challenging and a big project, but is a helpful and relevant way to wrap up the class. Even if the material weren't incredibly interesting, I'd take Inequality just for Professor Maralani, who is extremely smart and caring, and leads an intense but really great class. She's amazing, and the topics we cover are so important - I learned a ton in this class, and would absolutely recommend it.",
    "A good coverage of the theoretical aspects of inequality followed by an evaluation of a range of policies and their implications. Would recommend this for any sociology major and those interested in inequality in general.",
    "I had not taken a sociology class, but want(ed) to understand more about different loci of inequality in this country. I was challenged in a really exciting and productive way, and feel very grateful for it. It's a fantastic class, especially if you are in a place where you can be diligent and thoughtful about reading and preparing for class. You absolutely will become a better thinker, reader of sociology, reader of the news etc.",
    "Amazing experience. Professor Maralani was an incredible professor and the syllabus was very comprehensive and carefully put together. A lot of reading, but there was a clear point to each assigned article\/book. The short essays and lit review were great writing exercises, both for clarifying my thoughts and improving my communication skills. There was never enough time for conversation during class - 2 hours seemed so short! Really enjoyed continuing the discussions over lunch with Vida\/other students as well as office hours.",
    "This is the kind of class that everyone should take at Yale. It is truly one of those life-changing courses, and it has completely altered the way I approach my academic career. This is a difficult class for various reasons--Professor Maralani expects a lot from students, which means a lot of difficult reading, writing and thinking--but it is also one of the most rewarding! This class is worth putting in the effort, but only take it if you are willing to do the work; you don't want to waste this kind of opportunity. Highly, highly recommended!",
    "An amazing course that I recommend to anyone who wants to work in social policy, research or even writing. This course really helps you get a comprehensive understanding of how inequalities affect Americans today. While most people will come in with knowledge or even expertise on one sector of inequalities, you will leave the class knowing how they intersect in the lives of so many people. Professor Maralani is a great professor and leader of discussion, so I advise anyone to take advantage of the chance to interact with her and learn with her in a seminar fashion. She definitely cares about the various perspectives of her students, which is necessary for a class like this that depends on different understandings of the American lifestyle and issues in our society. I would most definitely recommend this to another student because they will have the chance to understand this nation and its people through an important new lens and have the benefit of improving their writing skills. Lastly, if you are especially interested in research, I suggest you take this class because the large literature review assignment at the end of the course gives you a chance to dive deep into a research topic related to inequality that may form over time while learning from the class.",
    "Yes, just yes. Sit down and learn. Vital issues and discussions regardless of your major."
