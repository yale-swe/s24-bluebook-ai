   "comments": [
    "good",
    "Time consuming",
    "I am learning a lot from this course but the homework assignments are extremely time consuming. I certainly learn the material through doing them, but this could be achieved with more targeted assignments.",
    "This is a great course, I really appreciate all of the detail that is provided in the lecture notes, which I consider extremely straight forward in comparison to other biostats courses taught here.",
    "This course is very useful and interesting.",
    "This course was excellent. The lectures were clear, well organized, logical, and useful. The lecture slides from this class will be an excellent resource for me in the future. The text book selected for this class was also an excellent choice. I appreciated that the lectures and the text readings coincided.",
    "Strengths: Material is goodWeaknesses: too much workload",
    "It's a good course. I learned a lot.",
    "The slides in this class are very good, but the lecture is way too long and hard to stay engaged in because everything is on the slides and they are basically just read to us. The homework is way too long and as such loses its value, you are not trying to learn the material but get through it as quickly as possible because the problem sets take between 20-25 hours to complete.",
    "excellent",
    "Nice thorough overview of survival analysis though some was more theoretical than I needed or would have liked. Rather than focusing on deriving equations I would have preferred more applied examples. Home works were extremely long. Final was very fair.",
    "This course, and its companion half-credit course, are extremely poorly designed. Conceptually, the class was not particularly difficult. But the work to learning ratio was extraordinarily high, and I'm not sure that I have the tools to actually apply what I learned in real-world settings. In a broader picture, I'm not sure why YSPH has these two courses or what they are trying to get out of them. It's a fast-paced cram session that gives a very basic conceptual understanding, but not much more. I know students had similar criticisms last year, and nothing really changed, which was frustrating.Pros:1) The slides are well written and present information well.2) Maria and the TA were nice.Cons:1) The lecture literally involved just reading the slides.2) The problem sets were absurdly long -- I think most of mine were>25 typed pages. They are also extremely repetitive. If I can do one log likelihood test by hand, I can do 5 of them. I spent an absurd amount of time working on them but didn't learn much.3) I feel now that I can do the tests we learned 1) by hand or 2) in SAS. But I don't want to do them by hand, and have no idea where to start in any other language or application.4) An immense amount of information (~150 slides\/week) were crammed into a very small space, leaving little time for understanding or digesting it, and not really allowing me to apply things outside of rather rigid conceptual frameworks. I could answer problem set questions from slides but I'm not sure I really could do more.5) Assignments were due on the same day of exams or right beforehand, meaning that we received no feedback and were likely to make the same mistakes on an exam that we did on the homework.6) There was no application of class information to real-world data.Suggestions:1) Condense these two classes into a single class, and don't try to do so much. Two half credit courses combined should be about the same as one class, but were actually more like 2-3 classes.2) Make lecture more useful, or vary class structure.3) Make assignments more reasonable in length and less repetitive.4) Emphasize real world applications more.5) Make code available for other languages, or discuss *how* to learn or think about the code rather than just providing samples.",
    "This was a good course, teaching necessary skills for performing a survival analysis.It would have been nice to have more time. The half semester seemed really short and very rushed to complete all lectures and assignments.It would have been nice to have talked about time-varying (not time-dependent) covariates.",
    "This course offers a thorough introduction to survival analysis. The course is well taught, and the lectures are clear and comprehensive. Homework assignments are long and sometimes tedious but do force you to review and apply key concepts.",
    "This is a great course that will give you a strong foundation in survival analysis. The workload is significant as you have very long problem sets due weekly but you will gain a lot from it.",
    "This course is more focus on application rather than theory.",
    "I think this is an excellent course. I wish we would've had shorter homeworks (even if we had more). The prof and the TF were great though.",
    "Very applied. Learned a lot.",
    "A nice course.Useful and clear.",
    "The assignments were very long, but covered appropriate material. The final did a good job of consolidating the course material as well."
