   "comments": [
    "Take the course.",
    "Definitely take this class. Lots of fun, the exams are long but you will have a great time in the course.",
    "One of the most interesting courses in the econ department. If you love thinking strategically, there couldn't be a more perfect course for you. It's all about best responses and thinking steps ahead. Some of the topics you learn you can apply to everyday life and the workload isn't too bad.",
    "This class honestly sucked. I had high hopes because past reviews of the course (which was then taught by Ben Pollak) were awesome. Barry Nalebuff successfully managed to make an interesting subject annoying to learn. If Nalebuff is teaching it, don't take it. You really won't learn much if anything at all.",
    "This is a class where a good review could have saved me. I wasn't able to save myself, but I can save you. You're going to shop this class and be blown away. Barry is charismatic, fascinating, and will draw you in with some really enticing lectures. However, BE WARNED this class slows down. You soon begin to realize that Barry is kind of a jerk. A jerk who takes perverse pleasure in calling on lost students to embarrass them in front of the class. You'll take an impossible midterm and an equally impossible final that involve trying to figure out random games with a few strategies you pick up in class. Would I recommend it? No.",
    "Don't take this course. Good at math? Waste of your life. Good at economics? Take econometrics. Bad at math? This course will be hell. Bad at economics? Why are you even considering it?",
    "Unless you are really interested in game theory, I wouldn't recommend it. The course is fine, but definitely not one that you must take. Professor Nalebuff is okay, but he cold calls in a lecture of 150 people and has you do problem sets on what you will learn rather than demonstrating what you've already learned. Also, the lectures are sometimes very dry and boring, and hard to follow at points. Maybe try it with another professor.",
    "I like Game Theory, and solving game theory problems, and thinking about game theory problems, but I didnt love this lecture. Maybe it was because it was my first of the day, but I wish there had been a clearer idea of what we were going to learn each day, and more focus on building skills, and solving the problems (what we're tested on) than various things like a full lecture about honest tea, various video clips of tv shows and other distractions. I never once went to section, that may have helped.",
    "A horribly taught class about really interesting material. Don't get me wrong, game theory is awesome, but Barry Nalebuff is awful. He cold-called several students each class, and wouldn't let them off the hook even when they got it wrong. He insulted students, and made me scared to go to class. I PURPOSELY WORE NEUTRAL COLORS EVERY MONDAY\/WEDNESDAY TO AVOID GETTING CALLED ON. Seriously. And it worked, BTW. Take it if someone else teachers it. Otherwise, you've been warned.",
    "A class for those that have already done some game theory, and that are prepared to go much more in depth, with an aloof professor. I would not recommend ECON 159 based upon my experience this semester. The course moves very fast, with difficult problem sets and exams. It was not as interactive as I expected game theory to be, and I feel that I did not learn as much as I wanted to. I would definitely recommend taking some game theory course though! If you do take this, get a good TA!!",
    "Abstract games with some math. Definitely take it, even just for fun.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The structure was terrible - assignments were given on topics that were being covered in the upcoming lecture (i.e. we had to turn the assignments in before the material was covered in class). This structure seemed to make life very difficult for the TA's who were always busy during office hours helping students complete the upcoming psets rather than helping students better understand material that had been covered in previous lectures. Moreover, the class was basically a bunch of brain teasers. I went to every class, worked hard on the psets, and I still struggle to articulate what exactly I learned. To put it best, I feel like I learned how to solve a few very specific problems rather than learning the general tools of game theory. The core problem with this course was the professor. Professor Nalebuff came across as egotistical and smug. He was quick to cold call people in class, and then he more or less made a fool of people who didn't know the answers in front of the entire class. It was not a pleasant learning environment.",
    "When Professor Nalebuff isn't plugging promotions for Honest Tea (he was a co-founder), he enjoys cold calling random students and then picking on them for the rest of the class if they can't answer his questions about the very convoluted lecture he's giving. Problem sets are a bit tricky, seeing as there isn't a good textbook (Prof Nalebuff's 'book' is a general introduction for the general public, not an academic reading), and that they are due before the lecture they are about.",
    "A warning: If it's taught by Nalebuff, do not take it - I repeat, DO NOT TAKE IT. The material itself can be interesting, but there are too many versions of this class taught in different departments for you to put yourself through this particular one.",
    "Good class, interesting concepts. Good Credit D but problem sets can be a bit annoying. Nalebuff was at his best when he told anecdotes and real world stories, thought when he was going over theory that he got too bogged down in engaging the class...",
    "ECON 159 is no cakewalk, but it the introduction to one of the most interesting subjects taught at Yale with tremendous applications to both the real world and other realms of academia. I recommend that everyone learn about game theory before they graduate.",
    "This course is meant to be an introduction to Game Theory, but it is so much more than that. What Barry said in during the first class was true: \"I want to change the way you THINK.\" To some extent, that happened. This class makes you evaluate real world situations differently on a regular basis. Very cool. I would recommend, but maybe start it off Cr\/D\/F just in case. The work and exams are very difficult.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Although I usually love Econ classes, this has been the worst experience of my Yale career. Game theory should be thought provoking and interesting, but instead it was a stressful and miserable experience. Problem sets are assigned before the material is taught so they are unnecessarily stressful. Lectures are disorganized and very confusing. Also, professor Nalebuff is extremely condescending and would often cold-call during lecture. Furthermore, you don't really end up learning much economic game theory as the professor's attempt to add real-world application to the class turned it into a class of how to solve brain teasers. Overall, this class with professor Nalebuff has been a horrific experience, and I would never recommend it to another student.",
    "No. I really hated this class and I would not recommend it to another student. Perhaps if it were taught by a different professor it would be better.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course! In fact I feel very strongly that this course is essential for a great deal of disciplines and I am so glad I took it because it is so relevant and helpful in all the things I am interested in. Plus it is just so interesting.",
    "Take it, great survey course of useful game theory topics, workload is small.",
    "NO NO NO no do not take this course! This course was terrible, probably the worst I've taken at Yale. Nalebuff is full of himself and an awful teacher. I feel bad even writing this - I tend to be really charitable in reviews - but I cannot in good conscience fail to warn people off of this course! For one, he tried to do a \"flipped classroom\" arrangement, but that only works when you have ACTUAL CONTENT TO LEARN AT HOME. He assigns his pop Game Theory book, which is NOT A TEXTBOOK. So to solve the stupid and unhelpful brain teaser-type problem sets, we ended up looking up and using other professors' materials to figure them out, and then sat in class bored as Nalebuff went over the homework for 75 minutes once we'd turned the assignment in. And of course, because we learned about the content in the homework after it was assigned and due, you couldn't apply what you learned in class to the homework either! When we did learn new material, it was incomprehensible. Nalebuff's slides were filled with mistakes, both spelling and (much more troublingly) mathematical. As somebody taking this course without a hugely quantitative background, the incomprehensibility of the algebra on the sloppy slides was a real problem. Furthermore, Professor Nalebuff was mostly rude and unhelpful. He would call on random people in class and keep hounding them when they clearly didn't know the answer. Even when people did know the answer (or thought they did), they were often hard to hear - and you'd waste time hearing wrong answers instead of Professor Nalebuff just teaching us game theory. And the experience was, I think, universally bad. I was looking for a Credit\/D intro to game theoretic principals and didn't get it, but I've also talked to friends who have taken tons of econ classes and were, on the converse, looking for a highly technical experience, and they were just as disappointed. So it's not that it's not what I was looking for - the class was just BAD. DO NOT waste a credit on this class - if you want to learn game theory, watch Ben Polak's lectures on Open Yale Courses, or take it with him if he ever teaches it again.",
    "Interesting class, unlike most courses in the econ dept.",
    "Valuable, interesting, useful material. Concepts are super applicable to real life. Hopefully it will be taught better in future years once the rough spots are worked out by Nalebuff. Take it.",
    "Good class. Nalebuff goes fast and is sometimes hard to follow but the subject material is really interesting.",
    "It's a really cool class, very interesting material. You have to do problem sets on material you will learn the next class. There is little to do to prepare for exams.",
    "lots of pretty interesting concepts and one of the best introductory level econ courses i've taken. barry is a decent prof (even though he kinda scared people off with his cold calls) and the subject matter is cool enough that it doesn't really matter.",
    "It's an enjoyable class that is not a considerable amount of work--one problem set a week, a midterm, and a final. The problem sets were challenging and enjoyable, but never took more than an hour or two. The exams were difficult but fair, as they required critical thinking to solve difficult problems. Overall, I would certainly recommend.",
    "This is the first year that Professor Nalebuff taught this class for Yale undergraduates after years of Ben Polak, and it definitely had its ups and downs. You learn very interesting, applicable material, but lecture can be hard to follow and Nalebuff can become frustrated when people have trouble following him. He will randomly call on people which can make for an uncomfortable class environment. Problem sets were reasonable although they were assigned erratically. The midterm was one of the most challenging exams I have ever taken at Yale, mainly due to time pressure, and the final was better but not by much. Yet we've been told that the class will be generously curved so that takes some of the pressure off. Nalebuff's problem-solving approach often seems to rely more on intuitive thinking than Polak's more mathy\/formulaic approach, which may be harder to grasp for some (including myself). Overall, I think this class was rough this year but has potential for improvement in future semesters.",
    "Interesting topic, but lectures are not very useful or clear. Homework was on topics we hadn't covered yet. Textbook is a nice read, but insufficient as a \"real\" textbook for the course.",
    "Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic class. You will learn a new way of reasoning and, every class, you will feel like you are learning something extraordinarily useful for the real world. Barry is a great professor and one of the most brilliant at Yale, but be forewarned that he uses a \"flipped classroom method\" whereby he assigns problems before you learn the material, and you have to work through the problems logically on your own before coming to class, where he might well cold-call you. If this sounds scary (aka if you are a practiced regurgitator of information, but not a free thinker), maybe this class isn't for you. But for everyone else, you couldn't do better than to take this class and learn applicable tools that will last you a lifetime. (This lecture, by the way, is not particularly technical or abstract-- it's all applied to sports, business, movies, politics, etc., so is very useful.) It's also a good Credit\/D\/F option, as the curve will assure that you NEVER stress about the D\/F, but some of the problem sets (which you have to attempt before formally learning the material) and exams (which are long and tricky) will be relieved of their gravity. But take the class.",
    "Game theory was a pretty do-able class especially with Barry as the teacher. Outside of the classes which at 75 minutes kinda dragged on a lot, only a few hours of work per week were required to stay up to date on the class. The material was also pretty interesting, and Barry although a little dry did a good job of presenting the material clearly. Barry is very proud of his business success and it shows, but thats ok, you can get past that. This class is worth taking, especially if you're an econ major.",
    "This was a very difficult class, be careful! It begins deceivingly easy and gets progressively harder as the semester proceeds. There are a lot of problem sets, which are usually due the day we begin covering the material necessary to complete them. The class moves quickly and it can be difficult to keep up unless you're faithfully attending section.",
    "Game Theory with Nalebuff has a lot of potential for being a great course. As Spring 2014 was his first time teaching the course, it was clear that sometimes he was unprepared for lecture and stuttered frequently. During other lectures where he prepared adequately, he was fine. The material isn't hard but it's tricky; it's very logic-based and you'll find that you have to think pretty quickly to get a hang of it. Overall I can't say I would recommend it to everyone because of its confusing nature, but if you think you can handle involved logic puzzles then I would look into taking the course.",
    "It's an interesting class that definitely changed how I think about certain things. It was a good senior spring class for me.",
    "Game theory is awesome. Barry Nalebuff is not. A different professor would be preferable, but the material is cool enough to take anyway. Just make sure you get a good section leader!",
    "Abject failure. Ben Pollak's reviews for this class are great. Sadly, Barry Nalebuff's version does not, to put it lightly, live up to the hype. Nalebuff used a 'flipped classroom' style, in which he assigned homework on a subject before teaching that subject in class - effectively requiring students to teach themselves the material. In a sense, that was good, since when he did teach he was no better. His powerpoints were unclear, sometimes to the point of incoherence, and occasionally had information that was factually (or mathematically) incorrect. He was also hostile to constructive criticism from students (after soliciting comments!). Nalebuff displayed extreme insensitivity, to the point where I (as a queer woman) sometimes felt quite uncomfortable being in class. Don't take the course with Nalebuff.",
    "Class is cool. Barry sucks. He's probably been the most annoying teacher I have had.",
    "Game Theory is useful information for everyone, so as a rule, I'd recommend learning it. Definitely take this if you're interested in the material or if it fills a requirement. If not, the difficulty of the psets probably isn't worth it.",
    "I would not recommend this course. For the amount of work I put in, I don't think the amount I got out of it was worth it.",
    "Take it with polak if you can. From his open course lectures he seems to be a great teacher.",
    "Seems like it could be good, but don't take with professor nalebluff.",
    "ECON 159 was an average course. I would not recommend ECON 159 to another student. It was Professor Nalebuff's first year teaching the course, so perhaps it will improve next year. I was excited about the course after the first few lectures during shopping period, but that excitement faded rather quickly. While the workload is very manageable, I found the to be difficult with not enough time to answer all of the questions. I think that the course would improve by having some of the material taught on the chalkboard rather than via PowerPoint, especially when solving some of the problems. I think that problem sets on a given topic should be due the class after rather than before the class during which the given topic is taught, so that we can practice applying the given topic to problems after we were taught the theory behind it. I would have preferred if there was a little more theory and a little less example. I felt that some of the topics were taught exclusively via example, which I do not think is ideal. At the end of the course, I do not think I achieved the course's goal of thinking like a game theorist.",
    "Horrible, now that nalebuff is teaching, rather than polak. Save yourself the misery and frustration. Not worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's really cool to learn all these topics and then instantly apply them in real life without even realizing it. Barry is an engaging professor, something very important in a lecture. The weekly problem sets were never too difficult (I recommend forming a study group to work on the p-sets every week) and neither exam was very hard, though the first one was too long.",
    "Game Theory is a great class to take, econ major or not. I recognized many concepts that are useful in other life situations, like how to negotiate. Being an econ major is helpful, however, to keep up with some of the concepts in the class that are assumed but may be new to non-majors. Overall, a great class with real-life applications!",
    "The curve is very generous and the material is really interesting. This course definitely trains you to think in a certain way and is definitely worth taking!",
    "This class is on par with intro micro in terms of providing you with a brand new methodology to analyze a lot of problems with. In other words, marginal utility is high with this one. Take it.",
    "No. I stopped attending lecture a quarter of the way into the semester. I was annoyed by Professor Nalebuff's method of cold-calling on students in lecture and then appearing irritated when the poor victim incorrectly answered loosely-worded questions. I was even a bit offended by his tactic one day of roping off the last rows of the Law Auditorium to force us to sit closer to the stage. We are supposed to be adults--he could have asked us nicely, as our professor. I felt that Wikipedia explained game theory concepts in clearer terms. On the other hand, the reader should also feel free to disregard my review considering I did miss most of the course. In the end-of-semester lectures I attended, Professor Nalebuff did seem nicer and more easy-going, more similar to how he was like during shopping period. So maybe he reformed half-way through and I missed the wonderful transformation. He's also an incredible game theorist, if not teacher, and a celebrity economist. Also a millionaire. So there's that.",
    "I loved the material a ton! Game theory has some really cool and interesting strategies, and I'd say it's a good logic\/reasoning\/thinking about things from someone else's viewpoint class overall. I thought Barry was okay and he tried to keep us engaged, but wasn't always the clearest professor. He gave really good examples sometimes, but also gave a couple different explanations for some strategies which wouldn't always make sense. We had a guest lecture by Florean and Ben Pollack, and it seemed like Pollack really knew how to teach the stuff, so if you can take it with Pollack, do so! If Nalebuff's teaching again, I'd say shop it and see how you like his style.",
    "Take it! It was my favorite class this semester",
    "Game theory is an interesting course with light homework. If you understand the concepts, it will be simple, otherwise it may be more difficult.",
    "My three favorite lectures from this course are as follows: 1. The guest lecture by Prof. Florian Ederer 2. The guest lecture by Prof. Ben Polak 3. The very first lecture during shopping period, before I realized what horrors, anguish, and suffering lay ahead On an average day - even on a bad day - I would say that I am a kind and forgiving person. But it's tough to find that shred of humanity when I've sat through 26 lectures in frozen fear, terrified of being called on by Professor Nalebuff and watching sadly as he verbally rips my fellow classmates to shreds. We are not superhuman, and cannot meet Barry's standards of answering within five seconds questions that 1) we've never learned about or seen before, 2) are poorly phrased, and 3) often require such mental acrobatics and meaningless math that no one could even begin to cough up an answer in the five seconds Barry allots him or her. And when you don't cough up an appropriate answer? Let the ripping begin. Barry will come after you again and again - asking increasingly complicated questions, getting frustrated with you, refusing to accept any \"I don't know\"s. I am tired of listening to Barry talk himself into such circles and tangling himself in such trivial mental math that even the brightest brains are left behind. Tired of fumbling in the dark on problem sets that always cover material that we learn in the NEXT lecture rather than the previous one. Tired of watching what should be the most fascinatingly counterintuitive and delightfully interdisciplinary subject being stomped into something so gray and dreadful. Barry is brilliant. Don't get me wrong. It shows through, in winks and flashes. But a professor's greatest contribution to the classroom should not be his mind alone, but the experience he creates for his students. And I am sorry to say - despite my usual unending optimism - that this has been the worst classroom experience I have had at Yale.",
    "Weekly problem sets, which were generally not too bad. The material is fairly interesting, but not always well taught. However, it isn't always well taught. Not too difficult or heavy course load though and very fair grade distribution. Class and lecture can get VERY boring though.",
    "I thought this was a good class to take cr\/d. It can be tough at times, but as my only econ class i took at yale i thought it was a good one.",
    "Game Theory teaches students how to think differently. Professor Nalebuff begins the course by showing that one can do well on the SAT without ever reading the test's questions. Indeed, his course focused more on practical applications than versions of the course taught by another professor. He desired to create a \"flipped classroom\" as well, at times cold-calling on students in lecture to ensure they understood the material. Professor Nalebuff encouraged active participation by rewarding correct answers with Honest Tea, artisanal socks and other prizes, which seemed to me too much of a gimmick. Note that the problem sets often required knowledge of subjects we had yet to cover in lecture. If you take the course, get to know the TF's well, who can help explain these concepts to you.",
    "most people take the class because they have to. I took it for a QR and there are WAYYYYYYY easier options ( see structures of networks) so I resented how challenging it was sometimes. However It was also a very cool class and I'm glad i took it.",
    "Definitely recommend. If you like games, take this class.",
    "It's interesting material but isn't taught in a very consistent way. I'd recommend it but with hesitation."
