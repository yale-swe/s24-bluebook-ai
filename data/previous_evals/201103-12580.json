   "comments": [
    "A series of ancient greek and roman philosophers and their main ideas and basic texts. I would recommend this class to someone who can read difficult texts quickly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The reading are definitely challenging but super rewarding and fun to talk about once they make sense.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. Having come into it frightened, I am leaving with a confidence in my ability to analyze texts of some of the greatest minds. Professor Sattler inspired me more than another professor this term and I can confidently say that I will continue my study of philosophy long after Directed Studies has ended.",
    "DS Philosophy, especially under Prof. Sattler, provided a foundation upon which greater philosophical knowledge might later be achieved. The reading load, as with any DS course, is both heavy and somewhat dense, but it is worth it. The texts which we read independently were discussed and generally hashed out over class. I would recommend this course--as well as any of the DS courses--to anybody interested in building an intense foundation for later learning within the humanities.",
    "I wouldn't recommend DS Philosophy to everyone. It's a great survey class, but some people can find the readings a bit dry.",
    "Yes. I had never studied philosophy and now I am very excited about it and feel like I have a solid basic understanding of the great classical thinkers.",
    "This was maybe the hardest of the three DS courses I took in my first semester. The readings are not easy at all, and the amount of text is, as with all DS courses, considerable. In-class discussion, though, was very fruitful in helping me to understand the key arguments of the readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend Professor Sattler's section. She's super smart and funny, but is also very blunt, which is a style I respond well to. If you say something that's wrong, she'll tell you flat out that it's wrong. But she also is very methodical and precise in explaining thekey arguments and all the steps involved in them, which comes in really handy for the exam; she takes her time and makes sure that everyone understands all the aspects of these really dense texts, and really knows what's important to talk about and what's superfluous. The class will really make you think in new and interesting ways if you put effort into it, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who enjoys taking apart the structure of arguments and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. In Prof Sattler's class, the emphasis was on this more than on the different ideas themselves."
