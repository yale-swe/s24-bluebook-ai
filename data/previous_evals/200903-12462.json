    "I believe that this class is essential to anyone who is interested in specializing in South Asian Economic History. Professor Martin will work you hard but you will get a lot in return. The class will make you make lots of presentations on large numbers of readings.",
    "Yes. It's a fair amount of work. Taking it Cr\/D is pointless, because there's a substantial amount of writing and you won't want to turn in terrible writing. But you will learn a lot, have fun discussions about the Indian economy, and possibly come away with some new friends, due to the small size of the class.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in the historical origins of the Indian economy. You will not get anything else out of it."
