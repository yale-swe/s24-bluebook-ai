    "Philosophies of time from Plato to Heidegger, with a running undercurrent of Proust. Absolutely take this course. It will change the way you think about everything, in subtle and not so subtle ways. Even if you've read some of the books on the course list, take this class so you can see how they can be synthesized with the rest of the syllabus. You will also really like Paul North."

It's the most basic element of our lives, and to spend a semester examining it from the point of view of over 2,000 years of intellectual history is a gift. Whatever my dissertation turns out to be, it will be heavily influenced by Paul North's class."
