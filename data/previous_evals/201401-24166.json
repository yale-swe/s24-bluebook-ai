   "comments": [
    "I think this class should be an elective; I haven't heard of many HCM students using SAS in the workforce, so having this class along with biostats was not only repetitive but unfortunately not pertinent to what I want to do in the future. I don't think at the graduate level we should be forced to take non-accreditation required courses; from talking to friends in other MPH programs, they do not take a similar course. It's a waste of the students and instructors' time for us to do the bare minimum to get through the class - Chen is a great professor and should have students that care about the material.",
    "This course is really not relevant to people who do not want to do research. Very repetitive of Biostats 2.",
    "good",
    "strengths: Professor Chen was very sweet and knowledgeable, and made very sincere efforts to engage students.weakness: This is a mandatory course for HPM, and I do not necessarily see the necessity of taking it. This is not any fault of the instructor, I just think our time may have been better spent in an economics or health policy class. I also did not find the lab sections to be particularly helpful or productive",
    "This class is misaligned with Stats 2. There was significant overlap with Stats and busy work which was not appreciated. Additionally, management students WILL NOT be using SAS in their professional careers. Spending hours a week on SAS really grated on the HCM cohort and some just elected to not do the homework. Learning research methods in excel or stata would be much more appropriate for policy and management. This a professional school and we should be learning skills that will serve us in our professional careers.",
    "Professor is a great guy, but the class itself is unnecessary. We already took Biostats I, we were in Biostats II at the same time, and we are all thoroughly fed up with SAS -- which none of us will ever use outside of this program.Useful understanding of different research methodologies, but not sure that merits an entire course.Workload was manageable, but some assignments were extremely ambiguous and it was difficult to get clarification from professor or TAs.",
    "This course overlaps heavily with Biostatistics and HCM students many only need to take either this course OR biostatistics. There was a lot of redundant material.A HUGE issue that should have been foreseen before the semester started is classroom capacity. If administrators knew that all health policy and management students are required to take this course, then they should have assigned classrooms that can actually accommodate all of us. There should have also been 2 lab sessions from the beginning. The computer labs at 47 College are much too small to hold all of us.",
    "This class did overlap with biostats 2 at times but I believe I left this class with a much better understanding how to apply statistical methods to public health research.",
    "I believe this class could be very helpful in providing an overview of statistic topics that may be useful (rather than take Biostats 2). I the PowerPoint presentations\/slides for both lecture and lab were more clear, better organized, easier to follow, etc it would make a huge difference. Especially for lab, because I didn't think it would help us do our homework. If lab presentations were organized like biostats labs, and HW followed the labs, it would make a huge difference.",
    "This course was difficult because the content moved faster than the content in biostats. We were learning some of the same things, but at different times.",
    "This class has too much work. Near weekly p-sets, quizzes, group project, and final project. I think the group project could function as the capstone to the course. Dr. Chen is a very nice guy. He is extremely responsive via email or will meet with you in person to discuss things you don't understand. Sometimes it takes the third or fourth time of him explaining something for it to make sense, though. His teaching and powerpoint slides, as well as the ease of navigating this course are all lacking. But, if you give 200% and work with Dr. Chen, you can get something out of it. Generally though, I think this class repeats a lot of material from Epi1 and Biostats2, so I'm not sure why it's required.",
    "I don't see the purpose of management students of taking this course AND biostats.Professor Chen is awesome but this class was focused too heavily on SAS which is essentially an outdated program not utilized or recognized by Many large firms.If this class was truly a methods class, it should be focused on providing skills with greater utility in the professional world such as data analysis (NOT coding to get data) and excel.",
    "Strength- Prof.Chen's commitmentWeakness- Too many assignments",
    "I think that this course covers important material, but I think that the structure could be improved. It was definitely hard to get thrown into regression when we hadn't even touched upon it in biostats yet. What I will say, though, is while I definitely would have said (all semester) that biostatistics taught me far more than Methods and in a more understandable way, I realized in studying for the biostats final that this was not actually the case. I felt that I was much more confident with the material that I had learned in Methods for the biostats exam.",
    "I wanted to like this class, but the other students and one of the TA's made it nearly impossible. Many of the management students had strong negative feelings for the class that were made known at every possible opportunity. As a policy student, genuinely interested in research, I would have preferred that this not be required for them. Material was interesting and necessary, in my opinion, but the delivery was at times was lacking.",
    "Strength- comprehensiveWeakness- Needs to be more relevant to healthcare management students",
    "Course could be better structured.",
    "I ended up learning a lot, but the start of the semester was a rocky start where I wasn't sure what the point was for a lot of what we were learning.",
    "- quizzes and homework are very difficult- enjoyed the group project",
    "It was difficult to follow the information as we were a few weeks behind in biostats and didn't have the statistical or SAS knowledge to complete the homework assignments.Feedback\/more time to decide on questions for the group assignment would have been nice and made it easier at the end during the data analysis stage.Lecture materials could have been more clear and concise.",
    "Strengths: Useful for students interested in survey design and regression analysisWeaknesses: The class was poorly taught",
    "although, lectures can be hard to follow because they might be a bit disoriented - after doing the homework (which is actual application), you'll better understand the method used and it will become clear in the end.the process will probably be something like this:1) 'what the hell is going on' thoughts in class2) struggle during hw3) struggle some more4) then 'aha! i've got it!' moments will follow.i can say that i've learned more in this class regarding SAS than any other i have taken in my first year so this course must be doing something right!",
    "Strengths: very responsive, friendly and helpful professor and TAs. The labs helped with accomplishing the assignments and this class complemented BIS505b really well.Weaknesses: poor logistics (space\/timing issues of course) that were beyond the professor's control but were pretty distracting at times.",
    "First of all the course started on the wrong foot because the lab was organized poorly. If 50 students are enrolled for the course, there will not be enough computers for students. So administrators and profs need to get that right.Otherwise, there was a lack of continuity in the course. It was unclear to many of my fellow colleagues the value of the material and how it was relevant to their studies, or future professions. I believe this could be remedied by a few minutes during every class touching on this topic.Finally, the slides were not comprehensive enough given the difficulty of the topic. I frequently used Dr. Ciarleglio's slides to supplement the regression analysis material.",
    "This was a required course. I would not have taken it otherwise.",
    "Weakness - Not pertinent to most student's career interests, thus the focus of the course should have been less lab based and more overarching."

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Most of us have a really hard time understanding Professor Chen's thick accent. It becomes very frustrating to even grasp the basic material simply because we don't know what he's saying. It has become a motivation to not even attend class. He is very nice, however, and I have found that it is easier to communicate with him via email when I have questions about assignments.",

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Great teacher. Hard worker. Always available outside office hours too",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0I think that Xi will become a great professor, but he still has to work on engaging a class. I also think that while he tries to explain things in simple terms, he takes a lot for granted on the part of the students. For a student who really does not get econometrics, class could be hard to follow I'm sure. I will say that I did attend class and did not usually find it difficult to follow, but I think I am in the minority.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Dr. Chen was so available to students and very passionate about the subject. He is knowledgable about research, however the issue of class lecture was troubling, both because we were in a space way too small for lab and our lecture time was cut to just over an hour per week.",

I heard that this is already going to start for next year's students, but HCM students should be able to choose either this OR biostatistics.
