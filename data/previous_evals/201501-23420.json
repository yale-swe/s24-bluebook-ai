    "Overall great class to learn about Indonesian music, culture, and society. It's fun, relaxed, and you learn so much! Highly recommend.",

    "Really cool class but not a gut. Definetely recommend for a second semester senior.",
    "Take it! It's not really that a huge gut like you would imagine, because there are weekly assignments. But it's an interesting, fun, and easy course.",
    "Ends up being more work than you think because there are responses for every class but in the big scheme still not too much and class time is very enjoyable.",
    "As a School of Music student I would definitely recommend this performance class."
