   "comments": [
    "If you want to know how to use color you must take this class.",
    "Take it! It's pretty time-consuming, but even if you've never taken an art class, it's a great one to dive into.",
    "Definitely take Color! The first half is basically a bunch of collage assignments based on Josef Albers and done using ColorAid paper. The second half is much looser and more conceptual. Clint gives excellent advice about how to improve your projects and push yourself as an artist. You really do get out of it what you put into it, and it is obvious when people didn't spend much time on assignments and when they put in tons of work. You produce a visually enticing portfolio by the end of the semester.",
    "Wonderful class for art majors or non-majors. Don't be intimidated by the art majors in the class, this is one class where everyone's creativity comes out in surprising ways. The end of the class (last two projects) was very work heavy but overall the course was smooth sailing and Clint is very aware of not giving out too many assignments during heavy weeks.",
    "I think color is a good experience- color aid paper for the first half of the semester is great for its purity, but sometimes very tedious to look through. Sometimes I knew exactly which color I wanted to use, but it just wasn't available in my packet. The second half of the semester is good, though sometimes the assignments are so broad it is hard to critique the entire class in a specific way. That said, it does allow for much more creative freedom than the first half.",
    "I would recommend it! Personally, though, I would say it is hard work!",
    "This class was very helpful and enjoyable to both art majors and non-art majors. It is a good class to get a better understanding of color and various approaches to color in art. I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially if they were a non-art major looking for a consistently good class with a reasonable workload and professor.",
    "There is a lot more worth thinking about when using color than \"what is your favorite?\" How colors relate to their context--what is being conveyed, the surrounding colors, the amount of the color, the texture of the color, or interaction with the drawing aspects of a composition--is worth thinking about. This course helps you to think about these things in a way that is useful and meaningful without being overwhelming."
