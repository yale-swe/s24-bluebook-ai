   "comments": [
    "The tests are hard for this class, but in the end of the day, you learn so many skills that are useful to everyone. You get a great understanding of basic electronics and there are so many TFs to help you out. Minjoo is a great professor, so take it with him.",
    "It's a pretty standard EE class. A lot of work with a lab component that took a lot of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, although maybe not if they aren't a STEM person. I loved the class and the logic involved in it, but it does require some background.",
    "EENG200 is a very good introduction to circuit analysis and electronics in general (I guess that's why its the title of the course). It provides a fairly intensive introduction to circuit elements, from individual resistors and wires up to logic gates, and filled some serious gaps in my knowledge when it came to low-level circuit components. When I say intensive, I don't mean that any particular part of the course is particularly intellectually demanding, just that (1) an incredible amount of material is covered over the course of the semester (2) There are 3-hour long weekly labs and lab reports that should really justify 1.5 credits for the course (3) there are 3 MIDTERMS. This might be necessary given the sheer volume of material covered, but dang, you spend a lot of time reviewing for exams. I learned a ton from the course and it was taught very well but it was a somewhat unexpected source of stress throughout the semester.",
    "This class is a lot of time: two 75 minutes classes and one 3 hour lab every week means you will spend a bunch of time here. The material isn't actually that hard to understand (90% of the course). If you read the textbook, the psets won't take that long to do at all. Get good lab partners, they make the course much more fun!",
    "Take EENG 200 if you like circuits. If you are more into programming, then this will not be so interesting to you. But for me (EE major), this was an awesome class!",
    "Power through this class: it might seem daunting, but it's rewarding!",
    "If you're considering taking this class you're either interested in electrical engineering or computer science or it's a requirement. Take it if you have to. If you're an engineer this will not be the most conceptually hard, nothing close to it, but it is an enormous amount of work, definitely not worth a single credit. But Professor Lee is awesome and all the teaching fellow were really dope. Really enjoyed it and probably one of the best introductory engineering classes at Yale.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to. The labs weren't as bad as last years, but still add time for a 1 credit course. Reading the chapters ahead makes it so much easier.",
    "Great course, although lab makes it a lot of work",
    "Great intro class. Gives you a strong basis for the major",
    "This class has a lab with it, so it's really 5.5 hours of class time a week, and the labs basically work if You have good equipment or don't at all if the cables You use are bad. The professor isn't exceptional, but he does care about electrical engineering and know a lot, he's just not the best at transferring that knowledge to others. However, he is forgiving and reasonable in regards to assignment due dates and the like. I thought this class was solidly mediocre - there was nothing great about it, but nothing terribly wrong either.",
    "Pretty extensive introductory course on circuits. If you have any background with E&M physics, it should help in the beginning. Overall, not a terrible class, just a lot of work.",
    "I would summarize EENG 200 as a basic introduction to Electrical Engineering class. No prerequisite knowledge required, no curveball tests or assignments. I would recommend this class to engineers and non-engineers.",
    "Definitely a challenging course. Very time consuming between psets, labs (lab reports are long), and tests. However, probably the most I have learned in one class. By the end of the semester you will have a strong, practical understanding of circuits. Overall I would recommend. Just be prepared for the workload.",
    "This is a great introductory course to circuits. Be warned, however, because it will become very demanding at times. There are 6 labs in addition to the regular psets and 3 midterms. All of these components, however, complement the material in class and hep you stay on track. Professor Lee is great, and you will enjoy the lectures. After this semester, I feel like I've really grown and that I've learned a lot of useful and applicable concepts. A demanding and overall rewarding course.",
    "If you have to take it, sorry. If not, no reason to take it.",
    "I definitely recommend the class. It's worth the effort.",
    "Required for EECS, EE, and ME, as well as key class for anyone who wants some electronics experience. Definitely a good class to take ASAP, well taught.",
    "EENG 200 is a challenging course, and it includes a lot of work (six labs in addition to lecture\/psets). I would recommend waiting until sophomore year to take this class, particularly because the speed and rigor of the class would be easier to keep up with having some college-level math and physics background. Most students in the course are committed engineering (EE\/MechE\/CS) majors. If you are considering any of these majors, I would recommend this course even if it not a major-requirement.",
    "A very informative course on the basics of electrical engineering. It covers an enormous amount of material. I would only take if you are sincerely interested in the material or have to take it for your major. There is also a lab included that is not mentioned and it also has a lab report. A pset each week, 3 midterms and a final. It is a work heavy course.",
    "If you are an EE or ME major, then I guess you have to take the class. It will be useful for further classes. To be honest, this class almost made me not want to continue being an EE major in the beginning - it just didn't seem very interesting. However, as the semester progressed, things improved significantly. Not only did the class content become more interesting, but Prof. Lee's lectures also became more engaging. At first, his soothing voice invites everybody to take a little nap. However, eventually he started to incorporate live demos (using his children's toys) and warmed up to the class and EE lectures actually became fun. The labs were kind of helpful with learning the material and gave a valuable hands on opportunity to learn. However, having to write full reports for three of the six labs on top of the weekly PSets made the workload more than a reasonable amount.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of electronics. I found every topic covered to be very interesting. The class is challenging but rewarding.",
    "There's not much point in recommending or not recommending this course. I'll just say that if you're interested in this course, you should know what you're getting into. This course is a lot of work. My year, Prof. Lee assigned 12 psets (not too long compared to other courses), six lab reports (varying in lengths from one page to ten pages), and three midterm exams throughout the semester. There was also a final. All this was very time-consuming, and the midterms and final were difficult exams.",
    "This is a great course. You have to take this for EE. If you're not EE and you're interested in circuits, it covers how electronics work from the electrons up to the transistors that are the fundamental building blocks of a computer. There is a healthy dose of \"just trust these rules for this component; it's beyond this class to explain how it works,\" which is fine if you just want to be able to figure out what's going on in a circuit diagram without looking too deep under the hood. You build the circuits in lab, and they are fun when they work, but beware the 2000 page lab report. Go to the homework sessions! The TAs and your peers will help you understand stuff so much faster, and it turns a moderate course into an easy one.",
    "Overall, EE200 is a good intro to circuits. If you haven't taken physics or didn't understand E&M the first time around, you'll be at a disadvantage for the first exam. If you haven't taken EE201, you'll be at a disadvantage for the third exam. As someone who was at a disadvantage from both, I still thought it was manageable. Kevin Ryan is the single best resource for this class. Be best friends with him."
