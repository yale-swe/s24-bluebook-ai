    "I expected a high level of ambition, intellectual curiosity and pressure and experienced all three.",
    "I thought advanced studios would give me the chance to adopt someone's means and methods of working, question them, and make my own reinterpretation through my work. Greg was not present enough to have this dialogue. Thus his ideas never got challenged by our projects and vis versa.",
    "I went into this studio to take myself out of my comfort zone. I will be the first to say that I didn't not challenge myself as much as I could have throughout this studio nor was I pushed to do so. I feel that I left the studio with a well resolved project, but nothing new in terms of challenging any notion of what motion can give to architecture. In fact, I think that in the entire studio, there was only one really IDEA about motion, and that would be Jaeho. The rest of the students used the Nike component as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098prop\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to disguise very traditional motion ideas placed into an architectural project \u00e2\u0080\u0093 myself included. I think that the Nike component, while interested, detracted from the more interesting studio problem of motion, and allowed students to create a flashy narrative that masked a lack of innovation. This is not to say that the projects were not successful, just that they did not reach the potential that we all thought there was at the beginning of the semester.",
    "It is clear Greg is an excellent critic when he is engaged with the student projects. Everyone appreciated his presence for he offered direct and clear insight into each person's work. That being said, it would be superfluous to elaborate on his lack of presence in the studio this semester. I should simply mention, excluding the studio trip, where the studio did not discuss about specific projects, the students met with Greg four times the entire semester. This is problematic not for infrequency, but for the lack of commitment and responsibility exhibited by the faculty for his brief and pedagogy. The students made a full commitment to accept the terms of this studio, but were left without proper response for their project or reasoning for specific direction of the studio. While everyone enjoyed the collaboration with Nike, the faculty seemed less enthused about his collaboration with the students. Overall, the studio produced many simplistic, one-liner projects."
