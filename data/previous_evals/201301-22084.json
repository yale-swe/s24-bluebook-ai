    "I would not recommend this course for a truly interested student. You won't get as much as you wanted to from it. For gut hunters though it is fine: 3 papers, no tests, and reasonable grading.",
    "A class where you will learn about Buddhism in India and China and the ways that it changed and the different schools that developed. Take it if you have any interest in becoming a more well rounded, knowledgeable person.",
    "You won't understand what the professor is saying, but it's only 3 five-page papers. Take this class if you want a class with less work-load.",
    "This was a great class. The texts are fascinating, and Professor Shinohara is a fantastic teacher.",
    "Yes. Good survey of Buddhism.",
    "It is a good overview of Buddhism in East Asia, which covers most major schools in China and Japan. Although the course itself is not very demanding in terms of its workload, the material for each class is very dense and can be often opaque and hard to read. The reading assignments can be a little long sometimes, but all of them are very interesting, especially in order to see how different schools dialogue with one another and approach similar issues in different ways. Some background in Buddhist history and\/or East Asian culture might be useful, as most of the texts we read for the class are primary sources. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the religious tradition of China and Japan, particularly because of the syllabus."
