    "L1 Portuguese creates a friendly, cooperative atmosphere in which to learn. There are tests every other week, but if you are prepared for class each day, the frequent tests should not be a major concern. Professor Valdez is extremely nice, and practically bending over backwards to help her students succeed. The language itself is moderately challenging if you do not have a background in a romance language. Many of the students in the class took Spanish in high school, so the language comes a bit easier to them.",
    "Super chill, awesome class. Maria is the best. She's crazy at times but so delightful and so passionate about Portuguese. Every day was BOM DIA! with a big smile. The class itself moves very slowly, and you are catered to at all times. Great learning environment, horrible textbook though.",
    "Basics of portuguese grammar. By the end, you'll actually be able to have a semi-decent conversation with someone in portuguese. It helps a lot though if you push yourself to learn more outside the classroom (if the interest is there).",
    "Would definitely recommend it -- little work, somehow learn a lot, and often lots of fun.Keep in mind, though, if you've taken other language classes at Yale, that the Portuguese department is NOWHERE as organized as the French or Spanish one, where you know what homework you will have on any given day of the semester from the very start, where you have endless review grammar exercises, or when you have homework every day for around an hour. This is an obvious bonus in terms of your time but you also sometimes feel that you could be progressing faster and aren't.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the portuguese language. I learned more than I thought I would with an intro course.",
    "Yes-if you know Spanish then take this class and it will be really easy and really rewarding!Even if you don't know spanish, the class will be really easy. In order to really learn the language, you have to make sure to put more work into the class than is actually required.The portuguese professors are all really quirky and fun and you don not regret having to go to their class everyday. Compared to other languages, a higher percentage of students are sophomores who didn't take a language freshman year or are juniors and seniors learning their third or forth language so it is a more diverse and interesting group than in the regular intro spanish classes or others languages.The small department and class size gives the teachers a lot of flexibility and means they put a lot more time and effort into each student. Open office hours, weekly language lunches, weekly portuguese teas, and optional events like a traditional brazilian dinner really improved my confidence speaking and made me closer with my classmates\/professor.",
    "Decent, not great, and very likely better with Marta. Be warned that Ana is Portuguese, not Brazilian, and so her accent is very different. It's not a ton of work but I also don't feel like I improved much.",
    "Not as many homework assignments like in other languages (i.e. French). Participate in class, practice for your oral exam and study for your final and you'll be fine.",
    "This class is great for a first foreign language. It's pretty laid back and you will learn a lot if you put time into studying for the tests and in the compositions. It can get confusing with how stuff is structured but go to office hours to get things cleared up and it will be pretty easy. It is not a time consuming class.",
    "Moves really slowly. Easy if you know Spanish. Pick your time and location carefully.",
    "Average class, period."
