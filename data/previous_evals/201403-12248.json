   "comments": [
    "Not bad, but your time could be spent on another course. What you get out of this course is what you put in.",
    "Interesting. Good class",
    "The subject matter is extremely interesting. I would recommend this course for psychology majors.",
    "Would not recommend. Boring class.",
    "ANyone who is interested in relationship psychology should take it. Interesting and useful information for the real world. That said, it's not the most exciting lecture to attend.",
    "Basic Psychology lecture, pretty interesting stuff. I would definitely recommend it. And it's a great 5th credit; does not add a lot of work to your schedule.",
    "Good introductory psych course, interesting material. Tests are a good mix of lecture and readings. Take the tests seriously though, first class average was a 71. Those who studied a normal amount generally did well though. Professor is great and non-cumulative exams are a huge bonus of this course.",
    "Heavily based on the reading. Lecture is hard to sit through and stay engaged in. Exams can be difficult if you do not read the book. Papers are easy.",
    "Take if you need an easy 5th credit. The material is not challenging, quite interesting to read about, and just requires a couple of nights before each exam to go over. Readings are interesting too, but you have to do them to do well in the exams as 50% of the questions are based off the readings. Projects are very formulaic and straightforward to do well if you follow the guidelines closely.",
    "If you need a simple psych credit or 5th class, take it.",
    "A psychology class based on all of the relationships a person has in life. Very interesting",
    "I would recommend Attraction and Relationships to another student. Beyond the academic portion of the coursework, the study of relationship science is beneficial to everyone.",
    "Incredibly interesting course that will make you analyze your own relationships and behaviors. Although some of the material is obvious, I also learned a lot of interesting facts from the many studies we covered. Considering the final take away from the course was that good relationships have lasting health benefits that help us lead happier lives, I think it's an important and relevant topic to be more knowledgeable about. Also, the class was not very difficult (3 non-cumulative exams and 2 projects) and the reading was easy and very enjoyable. On that note, you really should read the textbook material for the exams; many people incorrectly assumed they would focus primarily on the lectures.",
    "Pretty interesting course but at the end of the semester the material was rather repetitive. The exams are easy if you do the readings and pay attention during the lecture. The papers are simple and the TFs do a good job of helping you through the process.",
    "I LOVED this class! It allows you to think about your every day encounters in new ways. It helped me understand the relationships in my life and why we each behave in the ways we do. It made me change my major to psychology. One of my favorite classes at Yale! Definitely take this class if you're interested in social psychology.",
    "PSYC 126 was a phenomenal course. While at times the PowerPoints for the lectures felt slightly disorganized, the course material was so engaging that it didn't even matter. Professor Clark has extreme mastery of the material she teaches, which certainly comes across. The workload is totally manageable and the examinations are fair. While Professor Clark makes a note about saving that this is not a self-help course, it certainly does prove applicable to real life in surprising ways.",
    "Definitely would recommend the course, really interesting material.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in understanding on a deeper level their relationships. It can be dry at points, but Professor Clark is overall a great, caring professor",
    "The subject matter of PSYC 126 is interesting but the majority of it is pretty intuitive. It was a thought-provoking class but the lectures were not engaging.",
    "Yes! Take it! But be mindful that it is 3 exams and 2 papers-not that easy to handle.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class as any student will learn a lot about relationships and also about themselves in the process",
    "Take this class if you want a class that is very interesting and not too hard. It's pretty disorganized but not too much work. You need to read the book to do well in the class",
    "It was a riveting course that is really what you make of it. Many students chose not to attend all of the lectures but i definitely thought it was worth attending the lectures. It was very exciting to see PProfessor Clark's name mentioned so many times in the textbook.",
    "I was very excited to take this as an interesting fifth class and found myself completely apathetic towards it about a week into it. The material is interesting, but everything is in the book. So just read it instead of using up a Yale credit on this. The class had two papers and three midterms, so it's not your average gut. All in all, it's an interesting topic, but one that you don't need to take a class to learn more about it.",
    "This course explores the study of relationship science; it is not a self-help course (though you may find it helpful!)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any Yale student. Not only is it very interesting, but it is very applicable to real life. Even if you are not a psych major it is a very interesting and manageable class! I highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this class if You're looking for a class where You have to put in effort only at specific times. Nothing ended up being curved because enough people just got 90s and 80s on it, but if You had time to study for it it would've been fine (I had another midterm on the same day as two of the three midterms in this class so that didn't help). I didn't go to lecture for 2 months and I think it'll be fine.",
    "You read, you attend the lectures and repeat. Most of what you read plus a little bonus material is covered in the lectures. The tests are on the material that we cover in class as well as additional articles and case studies that Dr. Clark finds to be pertinent. The essays are a fair amount of work, but are entirely manageable.",
    "A solid intro level course with interesting material. Definitely recommend",
    "Moderately easy class, kinda boring but interesting at times.",
    "The material is material that seems very intuitive and is based heavily on the book.",
    "This class has been THE MOST useful thing ever in life it explains everything and will help you navigate your hookups, friendships, relationships and awkward in between things REALLY IT DOES if you actually pay attention",
    "Boring lectures, AMAZING MATERIAL. TAKE THE CLASS AND YOULL REFER TO IT EVERY DAY",
    "Perfect Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "The lecture was very boring and the lecturer yelled into the microphone and didn't make the material seem gripping at all. Tests cared a lot about memorization instead of understanding. Papers were very easy and straightforward to write if you just do exactly what they say.",
    "Yes, harder than expected",
    "This class sounds very exciting\/interesting but unfortunately the lectures tended to be pretty dry and boring. Prof Clark is nice but she doesn't seem to proof-read her slides or exams beforehand (there were a lot of typos\/misspellings). The class isn't difficult so if you're looking for a 5th class or an easy psych class I'd say you should take it. Some of the things you learn are actually applicable to daily friendships\/relationships which is cool.",
    "One of the few classes at Yale that you will learn things that actually apply to everyday life.",
    "Attraction and Relationships is a very standard psychology lecture class. The work consists of weekly readings, 3 non-cumulative tests over the course of the semester, and 2 relatively easy projects. In my opinion, the content was very interesting and relevant to daily life. However, Professor Clark's powerpoints were often very disorganized, and her lectures were a little stiff and boring at times. Also, the tests sometimes contained very specific, nit-picky questions about the readings. Overall though, it was a solid class with not too much work. Plus, the third test is on the last day of class so there is no exam during finals period.",
    "Not a great class. Despite the name, not super interesting lectures, not a great professor, and not a gut because the exams were unnecessarily ridiculous. Some of the material and studies were repeated multiple times throughout the course, pulling out only slightly different information each time, but it was very much the same, so it felt like the many portions of lectures were repeats. The only good part about this course is the textbook itself. I'd recommend you buy that and just read it if you're interested.",
    "Not as exciting as it sounds. If you're choosing between this and Psych 110, definitely take Psych 110.",
    "This class is an introductory psych course on all aspects of familial, platonic, and romantic relationships. I recommend it to non-psych majors because it is interesting material, but is very intuitive to anyone who has already studied psychology.",
    "I would only recommend PSYC 126 to a psychology major.",
    "Easy concepts, impossible tests. The tests were not on overall topics but rather minute details. The assignments were not too difficult, depends on your TA for grading.",
    "This was a good introductory psychology class focused on relationship science and addressing attraction in passing. I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in how relationships are formed and strengthened, but the class would not interest everyone, and is definitely not a self-help course.",
    "class was ok, some parts were interesting and some were not, some parts could feel obvious to people simply because they have lived life and have learned some of the ideas were saw studies about.",
    "The subject matter of the class is pretty interesting, and that's probably why you're looking at this class. Honestly, the lectures are somewhat skippable a lot of the time, because most of the lecture is identical to the lecture slides, which, at least this semester, were posted online. What I will recommend for this course is that you need to make sure to actually do the reading. Information from the book will be necessary for the midterms, and while it is often closely related to the material from lecture, there are often specific facts asked about on the exams that are not mentioned in lecture. Doing the reading isn't a huge issue though, honestly, as long as you can convince yourself to sit down and do it. The material is interesting enough that the reading won't be boring. I learned a lot about the dynamics behind relationships, both romantic, and nonromantic. I think the class is worth taking for that knowledge. It's pretty relevant to college students."
