    "Strengths: -Everyone is treated the same way regardless of where they are in the program\/writing process. -The discussion is generally very supportive and constructive, with a focus on everyone helping to improve each other. -The collaborative nature of the course made it feel like one's own work is not just a solitary effort, but the product of a supportive intellectual community. Weaknesses: -It's abundantly clear who reads and who does not. This not only impoverishes the kind of feedback given (since it all comes from the same one or two people), but it also risks making the presenter feel that their work is undervalued or undersupported by their peers. This seems especially one-sided given the fact that we all present something at one point in the semester or another: it's clear that some students are far more willing to take support\/feedback than they are to give it."
