    "Take it if you are a science person who wants a Hu, or a humanities person who wants a Qr\/Sc. With that said, beware that the math\/science part actually gets pretty challenging toward the end of the course (General Relativity diagrams are no fun). The readings are entirely unnecessary, and the lectures are usually somewhat dry. All in all, not a bad course if you need to fulfill a requirement.",
    "I would recommend PHIL 283 to another student. Jill North is great at presenting the material clearly. The class is part intro science course and part intro philosophy course, so neither the science nor the philosophy is gone into as much depth as it would be in an actual intro course. I know this bothers some people, but if you're interested in the subject matter, I'd recommend the course. Also, I think this is the most enjoyable way for a philosophy major to fulfill his\/her Sc credit.",
    "I would give it a middling recommendation -- for a class with no definable purpose, I would try to find osmething that's more engaging and involves more than just going to class and learning a few basic concepts and philosophical debates.",
    "Yes, it's a good and insightful class",
    "If you want to avoid doing math at Yale, it's a painless QR credit. The material itself isn't necessarily easy, but the pittance of math that somehow justifies this as a QR is.Expect to be confused. Expect to have \"ARE THEY SERIOUS?\" moments in some of the more abstract delineations. Expect to enjoy it.",
    "Interesting not great, physics not too hard if you are philosophy background but do not think it is too easy",
    "Beware humanities folks: This class is meant for Science majors as an easy Hu, not Humanities majors as an easy Sc or QR.Interesting concepts are overly-complicated and delivered as to people who are very familiar with physics-heavy vocabulary and background. Class is not well organized and very repetitive, though concepts are very intriguing - if you can figure out what is being talked about.6 problem sets throughout the semester. Recommended if you really like physics and some of the abstract (often irrelevant) thought behind it.",
    "I would, since it is little work and therefore a good way to fulfill requirements.",
    "I personally do not like this course very much because it deals with intangible philosophical concepts which can be hard to get a grip of if you don't have prior experience with philosophy.",
    "Maybe... the topics are interesting, but you sometimes feel like there is no overall purpose. Each week we talk about a different topic, which is interesting, but spend way too long debating philosophical thought experiments that have no relevance to the real world, and hearing the arguments that philosophers have amongstthemselves. Its Sc\/Hu\/QR distributional requirements make it very tempting. I'm glad that I got a Sc credit out of the way, I particularly recommend it for non-science people because the physics is at a basic high school level, but the lack of a textbook can make problem sets very confusing. The tests require memorizing a lot of useless crap, but it's not that difficult to do well on them if you put in a lot time...",
    "An okay class for non-science majors needing a science credit. I took it for the humanities credit and it was pretty worth it. no papers, readings can get a little\/a lot boring, but in the end it was alright. Problem sets manageable, tests fair, classes were interesting.",
    "Not a good QR if you want an easy distribution requirement.",
    "It was a pretty solid class - not a gut (and that's a good thing). I actually did very very badly on my midterm -- worst grade I've got in my life -- and the problem sets were sometimes challenging. But I learned a lot! And the topics were interesting! I recommend it.",
    "if you're at all interested in the connections betweenscience and philosophy, definitely check this class out. It is accessible, interesting, and worthwhile (i.e. not a gut, I don't think, which is good).",
    "Professor North seems like a genuinely interesting and nice person, and the topics the class confronts were mostly exciting and always new. But something was missing. North tries a little too hard to conduct lectures like a conversation, and it's easy to get bogged down in abstract details of already-esoteric topics. The class would also benefit from greater continuity between subjects.",
    "if you like physics and you need a qr, take it. if you just need the qr, find another course.",
    "Go into this class with the right expectations and you'll probably enjoy it; I didn't and spent most of my time internally asking why anything we were talking about mattered and not being able to come up with a good answer. This class feels like a history of the Philosophy of Physics (we talked a lot about what a bunch of different people argue about spacetime, for instance, without actually spending that much time evaluating the implications of those claims). Do not take this class unless you've taken some high school physics before. The problem sets were extremely math-heavy and didn't have much philosophical analysis to do. Judge for yourself.",
    "If you're interested in the material, sure. I took it for a QR requirement -- sometimes I felt a little lost, but in the end I think it was a good choice. It's not particularly math heavy. I took AP Calculus AB in high school and had no trouble with the math. At most you take a derivative. It was the philosophy or the graphing that sometimes tripped me up.",
    "While the course explored some compelling areas and concepts, it completely failed to bring its quantitative and qualitative aspects together. Rather than reinforcing each other and helping build a solid understanding of the puzzles and problems surrounding the philosophy of physics, the \"physics\" work and the \"philosophy\" work remained entirely unconnected. This was true in the lectures, the problem sets, and the exams. Of course it would be a joke to try and teach non-physics majors the true mathematical methods underlying most of the physics concepts explored in the class; but the massively simplified version to which we were exposed is completely useless as a supplement to a purely qualitative understanding of the concepts. To imagine that the one could support the other without a much more detailed investigation of both is hopelessly naive.Furthermore, the specific puzzles and problems addressed in the course seemed cherry-picked--we spent a great deal of time and effort discussing the direction of time, for example, but failed even to consider any questions associated with the big bang. Special and general relativity constituted nearly half of the content of the course, but we did not even touch on what are unquestionably the most problematic questions in the philosophy of physics, namely those posed by quantum mechanics. Either the title of the course needs to be changed (\"Philosophy of classical physics\") or the scope needs to be broadened (perhaps by eliminating the many class periods wasted trying to teach an extraordinarily rudimentary variation of a high school physics curriculum).Professor North clearly makes an effort to support her students. Unfortunately, her grasp of the material seems to be weak enough that she was often unable to respond helpfully to challenging questions raised during her lectures. Many students quickly discovered that attendance at the lectures was, at best, no more helpful to developing comprehension of the material than perusing Wikipedia articles on the same subject. The only intellectual challenge posed by the course was memorizing the arguments raised by specific scholars in the readings; yet in many cases these arguments do not even represent the most insightful arguments available in the literature.",
    "Wonderful at the beginning, terrible at the end. Professor North isn't very good at explaining a lot of things. I needed it for a QR, science\/math people needed a Hu, but the course was much more geared towards them than towards me. That said, midterm and final were fair. Discussions were occasionally interesting, and the class got me thinking about science in a way I never had before.",
    "Philosophy of Physics is a course that tries to blend knowledge of basic physics with the metaphysics that probes physical principles. It wasn't always fascinating, but Professor North is a very good lecturer and she is very committed to helping every student understand the materials. Overall, it was a great way for me to get a QR and learn about some interesting concepts at the same time.",
    "you basically do readings and examine thought experiments that make you ask: what is motion? is the universe deterministic? are the laws of physics correct? how does special\/general relativity shape our understanding of the universe? what is space?Needless to say these are difficult questions that aren't answered with a yes\/no. But they demonstrate the state of uncertainty we're in that's typical of life.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. Most people taking this class are probably just seeking to fulfill a QR\/Science requirement. There are probably better ways to do so. The class is at times a bad mixture of boring and difficult. I wouldn't take it.",
    "Take it if you're into phil.",
    "Good for a QR",
    "Yes, definitely recommended. I hadn't taken a philosophy or a physics class before this, and it's definitely do-able, you'll just have to put in some work.",
    "I actually really enjoyed this class. Not too much work- you don't have to do the readings bc Professor North explains everything in class- and pretty straightforward exams. It helps to have a few friends taking it though for problem set\/review purposes. Great, interesting science credit.",
    "Awful course. Don't take it. I thought I could get an easy science credit. I was wrong.",
    "It's a good class to get an easy Hu. If you know any physics or math at all you're ahead of half of the class and will already be able to do half of the problems on the midterm and final. The philosophy material is pretty interesting as well, and the workload is pretty light. Just be ready for good amount of lecture being devoted to stuff you already know.",
    "This class was a bit of a disappointment. It wasn't terribly difficult or stressful, just not as interesting as I thought it would be. We spent a number of lectures going over basic mathematical concepts that I had in high school (vectors, calculus, non-Euclidean geometries). The problem sets often included more complicated physics problems that weren't explicitly modeled in lecture; I think I would have been lost if I hadn't had a good grasp of the concepts. Still, it was a decent course and it did get me to think about topics that I probably wouldn't have considered otherwise. Jill North is a very clear lecturer when it comes to presenting philosophical arguments; she writes outlines on the board and it's easy to follow the structure of the lecture. She's also friendly and helpful. Take it if you're pretty comfortable with calculus and physics and don't mind a couple of less-than-riveting lectures.",
    "Yea even though the course has its flaws, its very interesting stuff.",
    "You learn about some of the philosophical complaints to Newtonian Physics, Special and General Relativity. Some of them are quite nitpicky and annoying. If you've taken physics before, the Newtonian mechanics half is going to unbelievably slow for you (but it's really easy). Learning about relativity is fascinating but again, the nitpicking sometimes brings down the level of fun.If you're interested in philosophy and like how philosophy sometimes works on technicalities, then take this course. If you're really a science buff, this may get annoying for you at times.",
    "THE WORST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. It is not an interesting, moderately difficult Science\/QR credit for Humanities people, as it is billed by the professor. It is instead an easy Hu credit for Science\/QR people. The material is poorly explained, there is almost no philosophy following the midterm and the problem sets are very difficult, but not as horribly unfair as the midterm was.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to read faster after spring break. The course material is rather slow and easy in the beginning, but gets really rather obscure quickly. And I mean, obscure, as in, you won't really feel the magic as much anymore. But maybe I would have more if I had kept up better.",
    "Strange balance of math\/physics\/and philosophy, but Prof. north is a great teacher, and it's a fun course where I was able to think differently about subjects that have never interested me before, and as a humanities student can now better appreciate science and how it relates to other disciplines. Only problem was that i didn't understand a lot of the reading, but it wasn't really necessary to do well in the class.",
    "Not a bad course for humanities kids looking to satisfy a science credit since there's a lot more reading and interpreting of arguments than math or problem solving. That being said, the philosophy can get really circular, pointless, and annoying so you better be genuinely interested in getting nitty-gritty about things like the direction of time, special relativity, etc. Even then you don't learn much beyond paraphrasing things that other people have said in overly complicated ways.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I believe there are more fulfilling ways to fill distributional requirements.",
    "Philosophy of physics is an overview of philosophical questions relating to science from Newtonian mechanics to general relativity. The lectures are mainly about the philosophy and the problem sets and exams are mainly basic physics. Its a super easy credit for a science person looking for a humanities credit but harder for a humanities person looking for a science credit. Its not an easy course but its not super hard either. Fairly interesting but at times sort of frsutrating because the philosophy is very specific and taken out of context, somethimes doesn't make sense. If youre not super serious about philosophy of physics but also want to learn something somewhat interesting for a science credit, its a good class for you.",
    "Philosophy of Physics is a relatively low-intensity look at some of the recent developments in physics and what they might imply for the lay-people who don't understand every mathematical detail. Overall I enjoyed it.",
    "yes",
    "If you are good at physics this is an easy Hu. If you haven't taken physics, this is a hard but not unmanageable Sc. I'm sure there are easier QR classes. Either way, this is an interesting class. I had taken a lot of physics but didn't have a good conceptual understanding of relativity until this class.",
    "If you are a humanities person looking for a QR\/SC, be very wary. This class is basically a physics class - the philosophy is there, but it is a pretty small part of the class. The problem sets can be quite challenging. Only take it if you are confident in your physics\/math abilities.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is an excellent survey of different theories regarding the physical universe and the philosophical arguments for and against them.",
    "Philosophy of Physics was probably the most disappointing course I've taken at Yale. I took the course because I was hoping that it would focus on interesting philosophical matters that related to physics. That seems to be what the title and description implies, right? WRONG.The course consisted of extremely difficult physics, very little philosophy, and even less explanation to those of us in the class that are not from the math\/science major. The problem sets were a struggle, the tests were nearly impossible, and Jill North went through the material at lightening speed.In conclusion, I would not recommend this course, physically or philosophically.",
    "Don't take this class if you're looking for a science credit and like philosophy a bit. It's looking as some of the concepts of the most advanced kind of physics, but without any of the mathematical\/scientific background to help it make sense. FRUSTRATING.",
    "I was a Hums person looking for a SC credit and for this criteria it fit the bill nicely.",
    "This is a great class for both science and humanities majors, because it provides equal parts of each. The workload is definitely manageable, and while the subject matter can get complicated especially at the end of the semester, it is always easy to get help. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "DO NOT take this as a gut science credit, especially if you've never had any physics. Lots of the P-sets assume high school physics which is NOT taught in class. If you took AP, however, this can be a fun class. Be warned, though, it's pretty circular.",
    "I wouldn't take this course. Doesn't really integrate the disciplines and the philosophers we read are often stupid. Take Infinity instead.",
    "Mediocre class but an easy science credit. The topics are uninteresting. The style of analytic philosophy is embarrassing here, where arguments about topics in physics often seem vapid and unimportant, and where the style of argumentation is often weak. I learned very little physics in this class, and I learned very little philosophy in this class.",
    "I think it's a good class, and if you go to all the lectures it will not be difficult to follow the progression of ideas. It also does a pretty decent job of introducing you to different aspects of physics if you're not a science person.",
    "Yes. This course is good for anyone interested in physics.",
    "DEFINITELY NOT. This class made my semester hell and I was constantly questioning my state of mind when I chose this class. This will NOT be the easy QR\/Sc you think it will be. It will be a complicated course in theoretical physics that will make you hate yourself. It will have absolutely no relevance to the real world. You will cover subjects like \"homogeneous spinning matter\" and \"space invaders shooting in from infinity.\" It sounds kind of cool now, but NOT worth your semester.",
    "Philosophy of Physics is a great non-major class that fulfills a science credit. Far too many non-major classes with Sc designations are really poorly taught classes -- often they are just uninteresting and frustrating. Philosophy of Physics, however, gave me the opportunity to brush up on what I had always considered the \"interesting\" questions of classical physics while also giving me the best understanding I could hope to have of special and general relativity without knowing the math. Professor North's lectures were great -- very interactive, with time dedicated to student questions in every class; she honestly encouraged students to ask questions if they were confused, and this made lectures both more interesting and more informative. If you are a science major with a strong background in physics, however, I could see how the class could be painfully boring at times, since we do review the physics a good bit. I'm not sure I wouldn't recommend the class to a science major, but, if I were I science major, I would think carefully about how I would feel about the lectures dedicated to physics instead of philosophy.",
    "Take it if you have the background and it'll be incredibly easy. If you don't have a background in physics, you can still take it, just don't be deterred if at first everyone seems miles ahead of you.",
    "Recommend for a QR\/SC credit for a non-science student; it was a solid course that as long as you went to lectures we could do okay in. However the course can be frustrating because the way we cover the material seems too superficial compared to the depth of the questions the material is asking.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy being bewildered by concepts largely beyond human comprehension. While the focus errs much more on the side of physics, and science majors looking for a humanities credit will have a MUCH easier time of it than the reverse, it definitely leaves you pondering the basic fabric of reality.",
    "It's an easy course that's Hu, QR, and Sc, so a huge number of students are in there for something distributional. In my case, I'm an engineering major and I needed the Hu. I found the course fun, interesting, and painless, but not particularly inspiring. It was certainly an easy Hu--the *problem sets* (I know! For humanities credit!) are easy, and few of the readings are actually necessary. The material was hit-and-miss: sometimes boring, irrelevant nitpicking over interpretations of physical theories; occasionally fascinating&relevant to my understanding of the world. One clear compliment I can give is that the qualitative\/\"layman's\" approach to stuff like General Relativity was unusually lucid&helpful.",
    "This is a great class to fulfill your science requirement with. The course material is incredibly interesting and would be challenging were it not for Professor North's teaching. She explains everything very clearly and the exams are all very fair. Highly recommended.",
    "It's an interesting class sometimes, but not as interesting as I thought it would be. Also, be aware that the mix of science and math people with humanities people means that some people are far more qualified to take the class than others - just because it's a QR, an Sc, and a Hu.",
    "Philosophy 283 is an interesting (though more difficult, i'm sure, than, say, planets and stars) way to fulfill your QR or science requirements, and an interesting way for mathy types to fulfill their humanities requirement. The material definitely stretches your mind, but Professor North explains it really well (so you have to make sure to go to lecture)! And it's a cool feeling to get these trippy concepts, when you do. Just be prepared to put in some work.",
    "I would indeed recommend Philosophy 283 to another student. This course is a really interesting look at philosophical problems posed by various features of both classical and relativistic physics. Professor North is a very good lecturer and goes over everything important from the readings -- so don't worry when they're incomprehensible. A strong physics background is not necessary for this class, although at least some physics would be recommended.",
    "As a philosophy-oriented student with intermediate physics background, I really enjoyed this course! Professor North is rigorous, engaging, and kind. She is brilliant at explaining difficult material in a conceptual way. You'll talk about spacetime for a semester, which is a blast, and end with discussion of relativity and time travel. The class seemed to integrate the two fields, physics and philosophy, by taking developments in modern physics and then looking at interesting philosophical questions that arise from them. I would have enjoyed further treatment of the relationship between physics and philosophy, but at least the course gives you a chance to question and grapple with this relationship (e.g. the ontological presuppositions of the scientific method) on your own, even without explicit treatment in lecture. Overall, lecture was really enjoyable, and I learned a lot!",
    "I too though this course sounded interesting when I read through the description. However stuck somewhere between a philosophy course and a physics course, the course ended up being a waste of time. Some topics like relativity could be very interesting, but lacked a coherent and intelligible introduction. Take a real physics course or don't waste your time. Problem sets are easy enough if you work on them as a group. Midterm is hard, but final is much easier.",
    "The main strength of this class is as a introduction to the concepts of special and general relativity. The philosophical issues are cute at times, but they often seem a bit inane. The class is not a lot of work, and if you pay attention in lecture then you don't need to do the reading.",
    "Good QR for a humanities type. Not too in depth.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the topics covered by Philosophy of Physics -- the nature of space and time for example. For someone who has taken calculus before the math might be a little elementary and tedious, but it was nice to review some old material too.",
    "I want to be fascinated by this material, because some of it - relativity, time travel - can be engaging. But the presentation method was lacking, and we spent a lot of time on the less compelling arguments and issues. Also, if you're looking for resolution or answers, this ain't your class. It's philosophy, so we end up shrugging our shoulders at the end of it and going home.",
    "I would recommend it if you wish to take a rather easy course that gives you the feeling of having a basic grasp on some sort of interesting philosophical problems (the grasp mostly entailing a familiarity with what we don't know and what seems impossible to know) and that provides useful distributional requirements. A caveat: DO NOT take this course if you do not have a reasonable background in high school physics, unless you plan to teach it all to yourself from a text while taking the course (it being mechanics, mostly, with calculus, etc.). It is doable, surely, but I, having taken AP Physics found the course much more reasonable than classmates who had not found it. This material will not actually be taught to you in a more than cursory way.",
    "I do recommend this class because unlike other science lectures, Jill North makes the material exciting, and her lectures are very easy to follow without being dumbed down. She moves through philosophers \/ concepts by repeating ideas in a cohesive way, and asking questions as if we were thinking through these conundrums of philosophy\/physics. Although the problem sets were at times challenging, working with others and really grasping the material was very rewarding. I found myself jokingly complaining about problem sets, but really, they were very manageable because of good notes I took and the notes JN posted online. If you want an engaging class with actual productive thinking, take this class! Sections are boring and you don't actually have to read any of the readings, but pay attention in class and study in groups!",
    "There are more exciting ways to get a QR. I did enjoy learning about special and general relativity, though."
