    "Improved writing and discussion skills",
    "I learned that many aspects of our culture can be theorized and understood from an analytical basis. I gained knowledge about the history of fandom and how it has evolved over time, and how our culture reacts and resists fandoms. The class has also taught me how to construct an argument and develop the necessary logic to support it in a well-reasoned essay.",
    "I learned what it means to be a fan. This was really eye opening for me as a Liverpool fan.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze something that seems so trivial. The course was incredible and the discussions were engaging.",
    "I was able to improve my writing skills with help from Bo. My seminar was on fan culture and I learned a tremendous amount about the origins of fandom and different fandoms throughout history.",
    "I learned how to format an argument clearly and how to use evidence properly to back up my claim. My analyzation skills improved a lot and the class allowed me to think conceptually and theoretically."

    "Strengths - papers are spaced out well throughout semester. Bo was a great teacher. Weakness - didn't really like the topic of fan cultures",
    "Strengths was that it exposed us to different thinking styles and theories so we could have a new viewpoint about the world. Weakness was that I felt like we didn't focus on writing so much."

    "I absolutely would recommend this to another student because this class is fun and engaging and allows students to connect research and academic writing with pop culture and fandoms. If a student actively consider him or herself as part of a fandom, taking this class will definitely allow the student to learn in an environment that understand and encourage his or her interest.",
    "I would recommend this course! Helps you write argumentative papers and gives you a new perspective on fandom and culture",
    "I would recommend this course to a student very interested in fan cultures and willing to delve into topics such as cosplay and fan fiction. As a writing class, this class will help to improve your writing style and to write essays at a high college level.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who would like the subject because the subject is pretty unique and not a lot of classes are offered on it."
