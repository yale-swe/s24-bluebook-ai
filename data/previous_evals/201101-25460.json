    "The only suggestion I have would be related to Revit. In the future, it would be helpful to have a base file (sheets set-up, graphic annotations, etc.). This will allow students to focus more on the actual problems related to building systems, as opposed to, for example, figuring out how to change line-weights on all their drawings so they are presentable and readable.Also, it would be helpful to focus the intro Revit sessions on the overall work-flow within groups, sharing files, and initial setting up. The meetings with Revit consultants were very valuable. Perhaps there could be more of them earlier in the semester, not only at the very end."
