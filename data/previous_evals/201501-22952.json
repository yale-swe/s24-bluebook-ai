   "comments": [
    "This course is brilliant! It gives you the skills you need to design on the web, but focuses mostly on how to think about interactive\/web-based artwork. Each of the projects pushes you to think in creative, divergent ways, and the class feels relaxed enough to allow you to experiment. Laurel is awesome and does a great job designing class projects, giving feedback, and engaging students in fascinating discussions.",
    "great class! sort of an exploration of the internet and design. lots of people shop so hard to get into if not an art major however.",
    "A class where you will learn HTML and CSS and jquery by actually doing very cool and very interesting projects. That being said it demands a lot of work and time, so it's definitely one for the passionate and determined to improve!",
    "If you want to learn how to code, definitely take this class. Laurel is really quirky and assigned fun and interesting\/unusual projects. A lot of work, especially if you're coming in with zero coding experience. Class probably could have been structured a bit more efficiently we broke up into small groups to look at our projects which often ended up going overtime. Also learned about net art, which is an entire weird world of its own.",
    "An art class that uses the browser as its primary medium. Projects are interesting and open-ended with a focus on creativity over technical sophistication. You'll learn HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript but will spend time mastering them on your own. Laurel is encouraging and specific with her feedback but really leaves it up to the students to guide the direction of the class.",
    "Interactive Design is a great class with a lot of demand. I think that Laurel looks for students who are really interested in not just learning coding and website design, but also in the intellectual implications of the web and interactive design. What does it mean to work with an ever-changing, impermanent, immaterial medium? What is the future of the internet? What role does a designer have in shaping that future? What is the evolving relationship between print and interactive design? The class is a lot of work, especially if you have no coding background like I did, and there's a pretty steep learning curve. But if you put in the time, I think it's a really worthwhile course to take, and highly recommend it!"
