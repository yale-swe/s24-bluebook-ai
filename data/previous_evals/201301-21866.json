    "If you have the time. It's a great course to take.",
    "French 120 is a rigorous second semester of French. If you are interested in the language, don't be dissuaded by other people's comments about how much work or how hard it is. I spent maybe an hour each week reviewing for the weekly tests (those aren't as bad as they sound) and another hour or so on miscellaneous assignments. Its really not a horribly large amount of work and you WILL learn a lot of French which is pretty cool. If you have a choice, try to be in Ngame's section, he is a great professor although he is a little tougher than others. I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "It is challenging and time consuming, but well worth it in the end."
