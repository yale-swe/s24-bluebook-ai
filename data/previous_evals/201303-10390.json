   "comments": [
    "This class is perfect if you want to gain proficiency in discussing political events and literature in Russian. It expands well beyond a normal conversational understanding.",
    "If you've come this far with Russian already, you'll want to take this class. It's plenty of work, yes, but it's very interesting and Irina is the best.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their reading, speaking and listening abilities in Russian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as a means of acquiring conversational practice, new vocabulary, new grammatical structures, and practice in reading.",
    "A good way to improve your Russian. Not too much work. Interesting readings. I would recommend this class to another student over any existing Russian lit class.",
    "This is a great class if you are looking to continue Russian. The homework does take a long time (usually 2 hours a night three times a week) but it's worth it to keep up the language. We cover a variety of topics and read 3 short stories a semester. Irina is a sweetheart and a great teacher. She really takes the time to go over your mistakes and help you with whatever problems you may be encountering. We only had 2 written exams and 2 orals in the fall semester with several quizzes thrown in. Basically, you don't have a choice if you want to do fourth year, but I would certainly recommend the class."
