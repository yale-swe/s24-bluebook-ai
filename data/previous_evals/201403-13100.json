   "comments": [
    "Above all, if you are lucky enough to be placed into this course, definitely take it. It is a great discussion about topics such as the happy life, abortion, euthanasia and afterlife\/immortality. Before each class we read inspiring texts by various authors that served as discussion base or template for argumentation. You could always read these texts in less than an hour (try to do that for other classes...) I would definitely recommend you to take this course if you interested in philosophical questions, argumentation and discussions. And, if you would like to understand why you think the way you think about certain issues of life and death and whether you might have to change your attitudes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you need to work on your argumentative writing skills, take this course and your writing will greatly improve. Take it with Anne Schindel!! She is always willing to help, gives great feedback, and is awesome in general.",
    "Take this class. So interesting and we will definitely improve as a writer if you put in the effort.",
    "Take this course! It is a fantastic section of English 114; the subject is interesting and the professor is fantastic. Each unit is thought-provoking and features a variety of short to medium length readings, which are always enjoyable and interesting. Professor Schindel is a very fair grader and a good discussion moderator; she always gives plenty of comments on drafts so you know exactly what you have to do to improve.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Don't be fooled though, it is not as easy as it seems. Your writing will definitely improve over the semester, but it will take work. If you are willing to put in the work I definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would reccommend Ms. Schindel's course because I found it fascinating and helpful in improving my writing and helping me take a stance on widely discussed issues. I also know of students in other sections who did not like their section do one reason or another and I am certain that that was not an issue here. The class discussions went very in-depth and helped me realize what side of an issue I was really on. Also, our class was given the perfect amount of time to finish papers and I am sure they were graded fairly.",
    "Absolutely! Take Living Well, Dying Well! The readings are almost always very interesting, class discussion is great, and Professor Schindel is amazing! She is a teriffic discussion moderator, is always willing to meet with any student that needs help, and she really helped me to improve my academic writing. TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Great class! The course was split into 4 units: good life, abortion, euthanasia\/PAS, and immortality, each with a paper. Each paper style was different and Professor Schindel does a really good job walking through how to write solid papers of different style. A draft is due before each final paper and Prof. Schindel gives a lot of helpful comments. The amount of readings is very fair and the readings are very interesting. You will get a lot out of this class.",
    "It was an interesting class in which you definitely learn to write better without feeling that it's an English class. It is writing intensive (4 papers: two 4-6 pages, one 8-10 page research paper, and another 6-8 page), but not any more than other 114 sections. You have good class discussions and read interesting and very different papers. The papers you write get more elaborate each time, but its a gradual process. I loved the class and would absolutely recommend it to someone interested in taking 114.",
    "Take this section! Living Well, Dying Well teaches valuable writing skills. On top of that, it is such an interesting course. How many times have you talked about death in a completely open and thoughtful way to a group of your peers? These topics just don't come up in regular conversation. When viewed from an academic lense, it is surprising how many novel ideas are introduced.",
    "We examine what it means to \"live the good life\" and explore different social issues that involve dying (abortion, euthanasia, etc). It is a very interesting course that causes students to really evaluate their beliefs on certain issues. I highly recommend this class.",
    "It's good course, whether you personally like it or not. And it is effective in teaching you how to write an academic paper."
