    "labor intensive but rewarding",
    "HIST 826 is the class everyone should take if they are interested in the Ottoman Empire itself or in imperialism in general. The Ottoman Empire is a great case study that people from all fields can learn from. Plus, the Ottoman Empire lasted for about 700 years and covered a vast region, which makes its study very important for any historian. Moreover, the themes Professor Alan covered in class like religious conversion and environmental history would be of interest to any historian interested in those themes. I would highly recommend the course to everyone!",
    "History 826 will be very useful for anyone interested in thinking about the historiography of empire beyond the great European powers and for those interested in the \"Middle East\"."

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "This course greatly deepened my knowledge in the area I am interested in. I wrote a research paper for this course that I will hopefully pursue it further in my dissertation. I needed this course to construct the context of the events and developments I was tracing in my research. This course made it possible.",
    "The course did not contribute directly to my dissertation but I would be interested in taking up some of the approaches to history introduced through the readings to my own work although the time period and geographic area is different."
