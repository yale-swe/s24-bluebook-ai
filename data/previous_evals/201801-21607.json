    "Strength: meets once a week, opens your perspectives, gives you new ideas of music and beauty, teaches you to compare art and architecture to class, only one interesting final paper Weakness: none!",
    "I thought it was really helpful to listen back to Conductions and discuss them as a class--both the Conductions we produced and the ones for assigned listening. I would like to have done that more often. Other than that, I was glad that most of our class time was dedicated to practicing. Definitely a must for this type of music.",

    "Absolutely- low workload, low time commitment, interesting, and you get to perform in an ensemble for credit! It will change your view of sound and life",
    "This course is unlike any other I took this year. I would recommend it because it forces musicians to take risks, have courage, and try a new form of music.",
    "Yes! Fun course and the professor is very knowledgeable about experimental music and conducting."
