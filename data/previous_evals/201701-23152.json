   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Literature allows you to grow in your thought of the arts and knowledge itself.",
    "This class improved my writing skills a great deal thanks to Katja's advice and comments. This class also helped us understand each text as best we could (given the short time we had with each work in a survey course) and also the connections between works across the syllabus.",
    "I loved diving into the texts and exploring literature's genealogy in this class--some fantastic books this semester. Katja is a fantastic professor and a great seminar leader. Her class was always the perfect balance of professor guidance and student conversation.",
    "Other than the interdisciplinary lens and close-reading skills that I've been able to improve, I've learned that it's an easy mistake to write an essay in a list-form. The essay should argue a point and make progress by developing it in each next paragraph.",
    "I was able to more fully develop the skill of reading great works of literature with a critical eye, thus also learning how to appreciate them more deeply and thoroughly. I now have a much better understanding of the history of literature, especially all that led up to the modern novel. I learned the unique abilities of the separate forms of literature we read (epic poetry, lyrical poetry, prose, tragedy, etc.) to communicate certain ideas or modes of feeling. My writing improved especially through this course, in both substance and style, and significantly in organization."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has a nice structure, but I would critique it this year because they excluded Tolstoy's War and Peace from the syllabus, and included three other less significant novels that I did not particularly like. I would add War and Peace back to the syllabus or a different Russian alternative in Dostoyevsky.",
    "The discussions in this class were very engaging, since Katja led the class with really thought-provoking questions.",
    "Strengths: good books Weaknesses: volume of work sometimes yields quantity of reading over quality of analysis and appreciation, so the professor can make or break your experience. I had a great professor so overall one of my favorite DS classes both semester.",
    "This course provided just enough background information on every novel and its author and placed it within context so that the text became richer than what it would've been just on the surface level. There was also enough time for the students to talk about what they wanted to talk about, and because there was a frame in which the book was introduced to us, our discussions were mostly focused and never felt scattered.",
    "The syllabus is absolutely incredible however, as there is such a great wealth of literature to pull from, it is understandably impossible to create a definitive list. I think my only suggestion for improvement would be to move War and Peace back onto the syllabus, taking out Hadji Murat and perhaps Omeros. I think War and Peace would be one of those staple works in DS that really synthesizes all the pillars of the program, whereas Omeros felt a bit more tacked on (although still, of course, a magnificent book).",
    "This course's strengths lie in its ability to cover a large amount of text in as much detail and care as possible, while understanding the greater context behind each work. The weaknesses are the same; each text could be studied for such a long amount of time and still not be fully understood. It's good to understand that with DS, it's more of an overview than an in-depth study, though it is a very good overview."

   "comments": [
    "DS is a great foundation for anyone, so this is a must for all first-years.",
    "I would recommend taking DS (and continuing through to the spring semester) because I think it is so valuable to have the foundation of the Western cannon. Katja also was a wonderful professor and made the class exciting and also pushed us to improve in writing and thinking about the texts.",
    "The literature track is one of the best in DS. For the most part I loved all the books we read this semester.",
    "Absolutely! The material covered was vast, but the portions we covered from each book were small enough that we gained depth and not just breadth. It's also a very comfortable seminar environment to discuss readings and our personal thoughts on anything related to the book. The writing feedback is incredible compared to other DS courses. There are specifics as well as broader commentary given back, when normally, feedback in other courses are just specifics. Coming out the class, I do feel much more equipped to read any intimidating book that interests me. I've also gained a much deeper appreciation for literature. It's amazing to study how much authors converse with each other's ideas across time.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes definitely, the syllabus is absolutely fantastic and so is Professor Lindskog. As this course is part of Directed Studies, I suppose the question must be whether or not I would recommend taking Directed Studies. From my experience throughout this year, I have found the program to be extremely beneficial in rooting me in the foundational texts which I know I will always be turning back to, hopefully to dig into further throughout my time at Yale and beyond. Taking DS I think really helps you orient yourself, both in your studies at school but also in how you see the world as it currently surrounds you. The program helps you see how we got to now, why we are the way we are. Regardless of what major you might be thinking of, if it is feasible in your 4-year schedule, I would definitely recommend taking DS to gain a greater appreciation and understanding of the power of ideas throughout history have in shaping your present experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student truly interested in learning about the Western canon via the literary tradition."
