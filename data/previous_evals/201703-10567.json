    "I learned so much in this course that it's hard to detail every single thing.",
    "The amount of synthetic chemistry learned is staggering. I can say that after this course, I would be able to plan a synthetic route (on paper) for almost any molecule thrown at me.",
    "immense amount of new knowledge overall on approaching syntheses and reactivity",
    "This class drilled synthesis into my bones and then some. The whole class is spent developing the skill of synthesis with regards to advanced natural products. In addition to synthesis, the class also enables one to develop a deeper understanding of organic chemistry.",
    "Devising synthetic routes",
    "Gained great insight into synthesis and synthetic planning as well as various important reactions and mechanisms.",
    "I have really learned how to approach a synthesis retrosynthetically. In the beginning of the semester and up through the first exam I was not very good at it, but by the end of the semester I was able to do the problems.",
    "I learned how to think through organic synthesis and retrosynthesis, and I was made aware of organic chemistry transformations I had not previously encountered",
    "I learned a lot about new reactions and mechanisms, and general strategies in retro analysis.",
    "I learned that there are a bunch of very specific reactions that apply in specific scenarios.",
    "SO MUCH. I've learned so much since starting this course - it has a wealth of knowledge within it.",
    "I really learned looking at complex molecules in a different way, by immediately identifying reactivity, disconnections, fragments, etc.",
    "I learned not only new reactions but synthetic strategies and classic total synthesis examples."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very efficient but very fast. Could be improved by going through slightly fewer natural products and more transformations\/tranforms",
    "problem sets could be a little more evenly spread out, but awesome course anyways",
    "The midterm was far too hard (highest score in the class was 80% even with generous partial credit), necessitating a substantial curve. This could be improved by making a fair test of the student's knowledge. In addition, the class is too fast paced for good learning to occur.",
    "The biggest strength of the class is the professor, Professor Herzon, who is able to boil down the very difficult material into a more understandable digest. In addition to his good lecturing ability, he spends time listening to the students and incorporating feedback into the class, making some adjustments that overall improved the class. The biggest weakness with the class is the slow turnaround when it comes to feedback, meaning that it can be difficult to know how a student is doing and changes that they may need to make.",
    "This course is the best I've ever taken",
    "Like drinking from a firehose. Dr. Herzon is a synthetic wizard and does an amazing job of making the material approachable and interesting.",
    "It was a lot of material thrown at us at once, which made it very hard to succeed. It was overwhelming. I thought having the final be take home was actually very useful and allowed me to think through my answers clearly.",
    "This course covers a lot of topics in organic chemistry. However, I wish there had more problem solving.",
    "I really enjoyed the level of difficulty associated with the class. I learned a ton and think it is a great class for any senior chemistry major to take.",
    "The course gave us opportunities to see a myriad of reactions, but the applicability of the reactions was a bit limited. Some of them applied only in very specific conditions; this made it seem a bit pointless to learn them, because there weren't any places to utilize them.",
    "Midterm was incredibly hard. Liked the takehome exam at the end. Liked the extended problem sets.",
    "The problem sets were very useful as they force you to look at complex problems during the semester, something which I'm usually not very good at. Plus, Seth is simply a very good lecturer. At first the speed was a bit too high, and I feel a lot of students were struggling with that. Seth took note, but after it was a little bit too slow sometimes. Right in between would be perfect.",
    "We learn so much in this course and I think they are all valuable resources for our studies. But because of the sheer amount of information we are given we dont have the chance to apply everything in problem sets or exams on our own."

   "comments": [
    "This class is essential to any student continuing their studies in organic chemistry.",
    "yes, definitely if you want to be a better synthetic chemist",
    "absolutely, only if interested in pursuing organic route",
    "I would recommend this class to another student with a caveat. The class is overwhelming on some level with the amount of material that students are expected to learn. In addition, the class is dedicated to a very narrow goal, and while it does an excellent job, this can be an issue if you are not sure that natural product synthesis is something that you have a deep passion and interest for. The workload is not too bad with the amount of problem sets, but they tend to take a while and the exams can be difficult.",
    "This course is awesome. You should take it if you want to do organic chemistry",
    "Challenging but rewarding.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, if they were focused on synthesis. Otherwise, no. This is not a good course for getting organic chemistry background, but it's a great course for learning more in depth synthetic transformations\/methods",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Don't be scared by the work load. If you love chemistry you should one hundred percent take this class. You will learn so much.",
    "I don't think I would specifically recommend this course to another student. I would say \"I guess take this course if you need to. It's gonna suck, but you'll survive\", but I would NOT say \"You should definitely take this course\".",
    "Yes! You learn so much in such a short amount of time.",
    "Definitely. This is the course I learned most from this semester.",
    "Yes I think it was a very helpful course for organic track students."
