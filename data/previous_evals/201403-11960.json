    "I would recommend as a good way to get L5 if you are still working on your Spanish and want to learn some interesting materials about the law at the same time.",
    "I would recommend it, if you can get in. There are ample opportunities to speak if you try to, although it can be a little intimidating. You will learn a lot about the law and have a lot of opportunities to write responses for homework, which do improve your writing skills. Prof. Carreras is very well-liked.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who needs a 5th class that is fairly easy and pretty interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Definitely! Take it!",
    "A great overview of law in spanish-speaking countries.the workload is very managable and Prof. Carreras is very friendly, brilliant, and fun.",
    "I would take this course if you are interested in using Spanish in a legal setting in the future or if you simply want to keep up with your Spanish.",
    "Take it!",
    "Great class! Best L5 class to take - helps you think about differences in law in different countries. You will receive as much help as you ask for and learn to formulate complex opinions in Spanish.",
    "Yes! Best way to fulfill a Spanish credit.",
    "I think this is overall a good course for a student looking to improve their Spanish skills (particularly their written skills) in a causal learning environment. Professor Carreras really cares about her students, and she supplements class discussion with videos and interactive items. I looked forward to going to class each morning and felt like I learned something new about the legal system each day.",
    "Good background of what law is and the different types. I learned a lot of things I didn't necessarily knew about in English before because I wasn't exposed to law and legal classes before."
