    "Definitely take it, but preferably as a senior when you do not have to take many other classes and when your classes will be more chill. This is a very time-intensive class because I poured a lot of time into my paintings before I was satisfied (and even then, it's hard to be satisfied with them). It was my first formal art class and I loved it. However, it is not very well organized and you don't really know when paintings are due until right before the next class. You also have no idea what your grades are, and we didn't seem to really seem to follow the syllabus (or at least we forget about it completely). That said, it was a very meaningful class. It has made me really appreciate art and my surroundings, and I wish I'd had more opportunities to paint.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "This class is fun and will get you painting! Definitely take it. You'll learn everything you need to develop a life-long love of painting. Prof Dyson is very caring but the class is very disorganized and she can be impatient and demanding. She would get frustrated at us for not painting in the right way.",
    "Fun class, and a great opportunity to produce a lot of paintings. Most materials were paid for by Yale, which was great. That said, the course was very disorganized. We never knew when paintings were due, and instructions for assignments were very unclear. Just a heads up, if you are the kind of person who likes everything to be scheduled!"
