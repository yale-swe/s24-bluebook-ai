   "comments": [
    "This is a great survey course on the Qur'an - you'll read from the Qur'an itself, learn about comparisons between the Qur'an and the Hebrew Bible\/New Testament, look at receptions of the Qur'an by Muslims and non-Muslims, and a whole lot more. I would definitely recommend this course to students trying to learn more about the Qur'an.",
    "I learned about orientalism and its role in the western interpretation of the Qur'an.",
    "I learned a lot of survey information about the Qur'an, its origins, and its interpretation. We worked with the source text and many secondary and tertiary sources. We also worked on writing and forming clear theses. Perhaps the most important thing that I drew from this course was the message of the fluidity, variety, and dynamism of Islam and the Qur'an.",
    "Having had minimal exposure to the Quran prior, I learned how the text came to be codified as well as its historical polemical uses. I also was exposed to some Islamic theological concepts tied with Quaranic interpretation and etiquette.",
    "I developed more insight than ever into the evolution and history of Islam. I left with a clearer understanding of the fundamental debates in the religion, in the present and in the past.",
    "Not sure i developed many skills. Regarding knowledge, I learned a lot about the Quran.",
    "I developed a much more academic understanding of the Quran and its complex history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is the various perspectives and approaches to the Qur'an that it covers. In terms of weaknesses, it would have been great to spend more time in the second half of the Qur'an reading from the actual Qur'an or doing a week on tafseer.",
    "The biggest concern with this course is that we never were really introduced to the text of the Qur'an. We never read the entire text of the Qur'an and spent more time on Western philology than what the Qur'an actually talks about and its importance to Islam. I took this course as a way of interacting with powerful literature and found myself in a course about hermeneutics and epistemology. The fact that we read more Western commentaries than Muslim ones is saddening to me. Another difficulty was with the exams and the vocabulary lists which were unwieldy to a non-Arabic speaker. The lectures were organized well and we did cover a good swatch of interpretations and meanings.",
    "This course was a very strong course. It was a very interactive lecture, with engaging readings, discussion questions once a week, and a great professor. I learned a lot of interesting facts and important facts. This course somehow managed to balance information that was general enough and intricate enough to be accessible and engaging to students with and without Islamic backgrounds. I think the course could be improved by slightly more structured lectures, slightly more explicit assignments, and fewer vocabulary terms.",
    "I think the courses strength were it's use of material in the Beinecke as well as the various readings we had. Some weaknesses might be making the Arabic terms accessible to students as well as inundating students with terms that were not discussed.",
    "This course would be improved by calling it something like \"Materiality of the Qur'an\" rather than \"Intro to the Qur'an.\" I was really hoping to read the Qur'an in this class and talk about its theological and historical content which did not turn out to be what the course was about. If the course is meant to be an introduction to the Qur'an, it should be changed so that we actually read the whole thing. We read no more than 10 percent of the Qur'an, and we did not have very serious discussions of those parts. I'm not sure I got much more familiar with the contents of the Qur'an during this class, with the exception of the week we spent on eschatology and the Meccan suras. Generally we should have read more primary sources rather than modern analysis, particularly as we spent the first two weeks talking about the failures of orientalist scholarship. This course needs a better handle on its objectives. It wasn't clear what we were supposed to be learning week to week, and so most weeks we didn't learn very much. Even if this was a class on the materiality of the Qur'an, we got a pretty muddled picture, often because we didnt have enough background to understand the articles we were reading or what the professor was talking about. On the other hand, sometimes the class was pitched too low, and the professor was intent on disabusing the class (many if not most of whom had taken a class on Islam before) of misconceptions we did not have about Islam.",
    "The course did a good job of introducing me to the field of religious studies and aspects of Islamic studies that I had not before studied, like tafsir and progressive Qur'anic scholarship. Loved the Beinecke visit -- would be better to focus on 3-4 manuscripts and spend more time on them. Looking at so many felt like a bit of a marathon. Awesome that Prof. Zadeh learned all of our names and took the time to specifically mention our ideas and comments on the readings in class. Improvements -- The vocab lists included far too many terms. This made studying difficult because it was hard to discern what was actually important and worth researching online from what wasn't. -- The vocab also gave an edge to people who already know Arabic, which felt frustrating if you weren't among them. -- The lists also included terms that were never mentioned in class, or perhaps were mentioned just in passing. And such terms were on the midterm\/final. This is frustrating because it requires us to spend a lot of time during test preparation looking up words online instead of focusing on the readings\/themes\/etc. --Lecture often felt a little disorganized and I felt difficulty in discerning the main thrust of what Professor Zadeh was arguing. --Section on Friday isn't great in terms of timing --The paper assignment felt confusing because we were supposed to make an original argument that could be disproved, while also drawing from the class readings. It seems that an original argument is more likely to come from a full research paper than a paper just based off of 3-4 readings. More guidance before the paper on what successful arguments would look like would have been helpful. -- The midterm take home assignment essay advantaged people who were already familiar with the material.",
    "This course is unfortunately very disorganized and the expectations are not clear at all."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student - it's a great introduction to the Qur'an, and Professor Zadeh knows the material inside and out.",
    "I don't think I'd recommend this course if it were taught the same way. I did not learn about the Qur'an in any meaningful way.",
    "I would recommend this class regardless of background. This class was incredibly informing and relevant to today's issues. Professor Zadeh is incredibly enthusiastic, informed, and accessible. Some days I left the class bursting to tell other students about the things that I had learned in it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, but I would still encourage them to engage in Islamic studies or Arabic prior to the course to enhance their learning.",
    "In general this course is not sure what it wants to achieve and doesn't work as either an introductory or more advanced class on Islam. The requirements of the class were unclear and weird, with exams on long vocab lists with Arabic terms we never discussed mixed in with terms like \"justice,\" \"patriarchy,\" \"colonialism.\" We didn't learn very much about the Qur'an and didn't read most of it. We read very few texts at all from the Islamic tradition, although we did look at some manuscripts and calligraphy. If you want a class on the material Qur'an, this is an ok class. If you want to read the Qur'an or learn about Islamic theology or history, this not the class for you.",
    "It's a good class that will give you insight into the history and fundamental debates in Islam. The class spends less time on the Qur'an itself and more on the development of the religion over time. Professor Zadeh is warm and approachable, but sometimes glosses over terms\/concepts you might not understand if you don't speak Arabic or aren't familiar with this material already. Lecture was usually good, but was sometimes hard to follow if you are coming in with little background.",
    "Unfortunately not. If you are looking to learn about Islam, there are more comprehensive courses with clearer expectations.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a very good, broad, expansive exposure to the Quran and its history. Professor Zadeh truly makes it an enjoyable experience."
