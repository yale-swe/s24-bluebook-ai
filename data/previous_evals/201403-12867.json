    "I would recommend Medieval Biography to any student who is interested in learning more about how people tell the stories of other people. Many of the texts are about Christian figures, and learning about their lives might not appeal to everyone, but if you're interested in the underlying discussion of the relationship between storytellers and stories, then this class is definitely worthy of your consideration. Creative writers of all stripes can learn important lessons here.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone is interested in the way biographies are written, especially in a time period that is far removed from our own. Most of the coursework involved readings about religious and political figures from the medieval ages. There were two papers and a fun final project that involved a class trip to do research in a rare books library.",
    "The best class. A few words: Section dynamics are important in a class this small. Know what you're getting yourself into. Sometimes homework assignments are added, changed, or dropped with little warning. If you have a full schedule, that might be stressful for you. Professor Butterfield is the best ever. She has high standards, and she will demand that you think clearly. Ask for her advice every chance you get. The Middle Ages are the best!",
    "Please please please take this class! I promise you, you will love it! For some reason, people are not excited by the thought of reading medieval biographies. However, the material we read in this class is the most interesting and fun I have read in any class. The medieval figures we encountered were so quirky and interesting. We also studied their afterlives, which was a really fascinating angle. Professor Butterfield is the best. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "Two papers, and a substantial final project, but the final work is done with the rest of the class as a group project of sorts. There is a lot of reading at times, but for the most part, the material is interesting, especially Joan of Arc, the subject of the final project."
