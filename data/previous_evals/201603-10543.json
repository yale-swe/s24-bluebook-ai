    "I learned how to write in a clearly structured way.",
    "I learned how to distill long and difficult historical texts into clear take-away messages and to grapple with differences between classical authors. I also learned how to manage a ton of reading.",
    "I think I improved at seeing larger trends that spanned multiple works and reappeared throughout the history we studied. I also think I got better at distinguishing between the works of different authors. I also think I improved in my ability to read and pick out the important or significant details.",
    "I gained a wide exposure to classical texts and was able to improve my writing skills. I also learned several important \"donts\" and was able to improve my analytical skills as a result.",
    "I learned how to write a better argument paper, how to synthesize different historical & political philosophy sources into a streamlined analysis, and how to look at a text more directly rather than from 30,000 feet up.",
    "This class helps in reading, writing, and discussing history. My writing improved a lot through this course, as did my ability to read a text and find what is important in it.",
    "I learned to analyze historical and political texts not only for factual information, but also stylistic nuances and implications; construct directed arguments in papers through careful examination of form and structure; form and vocalize opinions and personal interpretations of texts.",
    "Overview of ancient western history and political thought."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was never enough time to deeply examine anything.",
    "I found the DS H&P reading list to be really interesting. Section discussion was also engaging. However, the lectures were sometimes a bit boring.",
    "All strengths. Loved the books and the prof and the way it fit in with the other DS courses.",
    "I thought that most of the material we read was very interesting. I do think that we moved too quickly from work to work which made it hard to fully understand and absorb information from each work.",
    "H&P is great because it has the most explicitly \"real-world\" focus. The content and seminar discussions deal most directly with modern issues. However, more so than any other DS course, DS H&P has the longest and most unwieldy reading assignments. As a result it was difficult to fully complete the reading assignments in a reasonable time frame.",
    "The main weakness of the course was the strangeness of the curriculum- it was half historical writing and half political philosophy. Also, we did not go in depth into any of the works- we focused on the major points. Because of that, however, we did get a fantastic overarching understanding of historical and political thought, and were able to see the many threads through the works.",
    "This class provides a good foundation with the Western cannon, and I know that the texts we read will help me with things I read in the future. Also, the emphasis on discussion in class helped us come up with ideas about the reading and articulate them. Since this course is a survey course, we could not have discussed all of the reading in depth.",
    "Overall, a really engaging course taught by a professor who is very knowledgeable",
    "Strengths of this course include the intimate discussion sections, the investment of the students, and the appropriate choices of interrelated texts. The course could perhaps be improved by reducing the amount of reading and introducing variety in the assignments for the class.",
    "Strengths: Incredible professor (Prof. Charles Hill). Very broad scope."

    "If the reading list seems interesting to you, then you'll likely get a lot out of this course. The readings are the backbone of DS, and if you don't do those you probably won't enjoy the coursework. Professor Hill is really bright and engaging, and I enjoyed hearing his commentary on the works we read. However, if you have Professor Hill, you will probably find your H&P discussion section to be one of the more quiet\/less conversational sections. Professor Hill is not a particularly hard grader on essays, although he is fairly rigid on essay format and guidelines, without always making his specifications clear at the outset. Overall, I enjoyed this section and think most students would as well.",
    "Certainly. DS is fantastic, you should take it. It may be the best part of your collegiate intellectual experience.",
    "Without a doubt.",
    "Based on interest in the subject matter, I would recommend this course to someone who both enjoys this material and likes to draw connections between many works without diving too deeply into their individual meanings.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, as long as they are prepared to do copious amounts of reading. If you do most of the reading and engage in seminar discussions, you will feel as though you have a better meta understanding of politics.",
    "Absolutely, it is a lot of reading but totally worth it. I have such a better understanding of ancient political thought and history than I thought I could.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a good background in the Western cannon. The writing in the essays, the reading, and the discussions all helped me improve in each area.",
    "It's an experience.",
    "I would recommend this course (and Directed Studies) to any student who wishes to explore the humanities and who is willing to fully assume the hefty workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course for those interested. The combination of lectures, seminars, and essays encompasses the three fundamental ways of learning and thinking: listening, speaking, and writing. This course will change the way you think and see the world. :)"
