   "comments": [
    "I would summarize Latin 465 as a very good course taught by an excellent professor. For me, it was an especial pleasure to read verse composed after the Augustan period. The course was more discussion-based (vs. translation-based) than any other Latin course that I have taken at Yale. I would strongly recommend it to other students, especially to those not previously exposed to literature from the Neronian period.",
    "Take it! Not easy (L5), but really interesting, lots of discussion of poetics, style, allusions, meaning of the poem. Not as much checking of translations, except important passages and student questions. Don't be scared by the graduate students!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was a fun class.",
    "This class is a lot of work but definitely worth it, I learned a lot and loved it.",
    "This class primarily examined Lucan's Bellum Civile and its place within the genre of epic. In particular, we took a lot of time to examine the text as a sort of \"anti-Aeneid,\" where the plot sort of \"unravels\" the progress made by Aeneas in his journey. This was a truly enjoyable class, and although the weekly reading load can be heavy at times, I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys reading Latin."
