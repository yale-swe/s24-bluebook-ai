    "Question 6-7: The only field trip to the museum was very interesting and provided a different way of thinking about representation of nature. I hope there had been more field trips from this class.",
    "Question 10. Prof. Doolittle has been incredibly generous. Her guidance has been key in designing a research project for my MESc that promises to be successful. Working with Prof. Doolittle I feel confident of the success of my two years at FES. Without her, I probably would have been lost.",
    "In response to q. 2: I wish that more of the assignments had been more directly about preparing for writing the proposal. Writing the final proposal was of course helpful, but I feel that aside from the lit review, I was having to come up with most of it from scratch. It would have been great if we had had to write sections about methodology, etc, as homework assignments, so that we would have been able to get feedback on them.",
    "Professor Doolittle was exceptional. She is clearly dedicated to the class and her students, as evidenced by the amount of time she put into structuring her lectures and providing feedback on assignments. She made herself frequently accessible for office hours as well.I learned a significant amount from the class and it proved extremely useful for coming up with a model research proposal for grant-writing purposes.Kendall, the TF, was also helpful, providing copious feedback on the proposal and other assignments. It was also great to have her insight as a person who has applied for and received grants, as well as carried out qualitative research.",

You just have to start, adapt and don't worry about getting it perfect on the first go round because that's nearly impossible.",
    "The literature review was KEY. Through this assignment I both became well read in my area of interest, and learned how to build an argument upon current research. These two lessons are essential for my success at FES.",
    "Final proposal.",
    "General coverage of qualitative techniques, the progression through writing a research proposal.",
    "I know that having written this proposal will prove to be very helpful in the future, as I apply for various types of funding. It was also good to solidify my research questions throughout the course.",
    "The lectures were great, as were the thought-provoking assignments. I also enjoyed our discussions, which were always dynamic and enthusiastic.",
    "The best aspect of this course were the peer reading groups where 3-4 students read each other's work and improve",
    "I appreciate the different assignments that required us to actually go through each one of them in detail. I especially appreciate the participant observation, the interview and the interview coding. I realized there were more to each one of these exercises and had a new-found appreciation for them."

    "Many good suggestions have been discussed in class",
    "This may not belong in this class, but it would be great to cover more quantitative techniques in the social sciences.",
    "The guest speakers from the library, the IRB, and the survey guy all were weak presentations. I think I have a lot to learn about those subjects. The treatment in the class from these guests was too superficial to be useful.",
    "Perhaps a little more time on the literature review would be helpful. I still feel fairly uncomfortable with this type of work.",
    "There was a lot of survey of techniques--talking about them without really learning about them. I would like more exchange and dialogue between students-- this was a great way to learn and share experiences.",
    "The homework and readings could be more relevant to the actual writing of the proposal. I found that after the first several weeks, the readings were not that relevant. I also wish that we would have had homework assignments that contributed more directly to our proposals (other than the lit review, which of course was very helpful).",
    "Finding ways to better integrate learning data management...these lectures were the most difficult for me to incorporate into my own repertoire---my notes on these things are pretty scattered...",
    "The time allocated for literature review was shorter than it should be. Students could be advised to start literature review starting from the first week.",
    "I think that there should have been a more direct relationship between the assignments and the stage of the research that we did at the time of the assignments. Especially with the different topics and levels of skill and knowledge each of the students had, it will have been very valuable to see the development of our respective researches as we moved along the semester."

    "As an MESc I took this class out of obligation. Still, it proved to be the most valuable class I took this semester. This is the class where I learned to be a grad student. I have been out of school for 8 years before coming back for my masters. I needed to have a place where I could learn HOW to be in school again, or fall behind very quickly. The skills I learned in research in this class have been useful in each of the other classes I took.",

For these people, the progression is good, though more pointed feedback from the instructor would be helpful. It helped me think about issues I am interested in, but ultimately would have been better if I had had a research topic or area already picked out.",

I still feel like most of my final proposal was kind of vague, or at least that I didn't know what was expected of me for most of the sections. So I feel that it would have been great if we had spent more time in class going over proposals step by step...",

    "It was generative to get feedback and talk things over with peers, but because our interests were so disparate,I ended up forming separate peer groups anyway.",
    "Great to get exposure to what classmates were working on and to be able to witness\/support each other through our own processes...it re-affirmed the fluid nature of doing this work. It was also great to meet peers and have the opportunity to get to know each other a bit better and to start recognizing we as scholars can support each other in our work.",
