   "comments": [
    "Calculus of integrals, parametric equations, and series. Difficult and in depth but not impossible.",
    "I would recommend Math 115-04 to those interested. It is a basic math course.",
    "I would recommend students to start out in math 112 because I feel it provides a better foundation, but if you are confident that you can handle math 115 then you should try it out. I would recommend my professor as well because he is very helpful and kind",
    "If you haven't taken BC calc before, do NOT take this course. It goes at super speed. I took BC calc last year, so it was mostly a review for me, but if I were seeing this material for the first time, it would have been nearly impossible. This year, with Professor Rolf, the exams were extremely hard. Students were crying after tests. The test material had nothing to do with the material we covered in homework. I would recommend taking another math course.",
    "Math 115 is what you'd expect to take after a Calc 1 class, which can be a good and a bad thing. Up to the first midterm, the concepts involved require little to no extra work to master, but from then on, things are less straightforward. A solid professor will make this class a lot more manageable, but student initiative is still the main determinant of his success in the class.I'd recommend taking Math 115, simply because it's an integral math class for anyone, regardless of his major. One's understanding of calculus wouldn't be complete without taking this course.",
    "Basic equivalent of Calc BC. Easy to fall behind if you don't consider yourself a math person. There are a lot of resources offered, so take advantage of those. I would not recommend this class for giggles but it seems to be a requirement, in that case you have no choice."
