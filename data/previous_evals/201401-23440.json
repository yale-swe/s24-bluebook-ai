   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if a student was interested in getting a broad picture of what the field bioinformatics entails.",
    "Yes, and it's a required course as well",
    "Yes, I would recommend as the course really covers a lot of knowledge in this field.",
    "A good overview of different areas of bioinformatics",
    "It's a good introduction to bioinformatics and a qualitative introduction to various machine learning techniques. I highly recommend the course, though if you already have a strong stats\/ML background a more challenging course may be more appropriate.",
    "Yes. I enjoyed the focus on conceptual approaches to key problems in computational biology.",
    "CBB 752 is an easy class with boring lectures. I would not recommend it to other students because I do not feel like I was able to learn much in this course.",
    "CBB 752 covers the basic computational methods used to find patterns in large biological data sets and model the structure of a biological molecule.",
    "a must for modern biologists!need lots of after-class work on both computer science content and biology background"

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the field by introducing me to protein folding simulations, a part of computational biology I had no prior experience with.",
    "It exposed me to many aspects of computational biology that I had not previously been exposed to. Further, I learned more about the biology side of computational biology, i.e. experimental protocol.",
    "It covered basically every aspect of the field of bioinformatics. Very useful in the curriculum.",
    "It helps a lot!",
    "It helped me build vocabularies in this field",
    "This course gave me a very broad overview of bioinformatics which was helpful as I had only been previously aware of a few small aspects of the field. It provides me with a much better perspective from which to approach my research.",
    "Improved my understanding of certain topics in computational biology.",
    "This was a very useful class that I plan on incorporating in my PhD work here at Yale."
