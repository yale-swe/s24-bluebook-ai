   "comments": [
    "This course taught me a great deal about gene networks. How these systems may have evolved, what their components are, what the interplay of these components causes at the level of a cell's phenotype, and more. It did this by teaching me how to read biological papers well, and how to present them. I learned a great deal though this journal-club-styled class, and the discussions generated within it. I especially learned how to ask questions about biological papers, and their networks. I was much more able, and the end of the course, to understand the broad narrative strokes of the field and see how any individual paper fit into the framework, as well as how it broadened the scope of the field of Systems Biology.",
    "This course helped develop my skills in reading and presenting on scientific literature, as well as my ability to approach biological problems from a quantitative\/systems perspective. I feel I especially improved in understanding the building blocks of systems biology experiments - model systems, quantitative phenotypes, and control experiments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course hinged upon the strength of its presenters and the discussions, which means that much of your learning is reliant on your fellow students. For the most part, this was great, as it allowed much greater engagement, comprehension, and then the feeling of mastery over the material when you understood something and joined in discussions. It can be detrimental, however, if the students are low-energy, for instance, or if there is a specific point that is not coming intuitively to many in the class, and the discussion slows. Professor Acar did a good job mediating most of this, and he gave great chalk-talks in the beginning of the semester to describe sticking points among the class. These mini-lectures made sure that we generally learned all of the necessary information, and also that we wouldn't miss anything, even if the presenter did. He also provided interesting segues in conversation, or good pointed comments that helped guide discussions towards the key points that he was hoping we would take a way from each paper.",
    "The strength of the course is Professor Acar and the mix of students at the table. We all had different backgrounds, but Professor Acar really knows his stuff - several of the papers covered are his work - and he makes it accessible \/ interesting for everyone. The only real weakness is that the class met on Friday afternoons, so it was tempting to put off reading the papers until the last minute. The final project was also kind of rushed, and it would have been nice to have an extra week to work on it."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class! Hopefully it's not on Friday afternoons again, but it was entirely worth it. I learned a lot about gene networks and their evolution and utility, and thought that class discussions were generally really interesting. The work is reasonable, and the final paper-as-grant-proposal is thought provoking and a great way to work through experiment rationale and protocol.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding what systems biology actually means on the level of academic research. It's not an obvious choice for people who are only interested in medicine or biotechnology, but if you want to know more about how quantitative and computational approaches help biologists understand fundamental components of gene networks, this is the class for you! It's a great upper-level MCDB elective, and is a laid-back opportunity to gain practice really reading and understanding primary literature."
