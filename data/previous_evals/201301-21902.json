   "comments": [
    "Only if you have to.",
    "You're probably going to take this because you need a research methods class and are interested in neuro, so you kind of already know what you're getting into. The class didn't, for me at least, fail to meet my expectations and I thought it was interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student in the neuroscience track of the psychology major. It's a required component, and this class was a manageable way of fulfilling it",
    "Most people that take the class take it for the psychology BS requirement. But that does give you people who are genuinely interested in the topic. The small class atmosphere is nice and the work load really is not that bad.",
    "Yes, the papers are somewhat difficult but the tests are very fair. If you study the material, you will do well. My main qualm is that the course is a 3 hr meeting and can be a bit long winded.",
    "This class is a solid research methods course. You will definitely learn a lot about neuro anatomy and neurons.",
    "I would recommend Psyc 270 to someone who is really interested in Neuro and has a pretty decent background in it, otherwise it might be a bit of a struggle getting through the sometimes difficult material. The papers were very challenging, but at the end of the day I felt like I really learned a lot through this course. Professor Donegan is great and just a really nice guy who is willing to meet with you to answer any questions (take advantage of that, if you can). It is important to REALLY pay attention in lecture and to actually do the readings (there are not that many of them and they really help to clarify the material). The tests were also difficult, but very manageable and reasonable if you TAKE GOOD LECTURE NOTES and DO THE READING.",
    "dopeness. not too much work (couple long papers and first test is kind of hard). great professor.",
    "It's a difficult course. Definitely worth it if you've studied some neuroscience beforehand though. The course really deepens your understanding of those concepts. It was pretty interesting to get a first-hand look at something I had only had a theoretical understanding of before. In the process, you also learn about lab techniques and programs."
