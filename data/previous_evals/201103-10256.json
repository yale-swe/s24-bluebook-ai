    "Wonderful course, with a great mix of mainstream and not-so-mainstream authors. Does a great job tracing the course of critical history, starting with the New Critics and moving through reader-response criticism and New Historicism. Caleb is a very open and available professor, with much to teach -- a great ally and supporter."
