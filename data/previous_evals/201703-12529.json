   "comments": [
    "The seminar offered an introduction to the major figures of the Pliade, namely through careful engagement with their texts. We developed our skills of close reading, of taking a poem on its own terms, but also gained insight in how to bring intertexts to bear on works that were invariably rich, complex, intricate, and studded with allusions.",
    "I learned a great deal about an era and a group of writers, both of which had previously been largely unknown to me. The course was also a wonderful opportunity for me to work on improving skills in close reading and concise analytical writing.",
    "This course provided me the opportunity to read a lot of poetry I had not previously studied in depth. I gained a sense of the poets who were part of La Pliade and their relationships to one another. This included an understanding of ancient sources upon which members of La Pliade drew. This course augmented my sense of the importance of the ancient literary tradition to 16th-century French poets. I finished this course with an improved sense of confidence in reading and interpreting 16th-century French poetry."

   "comments": [
    "The course was excellent; my only suggestion would be to allow more time for the sudent prestentations, since the amount of material that needed to be covered was quite vast!",
    "Strengths of this course included a well-designed structure, a flexible set of options for graded assignments, beautiful material, and thorough poetic analyses. Professor Duval gave thoughtful critiques of our writing throughout the course and this was most beneficial. Through no fault of the professor, this course was challenging in that each student came to it with varied backgrounds, some more experienced than others in 16th-century poetry. A bibliography with a few references for extra reading to level this discrepency could have helped remedy this, though I suppose this is often the case in graduate-level courses."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The seminar is also a unique opportunity to work on competancy in spoken and written academic french.",
    "I would recommend any of Professor Duval's courses, as he so clearly commits to helping students improve their writing and his knowledge of his subject seems infinitely vast. The course itself provides a solid foundation for reading La Pliade poetry. I would encourage anyone who takes this course to come with strong reading knowledge of French; Greek and Latin help significantly as does any previous familiarity with the poets of La Pliade."
