    "I'd recommend DS to students who are willing to read a lot and who enjoy discussions, but not to all students.",
    "Despite what I said about the reading load (being too big), I would recommend this course as a good introductory survey of the great philosophers. Just beware that you will spend very little time with any of them individually.",
    "Bruno is a very chill person. He is a great listener, and he is always able to demystify certain topics. Philosophy can often be very complex, but Bruno was able to bring forth many valuable insights that people had not thought to consider. If you have an idea, he is incredibly respectful of your opinion and considers it regardless of what it is (as a true philosopher does). Discussions were insightful but many times unproductive, partly because we got off track on unrelated tangents too much, and partly because people were allowed to speak too often without raising their hands. Bruno is very good at being open to your ideas, but sometimes this also feels directionless. This may be because of the nature of philosophy, but it would have at least been helpful to know how on or off track we were. The texts in this class are often difficult and not fun to read. There is only so much that you can take of trying to figure out what a potentiality and actuality is and how it relates to the soul and body. This class made me realize that I was not as into philosophy as I thought I was, but I'm grateful for the skills I learned in it. Bruno's comments on papers are always thorough and helpful, though they are sometimes logic puzzles in themselves. He is also a bit of a slow grader, but this is usually understandable given the thoroughness of his comments.",
    "Students read Western and Western-inspired authors of philosophy, beginning with Plato and spanning thousands of years. In class you will discuss the selections you were assigned to read and every three or four weeks you'll write an essay concerning the works you've read. I would recommend this class, for sure. The subject material is very engaging and interesting and the professors bring a lot of clarity to that material.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "DS 003 is a wonderful introductory course in philosophy and philosophical thinking, and as such I would definitely recommend the course!",
    "Philosophy in DS focuses simply on analyzing the structure of arguments. Whittle always did an awesome job explaining things we didn't understand, even though his general tone was always a bit condescending (in a humorous way, fitting the tone of my particular section). His comments on papers,however, were very nice and always extremely thorough and helpful.",
    "A challenging class, but so are all the other Directed Studies Classes. It is important to always do the reading or at least most of it.",
    "Take philosophy, it's a survey of classical and early christian philosophical texts.",
    "DS Philosophy is a course that looks over some of the most important pre-Renaissance work of philosophy and helps us develop a foundation that allows us to see how other thinkers build on their work. I would recommend it to students who would like to have a greater knowledge of philosophy or who would like to focus on Plato or Aristotle."
