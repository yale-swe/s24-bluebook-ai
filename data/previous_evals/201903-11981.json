    "I learned a lot about the origins of hip hop and got to explore a lot of new music through recommendations from classmates, from the playlists we submitted, and from the class discussions. I was exposed to a lot of documentaries that I never would've known about without this class.",
    "I learned about hip hop history and a diversity of music tastes.",
    "In this class I was able to learn about aspects of hip hop - such as graffiti and break dancing - that were crucial to its development but often overlooked.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of hip-hop, and how to participate in that history.",
    "amazing course!",
    "learned more about hip-hop's history especially in coordination with social movements and other forms of art (breakdancing, etc.). also learned more about music just generally and found new artists to listen to",
    "An overview of and a greater appreciation for hip hop culture (not just music but b-boying, graffiti, sampling, The Culture, etc.)",
    "I learned so so so so much about history and culture of hip hop. Great visual aids, learned an incredible amount",
    "Reframed how I thought about hip hop and the history of music. Really useful insights into the layered musical trajectories of hip hop, helped me think about the genre in its larger context."

   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this class is that it's low stress and allowed me to explore more creative projects that I never would have been able to otherwise. I think it structured great and should stay the same for future years.",
    "Strengths: Chill, fun, engaging, relaxed, free-flowing Weaknesses: There should be more \"classroom type\" readings, discussions, etc. since discussion went tangential sometimes",
    "Although the class at times lacked a definitive structure, I do not feel as though it was a weakness. The lack of an overarching structure allowed for an ever-evolving conversation to take place during class, which I feel helped me learn the material in a more complete way.",
    "I loved it. It was very different compared to most of the other courses I have taken at Yale. The material was awesome and I was always engaged.",
    "the strengths are Nick as a professor who is endlessly kind and generous (he bought us Mac Miller candles and tix to a Danny Brown concert !!) and encourages students to learn from each other, which is a rare feat. the class could have used more structure but in some ways i think this is good in that it allows for the class to adjust to what students want to discuss, and i think that's a strong point for something that's as modern and ever-changing as hip-hop.",
    "I might be biased, but I don't think this class had any weaknesses. Just take the course already!",
    "No weaknesses. Best class ever at yale and throughout my entire academic career.",
    "Would love to hear Nick start out classes with and half hour or hour long lecture. He knows so much and sometimes I think listening to him before we started discussions would help us build off of the readings better."

    "Yes! This class gave me a stress-free, comfortable environment where we explored music and the origins and evolution of hip hop. This is a perfect 5th class and made my senior fall so much better. The workload is very light but the assignments\/class discussions\/projects were always exciting and engaging. It's the perfect gut",
    "I would recommend this class to another student due to both the course material and the professor. In addition to extremely interesting and always entertaining subject matter, Professor Conway was extremely passionate and this came out in his teaching. His love of hip hop and teaching created a close-knit and enjoyable class environment that made an incredibly positive impact on my semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Nick is a great instructor who facilitates a low-stress environment and interesting discussions. Learned a good deal about the history of hip hop and also gained insights on hip-hop and culture today",
    "Yes, but only if they are interested in Hip Hop.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes! take it for Nick and to learn from your peers, to expose yourself to more music and the history of hip-hop.",
    "If you love contemporary rap music\/hip hop, if you hate contemporary rap\/old school hip hop...take this course!! Regardless of your knowledge, Nick makes everyone feel welcomed. Favorite class and best professor I've met at Yale so farhe clearly cares about all of his students and takes the time to get to know you beyond a superficial level.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! A great fifth or fourth and a half class that will make you listen more carefully to hip hop, explore new music, and appreciate the stuff you already listen to more."
