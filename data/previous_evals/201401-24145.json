    "The model was helpful to discuss the material and think about issues raised in previous seminars but some of the seminars were unrelated or not even very globally focused.",
    "Good exposure to different people and topics in global health; wish the group was smaller and there was more interaction.",
    "Seminar is a total misnomer. This is a lecture where you listen to professionals and researchers in global health and learn whatever they have to offer. There is nothing in the way of a curriculum or certain goals that they aim to teach. Instead it is more of an exercise in what their research is and tells us.",
    "Very good exposure to a variety of topics",
    "Really interesting speakers this semester. It was great hearing from a range of distinguished professionals.",
    "The seminar was very interesting and touched on a lot of important global health topics. For the most part, the speakers were great.",
    "The quality of speakers and topics needs improvement.",
    "This class exposed me to different topics in global health, as well as many of the leaders in global health. The modules were more interesting this semester and the speakers covered a wide range of disciplines. I enjoyed the chronic disease focus this semester.",
    "Good seminar series, interesting speakers",
    "Good course. No improvements needed",
    "Great presenters",
    "great! love it",
    "It was nice to get dinner and listen to an interesting talk. However, I wish that attendance wasn't mandatory during midterms and finals. We all we stressed that we had to stay in class so late when we had so many things due. As a result, many students are forced to do work during class.",
    "Good course",
    "The course had great speakers and was well-organized. I just wish there were more people in the course because the lecture hall is always so empty!",
    "A great survey seminar in selected global health topics.",
    "Overall good. La Palestra guy did not belong.",
    "The lecturers this semester varied from excellent to poor. The Global Health Working Group should focus on bringing in less \"pop culture\"-esque lecturers and more on those with a rich global health background."

    "Some times it is annoying to have to go every week, especially if the week's topic or speaker doesn't really interest you. However, I would recommend the concentration overall if you think you are going to work internationally at any point in your life.",
    "Don't take it unless you want the Global Health Concentration. It's really a waste of time since there is no curriculum or learning objectives. But they do feed you so that's nice.",
    "Very useful to anyone wanting to work in the field of global health.",
    "Loved it.",
    "If you are interested in global health, this is a great course to get a wide overview of the important issues. We heard some amazing talks and it was worth the time.",
    "The course provides broad coverage of topics in global health and invites great guest speakers every week to talk about their experiences and areas of expertise. Easy but very informative class.",
    "This course introduced me to many topics and organizations in global health.",
    "Recommend it!",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Great way to expose students to international work and efforts.",
    "- Would like to see more global health management related lecturers",
    "It's a forced requirement. I wish this wasn't the case. You are only allowed to have one absence, which is difficult considering how late this class runs on Mondays.",
    "Wish there was more of a presence by Rafael",
    "Definitely take it- you can make some good connections to organizations, professors, and outside researchers that you never would have had the opportunity to make otherwise.",
    "It's a useful seminar for students in any number of disciplines and worth taking the time to attend if interested.",
    "n\/a",
    "Good course that provides a broad overview of the field of global health.",
    "I would recommend this to those who want a broad introduction into global health issues. There's a variety of topics covered and the speakers are usually interesting."
