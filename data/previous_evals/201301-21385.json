    "This is the capstone course in (what is in my opinion) the best statistics sequence for the social sciences at Yale. It is a great course to take to cement your understanding of what assumptions we rely on to make causal inferences across a number of different research designs.",

    "Now when I sit in seminars and job-talks I feel much more confident asking questions and thinking about the assumptions behind the speaker's research design.",
    "I haven't had a chance to learn about experiments before. But through this class, I read several experiments articles, dealt with real experiment data, and replicated the analysis in the papers. These series of experiences gave me a good sense of experiments, and now I'm coming up with a survey experiment. So clearly this course contributed to my research a lot."
