    "You don't have a choice! But the class is awesome: you bond with your fellow majors and trusty professor, workshop evolving essay ideas, and practice public speaking. It's like a feminist toastmaster's club (google it) with snacks.",
    "This course is mainly self-driven. It gives you time, place, and support to prepare your senior thesis.",
    "well if you're a WGSS major you're going to take this, and if you aren't then you won't. For curious WGSS majors: with Joe, this course was part WGSS support group, part book club, and part mini-Mellon forum. It's low stress but very helpful, especially if you put in more work to your presentations. If nothing else, you'll come out of it feeling much more confident at public speaking.",
    "This was an amazing course! You basically get to hang out with the other senior WGSS majors, who are wonderful people, and the DUS (which if it's Joe Fischel is also a wonderful person). You do important work but it's not stressful. It's supportive and fun and really gets the ball rolling on your senior essay!"
