    "I would not recommend spanish 110 to another student unless they really wanted to learn spanish because of the difficulty of starting a language",
    "Good if you want to learn a lot very quickly; be prepared to put in consistent, daily work",
    "Great course. This teacher is awesome.",
    "SPAN 110 was a solid introductory Spanish course. The class was organized and straightforward, and the teacher was always clear about her expectations for us. The every-day format, though somewhat consuming, was helpful for consistent Spanish exposure and thus better learning. I had never taken Spanish before, in contrast to about 80% of the class, but I was able to manage decently. I think my Latin background helped a lot with conjugating, agreement, etc. Professor Garcia was nice, straightforward, approachable, and understandable. She was great for an intro Spanish class! If you are set on taking Spanish, this class is fine, even if you haven't taken it before. I'll have to see if the same holds for L2, though...",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a good starting point or review for any spanish student. Garcia is an awesome teacher and a really good person.",
    "Spanish 110 is pretty fast-paced introduction to the language. It can be hard for first-time learners, since most students already have some background in the Spanish. The homework that is required each night is pretty light and can usually be finished in ten minutes or less. If this is your first time learning the language, however, be sure to spend some extra time practicing and reviewing for the quizzes. If you do a fair amount of studying, you should be able to do fine."
