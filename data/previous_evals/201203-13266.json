    "Overall, it's an okay course. It's pretty easy, especially if you go to the problem sessions. There are 2 take-home exams, a problem set every week or so, and then a final paper (8-10 pages, single-spaced). It's not a lot of work, and you don't really need to go to class to do well. I say just take it.",
    "Yes, I recommend.",
    "While the course description says it is an \"overview\" of many different topics in biosensing and bioimaging, it is really just a lot of NMR and MRI. Dr. Sigworth's lectures on optical sensing were fascinating, but probably not worth an entire semester's worth of work."
