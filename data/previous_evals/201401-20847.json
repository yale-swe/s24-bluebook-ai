    "Definitely take it if you have prior romance language experience!",
    "I would recommend ITAL 125 01 to any student who is even remotely interested in Italian or a romance language. It is a great course! Definitely worth the early morning wake up.",
    "I'll put a long review below. But here's the essential bit: This class is 130 hours of a fat woman yelling at you. In exchange, you reach an infantile level of Italian. Even if you think you want to go to Siena, or you love Italian: don't do it! Chiodo's 125 is miserable. Also, it's first thing every morning. You might say to yourself \"I'll tough it out, because, hey, Siena.\" You don't know what it's like! 2 hours of this misery every morning, and every day will start you out in a terrible mood. All semester. Hopefully that's enough for you to not take the class. But if you need more: To begin,Carol Chiodo says everything at a yell. Everything. You may not believe this to be possible. I didn't either. But it's true. Her vocal tone is unbearable. In other news, the 1\/2 Intensive sequence has been moved to the spring semester. Seems innocuous. However, that shift reveals the priorities of this class: not to learn Italian, but to prepare students for a summer party in Siena. Mrs. Chiodo also teaches the summer session classes abroad, and thus has no need to prepare students for more rigorous future study. She is the next teacher to have her students, so whatever middling level of Italian proficiency they manage to achieve is fully acceptable. As one may imagine, the standards of performance in this class are accordingly low. You will spend about 130 hours in the classroom for these two credits, and those 130 hours will show you a new level of academic misery. Most days go by without a single teaching moment. Expect ridiculous group exercises, movies in class, getting out early most days for lack of material, and general academic inefficacy. Your entire knowledge of Italian grammar and vocabulary comes from reading a textbook and doing exercises in a workbook. Save yourself the 130 hours of boredom and fill out the workbook yourself \u2013 if you do it all in one go, you\u2019ll end up better at Italian than most students in the class. Now, even as the class nears its end, most students have no grasp of correct Italian pronunciation. Mrs. Chiodo does not correct even the most blatant mispronunciations, and her pronunciation is hardly the model one would choose for correct spoken Italian. English is spoken in class every day; because the average Italian level is so low, students use English as a facultative language to clarify assignments and exercises in class. You also get to look forward to Mrs. Chiodo\u2019s personal insecurities and psychological problems playing themselves out in class. She seems quite defensive of her Italian ability, perhaps due to doubts in her past. Her Italian level is fine for beginning students \u2013 the main problem is that she feels the need to prove herself constantly. Expect all sorts of little power games: gloating over student errors, refusing to admit her own mistakes, side comments about how Yale students are some way or another. Furthermore, Mrs. Chiodo is as a rule unable to understand student questions and to provide alternative explanations for difficult concepts. She frequently answers the question she believes a student to be asking instead of listening and responding to a student\u2019s actual concerns.",
    "ITAL 125 is a good way to learn all the basic Italian grammar quickly. I would recommend it for those who do not want to spend 2 semesters on fairly simple material (especially if they have already taken another romance language).",
    "A fast-paced and fin class to help learn the basics of Italian. It takes a lot of work outside of class, but is worth it."
