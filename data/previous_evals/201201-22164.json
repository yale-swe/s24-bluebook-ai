   "comments": [
    "Yes but it is incredibly challenging.",
    "YES if you need an easy QR and enjoy philosophy, TAKE THIS.The first PSET may be a little difficult, but just stick it through because the rest are easy.",
    "I'm torn on how to describe this class. On one hand, I often found some of the philosophical ideas being discussed to be verging on silly or unenlightening (being a physics major might have something to do with my opinions on some of this), but then there were times when a paradox or idea would spark me to think and question my assumptions. Even if I disagreed with a paradox, I would have to think about why, and this was a good exercise for me. I also think this class gave me a further appreciation for why the universe is the way it is (having limits on infinite division of space and time as in quantum theory, limits on speed as the speed of light, etc.) because now I can see the difficult paradoxes that arise if we try to assume that we can do these infinite things. At other times, though, I would just think the ideas we were talking about were so divorced from reality as to be almost pointless.",
    "Do not take it. I would not recommend this class to anyone unless they absolutely have to get both a QR credit and a E&M distribution requirement done in one class. Even in the latter case I would strongly advise against it.",
    "Infinity is an interesting class about historical paradoxes that provided a fairly solid introduction to philosophic discussion and argument. This class is sometimes a little recursive, and while it is perfectly non-major friendly, the discussion can get a little pedantic.",
    "I would recommend this course only to those with a particular mathematical interest in infinity. While I had hoped for some sort of broader philosophical implications, the class seemed interested only in physically impossible hypothetical scenarios and metaphysical theories.",
    "This course was a great introduction to philosophy for math\/science oriented people like myself. I found that it helped me better understand how to think and argue in a philosophical context, while exploring topics both familiar and exciting to me (mathematical)",
    "You don't go far enough in depth into either the math or the philosophy for the course to ever be very interesting.",
    "PHIL 281 is an introduction to the study of paradoxes involving the concept of infinity. The course starts pretty basic and goes over some issues involving infinite sums (which will be pretty straightforward to those who are more quantitatively minded), but eventually scales up to interesting issues in metaphysics and gambling. My favorite discussions were the ones at the end about modern decision theory and the paradoxes that it generates, and how it can be modified sensibly to address those paradoxes. The lectures were good for an introduction to each topic, the TA sections were good for discussion them more in-depth and challenging some of the assumptions of the main philosophers specializing in those topics",
    "Don't do it. It's not a \"HU credit for a quantitativeperson.\" That's why I took it.Two things to keep in mind if you're interested in this class:1-Shopping period is VERY different than the class itself (the first two weeks are heavy on the math and theory, afterwards its just philosophy.)2-The class is very boring. Lectures are boring, the TA sessions are worse.Also, the grading is very arbitrary! Just don't do it.",
    "nope, not worth the work",
    "Infinity is broken down into four main units: math, motion, composition, and decision theory. The math unit discusses the mathematical properties behind the concept of Infinity. The motion unit examines Zeno's Paradox and other similar problems when the real world and infinite elements are combined. The composition unit discusses what exactly composes matter and how it works. The decision theory unit revolves around certain situations where the common sense view of things and the mathematical view of things are in stark disagreement.Overall, I thought the class was enjoyable. It is not a standard QR class (in that most of the \"problem sets\" are actually short written assignments), but you do need to have a good mathematical brain if you want to do well in this class.",
    "It's a hard class to recommend. If you don't know math, you might struggle in the first half. If you're a math or CS major, you'll have a harder time with the metaphysical questions -- the workload isn't bad but it's hard to come up with the discussion they're looking for. Unless you're a philosophy major with an interested in math, you might want to consider Cr\/D. Just know that this class isn't about infinity, it's about logic and metaphysics.",
    "This can be a kind of fun way to get a QR. By the end of the course I didn't feel like I was getting much out of it, but it's not overly difficult.",
    "A lot of the readings are really interesting, and Prof. Whittle does a good job in lecture of going over them. Lectures don't really go that far beyond the readings, though. If you're a philosophy major or familiar with philosophy, you will be frustrated by section, because the class seems to be mostly non-philosophy majors\/people without philosophy experience.",
    "Thought it was a really great class. The readings were thought provoking and the professor was engaging. The content was really something that if you're at all curious about I think you'll enjoy.My one complaint is that there were a lot of stupid people in the class, so be prepared to be frustrated in section.",
    "The idea of the class is better than the actual thing.",
    "Infinity is a philosophy class with a lot of math and math-type thinking in it. I would recommend this class to any student who likes puzzles or complex problems. It's not a lot of math at all just thinking about complex situations, which is sort of similar to physics. I don't really enjoy writing, but I liked writing for this class because the topics were interesting and difficult.",
    "The material seems interesting at first, but the whole approach to theme is a little diffuse. At the end of the course, I did not have the impression that I was more knowledgeable about the subject or that I knew what the relevant discussions in this field of philosophy were. I would recommend it for someone who is looking for a QR but does not what to be doing problem sets every week. The assignments were much more 'philosophical' than 'quantitative' and the problem sets turned out to be more like short papers on issues like 'motion', \"time& space', 'contact', etc.",
    "No. Its the worst class at Yale because it literally rushes through material and doesn't have prerequisites yet assumes Logic. Don't be fooled!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class if it's being taught be Bruno Whittle. The lectures are a waste of time, it's not particularly interesting, and the assignments have nothing to do with the readings. This is coming from a Math Philosophy major.",
    "It's not as interesting as you may think. Rather poorly taught - most people stopped going halfway through the semester. However, if you need a QR and you're ex-DS\/humanities you should take it as it's only mathy for the first few weeks.",
    "Not a bad class, not an amazing class either. The material is interesting which is good, and there isn't a massive amount of work. That being said class can be a bit boring at times as the professor isn't the most compelling lecturer. Also, the first third of the class on set theory can be very difficult for people who haven't seen the material before. Anyone with a remote math background can survive, they just might have some difficulty.",
    "I took this for a QR and a metaphysics\/epistemology credit for my major. It was good for that. I think there are perhaps methodological problems with this sort of approach to metaphysics, however -- I would have liked to see these addressed more, to be honest. Or some sort of introduction to what it is this type of philosophy is trying to accomplish, a sort of meta-mereology... Because I found it very, very difficult to care about the material taught here, other than finding ways to solve philosophical\/mathematical puzzles that are in most cases explicitly removed from all real world significance."
