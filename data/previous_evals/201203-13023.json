   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course to any individual who has not read most of the assigned text. The textual interpretation is conventional, so the course may be uninteresting to someone who has already read much of the assigned books.",
    "Directed Studies is one of the greatest opportunities at Yale. Although many people criticize it for various reasons (strictness of grades, hundreds of pages of reading per week, difficulty to explore other classes in your freshman year), DS is really worth it. It will help you get out of freshman year being able to write really good essays in short periods of time, really understand how to analyze text and how to different works are relevant across time periods. Take DS if you are willing to put in the time and the effort and want to get off it feeling like a new person. Don't take DS if the only thing you care about are your grades.",
    "Directed Studies first semester focuses on a lot of old white dead guys.But that is DS in general.I don't love epic poetry but I loved the class.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is a survey course of the Western canon. It provides an introduction to great works of literature that have inspired and influenced generations of writers. I would recommend DS Literature - it has given me a new lens through which to examine books that I read, both for class and for pleasure reading. Furthermore, for aspiring writers, becoming acquainted with the Western tradition is vital and valuable.",
    "I would recommend this. I enjoyed reading a lot. I have to warn you though, DS has taken away the ENJOYMENT out of reading. Because we have to speed through everything, I found myself looking just at how many hundred pages I had left and how much time I could read it--I could not really take the leisurely time to really focus on one passage or analyze it. That's a trade-off, and I'm not sure it was worth it. I have always enjoyed reading, but not now and not in DS.",
    "I highly recommend DS, and the literature portion was my favorite of the three classes! All the works are wonderful and intricately interrelated- you cannot look at them or fully understand them in isolation which is why the DS set up is so useful! Take DS, try to get a section with Jane Levin, get to know her, and if you are going to cut corners with DS readings, do NOT cut corners with literature...read all the works!",
    "Of course. DS has given me perspective. I feel like I understand the origins of many contemporary works. DS, I feel, is the foundation needed for a thorough education.",
    "Yes, I would. It's an incredible chance to read some of the most important works of Literature in the western canon, but anyone who signs up needs to be prepared for a heavy, heavy load of reading and writing.",
    "Though this course is said to provide a preview of the vast Western literary tradition, I found some parts we covered in class to be challenging and very in-depth. For a person who has not been exposed to conversations among great writers--in high school, we often read books that have little to do with each other outside plot and setting, etc.--this course will be eye-opening. I would recommend this course to those who have a genuine interest in English literature, or would at least find it intriguing; it might be hard to keep up with all the reading, but at the end, you will wish you could have picked up more!",
    "This class was a useful overview of the highlights of Greek, Roman, and Early Christian literature. The readings, although often lengthy, are much easier to get through than those assigned for DS Hand P or for DS Philosophy. That being said, the level of analysis and writing that was expected was very high and the amount of time and thought put into the reading and papers definitely corresponded with getting much more out of section and out of the works and class in general.",
    "DS Literature is a survey of many of the most important works in the western canon. The class moves at a very fast pace, so there is a large amount of reading and the class lacks some of the extensive in-depth discussions that might take place in other literature classes. Overall, DS Literature is great for anyone who wants a broad knowledge of classical and early medieval literature."
