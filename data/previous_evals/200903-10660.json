   "comments": [
    "Basic things to know for graduate school. I would recommend it because I think some of the information was very important for us to know.",
    "900 01 is an introductory research course. some of the classes are very helpful, some are boring and pointless. It was useful to learn how to write a grant, but the statistical computer lab part was not very helpful at all. I would have rather learned more about how to present before my rotation talk.",
    "Its a required course for first year MCGD students that covers resources and goes over the NSF proposal process. We also did rotation presentations. I wouldn't bother recommending it because it is required.",
    "1) A required course where people try to attempt to give you information that will be useful. 2)A place to hear about the kind of research is student is participating in.",
    "Yes, I would recommend other students to take this course as I did learn things including the statistics and how to use the various resources in Yale during this class.",
    "I would say that it is a required class that all first-years need to participate in, but most of the classes are helpful in terms of the experience of writing an NSF essay and presenting your research. I would recommend the course to another student because overall it was a helpful experience.",
    "I would recommend this class if for no other reason than to get some experience presenting in front of your peers.",
    "Come. this class is required, everybody has to choose this class.",
    "Some basic concepts important to graduate students- how to write a grant, how to give a presentation, etc. I'd recommend, but with some changes (ie, fewer lectures).",
    "I feel the main purpose of this class is the rotation talks. The other classes give some useful information to think about as you go about researching, but might not be overly useful during the first year.Genetics 900 01 is required, so I guess would recommend taking it.",
    "No, I don't think it is particularly useful.",
    "weekly course attempting to teach aspects of working in biology that you don't get through coursework",
    "Some parts were great but I wish I could have skipped others.",
    "I will recommend it to another student. Because from this course I learn a lot of thing that otherwise will not be taught in a course, such as manuscript writing, grant writing. It's a good training.",
    "unfortunately, you have to take it.",
    "the best thing to get out of this course was how to write a grant and practice presenting research. yes i would recommend it, although again, certain aspects were not as useful.",
    "It was required and was quite useful.",
    "Well it's required. So in that sense it wouldn't matter whether I would recommend it or not. It's not a great course, but having practice presenting research is always positive.",
    "Compared to the other classes I took, this one was really not that helpful. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that doesn't have to take it.",
    "It's good to take it to get practice at writing grants and doing lab presentations."

   "comments": [
    "I defnitely thought that it was helpful to do a presentation in front of the class about our rotations.",
    "It was very useful to practice presenting in the rotation talks, even though we did not get any feedback. It was also great to practice writing grants.",
    "This course gave me background and research on what it will mean to be a scientist.",
    "The course was helpful in introducing us to important topics like writing papers, getting published, presenting, etc. It was nice to hear from current students, also.",
    "It didn't.",
    "I've learned how to write a proposal, how to present data, and how to discuss with my classmates in this class. I think all these experiences will help me in the future research work.",
    "The course did not provide me with any specific information regarding my field of study, but rather it helped prepare me for a future of writing many research proposals and presenting my research, which is important in grad school and beyond.",
    "I don't think this course taught me anything specifically about my field, it just gave me an opportunity to learn more about it on my own.",
    "A lot.",
    "Helpful for entering graduate students&their common issues.",
    "I found the information on paper writing most useful, but it probably would have been more applicable later in my graduate career. Rotation talks went well and were a good way to practice presenting my own work.",
    "The course could have done a much better job of preparing us for our rotation talks and for our NSFGRFP applications.",
    "The only helpful session was the stats session, which was too cursory to be a real benefit.",
    "Didn't really deepen my knowledge as most of the things we did were not relevant at this point in time. It was awesome that we had to apply for the NSF GRFP though.",
    "I learn what others' doing from the rotation talks, and get a concept of what is research and how to do research from rotation.",
    "this will be very useful when i have to write grants in the future or present research.",
    "The course introduced basics of what a 1st year student need to know. NSF peer review session was very helpful as we got to receive comments and suggesions from other students.",
    "I learned a lot about how to do research such as data analysis and presentation.",
    "This gave me experience that will contribute to my career by requiring us to write the NSF proposal as well as giving rotation presentations.",
    "I found some lectures to be helpful, but often the sessions dragged on. I think the class could be shortened and the material could be covered at a faster pace in the future.",
    "learned more about grant writing."
