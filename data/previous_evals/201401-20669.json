   "comments": [
    "A (somewhat) detailed overview of music in European Court, Church, and Theatre from 1600-1800. Hepokoski is a legendary lecturer for a reason! Definitely recommended.",
    "Great class, great professor. Definitely take.",
    "Professor Hepokoski is incredibly dedicated and a phenomenal lecturer. I have always enjoyed his lectures, and are very memorable. The lectures are structured in a way that enables the material to be ingrained. Though the workload is demanding, it has definitely been very rewarding.",
    "Amazing class! More difficult than 352 just because of the style of music you're learning about (listening ID quiz was harder, I thought). It's a lot of work, so not the best to credit\/D, but if you are interested in learning about this time period in music in some depth (and learning sonata form from Hepokoski himself) then it is very worthwhile to take.",
    "A detailed, rigorous, and intense look through both the music and sociopolitical worlds behind the music of the baroque and classical periods (late 1500's up to late 1700's). The main strength of the course is Professor Hepokoski's preparedness, eloquence, and passion for the subject. And people say it just gets better for Music 352. Both of the TF's were great for this course as well- Becky and Kamala. Kamala was especially inspiring and knowledgeable. The course is A LOT of work- 3 listening ID exams, 3 factual (essay) exams, and one ~10-page final paper. It also really helps to have a relatively decent foundation of music theory to make the most of the course, especially when Hepokski starts to get into Sonata Theory in the last few weeks. I loved this course, because I learned about a musical era (really several era's blended together) that I didn't know much about, was exposed to a lot of beautiful music, and was exposed to the social and political worlds that produced this music. That being said, I didn't love all the music we listened to. And some people found the course to be quite dry on the whole. Like I said, the course was also a ton of work. One weakness- I thought the listening quizzes were a bit too anal about memorizing the exact dates when works were composed and the exact names of the composers (first, middle, last including accents). As a result, I ended up cramming a lot of material rather than learning a lot more about a few, select pieces. So try to gauge your interests- if you want an in-depth look and analysis of the Baroque and Classical periods and an understanding of how they influenced later era's of classical music and you're willing to work really hard, this course is for you!",
    "It's a good course. Honestly it didn't live up to the hype, and 352 was way better, but overall a solid course.",
    "If you're interested in music history from 1600-1800, definitely take this (or, if you're a music major, you have to take it anyway). Hepokoski is an amazing lecturer who does a fantastic job of making centuries-old music seem relevant and important. Beware of the work, though; there are no daily assignments or final exam, but in exchange there are three written exams, three listening ID quizzes, and a 10-page paper in which you compare the textbooks' treatment of Bach and Handel. In and of themselves, these aren't so bad, but they can sneak up on you if you don't keep up with the readings and listenings. This is a great course that gives you what you put into it.",
    "Really great class! Go for Hepokoski's lectures and take good notes and you'll be fine in the exams - there are generally a very few things that Hepokoski actually wants you to understand. Just get them, and you'll do fine. The final paper is pretty challenging - don't wait till the last minute.",
    "351 is, at its core, an intellectual history class. As a musician, it's amazing to see the interactions between music and society in a period that most people don't think too much about critically these days. Your current beliefs about the \"Baroque\" period will be transformed forever after taking this, and the class will teach you to think about history in countless new ways. The class is a LOT of work (memorization tests, essay tests, a long, but fun, final paper, lots of reading, etc.), but it's definitely worth it. Taking this course with Hepokoski (DEFINITELY TRY TO TAKE IT WITH HIM) should be a requirement for all those wishing to really understand music of the west and the intellectual history corresponding to its developments.",
    "Bach, Mozart, Handel and Monteverdi are thrown around a lot. You'e heard or even played their music and \"think\" that you know them. That is wrong! This class will add a new dimension to the way you listen, think about and perceive music from these great composers and more. It was such a great experience to learn about the social and historical context behind each of the composers - why did they write these pieces? what was going through their mind? why is this musical passage so important? Music is not just something we listen to for entertainment or play for personal enjoyment. Those things are true, but you music is also deeply intertwined with human history, thoughts and culture\u2026this class will show you how! There are 3 listening identification tests, 3 written tests (study early for them, you get review sheets but they are very long sets of questions, not answers) and a final essay (no final exam my year).",
    "take this course! a must for any scholar of music and history",
    "MUSI 351, like its counterpart of MUSI 352, is an intense, broad, and deep survey of a large span of music history, narrated incredibly beautifully and cleverly by Professor Hepokoski. At first the subject matter starts somewhat dry -- it seems that few students have much interest in Monteverdi, Carissimi, Peri, and so forth -- but soon enough you are learning about the crazy masters like J.S. Bach, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, as well as a huge span of other striking or goofy composers. The course has quite a learning curve just to get a sense of how exactly you will study and prepare: you will want to take notes on basically every sentence the professor says, because it is all fair game for the tests, and the listening quizzes are another major challenge to brace yourself for well in advance, but once you can get into the groove you will look back with nostalgia. It feels like MUSI 351 is meant for grad students who have much more time on their hands, but in the end you will have a huge amount of respect and understanding for the origins of modern orchestral music. This is a course that might make you feel miserable while you take it, but when you come out on the other side you will realize just how much you learned.",
    "If you love Western Art Music, you'd be silly not to take it.",
    "Yes, absolutely, though it might change significantly if Prof. Hepokoski is not teaching it, since its strength is really in the high quality of the lectures. If you're a music major, obviously you have to take it, but if you're not a music major, seriously consider taking it just because it's a great way to delve further in the music of the \"Baroque\" and \"Classical\" eras (i.e. take it for Bach, Mozart, and Haydn)."
