    "You have to take it. Prepare yourself. It is more than you can handle.",
    "Junior Studio is an intense first design studio. It is a very strong and well-coordinated syllabus, and I think worth the work required. That's not to say that it doesn't get frustrating, though, and the time commitment is serious. I would recommend it only to those who are sure they want to put the time in",
    "Yes, it's required.Yes, it's a lot of work.But you'll also learn a lot.",
    "My answer won't make much of a difference, but I'll just say that this was a fantastically enriching studio semester. A straight shot to the finish line in December (maybe a bit easier this year with Sandy and the Oct break), but more than worth the countless all-nighters, stress-laden weeks and intense crits. You will learn a lot about yourself, your approach to architecture, your strengths and weaknesses. There is a lot of personal attention, a lot of studio time with your classmates and a lot of time spent poring over drafting boards, computer screens and whitewashed models. I loved it, and so will you if you keep your head up, resist the urge to feel like you're competing with everyone else, and ASK PEOPLE FOR ADVICE. Ask Bimal\/Trattie, ask your classmates, ask the seniors. It's supposed to be a hugely collaborative process, and it will make your life so much easier. Don't be shy. Also, grad students are hot and not all mean.",
    "Models and drawings due each week. The amount that you can produce in a day\/night will be shocking. This class is all-consuming, due to both the amount of work and to how much you will care about studio compared to everything else. Plan wisely with what you take with it. Honestly the most tiring and best experience I've had.",
    "It is a ton of work and only take it if you are an architecture major.",
    "If you're reading this, you're probably already an architecture major, so you know you have to take this class. My advice is to set very specific goals for yourself with each project and be clear about it. As your first design class, you'll see that its painful to do only one week assignments over and over; you're projects will rarely feel finished or satisfactory at a time when you're determined to prove yourself. Looking back, the most successful projects kept it simple by sheer virtue of there being enough time to complete them. Remember that this semester will eventually end, however hard it is. You'll get through it!",
    "This class will take up a \/lot\/ of your time (think most of your time). However, the professors are great - Trattie and Bimal have very complementary styles (in that they have differing ways of working\/opinions but together can usually get to most problems with your projects.) Don't be too intimidated by them - they are very understanding, and listen and respond to concerns.",
    "I thought it was well taught and I learned a lot in this class. Bimal and Trattie are very different, but a good team that encouraged and pushed us. I grew a lot as an architect. Be prepared to sleep less. The rules are really just guidelines. Take your idea as far as you can, even if it means bending those rules!",
    "The first half of Junior Studio is very good, especially because of Bimal and Trattie. It is, of course, a crazy amount of work. There is a project due every week, which usually means it is assigned on Wednesday, you have a desk crit with your TAs on Friday going over your ideas, diagrams, and sketch models, you meet with one of the studio professors and a TA on Monday, and then you present at least one model, one hand drawing, and whatever else you have on Wednesday. The assignments logically progressed and the TAs and professors offered very insightful and helpful advice most of the time. I definitely better at designing after this studio.",
    "Wow, this was quite a semester. You produce a lot of work, you probably age a couple of years, and you learn so much. I enjoyed this studio far more than analytic model and drawing from sophomore spring, because for the first time, we were designing--we got to see an idea through from concept to sketch to model. You really start to develop your own mode of designing, you find your own habits of working, and you start to see a personal style emerge, and that's really exciting! Because we had new assignments basically every week, the pace is fast, but you never get bored of what you're doing. And if you had a bad week in which you weren't satisfied at all with what you created, you could kind of start over the next week. The field trips we took (to New Canaan and New York City) were amazing!! Bimal and Trattie were always inspiring and genuinely cared about our education."
