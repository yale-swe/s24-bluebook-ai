    "If you are interested in cryptography and has a solid mathematics knowledge, it's a choice.",
    "Outstanding material and motivated lectures. You should definitely take this class to have a baseline understanding of cryptography and computer security.",
    "The course is theoretical and requires a lot of memorization of concepts. I would recommend it to another student because a lot of knowledge can be gained over the course and it is easier to do well on it even if a person is not very good at programming.",
    "Yes. It's a nice, medium-level-workload course, and you get to learn a lot about how cryptography really works - and why it is very important to define exactly what kind of security you want.",
    "If you are interested in computer security, not attending class that much, cannot tolerate a very dry\/indifferent\/robotic professor... run the other way. If you want to learn number theory then I recommend the class.",
    "yes",
    "I would, because it's quite useful for future career."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not working on any research or a dissertation since I am a terminal masters student. However, since I'm going back into industry where security is of the utmost importance, I think having a strong grasp of the basics surrounding cryptographic primitives is tremendously helpful. I've even considered a bit of a career shift into practical computer security because I've found this course so interesting.",
    "For one, this course enabled me to learn a newarea of computer science, which involves a lot of mathematics. Security is one of the most important areas of research today and this course helped me understand a few things about how it can be assured.",
    "I nowknow nothing is ever really secure",
    "My research is focus on privacy in social networks. Thus the course helps me a lot."
