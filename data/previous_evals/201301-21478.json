   "comments": [
    "It is both a good introduction for the uninitiated and a good review for those wishing to tie together the more specialized threads on which they have been focusing.",
    "It is a basic course in the foundations of ancient and modern Judaism, focusing on the Rabbinic period and how it came to be the historic expression of the faith over and against the cultic practices that ended in 70 CE.I would recommend the content, but perhaps not the class itself. While I do feel like I learned about ancient Judaism and the foundations of Rabbinic Judaism, it had less to do with the instructor and more to do with the course assignments.",
    "I'm in the Divinity School, and I would recommend it to a student looking to fulfill out Non-Christian Religion Requirement, since all of the material covered in the first half of the course will be review from our Old Testament seminars. If a student is looking to learn a whole new set of material, I would steer them towards something else.",
    "The course is a good overview of ancient Judaism but not very engaging. I would not recommend it as a first choice for students.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone interested in an introductory basic overview of Rabbinic Judaism. I thought the course did a great job of allowing students a taste of the overall history, Jewish styles of interpreting Scripture, and main issues\/themes regarding the development of Rabbinic Judaism from the Temple\/Prophetic eras.I would also recommend this course for Divinity students or future ministers because it gave me a new way of looking at The Bible through a Rabbinic lens. I found the Rabbinic texts more creative and innovative in their dialectical approach, which was refreshing alongside Christian theological approaches.",
    "I would recommend",
    "It's an excellent introduction. I would certainly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it. I thought it was a proper introduction to Ancient Judaism and Rabbinic writings.",
    "I would recommend the course. One comes away with a good understanding of Judaism in the Ancient World. I wish the course covered contemporary Judaism but that is not the topic.",
    "Yes - a good way to get a grounding in ancient Judaism and rabbinic literature.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it for a divinity student."

   "comments": [
    "Very useful to study a religion different from my own. It gave me knowledge I didn't have before and new insights for my own faith as well.",
    "I feel like I have a broader perspective ofthe trajectory of Judaism on which to hang my research.",
    "While I do feel like I learned about ancient Judaism and the foundations of Rabbinic Judaism, it had less to do with the instructor and more to do with the course assignments. This course met a distribution requirement for the Master of Divinity degree at Yale Divinity School, and though it didn't contribute to my professional studies, it has helped form my understanding of Judaism, its relationship to Christianity, and its current practice.",
    "I learned more about rabbinic interpretation than even before. It did aid me by allowing me to work on a paper relevant to my area of research and by initiating me to rabbinic thought and its relation to prior Jewish thinking.",
    "I particularly appreciated the look at rabbinic Judaism from the \"inner plane\" of history, as Prof. Fraade phrased it. Though as I mentioned previously we are adequately prepared in historical-critical methods of interpreting biblical text at the Divinity School, and therefore the \"outer plane\" of history is familiar to us, considering a historical view as continuous was a fresh perspective on acquired knowledge.",
    "See above: feel as though I have a much better knowledge of the history of ancient Judaism, concerns that motivated certain movements in its development. Don't feel my knowledge of the ideas or beliefs of ancient Judaism has been significantly improved upon taking this course.",
    "It provided with a deeper knowledge of ancient Judaism and helps me to understand how this faith tradition relates to my own Christian tradition.",
    "I came away with new ways to interpret Scripture and teach biblical texts, which I can use in my future preaching and Bible study. Likewise, I now have an idea of what Jewish materials from midrash, Mishnah, and Talmud that I can use to complement my exegetical tasks. Furthermore, I have a better understanding of Jewish and Christian relations regarding the development and expansion of Rabbinic Judaism.",
    "It gave me a good introduction to Rabbinic Judaism",
    "As a divinity student, I hope it goes without saying that the broader and more serious a Christian minister's knowledge of Judaism, the better. I feel the insights I gleaned in this class will add to my exegetical, historical, and critical skills in my likely employment.",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of rabbinic approaches to the law, which I believe will help me in my teaching an preaching."
