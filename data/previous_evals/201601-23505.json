    "This course seemed like an afterthought at some points in the semester. I wished we started with more \"straightforward\" assignments instead of jumping straight into analysis, as we did not know what was expected from us. I enjoyed the seminar aspect of this course with experts of each field giving lectures on their fields.",
    "Very nice course",
    "The strengths of the course are the different topics each week and the guest lecturers that come in. Weaknesses are the sometimes tenuous connection with \"measurement issues\" that need to get forced in to make the topic relevant for almost two hours.",
    "Strengths: measurement issues in different fields Weaknesses: learning to critique a paper earlier in the semester",
    "one strength of the course is that it provided an introduction to a variety of topics",
    "This course is a great overview of a range of issues in the field. I appreciated the diversity of topics and how each lecture connected back to a common theme. I thought the final project was also a great way to bring together many of the topics talked about."

    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman is great with feedback and working with students. She encourages great and in-depth conversation and overall, I think she does well handling a (required) class that may not be everyone's favorite just because of the material.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Strengths: cares about students, good critiques, will learn a lot",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Professor Lichtman is wonderful! This course could easily be very dry, but she is able to make it incredibly engaging and interesting. She works hard to make sure the students get something out of the course and it shows. She is incredibly busy but it was clear that teaching to her was a priority."
