    "Great course with superior lectures, should be a mandatory course for all hpa students",
    "Very insightful and interesting. Rich materials and deep discussion. Have learnt a lot both from the instructor and the class, many of whom had experience in medical settings.",
    "Very goodIdeas presented were dealt well, struck the perfect cord of law with non lawyersgood class",
    "Strengths: excellent introduction to health law for students with no law background. I really enjoyed the format of covering specific topics by discussing cases from the case book. Weaknesses: the course was a little slow in the first few sessions due to a funny schedule with a couple of cancellations, but once we got into a routine the class worked well.",
    "Good, but just very dense in information which can be overwhelming considering there is only an exam that determines your proficiency",
    "It was my first law class in my life since, as an international student, I didn't take any law class back in college. So, it was very challenging to me at first because I was not that familiar with both law itself and American health law and policy system. However, through the final paper in particular, I could learn a lot about them.",
    "The course was a good overview of health law. While informative, it was sometimes difficult to have concrete takeaways given the nature of the law that can be argued either way. There is a lot to learn that is relevant to public health practice.",
    "It is a very good introduction class for a layman and I really learn a lot from the case study.",
    "Overall this was a great course! Given that most Public Health students have limited courses linked to law, I wonder if an additional class touching on basic non-liability related legal concerns could be added. For instance, the issue of hospital anti-trust law in an era of declining reimbursements that might require more M&A could be interesting. There are also important questions around provider-physician alignment and medical staff bylaws. Perhaps, other legal topics might require a whole new course, but that migth be worth thinking about.",
    "one of the most interesting courses I have ever taken",
    "I wish there was more discussion and less lecturing by the professor. Moreover, it should meet more than once.",
    "Very interesting topics discussed. Nice balance of lecture\/discussion."

    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Spectacular lectures, best I've experienced at Yale across a half dozen different departments",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Very clear explanation and discussion. Logic and having profound knowledge. Very busy and occupied, though.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Good professorstruck the right cord while presenting law to non lawyersthe topics dealt with were relevant to public health, and the public health approach was never lost to law",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Ted Ruger is a great professor for this course. He knows we are public health students and not law students. He values our different perspectives (compared to law students) and does a good job of explaining the main topics in an understandable way. His personal experiences at a health law firm were also interesting to hear about. Our class was sometimes on the quiet side, but Ted did his best to encourage participation.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Ruger is great. He knows so much and facilitates conversation very well. Very methodical",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0He is an enthusiastic and passionate instructor who really tries to explain concepts and give examples of the material discussed. It may be helpful to have slides or handouts about specific health law topics (i.e., apparent agency, EMTALA, etc). He had one handout in the beginning of the course but it would have been nice to have more as it helps in wrapping up for the final.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Very interesting and sometimes he can use some easy examples to explain some complex concept.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Professor Ruger was interesting, insightful, and dynamic in being able to relate the study of medical liability to health policy more broadly. I also appreciated having an instructor that seemed to hail more from the professional arena versus just having worked in the academy. This seemed to add something unique.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0one of the best and most interesting professors ever!",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Good professor! Should be more approachable!",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Great.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Ruger \u00a0Strengths: Excellent in class lectures, open to questions from students, structured curriculum, final examination was very fair.Weaknesses: Could benefit by posting outlines for each week's class or specific cases to review."

   "comments": [
    "Policy is predicated on a rule of law so it's very necessary to understand their interaction. This class did a superb job of making that link",
    "Most suitable for medical practitioners to get familar with the medical laws, and students who will work in the policy setting or continue to study health law in the future. Worthy of recommendation.",
    "Good courseTed Ruger does a great job of summarizing important health law information.Caes are discussedhelps analyse law terms and the jargon made simple",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is particularly important for policy&management students. I was hesitant to take this course because I have absolutely no background in law and don't plan to go into law in any way. A previous student who took the class convinced me to check it out and I'm very happy I did. It's very different than all other YSPH policy courses&offers real world cases to discuss very relevant topics that confront many health care organizations, companies, etc. I was slightly nervous that our entire grade was based on a take-home essay final (you have 8 hours to do it on the day of your choosing during finals week), but Dr. Ruger prepared us well (offered an optional review session) and the exam was very fair. Great course and even better, it was light on the weekly work load compared to other classes.",
    "I would recommend this because this feels very much like a seminar and Ruger engages people and their expertise rather than assume that he knows everything about health care law. It's nice to have a humble professor trying to reciprocate information rather than try to act like an expert at everything without remorse.",
    "If you are not that familiar with law, but still interested in and want to take the relevant class, this is the course for you.",
    "Excellent",
    "The course is a good course on health law and I wouldrecommend it because it deals with issues that as public health professional we will all likely deal with. It also illustrates how the law can be used to prove different sides of an argument (i.e., there is no right answer).",
    "A very good introduction law class and I will recommend.",
    "take it take it take it!",
    "Really interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course for a fellow student because it gives you a broad background about health law and ethics. The instructor was great in translating law language, legislation, and other legal and ethical issues in a way any non-law student can understand and make this knowledge useful in his\/her career."
