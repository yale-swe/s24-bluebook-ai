    "It's a pretty good class if you're interested in water and why it's important.",
    "Environmental engineering 371 seemed to be a good preview of what engineers in water resource management encounter regularly. I enjoyed learning how to find real, detailed data on the USGS website and other places online. I also found Professor Wallis's lectures on his experiences with past water projects, such as Devil's Lake, to be particularly interesting.I wished that the lectures had more to do with the problem sets. Professor Wallis's lecture style is not very engaging. Many of his power point lectures are full of technical details that are gone over too quickly to be understood."
