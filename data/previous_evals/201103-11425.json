   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS--but only if you love social theory. If reading theory is not your \"thing\", do NOT take this class, because you'll hate it. But the readings are fantastic, the professor is wonderful, and the discussions are incredibly stimulating, so I would definitely recommend it to all sociology-interesting people.",
    "Although it is a requirement for the major, I was actually glad to have chosen this class. The workload is manageable but it is a lot of reading, as any theory class would have. But the readings were really interesting and offers different ways to think about society and individual freedoms. The overall content of the course was great and the students in the class made discussions very lively and engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to someone interested in sociology. It's a tremendously interesting course and the readings, even if lengthy, really opens your eyes to new things.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you're a sociology major, then you have to take it, but I was expecting it to be painful, and it was not painful at all. I learned a lot, and I'm glad that I had the chance to read some of the really influential sociological texts.",
    "A class about modern theory, answering questions such as: is it possible for human beings to act of their own volition? Who holds power in modern society? Should we value morality or rationality?Required for Soc, but actually kind of interesting. Seems better than classical theory, very related to contemporary life.10 pg midterm, 10 pg final, 1 pg response every week. Ron Eyerman is also really nice!",
    "This was a fine course with several interesting books on the reading list. In particular I appreciated the opportunity to read Foucault. If there had been more upperclassmen in the seminar, or more students with a good foundation in social theory, the discussions could have been more sophisticated. (Of course, the make-up of the seminar could change between this year and next year - shop it). But even still, most students seemed very much to enjoy the class and its discussions.",
    "Don't take it unless your a sociology major, then its required. Not the worst class ever but definitely not especially interesting.",
    "It will seem like a horrible and daunting class in the beginning but it really is worth it and it gets better! Not hard to do well, even though it seems like it is at the beginning. It may be a lot of reading and a reading response due each week, but you will sometimes find yourself really engaged with the readings.. and you don't actually have to read ALL of them... just enough to get the gist, and be able to talk in seminar.",
    "Theory is hugely important in the field of sociology and you get a good understanding of both macro and micro processes in this class. Eyerman is a fantastic professor and discussion is always pretty interesting. I think he particularly is really into critical social theory, so his syllabus probably differs from others if that's not your thing and you can wait to take it. A 2 hour seminar on theory does sometime feel long though, especially given its relatively early start time.",
    "Yes it is a good class with a lot of insightful discussion that is particularly relevant in a modern context.",
    "If you have an interest in modern social theory, take this course, because I absolutely loved it. Though the reading is often heavy and sometimes dense, the weekly reading responses allow students to focus on what they found most interesting about the topic. The same applies for the midterm (two five-pagepapers) and the final (one ten-page paper). The course is discussion-based, so your enjoyment will definitely depend upon your classmates, but Professor Eyerman is not only a great conversation leader, but he genuinely cares about his students and takes the time to really read and digest each student's reading response for the week. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This class is wonderful. If you have to take it as a sociology major, you will enjoy it. Still useful if you're not in the major. Definitely a manageable amount of work and the readings are interesting."
