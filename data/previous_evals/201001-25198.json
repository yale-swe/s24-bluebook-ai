   "comments": [
    "Very informative class, great for giving you an overview of the human brain, what areas are associated with certain behaviors, and how researchers study such areas. You take in tons of information, and keeping of with professor McCarthy in class is a challenge. 1.5 hours of constant notes can be quite tiring. Professor McCarthy, while not the most flashy lecturer, beams with enthusiasm for the topic, which gets his students interested as well.",
    "A nice intro to neuroscience.I would look for other courses that cover core topics in neuroscience.",
    "i wouldn't really recommend this course. brain and thought was a MUCH more engaging class and goes over the same material plus more. i honestly found this class pretty boring; it was hard to stay awake at times. professor mccarthy is really great and is clearly a giant in the field, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the most interesting lecturer. i thought the class focused to much on fMRI results and not enough on actual brain mechanisms.there's no real need to take it for the psych major since brain and thought + fundamentals of neuroscience will teach you all you need to know for upper level classes. plus the exams were ridiculously hard and specific.",
    "This course is a marvelous introduction to many concepts in cognitive and psychological science, and it is amazing. I would recommend this course very strongly, though caution about the testing.",
    "The class is good if you either need a list B course for psych (in that case, take it C\/D\/F) or if you are interested in neuroscience. If not, it may be too much mental effort for you.",
    "This course addresses the human brain and what its parts do. Lecture can be a little dry at times, but Professor McCarthy always injects a little humor into the discussion when he can, and the material is fundamentally fascinating. The tests are challenging but fair, and there isn't too much work outside of studying for them other than writing a few critiques of articles from the field. If you are at all interested in the functional anatomy of the brain, you should absolutely take this course.",
    "It is a lot of work and McCarthy's tests are really hard. Unless you are really interested in imaging or the specifics of neuroscience, this class is probably more work than it's worth. However, if you attend all of the lectures you will gain a good understanding of the brain and the current field of neuroscience.",
    "YES recommend -- lots of great neuroscience without being scary",
    "This is one of the most informative classes I've taken at Yale. Looking back on it, it's remarkable just how much I've learned from it. I can actually look at a picture of the brain from an MRI scan and locate areas of the brain and what their functions are. It's a really valuable class, and if you're into psychology at all, you should take it.",
    "yes",
    "Solid course. Professor McCarthy is brilliant and basically invented the field of cognitive neuroscience; he can occasionally be dry but is generally a good lecturer. You cover a LOT of material (seriously, you'll probably get through about 70 slides per lecture at least), but the tests are totally fair. If you like the subject, a must-take.",
    "This is a great course for people who are interested in getting a comprehensive understanding of neuroscience. It goes system by system (visual, auditory, motor, emotions, executive functioning, etc.) and the parts of the course on brain lesions are especially fascinating. My only warning is that if it is still offered in the afternoon, you might find yourself dozing off a bit (the room is warm, the lights are low, Professor McCarthy has an incredibly soothing voice) even though the material is really interesting, so have some coffee beforehand!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class unless you're the kind of person that's afriad of learning a little hard science. (Obviously, if you're that type, yu should steer away from a neuro class.)It's a fantastic introduction to the field, and will get you thinking in terms of processes, networks, connectivity, and how to deal with fMRI, EEG, and other imaging methods. If you thinking of being a neuro track psych major, you MUST take this class. it's WAY better than the other neuro intro options.",
    "It's a really good class, make sure you know the basics because it's easy to get lost fast if you don't.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it! A lot of information very quickly, but very interesting and well-taught! I really thgink it should be re-evaluated in order to have a Science credit, because it really seems like it should carry one.",
    "I would recommend it for all psych majors because neuroscience will have huge consequences for psychology in the future. But those who struggle with science will have to work hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in neuroscience. I came away from it being able to interpret fMRI scans on my own, which I think is pretty cool. If you don't care about the brain, then it's not worth it.",
    "Even if you are interested in neuroscience, definitely shop this course before you sign up for it. The lecture style is quite tricky, especially when it comes down to exam period, because it presents various studies and requires you to piece them together and extrapolate the meaning. If you are not capable of interpreting neuroscientific jargon on the spot and taking notes, you will enjoy and get much out of this class. However, if you cannot pull this off, you may arrive at exam time struggling to understand the material.",
    "There are probably better courses out there, unless you really want to be a neuroscience-track psych major. This course should be called \"Geography of the Brain\". You spend a lot of time learning which part of the brain does what; it didn't turn out to be as interesting as I had hoped.",
    "yes, especially if the brain intrigues you to no end :)",
    "A pretty good course. Work hard to learn your anatomy.",
    "It's a good review of the human brain and behavior and how they are related."
