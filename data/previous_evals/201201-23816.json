   "comments": [
    "The topics are interesting, but the slides are a little confusing",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course!",
    "Professor was very receptive to what we wanted to learn. Structured lectures in that way. Good combination of biology, epidemiology, behavioral science, policy.",
    "One of the best EMD courses, hands down",
    "Weakness:The class was too rushed and would benefit from being split into a year long course so that topics could be covered in more detail. It would have been helpful in reperation for the exams to have had attendance by Dr. Pettigrew at the review sessions.",
    "The students have a say in what we want to learn. The mix of epi and biology works well. It is a good complement to the Immunology course.",
    "I know that some changes are already going to be made which reflect my opinions regarding improvements.",
    "The contents were very interesting and covers a wide range of infectious diseases. Format is good - lectures and 3 homework assignments.Weakness is that the power points are not always clear and maybe can be improved.",
    "Overall a good class.",
    "Strengths: integrating biology and epidemiology to understanding implications of creating vaccines\/implementing programs\/policies for infectious diseases. Homeworks were helpful in critiquing and understanding papers and study design implementation. I like the holistic approach to problem solving, including the ethics and the pros and cons of an interventionWeaknesses: afternoon classes means it is harder to stay awake after lunch. Slides were not always clear, but for myself, it takes time to absorb information before being able to ask questions about clarity of the slides. You don't get to touch upon as much about social and behavioral pieces or environmental factors. It would make the class more holistic.Improvements: I think 4 assignments would be better just to get more practice writing about the problems faced with these infectious diseases.",
    "This class was the Dark Horse of my schedule. I was interested but kind of indifferent to the course when it started but within a few weeks really enjoyed going to class and learning about the biology and epidemiology of the many diseases we covered. It became one of my favorite courses this year.",
    "Good to know of the trasmisision pathway of different infectious disease and can understand the status quo and promising future development of diseases.very helpful in keep up with the public health in reality.If ppt can be clearer with some explanation or answers as notes for the question raised , it will be perfect,",
    "I learned great amount of materials in this class. The professor was able to integrate biology and epidemiology very well. Biology part was my least favorite because it requires memorization. I enjoyed examining and solving problems from a broader perspective, and this class definitely help me to do this.",
    "Strengths: very interesting material. I like the format of the course (new concept each lecture).Weaknesses: wish we could cover more diseases. Sometimes feels like we go into great detail on certain mechanisms\/pathways, but I feel that the greater overall concepts are more important.I like the idea of merging biology and epidemiology.",
    "Strengths: I loved to combination of the biology\/epidemiology with the discussion of policy issues or practical considerations of a given intervention. I will remember much more material from this class than I will from other classes at YSPH!Weaknesses: Jamie Childs' guest lecture.",
    "The strength of this course is that it covers many different topics in an interesting way. Although this is a required course for EMD students, it is an excellent course that I would recommend to other students. There are not many weaknesses other than when we had lecturers other than the professor, it was very difficult to figure out what the key points were for the tests.",
    "It was okay. For people with a microbiology background, it was pretty elementary and not very engaging.",
    "This was an excellent course. In addition to discussing a new infectious agent every lecture, the professor also discussed the epidemiology of the disease and public health significance in today's world, making the lecture material applicable to current circumstances. Although there was a lot of material, having non-cumulative exams was very helpful.",
    "I enjoyed this course, I think it does the best it can to cover diverse topics for each disease system, but obviously it is extremely difficult to cover all topics within a system. I think the important parts of each system was covered. I wish that each system was organized in the same way, briefly going over the molecular level, the natural history, the epidemiology, vaccines and interventions, and then one of these topics will be expanded upon for each.",
    "Great course. I was not an EMD student and still felt like the course was accessible to me. I enjoyed the diversity of the topics and gained a deep knowledge of current infectious agents in our environment. The information learned will be definitely be useful in any future career in public health.",
    "Very good course! Along with the biological knowledge about a pathogen, also learn the public health implications of what we learn in class.",
    "W: Wish I had more time to prepare for exams and wish could have spend at least 2 lectures per topic",
    "Excellent instructor, perfect amount of material to balance out other course loads.",
    "By far one of my favorite classes at YSPH! Biology of IA is an amazing blend of epidemiology and biology of an array of infectious diseases. It provides a solid foundation of basic biology concepts and integrates epidemiology to understand the transmission patterns of disease. The course also does an amazing job of making students critically think about infectious diseases through current research and helps students to critically evaluate public health policies\/practices regarding infectious diseases.",
    "Strengths: I think that this class does a good job in terms of providing a nice overview of a number of different pathogens. Moreover, Melinda is very interested in student feedback and leaves several lectures open so that the students in the class can choose what \"elective\" topics they want to leaner about. This year we learned more about HPV\/HCV, bioterrorism agents, SARS, emerging viruses, arboviruses and so forth.I think the best part of this class is that it focuses on bridging science with policy. We learn about the underlying science and biology of various diseases and then using that information are asked to think about and assess the public health implications and ramifications that the biology may impact.",
    "AWESOME should be longer(2 semesters)",
    "On the whole very good but I was hoping for less biology and more epi",
    "The primary weakness is probably the brevity of each topic; I would have really liked to learn about more diseases, and more about more diseases. However, I understand the class is turning into a year-long course, so that is probably a moot point. For the time allowed, I thought the level of detail was excellent; I became much more of an expert in diseases I was previously only vaguely aware of, including means of transmission and mechanisms of disease. The lectures (and slides) were excellent, and I continue to reference them, as many of them have relevance to the work I am doing this summer.I also hate to say it but more homework (gasp!) would probably be beneficial. I did not do very well on the homework assignments until the last one, and I think that was partially because it was unclear to me what was wanted. Homework would be an opportunity, too, to bring in more of the epidemiology side, which at times seemed to be lacking\/ignored.",
    "Weaknesses:1)The posted powerpoints could be improved. The slides could include more thorough descriptions of mechanisms, processes, and information about certain studies.2)The course appeared to focus on memorization.",
    "Strengths:The lectures were really informative and organized. The assignments were pretty fair. Studying for the exams took a lot of my time but really helped to fully understand the material.Weaknesses:It was one of the only classes that I stopped doing the readings. There were a lot of articles for the two lectures every week. I was not fully understanding them and realized that anything I needed to know from there would have been covered in lecture. I would have liked to know more about the pathology of the pathogen.",
    "I am glad this course will be divided into two semesters. I think there is too much information trying to be condensed in one semester. I also think there should be weekly assignments. Students would be forced to read for lectures and class. Perhaps the assignments should be due before lecture so students will have a better understanding for lecture and be able to contribute more to the discussion at hand.",
    "This course is the best course offered within EMD. It needs some revamping though. It is so broad and tries to cover too many pathogens in too little time. I think it will be great that it will be offered over the course of two semesters next year. I enjoyed the epidemiology part of the course much more than the details of the biology, which I often found very challenging. If you did not have prior coursework in biology, you will need to spend substantial time trying to figure concepts. However, the biology is important, therefore, I think what is needed is a slower pace.I learned an incredible amount in this class and believe I will use this knowledge on a daily basis."

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda was great and I liked her approach to the purpose and objectives ofthe class. It was hard at times to understand that although we covered a lot of material, that not all of it was necessary for the exams. Some of the material felt repetitive depending on your background and what is covered in other courses if you took it before you took this class. The slides were sometimes confusing, but overall I understand that it can be difficult to put the necessary information on the slides in a way that everyone understands.",

She has a wry sense of humor and does a good job of communicating interesting articles to us throughout the semester.Sometimes on exams\/homeworks, it was difficult to determine what precisely she wanted us to discuss (i.e. it sometimes seemed that questions were very open-ended but that the work was being graded for very specific answers).",

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Excellent, great teacher, presented the material very well. Speak a little slower next time, please.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0In a lecture hall it is difficult to get class participation (andI admit to being one who did not speak up in class much) but engagement would have brought the class to life in a new way, and prevented the dryness that almost inevitably happens when a lecturer has going through his\/her own slides many, many times. Melinda knew her material well, though, and was usually able to field questions about things not on the slides as well. When she was not able to, she addressed the questions promptly at the start of the next class session. I sensed a real dedication to not only teaching but expanding her own knowledge.",
