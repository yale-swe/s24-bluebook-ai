   "comments": [
    "If you're reading this review, you've probably already taken German 110 and are basically required to take 120 at this point if you want credit. I would give these words of advice. If you're looking for professor reviews, Nadja was wonderful but she isn't teaching next semester. Most of the professors are pretty good, though, is what I've heard, especially the native German speakers. And what should you now about 120? Probably just that it gets a lot harder than 110. If 110 didn't feel like 1.5 credits, 120 does, so adjust your course load accordingly. (I could've handled German 110 with 5.5 credits but it was much more difficult with 120, and I did not realize that.) Overall, though, it's a good class if a little bit of a drag sometimes.",
    "German 120 is a really great class for learning your German. The regular language sequence goes at a nice pace to steadily learn the concepts and get more proficient at them by the end of a year. The homework is steady but very manageable, and there are a lot of good activities with speaking and composing that help with language skills. Overall, a very solid class.",
    "The German department does a great job in structuring the German course. By the end of 2 semesters you will be able to hold a basic conversation and write small essays.",
    "In German 120, you continue to learn the basics of German while also learning more about German and European culture. It is an extremely interesting class that I would definitely recommend to any other student.",
    "German 120 was an ok class, but to be honest I felt that I could learn much much more if the class was organized in another way. First of all, the video project was very time and energy consuming but I felt that I didn't learn much German from it, because most of my energy was focusing on the story, the shooting and the video editing. Secondly, I didn't get much feedback on my homework, tests, video dropbox and forum. I did lots of work but I didn't know which part I needed to do better. The only thing I got was a score on classes v2. The lecture was fun, but I rarely got feedback after I answered a question and most of the time I didn't know if I answered it correctly or not (like grammar, sentence structure, etc.).",
    "Yes. If you're interested in the German language, this is a good class. More devoted students should also check the intensive class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I think it is one of the better-organized language programs here.",
    "I would highly recommend it, although the load is high."
