   "comments": [
    "If you're an ecology\/EVST major, you'll have to take this course. It's pretty dry, but if you come to lecture and pay attention you'll get quite a bit out of it. The workload is more than you'd expect! Two lab reports, three problem sets, three exams.",
    "I am so sorry for everyone for whom his class is a requirement. Quite literally the worst class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "A great introduction to ecological theory",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are interested in pursuing biology or ecology or if you need it for a major requirement. It's interesting, but the material can be pretty challenging. The labs are very tedious and extremely time consuming. There's not very much work from week to week (only three problem sets over the semester), but the tests are very hard and there aren't that many practice problems with which you can prepare.",
    "If you are interested in ecology this is a must take class. Some parts are heavy on the math but it is still really interesting. The work is very time consuming especially the labs. The exams are deceptively hard.",
    "A great class in the study of ecosystem and organism dynamics. Does a fantastic job of integrating environmental science and geoscience into ecology. Vasseur is an amazing lecturer. I would highly recommend!",
    "don't take this class if you don't have to. while the topics are interesting, it is not a well-structured class. it's not tooo much work except for the two labs which are death.",
    "This class is a good introduction to ecology, and uses math to help explain\/model certain events that happen in the natural world, which is cool if you like numbers and the sciency side of environmental studies. That being said, it's not an easy class - some of the concepts can be pretty difficult to grasp.",
    "More work than you could ever expect out of General Ecology. Rewarding work at times, but often very frustrating.",
    "Be prepared for a rather tough, quantitative class that is very heavy on modeling. That said, the instructors are great and really into the material, which makes it more enjoyable.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you need it for your major. The course material was interesting, but I didn't like how the course was taught. I had a hard time studying for the course because the slides were very confusing.",
    "I would recommend EVST 223 to another student if they had an interest in the environment and organisms interactions with their environments, because that is what the class covers. Furthermore, if the student likes science courses it is an awesome course to take along with biology.",
    "I recommend this class for people interested in an introduction to ecology. The information is interesting, and overall pretty easy to follow.",
    "General Ecology is actually a surprisingly challenging course. I wouldn't take this unless you were really interested in ecology or are an E&EB major. There is a surprising amount of math, as you will have to understand predator-prey dynamic models, for example. However, the material is pretty interesting and taught pretty well by Vasseur and a bit less well by Staver.",
    "Avoid it if you can. Never take this course unless you have to (which, if you're E&EB or EVST, you do). It's a general survey of ecology but it is poorly taught and disorganized, and it's way more work than it needs to be. I was excited to learn about ecology, but this course was one of the worst I've taken at Yale due to the quality of teaching and the structure of the course.",
    "Most people are in this class because it fulfills a requirement of their major. If this does not apply to you, I would think hard about taking this class. It's not terrible but it's not easy, and the first half of the course has an incredible amount of mathematical models (it's not just about ecosystems!). But if you do decide to take it, you will learn a lot about ecology (lots of population modeling) and will be challenged, but will be fine.",
    "Very interesting course but the material can be heavy",
    "Overall good class. I probably wouldn't take it unless it's required or you're particularly interested in the field, since it's a lot of theoretical population models \/ ecosystem dynamics. The 3 homeworks were easy, the 2 lab essays took a while and required learning a little excel (which is really useful), and the exams were a little difficult because they asked for synthesis of material\/equations.",
    "Don't take this course unless it is required. Not super well organized and as a result it is harder than it needs to be - students had difficulty because of poorly designed exams (self acknowledged by the professors) that were unnecessarily frustrating.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course. There are some interesting topics like population growth, metapopulations, and competition dynamics--which is definitely worth your time. These early topics were very well taught. However, the second half of the course was pretty broad and did not feel particularly cohesive. Most of the information, like the way we discussed global warming for instance, was pretty intuitive (most people who are taking ecology already have a sense of the basics). The exams were quite difficult as well, and these exams were very difficult to prepare for.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to.",
    "This course is designed to give you a broad introduction to a range of topics and subfields within the field of ecology. I would definitely recommend this course because though there is a good amount of work; the work always feels worthwhile and that you are learning something new with each assignment. By the end of the semester you have learned many new tangible concepts and skills that you wouldn't have known otherwise.",
    "I would suggest this class if you are an EVST or E&EB major. The material is interesting but there are other classes you could take to learn the same thing and do half the work (i.e. Conservation Biology).",
    "If you are at all interested in Ecology, take this course! It will give you complex models for ecological concepts and open your eyes to all the tools and areas for study in this field. Be prepared to work harder for this class than you have for any other course, but to come away with a completely new framework for understanding the life around you. Excellent class!",
    "General Ecology discusses a few topics in Ecology very thoroughly, focusing especially on theoretical ecology and climate change. If the class is supposed to be a survey class of all of Ecology (as the name implies) it leaves out much of the experimentation and field component of Ecology. I also felt that in general the instructors did a poor job of communicating the importance and excitement of the field. Professor Vasseur was wonderful at explaining the theoretical side and I really enjoyed him as a professor. I felt excited to go to class when he was teaching. However, Professor Staver was disorganized and did not show any interest in the material which made really interesting things boring and seem irrelevant. As a whole I would not recommend this class if you already have some background in science and Ecology. The class expects very little of the students despite assigning complicated projects. I found this frustrating as well."
