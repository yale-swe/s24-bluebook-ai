    "This class really taught me a lot about what a religion is, how one might develop, how they influence and are influenced by society, and religion's role in fiction. This course helped me develoo my literary analysis skills.",
    "A really wonderful course that spans as many religious topics as possible. I did not know much \/ anything about religion prior to the class, and have since learned so much.",
    "For a start, this class opened my eyes to so many new religious ideologies, frameworks for viewing religion, and gave me a newfound awareness for questionable\/enigmatic ideas and tropes within literature. The course allowed me to re-learn (to a degree) how to re-take notes on the readings, and through blog posts, forced me to engage directly with the material while simultaneously provided an opportunity to express my own opinions in a semi-non-pressurized environment. Overall, I'm not sure if I'm going to become further involved in religious studies through my academic career, but I still felt challenged and slightly rewarded by my experience in the class. I definitely have a newfound appreciation and respect for the literary genre of science fiction, as well as the benefit of religion despite its factual authenticity (its \"functionalist\" definition rather than its \"essentialist\" one). The books and short stories we read were on the whole interesting, challenging, while very enjoyable and fascinating.",
    "Christianity, Islam, Hindu, New Religious Movement, Orientalism, etc.",
    "Prior to taking this class, I knew little about religious systems and science fiction. Now, I feel more confident beginning to identify certain cultural systems as religions and have conversations with people regarding what a religion is and clearing up some misconceptions that people have regarding new religious movements.",
    "I certainly gained a greater awareness for both the range of minority religions currently being practiced and the deep inter-relation between the religious and the recognizably fictional. One of the biggest take-aways is how difficult it is to define religion helpfully. Although we only touched on this briefly, the difficulty in defining religion has huge legal implications, which fascinates me."

   "comments": [
    "The class and Professor Doerfler really encourage interesting discussions on religion and its relation to society.",
    "The course has a large reading load, which, while consisting of a blend of esoteric, academic as well as prosaic and creative texts, was just generally a lot (not for the weak of heart!). One of the best and worst aspects of the course was the breadth of knowledge that we were expected to take in. While I learned quite a lot, in terms of class and reading time, I regret not being to fully engage\/understand more fully\/spend as much time on the material we covered as I would've liked (I understand that's also college in general, but still!). I'm always an advocate for seminar-style, discussion-based classes, but there were almost certain times when the conversation got convoluted and abstract that I would've appreciated the occasional lecture\/presentation straight from the professor. I really appreciated (though was understandably challenged by) the freedom we were given in our reading responses. While the mandatory (yet thankfully and occasionally lax) submission policy for online discussion threads before class forced me to respond directly and personally to the material, I wished the policy before class might've been to write and a response AND respond to another student's post. I tried to read everybody's interesting writing before class, yet I think if we had responded more to each other, we could have engaged more deeply during the course discussions.",
    "Can hear lots of different opinions about religions from many different perspectives",
    "Although I enjoyed reading scholarly works regarding science fiction in this course, I didn't always enjoy reading the science fiction itself. It might be better to use science fictions of greater quality, especially when it comes to analyzing these texts because for some of the novels, I found that even the author was inconsistent when it came to the religious system he\/she was presenting in the novel, which made it hard to comment on.",
    "Strengths: It's an engaging, not too serious freshman seminar and a lovely way to settle into Yale coursework as a first semester freshman (it can be a gut class if you make it one, but it's also a lot of fun). Dr. Doerfler is a great discussion leader and constantly offers to be a resource not just within the class but as you're figuring out how to Yale. Weaknesses: The assigned reading quantity fluctuates drastically, everything from 25 pages one class to 400ish for another. You'll either learn to skim, if you haven't, or you'll spend a lot of time reading sci-fi. Not a bad thing necessarily, but it can begin to feel excessive."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any freshman interested in science fiction and\/or religion!",
    "This course was incredible-- beyond the obvious intersection between religion and science fiction, this course also covered elements of Orientalism, new religious movements, and feminist writing, all subjects I had not expected during the course. These interesections brought about many lively discussions that I looked forward to every day.",
    "To be honest, I did not anticipate how rigorous this class was going to be academically. It should be made clear in the description that the course involves a heavy reading load, and I might even petition for the course to be deemed a writing credit, as the constant discussion posts, three papers, and lengthy final paper comprised a substantial amount of writing. Religion is a very tricky, abstract, and challenging concept, and the intellectual discourse was more often than not very daunting and esoteric; I came out of many classes confused (not always in a constructive way). There is a lot of discussion required, and I would recommend this class to students who are comfortable speaking with relatively sizable groups and those who are not afraid to mess up in front of others; there were times when the atmosphere felt a tad competitive, though overall, the class had a friendly ambience.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Even if you were not interested in religion or science fiction, you would enjoy this class and learn a lot.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Would definitely recommend if you're a freshman still figuring out how to navigate things. This is a fun, low-pressure class, and you'll get as much out as you put in. Doerfler is great, and as she mostly teaches upper-level RLST classes, it's nice to get to know her in a more low-key setting. If you like reading sci-fi for homework and theory articles like \"Matrixism, Jediism, Pastafarianism,\" this is the class for you. In my experience, it's not the class that will push your writing skills or change your life intellectually, but it's a fun, niche topic that rarely gets the kind of analysis it deserves."
