    "I recommend this class to students who have even the slightest interest in learning about medical anthropology.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you are interested in various topics in health, health disparities, or how health is understood cross-culturally.",
    "Yes! Great class! Not a light reading load, but very interesting stuff and Professor Brotherton is great. Highly recommended.",
    "Great class. If you are an anthro major the discussions might end up being a little light on the anthro, but it's a good opportunity to get to know different perspectives on topics of global health.",
    "I would recommend the course. Professor Brotherton was excellent. He was very engaging and open to students asking questions and giving their input. It was great that he made himself so available to discuss the final papers and the student run presentations. Professor Brotherton was very knowledgeable about the more theoretical side of anthropology which was a great value when we had our discussions. This was a wonderful class. It gave me a new perspective on how people of different cultural backgrounds experience health, illness, and the health care system. The seminar style of class was conducive to sharing our thoughts about the readings and I liked having one student lead the seminar each week."
