    "Take this class if you need the language requirement, or want to actually learn to start speaking and understanding French more fluently. Don't take it in the morning, waking up early every day gets to you after a while. It is an okay class.",
    "Never really learned much from this class. The way she tests on your complementary reading is ridiculous. You have to do much boring memorization to prove that you've actually read the material.",
    "Taking this class at 9:25 AM definitely put a damper on my appreciation for it, but I still don't think that I would have really enjoyed it at any point in the day. I took the course hoping to become a more confident and fluent French speaker, but it actually focused more on grammar, vocabulary, and reading\/writing. Because it wasn't interactive, I found myself bored and doing drills that I could have done by myself.",
    "Yes--it's fair but still challenging...if you want to learn french, take it."
