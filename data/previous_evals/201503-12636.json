   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. The workload was very manageable, and the exams weren't extremely stressful - if you attended class and did the readings you did fine.",
    "Yes, I would for sure recommend this course.",
    "If you want a relatively easy class and are interested in the more theoretical foundations for the political issues facing the nation today, definitely worth taking.",
    "crappy class, not worth an easy class, you'll fall asleep too easily.",
    "Straightforward PS credit, good PS class for both PS majors and non-PS majors.",
    "Take this course with Rachel Silbermann. Her lectures and lecture notes provide more than enough to do well. You will probably only need to skim the textbook at most, but I've heard it's a great replacement if you never go to lecture! But you should go to lecture. It's really easy. The course is very easy. All you have to do is read your articles, learn what the main points are, and study them. The exams for each module are very doable in the hour. And the final isn't really a final. It's the third module's exam with more time. It was so chill. I would take this course again, for sure. It's the best combination of easiness, understanding, and low workload I've had at Yale. General interest in politics helps a lot but isn't necessary. I would very strongly suggest this course with Rachel Silbermann. As for TFs, I had John, who I liked but I could see why others didn't. (Section was long, awkward, and quiet because people don't read.) I don't know what others thought about Matthew. 3 short exams (25% each), section (20%), \"one-minute papers\" that basically check if you have a brain and were breathing during lecture (so easy; 5%), and extra credit that I forgot to do, but honestly wouldn't have needed. Module 1: Political Foundations (founding era, federalism, civil rights\/liberties); Module 2: Political Institutions (the three branches, bureaucracy; Module 3: Political Behavior (public opinion, voting, campaigns, elections, political parties, interest groups, media, reform prospects).",
    "It was a good class and easy to follow. Interesting material. Make sure you're reading to better your experience. I would recommend this class, because it gives a good introductory insight into politics.",
    "It's exactly what it sounds like, it is an intro course to american politics and it is not that interesting. It is not hard to do well in the class though if you put the time in.",
    "great class if professor silberman isn't teaching. the material is interesting and its definitely interesting and important stuff to learn, but professor silberman does not have the confidence or delivery to be a lecturer. she is constantly reading from her notes or directly from the slide and has no confidence in the material so even though she is definitely knowledgeable on the subject, her delivery and nervousness EVERY DAY makes it harder to trust what she is saying",
    "Take this class ONLY if you are virtually ignorant about American political structures and can motivate yourself to go to lectures every week. It's an easy but boring class. Taking this class makes sense only if the material is completely new to you and you are willing to learn by absorbing the raw information presented in lectures. I would recommend it especially to international students.",
    "American Politics is a gut course to me. There is not a lot of preparation that is required other than studying for the tests and with a good TA who summarizes the readings well it is easy to be prepared for essay questions. It is interesting and as much work as you make it.",
    "I would recommend intro to American Politics to another student. It was my favorite class of the semester. With three midterms, discussion participation, and small one minute essay responses comprising the grade, the workload is not too bad. Professor Silbermann is engaging and so sweet, while the TA's were also wonderful. The readings aren't too dense, and if you put in the work it is an easy A.",
    "A very good intro course for anyone interested in American politics. The readings and textbook are very detailed but the most important takeaways (for the tests and for basic political knowledge) are the principles of political logic that underly each chapter. If you understand these, the course becomes pretty interesting and easy to study for. The lectures and TA sessions cover what you need to know for the very approachable tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because I already have!",
    "Hardest class I've ever had to sit through. Everyone around me also seemed to hate it. She grades way more thoroughly than she teaches.",
    "The midterms are graded very harshly but teachers are nice",
    "I would recommend the course if you are interested in the subject matter",
    "Yes",
    "Interesting material but a lot of the lectures were just notes and powerpoints being read. Spend a good time comprehending the reading if you can."
