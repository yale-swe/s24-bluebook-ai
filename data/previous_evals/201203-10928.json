    "Excellent. It feels odd to gush about a course on genocide, but this seminar was truly excellent.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to others",
    "I would recommend the course for those unexposed to the study of violence or to comparative history. HIST 980 is a sweeping comparative-historical survey of worldwide instances of genocide and its theory. The course also couples with Yale's Genocide Studies Program, exposing students to current work in the field -- both academic and non-academic work."

    "Though the course did not directly impact my dissertation research it very deeply indirectly impacted my dissertation research by encouraging me to think more theoretically about violence. The course very greatly deepened my knowledge of Genocide Studies and the historical profession."
