    "I would recommend the Cosmology class to fellow students. The material was interesting, the problem sets instructive, and Priya is a great teacher.",
    "I would summarize Physics 600 as a solid course to take in order to be fairly comfortable sitting in on seminars (YCAA or Astro Colloquium) presenting current research in cosmology. It is probably helpful to have some familiarity with current research topics already, and Phys 600 helps clarify the foundations behind these topics. So, I would in fact recommend a student interested in doing research in cosmology to take this course.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot in this course and it is an excellent review and\/or introduction to lots of key physics and astronomy.",
    "This was a great introduction to Cosmology taught by an awesome professor who is doing some fantastic research in the field. The material was challenging but never unreasonable, and the workload was pretty light for most of the semester- up until the final, which was ridiculously long. The homework could have been more interesting\/useful- I sometimes felt like I was just regurgitating material from lecture or the book(s) without having to figure too much out on my own. Still, you'll come out with a good grasp of this wonderful subject."
