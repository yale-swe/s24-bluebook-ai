    "The second semester of DS Philosophy primarily focuses on epistemology and morality. Its thinkers develop a lot of the thoughts of DS Philosophy Semester 1 into what feel like more relevant arguments to the modern age. Really wonderful material, if you're down to do some deep thinking.",
    "This is a great introduction to modern philosophy and I would highly recommend it!",
    "Continuation of first semester DS, but with more interesting material.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy, much like any Directed Studies course, is fast-paced, rigorous, and highly engaging. To get much out of Directed Studies Philosophy, one must fully engage with the course material before the section begins. Lectures do facilitate learning, but much must be done on one's own. As a result, Directed Studies Philosophy remains a difficult, but not overpowering, course to take. A recommendation, however, is contingent upon a fellow student's desire to take the Directed Studies curriculum, rather than the course itself. If he\/she is up to all three courses, then I would recommend Directed Studies Philosophy by all means."
