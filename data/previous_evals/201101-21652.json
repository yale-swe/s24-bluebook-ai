    "I would not recommend BRST 179 to another student, though this might not matter as it may have been a course intended specifically for the spring 2011 term of Yale-in-London. Do the reading list on your own time - it contains a lot of great books (and a couple really boring texts too) - but I didn't feel that I gained much from discussion that I did not already get while reading.",
    "If they're interested in the topic, then yes. But if they are just looking for a literature class, there are many that are more interesting.",
    "It is a class that examines novels simultaneously taking place in London and somewhere else in the world. It's a bit... abstract sometimes, but you'd like it."
