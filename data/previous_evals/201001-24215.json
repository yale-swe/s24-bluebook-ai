    "It takes a particular type of person to fall in love with printmaking, which involves complex technical aspects as much as creativity. But I loved it. Printmaking is so different from other types of art and Yale classes, and the class is cool because you work on your portfolio while you learn new techniques that you can't really get elsewhere. And you have multiple copies of almost all your work, so you can share!If you've taken Printmaking I, Silkscreen, or Lithography already, you probably know to what extent you enjoy printmaking or not. This class will let you work more independently in a variety of forms of printmaking.The workload can be a lot, especially if you are very serious, but the payout is good.",
    "Great class, definitely take if you like printmaking.",
    "Definitely, it was one of my favorite classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Art majors should definitely take it because printmaking is a great medium. Its a good class for non-art najors too. You get a lot of really cool work done and learn a lot about printmaking."
