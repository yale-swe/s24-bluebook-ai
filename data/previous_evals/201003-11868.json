    "The workload isn't too bad, but the exams are far too hard. It's also all pure math, with very little application. And don't take it with Zhenqi Wang. She doesn't speak English (not exaggerating). Most people in the class dropped it or switched to a different section. I wish I had.",
    "Mathematics 115 covers many topics involving integration, such as area, volume, parametrics, polar, sequences, and sums.It is not very difficult and as long as you stay on top of your p-sets, you should be fine. The book is very helpful if you do not understand any of the material.I would recommend this class to any students who are familiar with Calculus, but do not want to take Math 120.",
    "Don't take it. Drop to 112",
    "Math 115 is a course well worth your time. You learn a lot and it's not too difficult.",
    "I would not recommend Math 115 to a fellow student unless they had taken it in high school. The material is very difficult and is covered at a very fast pace that is not always well explained.",
    "I would recommend the class only if you absolutely need to take it. Make sure you get a professor you can understand."
