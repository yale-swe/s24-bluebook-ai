    "Definitely take it!",
    "The good: This is by far the least work you will ever have to do for a writing credit. There are just four 300 word essays and a final 1500 word paper! The readings are interesting and thought provoking, and basically cover different sides to one central question: Can you build a mind out of software.The bad: Gelernter is very repetitious, and invariably spends the entire class talking about the same idea over and over again. This forced me to weigh the costs and benefits of coming to class every Monday and Wednesday.Honestly though, you could get by just fine without ever coming to class (since all the assignments are based on the readings). Just make sure you manage to get the handouts from somewhere, because he doesn't post them online.Useful tip: To guarantee yourself a good grade in the essays, make sure you don't have a single \"unnecessary\" word. He means it when he emphasizes simple, to-the-point writing.",
    "little work; grades hard on writing; interesting material but very little material",
    "It's okay. Take it if you need a writing credit..even tho its only a few short one-page papers, the grading is difficult. Not a lot of reading though and the lecture is just a sumary of the reading so missing lecture a few times doesnt put you much behind",
    "The class is, by far, one of the most interesting and rewarding class I have taken at Yale. Not only did it help me how to write (writing concise) it taught me to think analytically beyond I thought was possible. This class matured the way I think about our human mind as well as the reason why we live in this world. It will make you think about why humans are so special. It will make you think beyond the obvious answers, and at the same time, learn to express abstract concepts clearly in your essay.",
    "Your only grades are from several short writing assignments and one final longer writing assignment. The professor is very particular about the tiniest details in your writing, so the assignments can be very stressful if you're concerned about getting an A. The material itself was interesting, but the writing topics sometimes didnt go very well with the reading. The class was not as simple as I assumed.",
    "It's a good writing credit. You focus on writing well rather than writing long, which I thought was very helpful. The papers are all interesting and none too long. If you are at all interested in whether an artificial mind can ever be built, take this class.",
    "CPSC150 is a really easy WR credit. A few 300 word essays and a final 1500 word paper. Once you get a feel for what he's looking for in grading, it's easy to get As.The material is interesting, but this class is SO BORING. The professor just drones on and on and on, clarifies concepts everyone already understands, and leaves no room for student discussion. If I were you I'd look for a different writing class.",
    "I am not sure if I recommend the class. It requires more work than you think it does, unless you are very used to philosophical writing. The grading is rather harsh.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It requires no prior knowledge concerning the philosophy of mind. The readings are very interesting. The workload is very manageable. However, even though the essays are short, they may be difficult to write. You get out of this class as much as you put in.",
    "not much work. interesting. need to be able to write clearly"
