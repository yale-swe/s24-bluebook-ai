    "Yes, I would recommend it... most of all if you're passionate about the syllabus.What you read and whether you enjoy it or not really defines this class... It's all about whether you're excited to read the books or not.",
    "I would recommend the course English 127, but with a different professor. Considering some of the other professors who I know were teaching it this semester, I am quite honestly disappointed to have been placed in this section specifically. However, all learning styles are different, and I'm sure students who enjoy very casual, surface-level discussions of literature would benefit from this section.",
    "I would say the work load is slight but the amount of reading is heavy. The course does seem to be targeted at those interested in pursuing english majors.",
    "In the spirit of Professor Cecire, who encouraged us to live-tweet Moby-Dick (an offer I don't think anyone took her up on), I will write this evaluation in the form of a tweet.If you want to discover some great works of American literature and brag to all your friends that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read Moby-Dick, take this class! #ProfessorCecireistheshitIn all seriousness, Professor Cecire is super nice, very easy to talk to, and a fair grader. The workload (minus reading Moby-Dick) is really ridiculously light, especially during the poetry unit. (Literally, reading Emily Dickinson took 10 minutes.) It all does depend on your class, though. I personally really liked my class, and I thought everyone had insightful things to contribute. Also, Professor Cecire is really passionate about literature and says really smart things without being pretentious. Just be aware that it is an intro class, so you will spend an inordinate amount of time going over how to write an essay and things like that.",
    "It was disappointing compared to what I was hoping for. It is not a bad class, it just depends on the professor.",
    "I would recommend the class but warn that I was slightly disappointed by the lack of depth with which we discussed the material. The class was a very interesting look at american history through literature, but a less interesting look at the literature itself. That being said the class varies by section. All sections of this class read Moby Dick which is the best book ever.",
    "I'd say it's a good course if you want to read some classic American works and have a better understanding of the American tradition. If you're studying to be a really intensive reader, this class is maybe not the best because it's more relaxed and a little less intense than that."
