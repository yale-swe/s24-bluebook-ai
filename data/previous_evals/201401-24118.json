   "comments": [
    "This course is very well taught. Professor Dubrow really listens to the students and takes their feedback into account. Although the exams are not difficult, you must study for them to do well.",
    "- Homeworks are tedious and often hard- Lectures were helpful for tests",
    "Strength: Very comprehensive, insightful and applied to the fieldWeakness: Work load too much, pay attention to very detailed subtle things and exams should be open-book if the goal is to memorize every detail in the course",
    "I learned a lot from this course, and really appreciated the improvements Dr. Dubrow made to the course after student feedback. It would have been nice if there was a textbook available for the course instead of the individual articles. I actually think the best resources were the chapters that Dr. Dubrow wrote himself. I wish there were more of those!",
    "There is SO much material that is covered in this course, sometimes I felt like it would be better to focus on less material in order to understand it better. Many of the topics flowed well from EPI I, but there were other topics (like molecular biology) that seemed out of place.",
    "This is probably the class i learned the most in at YSPH. Not only does this course teach you how to critically read and analyze papers but it ties all other public health concepts together. Courses like AAMIE teach you how to analyze data in SAS but this course teaches you the meaning behind the analysis. It covers everything from outbreak investigations to modeling to really making you understand confounding\/bias. It takes a little while to get used to Dr. Dubrow but as soon as he starts talking about medical concepts he brightens up and seems more enthusiastic. If your interested in medicine at all this is a great class because all of the examples relate to either chronic or infectious diseases. He also has a lot of clicker questions which while they can be challenging are a good way to study for the tests and see if you understand the material.",
    "I appreciated the lecture notes. They were very thorough and had good examples. I also appreciated the clicker questions. Sometimes the wording on homework questions was a bit unclear. I also do not particularly like the format of discussion sections, where we go around the room answering questions. It does not really facilitate discussion.",
    "This course is very useful.",
    "Strengths: helpful when taken alongside Biostatistics II and Applied Analytics Methods in Epidemiology",
    "Epi II is a very useful class, and should be required for all students in addition to Biostats.The homeworks however were very time consuming, and I wish included problems similar to the exams, rather than on a journal article every week.",
    "Epidemiology became much more complex in this semester. However, deeper understanding of epidemiology methods and applications made our logical thinking much stronger, and it helped a lot on research paper reading across every courses.",
    "The range of topics covered is good, as is the depth for each subject. That we have to read articles for the homework and tests instead of working on made-up problems is very nice--I both became more familiar with the literature (mostly in areas I would not have otherwise read) and learned how to better read a paper.The lectures were not my favorite. I found them to be slow in parts, with too much emphasis placed on made-up examples for concepts and not enough time discussing details of the concept itself.",
    "I really liked this course, and in particular I felt that the clicker questions were a key component of my ability to learn and understand the course material. I think the clicker questions should remain a central tenet of the class going forward.",
    "I loved this course. I think one of the most important skills PH people need to know is how to tell a good study from a bad one because we make policy decisions based on evidence, but not all evidence is created equal. Now I have a lot of fun looking through studies and discerning whether they are quality studies or not. It's almost like playing detective. By far the most useful class I have taken thus far at YSPH.",
    "Information\/theory intensive. Challenging but fairly so. A bit bare bones but structure certainly lends to exposure\/indulgence to key concepts.",
    "I thought this was a really great class on specific applications of epi concepts and it really broadened my epi knowledge. I felt like the course was kind of poorly organized, though. In Epi 1 there was a clear flow to the point where you could kind of predict what was coming next. In this class it felt like the topics were kind of haphazardly arranged which sometimes make it confusing.",
    "This course was very useful in understanding key public health concepts. Additionally, it really helped in understanding things for other courses.",
    "I did not enjoy this course. Although I did learn quite a bit about how to analyze different epidemiological studies, I found the lectures hard to follow and uninteresting. The clicker questions did help, but because it was voluntary not everyone would participate. They should have them count as part of our participation grade if they want more people to use them (the grade should not depend on whether people got the correct answer or not, just that they used it, and were actively participating).",
    "Great class overall. However, I felt that there was a lot of focus on topics that don't concern me. For example, we spent a long time and there was a lot of energy expended on genetic epidemiology. I understand why it is important but I know that I, and many other people, will never be doing this kind of epi so I felt that learning this served very little purpose for me.",
    "I enjoyed this course greatly and felt that it improved my understanding of epidemiological concepts. I especially enjoyed the interactive clicker questions and the review for each of the exam. I felt it was an excellent way to gauge my understanding of all of the individual concepts. I also really liked the professor and the interactive spirit he tried to encourage in the class.",
    "The course was definitely challenging, but it was well organized and well taught. The homework and discussions sections were important for driving in the concepts. A good course overall.",
    "useful, elaborately introduced the basics of epidemiology",
    "Much more difficult than epi I but probably more worthwhile.",
    "Very good for improving epi reading skills",
    "This is a very applied and practical class, where students learn epidemiologic concepts in an article-based\/example-based manner. The clicker questions are a great learning tool.",
    "I learned a lot and think it's a great course that built off the concepts from Epi I. Although I really disliked doing the homework every week, they really helped to solidify concepts learned during each week, and made studying for exams a little bit easier. The use of the clickers was super helpful! They really tested our knowledge and checked to make sure we understood what was being taught. My only recommendation is to try to make the course lecture slides a little less wordy, more colorful and more interesting. Sometimes I found it a bit difficult to pay attention to the slides as they were.",
    "I learned very useful skills but I often felt like I was swimming upstream to do so. The lectures were a bit disorganized sometimes and my TA was often not able to really provide great clarification, so I felt like I was swimming through a bunch of information and having to find my own structure. I also felt like there was a lot of ambiguity in how homework and exam questions were phrased and often more than one right answer, which made it difficult to get a strong grasp on the material. Lastly, I struggled to discern what Dr. Dubrow was asking for on exams and felt that there were a lot of \"grey areas,\" which I realize is sometimes unavoidable in epidemiology but at the same time makes it very difficult for a student to get a good handle on the material. Anything that can be done to make the \"lines\" a bit more clear would be useful from an education standpoint.",
    "The clicker questions were helpful for generating discussion, which made the material a lot more palatable. The homework assignments could be a little bit tedious, but most of the article selections were interesting.",
    "material was useful in understanding how public health research is conducted",
    "Instructor is very receptive to feedback and very helpful one-on-one. There is a lot of material so keeping up with it week to week is very important. Class helped me better understand the research articles and analysis that we've encountered in other classes.",
    "I had a hard time following the material and getting a lot out of the class.",
    "The material is very interesting and important to know. The problem sets were long but always covered interesting and useful topics",
    "Great course, but too much material.",
    "This is one of the best classes in YSPH and my favorite one. Major strengths are its content and the way how it is sequenced and taught. The weaknesses include that it seems that the TAs are not discussing in depth the explanation to the assignment\/exams answers with the professor, and that the course doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a special or additional discussion section for PhDs. Therefore, it can be improved if the explanations to the assignments\/exams answers are discussed more in depth, and by having a separated discussion section for PhDs, respectively.",
    "The course is extremely well thought trough and well-structured. It covers many topics, and established a good ground for understanding epidemiology and taking more advanced courses.",
    "This was an excellent class that exposed me to the most important concepts in epi, in a short time period.",
    "It goes into a lot of the detail of epi and really builds on what we learned last semester. Glad I took this.",
    "Strengths: help students to have a much more profound understanding of Epidemiology, great interaction with students by using clickersWeaknesses: too many homework assignment",
    "Lecture slides were well structured and explained concepts well; the homework assignments were long, but not difficult and applicable to the material of the week.",
    "I think this course would benefit from more in-depth coverage of a few specific topics that students are more likely to use frequently, and less coverage of methods that students are unlikely to use.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive, covers all the basics of more advanced epi, and applicable to real life situations.Weaknesses: difficult to engage in sometimes"

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is one of the sweetest professors I have met. He acknowledged that he's not the most engaging lecturer and is a littlebit awkward but he cares so much about his students. If you participate and try in the class you can get a lot out of it. It is a two-way learning street. I did find it hard to pay attention the first few classes but after you got used to his style and slides and methods of teaching it was an amazing class and he was an amazing professor. I think if he focused more on medical examples it would be a little better since that seems to be his focus as well. He really cares about the students and makes sure they understand some concepts!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Friendly, but made the material very dry and only read off the slides instead of trying to engage the students.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I enjoyed Dr. Dubrow's lectures. The content was thorough, and the examples were helpful.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr Dubrow is excellent! He is very responsible. I like him very much. Hope he can be the teacher of the year in this year!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Strengths: responds and incorporates feedback at midterm evaluation",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a very caring instructor, and is willing to take the time to make sure his student's understand the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I have never seen any instructors like Dr.Dubrow who was so dedicated in teaching, and willing to adjust for better and clearer lecture notes after class evaluations. He made the complex epidemiology thinking more acceptable to us. I really appreciated learning from him and really enjoyed this semester.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I found the lectures to be a bit slow, with Prof. Dubrow sometimes asking for class responses and waiting a long time for responses. I agree it is silly for no one to answer, but the clickers may be a better way to get audience feedback.I and others also struggled with unclear test questions. An example doesn't come to mind, but answers sometimes felt like an opinion or certain interpretation.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a great teacher. I appreciated his clear and thoughtful slides and also his ability to assist students and respond to questions outside of normal class time.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a not a show-man of a teacher but he is thorough, clear, and really values student opinions on how to make the course better. His powerpoints and lecture notes are amazing in that they walk you through every point in a very clear way. I occasionally had very minor questions that I would go to office hours for to clarify but overall he taught the course in an excellent fashion.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Knowledgeable, inviting. Monotone diminishes the impact of his ability a bit. But has a real genuine interest in student participation and progress.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow clearly really knows his stuff and I thought he was a good teacher. He was very responsive to student feedback, and if things seemed like they were unclear to us, he would go over them again in a different way. He did a great job incorporating clicker questions to drive home important concepts.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0A very good professor that did a thorough job explaining. Assignments were extremely helpful in making sure we understood epi topics.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I would say that the majority of the time, he did not teach the material in a way that was easy to understand. His slides could also be hard to follow at times because there were no explanations as to how he arrived at a particular conclusion.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is very intelligent and entertaining.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I really liked the professor and the interactive spirit he tried to encourage in the class. While I understand that many people would call him a bit of a boring lecture, I felt that on the whole he was intelligible and presented the topics in a clear and straightforward fashion. Additionally Dr. Dubrow was very open to feedback on his lectures and the course and I felt put a lot of effort into making the course as successful as possible.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow taught concepts clearly and effectively. His clicker questions were also well chosen, and he really made them good learning opportunities. I really appreciated that we use important and influential studies for the homework and in the class examples and that he attempted to keep things consistent with what we learn in biostats II. He was also very receptive to student feedback.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0conscientious, considerate of students",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0See above.Also, Dr. Dubrow is a kind and intelligent man, but sometimes can be a bit difficult to understand and not that engaging during class. Clicker questions were very helpful and I would recommend these are continued. I also think another goal could be to make the slides slightly less wordy while still maintaining the key messages and themes that are essential for students to learn the concepts.",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Instructor was very helpful in office hours and though lecture is not always the most engaging, he kept us thinking and brought up interesting real-world examples for us to connect concepts that we are learning in class.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0So very nice and clear, but could be more engaging.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0The instructor was obviously passionate about the topic and extremely knowledgable. He taught at a good pace and tried to be sure that everyone understood the important concepts. The energy of the class could use improvement.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Monotonous, but very open to meet with students and very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0The instructor is one of the best I ever had. The instructor major strength is his ability to integrate the theory with practical applications in a really good way for the learning process, including the use of technological tools, and to approach the student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doubts and needs. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any weakness.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a great teacher. His lecturing style is a little dry, and it may discourage students from taking the course, but, at the end of the day, we're all interested in learning new things from the courses we are taking rather than having fun during lectures.Dr. Dubrow prepares lectures and homework assignments and selects readings very thoroughly, and he is also very approachable and sensitive to students' needs.I liked clicker questions a lot!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is sweet, caring, and very passionate about epi. Although Professor Dubrow is monotone, his kind personality along with his undeniable love for epi, will force you to love epi as well. Dubrow is extremely attentive to his students' demands and concerns. He makes you fill out a mid-semester evaluation in order to improve the class. As a result of this, he made the hw of a shorter\/more tolerable length after we voiced our concerns. He put clicker questions right in the middle of lectures when we told him we would prefer this. He even asked us to vote on the number of articles we wanted in our final exam. More professors should learn from Dubrow. He is truly concerned about his students and he wants to involve the students in every decision he makes.Only improvement: Be less monotone.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Great guy. Monotone but brilliant. No complaints.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0A great and considering instructor",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Really took the time to gather feedback about the course and very responsive as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Instructor is very good at providing answers in a 1 on 1 setting. Lecture formats are ok, but it is difficult to be engaging in a large lecture. I think that more time spent in the smaller breakout sessions and less time in lecture might be beneficial.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is an extremely intelligent, thoughtful man who is sensitive to feedback. I appreciate him as an Epi professor and I have nothing bad to say about him."

    "Instructor: Mary Christine Playdon \u00a0Mary is knowledgeable and thorough. She had great examples and walked you through the homeworks so that everything was laid clear. She is patient and kind in helping you realize errors and understand the why they were mistakes.My only qualm is that she made sure the section took the entire hour and 15 minutes when the course could have been taught in less time without loosing content or understanding. It's pretty brutal to drag out the class at 9am when everyone already understands the material.",

   "comments": [
    "It's not that bad, but it does take time and work.",
    "Hard, necessary, you have to put the work in if you want to do well (especially if Epi doesn't come easy to you)",
    "Helpful, but takes lots of time to learn",
    "Would definitely recommend for students looking to get more in depth knowledge about epi",
    "This course was a lot of work and hard to keep up with. I ended up learning a lot, once I started to understand Dubrow's style of delivering material. I would recommend this class only for people who really want to learn more epidemiology and who are willing to put in the work for it.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes i've taken at Yale. I think I learnt the most out of it and I don't think it should be optional for any track. This class really ties together all the concepts of public health. It is also a good class to take at the same time as AAMIE or Biostats because it helps explain the concepts in more detailed and from a more practical point of view. By not making this class mandatory for everyone in this program, it is a disservice to them. Personally, I don't believe you get a true PH education without this background. You just have to stick through the first few weeks and get used to him, but he listens to feed back and really tries to make improvements throughout the semester. He is looking out for his students and that is obvious.",
    "It is a very good course. I would recommend it because it is challenging, but not overwhelming. It is a good review of some topics from Epi I, and it goes into furtherdetail. There is also some new content that is well covered and important.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to others. The course covered most of the important epidemiological issue. However, I think the topics covered were too much for one course. There were more time needed to work on each of the topics to understand them deeply.",
    "Great!! Strong recommendation!",
    "Epidemiology is the building block in both CDE and EMD, for those students in these two departments should definitely take Epi II in the spring semester to a deeper understanding of the Epi world, especially before the summer internship.",
    "This is a continuation of Epi I. Some of the material overlaps, but it's often more in-depth in Epi II, and the course will give you a better sense of the field overall.",
    "A good follow-up to intro to EPI I that holds its own and incorporates more quantitative work than what one might expect, but in a edifying way.",
    "This course gives you hands-on practice with many of the epi skills you learned in Epi 1. It also gets into the details of how to do more complex epi research. I would recommend it to a fellow student interested in a research career.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Good class overall and you will gain a really deep understanding of epidemiological methods.",
    "I felt this course took the basic epidemiological topics that were established in Epi I, built on them and also added a lot of more advanced topics to research and study design which I feel to be invaluable to publishing a quality paper. Overall, I greatly enjoyed the class and would recommend it to anyone seriously considering conducting epidemiological research or studies.",
    "This class was very useful, and coming out of it I feel as if I really have a good grasp on key epi concepts. I can now read a scientific article an not only understand it, but also critique it. The class does a good job of building on Epi I. The course can start off slow or seem a little dry, but I really feel that the material you learn in this course will be very useful in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Because it is helpful in the future work.",
    "I would recommend the course because I learned way more in Epi 2 than epi 1. I can actually see myself using these skills.",
    "I will recommend it for all of the epi students.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it has an emphasis on practical skills in Epi.",
    "Despite how much work was involved, I thoroughly enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Useful class, would recommend based on the practical skills one acquires. But I would tell students that the teaching still needs some work and that they might find themselves confused from time to time.",
    "Would recommend it. Gives a broad overview of epi and even stats topics in a way that makes other classes easier to understand.",
    "I would recommend it for any epidemiology students",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it gives a much richer understanding of epidemiology. It is a lot tougher and more in-depth than EpiI, but it is also much more interesting and applicable to our future public health work.",
    "great course for those who want to do epi research, unnecessary and difficult for those who do not",
    "Covers important concepts like sample size, power, confounding, bias, RCTs, etc. It is a great class to take to understand the basics of epidemiology and conducting studies.",
    "Great course for fundamental epidemiological concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is the best epidemiology course I have ever taken and the most excellent epidemiology course for intermediate and advanced students that is being offered at YSPH. It is an extremely important course for any public health student who wants to become a good epidemiologist.",
    "Highly recommended to everyone, who wants to understand epidemiology. This course provides a perfect basis for learning more advanced epi topics in future.",
    "This is an excellent follow-up course to epi I. I totally recommend the course in spite of the long hws.",
    "It will kick your butt but you should take it.",
    "My favorite course around this semester and i recommend it",
    "Nice follow-up to Epi I. This class emphasized application of concepts learned in Epi I along with new material, with a focus on dissecting published articles to get afeel for both Epi research and study designs.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student who is interested in evaluating or conducting epidemiologic studies.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone serious about public health."
