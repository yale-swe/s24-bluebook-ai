   "comments": [
    "If you haven't taken a stat course before, or feel like you didn't learn it well in high school (or undergrad), I'd certainly recommend the class. (If you feel like a particular week is review for you, take the time to read some of the ClassesV2 bonus material, which is excellent). If you've already written a competent results section or two, or you understand main effects\/interactions\/correlation\/regression, this will probably be a little too basic.",
    "Yes, if you are in the social sciences and working with individual level data, this is a great introductory class. You work with your own data and get great attention and feedback from the professor and TA.",
    "Provided a good base for understanding common statistical concepts. Yes, I'd recommend it because I felt it helped my understanding of stats for my research.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as a good basic statistics course.",
    "Yes. Of course, it is also required!",
    "I might recommend it for students who knows SPSS already, instead of students who do not SPSS before taking the course.",
    "This is a great (grad-level) introductory statistics class. It's a good blend of practical and theoretical. I'd recommend it.",
    "This class is crucial for understanding the basics of statistics, and it would be very difficult to plan and execute research without knowing the material covered in this class.",
    "Psychology 518 01 is a good introductory course for multivariate statistics. It will cover much of the basic statistics used in the field but you will need to take additional courses provided in the department for higher level statistics commonly used in Clinical\/Social Psych research. I would recommend this course, even if you feel you know some of the basics, even if it is a refresher class for some.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another graduate student. The class improved my data analysis skills and I felt that I got a lot out of the class in terms of learning new strategies to apply to my own research.",
    "It's a course on univariate ANOVAs with an emphasis on calculation by-hand and SPSS. At the end of the course there is a grab bag of other approaches, like mediation analysis and factor analysis, that give a good (though brief) overview."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Well, I can do real science now, so that helps. (I'm a sophomore).",
    "Yes, it helped me immensely with learning how to use SPSS and write up results for publication. Really loved it! Very practical and to the point.",
    "It didn't help my area specifically. It helped me learn statistical concepts that I will hopefully be able to apply to my research.",
    "This was a useful review and quick exposure to new concepts that I would like to learn more about. I think it will provide a good foundation for future learning that will help me as I continue my own research.",
    "I can write results sections now that aren't gibberish. My experimental designs are more complex and interesting now, too.",
    "It was completely crucial. My only complaint is that there was only one course. I would have appreciated a second introductory statistics class to go into latent variables, and maybe more on regression.",
    "I learned more statistics than I probably need to know for my research but I feel this is a good thing. I will be able to better understand research from other areas in the field of psychology which is a good asset to have. As far as my dissertation\/research, I feel I can analyze my data more efficiently and have more options for analyzing said data.",
    "This course greatly added to my knowledge about how to approach data analysis and how different approaches to data analysis could shape results. I know that I will use the skills I learned in this class in my future research, including my dissertation. The focus of the class was on the strategies that we will most likely use in our future research and this focus was much appreciated.",
    "I definitely learned some things from this course, but I already had a very strong stats background so I mostly found it repetitive and was somewhat upset we did not get any further. The things I learned that were helpful were SPSS syntax, Cronbach's alpha, mediation, and using SPSS for factor analysis."
