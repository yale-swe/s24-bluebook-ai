    "This class does three things- it explains refugee law within the context of the US, it examines legal theory and how the law is applied in a policy context, and it builds different analytical skills. I learned so much. Take this class.",
    "Excellent class. Take any class with Dufresne. Her passion is evident and transfers to the class. Not as good of a class (though still good) for people who have taken immigration law or are very familiar with legal coursework.",
    "This course did a great job at really making us think hard and think through the many facets and issues in refugee law--political, legal, humanitarian, and practical considerations. I LOVED being \"put in the driver's seat\" and having the chance to come up with our own formulations and interpretations of law, policy recommendations, and legal arguments. (It's a really great way to learn and also gave me a lot of confidence when I was done). The emphasis on working with classmates was also wonderful; I really wish more classes at Yale did this. I don't feel like I'm any sort of \"expert\" now, but I DO feel like I've gained skills of legal interpretation, analysis, and argumentation and really accomplished something this semester. The only downside is that there is just so much to cover, so many interesting arguments to make back and forth, and our class was fairly large, so you're always left feeling like you wanted more. Dufresne is great. Her expectations of us were always high but somehow reasonable. She placed more emphasis on thinking through problems and learning from each other--such a breath of fresh air from other classes at Yale. Every assignment had a purpose and was a chance to learn, apart from allowing her to evaluate us.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The class deals with real-life refugee law issues and reforms within the system.",
    "YES. yes yes yes yes. But only if you're motivated and willing to work incredibly hard. Not worth taking if you're going to slack off. Wouldn't recommend it as a fifth class-- I only loved it so much because I was able to spend at least 15 hr\/ week on the reading and assignments.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. You learn a lot about a specific facet of immigration law - asylum law - and the political and legal issues that stem from that subject matter. At the same time, you learn important legal skills - how to make an argument, articulate it both verbally and in writing, as well as the different \"plays\" you can make when you're doing an oral argument. The course is also an artful blend of statutory law from your textbook and memoirs from actually asylum-seekers, so you really get a full picture.",
    "Yes! If you get into this class, definitely take it. I think that this is one of those classes that can actually change your life. For me, this class has made me want to work on refugee law in the next few years and has made realize that I definitely want to go to law school at some point. I have other friends who have felt the same way after taking this class. Refugee law is probably one of the most interesting areas of law that you can find, and Professor Dufresne loves the material so much that it shows whenever she speaks. Professor Dufresne really cares about the material - and she will do anything in her power to help you get the most out of the class because she wants you to learn as much as you want. The work baseline for this class is high - you are expected to do a lot of work. However, this is one of those classes in which you can never do enough work - there's so much to learn (and you will want to learn more even if it's not required material because you'll simply fall in love with the material) and in that sense you will get out of this class as much as you put in. Just be ready to put in a lot.",
    "This was the best class I've taken at Yale. If you are interested in refugees and the law, or are trying to decide if you are interested in these , you must take this class. You learn a tremendous amount about US law as it applies to those seeking asylum in the United States. The class discussion is very strong and the weekly homework assignments are creative, challenging and enjoyable to complete. Everyone in the class had to lead oral arguments in front of the class (you are assigned to either the asylum seeker's side or the Department of Homeland Security and have to argue that side for a particular case.) But the oral arguments are not as intimidating as they are made out to be. There is a presentation that allows you to act as a policy maker, and the final paper is a legal brief in which you represent an asylum seeker. The class is very hands-on and teaches you to apply the legal knowledge you gain throughout the course. It is a lot of work, but it is entirely manageable. I would imagine it would be hard to complete if you're not interested in refugee issues though, as it gets into a lot of detail on a very narrow topic. Professor Dufresne is fantastic. She leads dynamic seminars, facilitates strong discussion, develops interesting and creative assignments, challenges you, provides tons of feedback on your work, and is attuned to the needs and pressures of the class.",
    "Fantastic class. Demanding but not unreasonably so, it's definitely possible to juggle this class with other ones (though I get the sense that the workload may have been a bit lighter this year relative to past years b\/c Prof. Dufresne was dealing with a lot of things outside of the classroom). A must-take if you're interested in immigration\/migration\/legal methods\/the American prison system; still highly recommended even if you're not.",
    "I was really on the fence about this class after I got in. It was my 5th class, so I took it credit\/d\/fail. Looking back, I put so much work into the class that it seems silly that I didn't take it for a grade. The classes focuses more on refugee law then policy, but its a really amazing course at Yale. I would recommend it even if you aren't super interested in refugee issues to begin with. Almost every class you have in class debates, which you might be called on to debate for your side -- so you always have to be on your toes. It might seem intimidating at first, but don't stress too much about it, your classmates will bail you out if you need help. The key to the course is figuring out how to what to read for when you are going over the cases -- and taking notes as you read that you can refer to during the class. Overall, this is one the best classes I've taken at Yale. Take it if you get the chance.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I REPEAT, TAKE THIS COURSE. It's absolutely incredible. It's one of those rare classes that teaches you a life skill in addition to how to think analytically and creatively. Dufresne was inspiring. You have to work hard, but there's a lot of teamwork, and I have never felt that I was doing anything unnecessary or that didn't help me better understand refugee law.",
    "Yes, yes, yes, but only if you don't take more than 4 classes and are serious about this.",
    "Refugee Law, as past reviewers have said and this year's will no doubt say as well, is an excellent class and will be among the very best you take at Yale. The class is mostly devoted to refugee LAW, and you go chapter by chapter through an interesting textbook pitched to the law school level. On top of that are in-depth reading of specific cases and preparation on certain weeks for randomly-assigned mock trials of the case. Thrown in at the beginning are some more theoretical andhistorical thoughts, and the end of the class devotes a couple weeks to policy and reform ideas. The workload is tough - about 100 + pages of legal reading plus weekly short answer \/ mini essays that can easily run to 4 or 5 pages - but I got the feeling that this year the workload wasn't as bad as in past years, and it definitely tapered off a little towards the end. Besides, though, the homework is fairly engaging and extremely helpful for learning and arguing about the material.Dufresne is an excellent teacher and ensures the class runs well while also drawing out the most from everyone. Though it's the type of class that'll be interesting regardless of your pre-existing excitement for the subject, it's an especially worthwhile one if you are interested in refugees, us law, or figuring out whether you enjoy legal work and argumentation. It attracts a good crowd, both in numbers during shopping period and in the quality of people you'll have in seminar.",
    "If you're interested in legal thinking and\/or immigration\/refugee issues\/international relations\/conflict\/political process\/policy making, take it!! It will change your life.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in law, refugee issues, international relations, human rights or anything else related to the above. It is very rigorous but you learn a lot. It is the most \"qr-like\" social science course I have taken in that you really learn skills, not just a body of knowledge.",
    "Refugee Law is a fast-passed introduction to ref law. It is a challenging and difficult course that has a large workload but also pays off in the end. It allows you to really use your skills to engage with legal as well as policy issues surrounding refugee law. It allows you to be creative, to think critically, to work in groups, to tap into your own imagination and to really work through challenging ideas. You learn to make legal arguments and to understand both the foundations and the problems with refugee law.Professor Dufresne is the nicest and most capable person. She is an amazing teacher and she structures the course and workload such that you get the most out of the class. She is always available, very encouraging and helpful.Take this course. But you have to be interested and willing to put in the work. It will really be worth it, though in the end. You'll feel like you've grown from the work that you've done, from your classmates and from Professor Dufresne."
