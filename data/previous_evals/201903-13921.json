    "Poisson process, random incidents, queue in model, markov process, and various applications of the mathematical modeling techniques.",
    "How to frame many different compelx questions as simple operations problems",
    "This course has enabled me to develop a good and strong intution to tackling some real-life issues that can be resolved with some probability or statistical tools.",
    "For me this was mostly about understanding the intersection of theory and practice. How to do non-empirical work in an applied setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths include an engaging instructor and challenging but instructive problem sets. The course was also well organized as all readings, assignments, and materials were easily available on Canvas. Weaknesses include the course at times feeling to move from one application to another, meaning that more time could potentially have been spent on drawing the big picture.",
    "It does a great job of covering a number of bases in the policy modeling arena. It provides a great breadth of information. It could be better at showing how these principles could be combined together in complex problems and case studies. It would also help to have clearer grading. It remains unclear how much the problem sets, exam, and optional final were weighted and how final grades were decided. It remained unclear for the entire course how well you were doing and how you could examine what grade you were on track to get. It would also help to have the TA session earlier than the night before the problem set and to have more office hours.",
    "The greatest strength is Prof. Kaplan! He is such a thoughtful educator and did a great job leading the class. We cover a lot of material in this class. Some on the cutting edge of the field. The problem sets were challenging and engaging, and the midterm was a lot of fun. This is a rigorous course and the problem set makes the content easier to digest. One weakness about the class is the group assignment format. Since the background of the students were diverse, usually the homework was finished by some group members only. For example, in my group, I finished every assignment by myself. There is no difference than an individual assignment.",
    "This course has perfect pacing with how the topics are spread out in the semester and the timing of the assessment tasks. This course has so far been my favourite at Yale. Very intellectually stimulating and engaging.",
    "It has a wide variety of students taking the course. Perhaps more focus on work appropriate for each segment would have been nice although the professor did a very good job."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend to those interested in the application of probability models to various policy issues from health care to anti-terrorism and public housing. The instructor is engaging. Workload is relatively heavy.",
    "Yes I would if they are interested in learning and developing concepts for modeling. It must be stressed that you should have good quantitative skills or it will be very challenging to keep up despite its name.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! I would recommend this to anybody who is interested in solving quantitative models. I was exposed to a variety of problems and approaches to solve them. I learned that certain categories of problems are solved in their general form, while others require a more problem-specific approach. I also became familiar with certain concepts and techniques.",
    "Definitely",
    "Certain;y, Prof Kaplan is a superb teacher. Each class was revelatory, if not always technically challenging."
