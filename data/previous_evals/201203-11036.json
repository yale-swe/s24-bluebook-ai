    "At this point no, I think the course needs a lot of work",
    "Summary: Neurobiology is a broad course. You'll learn a lot about how single neurons work, and how human and select non-mammalian circuits of these cells work. Comfort with physical and mathematical concepts is necessary for the first third of the course, but the latter two thirds are just memorization. It's a solid introduction to neuroscience, but by no means complete.I would recommend neurobio to another student if only for the first third of the course.",
    "provides broad coverage of topics in neurobiology in more detail than an intro course. i would recommend this course to a student who has a solid background in science and would like some detailed understanding neuroscience. however, i might not recommend this course to a student who has already taken an introductory survey course and is interested in studying neurobio further. such a student could get much more detailed and focused knowledge in an advanced course devoted to thetopics he is really interested in.",
    "I good introductory neuroscience course. I would recommend it to students that I have not much experience in the field.",
    "Very helpful as far as learning fundamental electrophysiology, however I feel that the class attempted to cover too many concepts in the second half."

   "comments": [
    "The course mainly benefited me by presenting a wide variety of topics, including the fundamentals of neuronal signaling.",
    "As I have already taken a basic neuroscience course, it was simply a refresher course for me.",
    "I am doing electrophysiology, so the first portion of the course was extremely helpful for understanding things like voltage and current clamp. I feel like my ability to interpret research peripheral to my own research has improved.",
    "the course served as a refresher and added some details to what I had learned in previous courses. it provided background knowledge but did not directly contribute to my research.",
    "I was already famaliar with much of the material from my undergraduate education - it wasn't terribly useful in that regard. The 'experimental methods' Friday discussion were most helpful.",
    "Forced me toactually process and comprehend some very difficult physiology concepts that I had previously brushed over. Also introduced me to some helpful concepts regarding circuitry."
