    "I would say absolutely take this course but JD is leaving and he makes the class. Not to say that if it was taught by someone else that it would be bad, just not the same.",
    "This question is irrelevant, you can never take this class. But yes, I would recommend it. It's a class about production design, and you'll learn to look more carefully at the spaces of a film and understand how design choices happen and how they happened in the past. Take it if you care about understanding anything about how films are made, because design is a huge piece of that.",
    "With JD gone, this class will never be taught the same, if it is even taught at all. You're missing a great class with a fascinating topic and a huge amount of learning about something that isn't focused on in the theory-centered Yale film department."
