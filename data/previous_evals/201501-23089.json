    "Yes, I would recommend it to any cog sci\/psych major who wants to see what research is like.",
    "I highly recommend taking two semesters of PSYC 495 junior year to get started on your senior requirement.",
    "PSYC 495 is really whatever you make of it. I spent my time learning my way around a lab and starting to get a feel for what I want to do for my senior project. It's a pretty personalizable \"class\", but you get out of it what you put in.",
    "Gret if you have a lab that you want to work in!",
    "Yes, doglab is amazing and lots of fun. Basically a lot of examining dogs (with the excellent bonus that you get to pet lots of dogs) in interesting ways and finding out how dogs think. Great psychology and biology fun, while being a lot more hands-on than any class.",
    "I absolutely recommend that any psychology major or prospective major get involved in research. The ICC is a great way to get training in a more low-stress environment, but any research is great for majors.",
    "Do it if you have the time for the semester. The level of work depends on which lab you're a part of, but it's a great way to get empirical research done without having to worry about extra time commitments."
