   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For the SAS lab, a more detailed instruction lab handout is needed. There were many people, including myself at times, that had questions for the TA about what was needed to be completed for the write up. Most of these questions should not have to be asked of the TA; they should be in the handout. That being said, SAS material was well integrated into the lecture material.",
    "The lectures are clear and easy to understand. The handouts are helpful. I would like a little bit more assigned work to be able to better understand the material.I also like the labs, I feel that they are relevant to the course material.Would it be possible to change the class time to later in the day?",
    "It is a very tough class to take in a group of 100 people. Having no background in statistics I felt that we moved at too quick of a pace and I did not feel comfortable asking questions in class. Additionally, the TA office hours were always busy when I attended so was not able to get the personalized attention I needed. Splitting the class into more than one section depending on people's backgrounds would help with the pace\/class size issue, though I am not sure that is feasible.In general I strongly disliked the course, primarily because I found it difficult, uninteresting, and I do not want to pursue public health research in the future.",
    "The instructor is not very approachable after class. She emphasizes the TAs' office hours too much.",
    "Professor Klaus knows a lot about the material, and she's very friendly, responding to questions quickly. The way lectures are structured, however, makes it difficult to see the big picture of the course. It would be helpful if whenever a new topic was introduced, there was a step-by-step explanation of when and how to use the test\/equation.",
    "The classes were very dull, not well organized, and generally more confusing than helpful. Everything I learned in this class I learned on my own from the book (which is not a very good Stats book). I've taken two stats classes in the past, both of which I felt like I learned much more and left with a better grasp of the material. I don't feel as if I can take what I learned, or should have learned, in this class and apply it to any real life situation.The SAS section of this class wasn't well done, and again, I didn't learn hardly anything about how to actually use SAS and generally just copied what was shown on the power points. I would have appreciated more instruction on SAS.",
    "It bores me to death. Watching professor Claus write notes on a projector illegibly is not interesting. If we did more problems or examples in class, It'd be more beneficial.If professor Claus were more welcoming outside of the classroom, that would be nice too. It's almost impossible to ask her questions in office hours, and she's very intimidating.The TA's some were amazing (Julie and Debbie), so gave me poor\/lazy guidance (selina).",
    "The book is confusing, and difficult to follow with course lectures. If a new book could be used that would be very helpful.",
    "Course was good overall. Sometimes it was hard to follow what the professor was going through. The course would benefit from teaching SPSS, rather than just SAS. Majority of professors agree they have not used SAS in years, the program is complicated and SPSS is easier to understand.",
    "This course was a great introduction to biostatistics, however the pace of was a little slow. Professor Claus was a great lecturer.My only complaint would be the lab assignments. It was unclear throughout the semester what the expectations were for the lab write-ups. Also, the grading did not seem to be consistent from assignment. Each teaching assistant seemed to grade differently, as opposed to following a standard grading rubric.",
    "The course is great! I have gained skills that I will use for life.",
    "I am not sure that I understood this course. I do not feel like it focused on biostatistics but rather on SAS. I know that SAS is important but it was not really taught to us very well although it was the focus of the test. I can read a SAS printout somewhat well but I don't really know when I would use what statistics for a specific problem. I think I would have been really lost had I not taken a statistics course before.",
    "I think TAs should rate our assignment in a more interactive way.",
    "Strengths: Very good at explaining the how to use the equations, what tests to use in different circumstances. This class was practical and I think it will be useful in the future when discussing research studies\/ statistical analysis.Weakness: Though SAS lab was an addition, I didn't learn as much programming as I would like to. During class, when the professor is explaining the SAS outputs, it would be much better if an example was used and the actual program was running in class to show us the thought process of why a certain test was used in SAS.",
    "Could be improved by making sure the lab material is covered before anyone has a lab so that labs earlier in the week have the same advantages as those later in the week. Further, it would be good to standardize what the TAs tell the students in lab about what is expected of them.",
    "Great teacher; technology upgrades would be wonderful. Dr. Claus still uses transparencies, so notes in class and online are pretty impossible to read. Something more structured--like powerpoint-- would make it easier to follow during class and to study for exams.Also, more problems to practice for exams... the questions were very different from homework, so it was difficult to feel properly prepared",
    "This was a very good intro stats course. I felt that I received the knowledge necessary to perform basic statistical tests and understand the work that I was doing. The lectures were a bit scattered at times, but it was a very good overview of the material in a fairly straightforward method of teaching.",
    "I would like to have seen this course push a little harder on our actual understanding of the concept. I think allowing a notes sheet on the exam rather than all of our notes might have been better to push our understanding. Also, I would have liked to have more practice problems as back-up in case a certain concept was unclear.",
    "Great professor, great class.",
    "Previously taking stats before and hating it, I came out of the course with a much more stable knowledge of the course and ended up enjoying the class.",
    "Lecture was concise and great for those of us who have no stats background.",
    "The course does a good job of connecting the lecture material to the lab material. I like how interconnected SAS was with the methodology taught in lecture. The course could have been a little more organized in terms of the lecture, but besides that I think it was great!",
    "Clear, fair introduction to biostats. Could be improved with more clarity in hw\/lab grading.",
    "Transparencies sometimes hard to read when uploaded to classes v2",
    "I think this is a good class, my only objection is the organization. It was quite helpful structurally to see the flowcharts, but we only saw those towards the end of the class...I think it would have been great to have those from the beginning, to get a better understanding of the overall main concepts.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot; I think it is necessary for our understanding of epidemiology and public health. I think that the course was mainly an issue for those without a strong stats background. It also seemed that people were confused by the flow\/outline of the course material. Perhaps it could be organized a little better.",
    "homework is not representative of the tests.Tests are easy but questions may be confusing",
    "The course covered the basics of biostats and incorporated SAS well. At times, however, I would have liked a little more depth and real world examples of application.",
    "The course was useful.",
    "Great course overall-Could be improved by more clear SAS instruction and could use another teaching tool besides the projector",
    "The course was great- it was taught very well. The main strengths were the lectures. The main weaknesss was the SAS lab. I feel that SAS was not taught in a manner where students could have enough practice to apply what was learned in class.",
    "It's very early in the morning, which is difficult because it's such a complex subject, and many of us are simply not able to handle math that early! Or we're just not morning people.Aside from that the instruction is a little all over the place, I wish it was a bit more linear as far as the tests, processes, what we're suppose to know, etc. It was a lot of information to sort through. I'm glad there are no powerpoints, as I hate powerpoints, but better in-class notes might be helpful, and putting things into overarching categories, like 'SAS code' or 'Biostats tests'",
    "This class is great! The class is well taught with the instructor catering to both visual and auditory learners. I typically don't learn much material during lecture, but the way the class was taught definitely improved the way I learned the material.The weekly lab sections help with SAS understanding, although I wish the session were more than 1 hour per week.The teaching assistants, however, should be more knowledgeable of the material. Perhaps if they were given an answer key to the homework questions they can better help the students with the homework sets. I found only two of the four teaching assistants helpful, while the other two incompetent.",
    "Overall, I liked this course. It was good in that it gave a broad overview of what biostatistics is and what can be learned in this field. However, I felt that each statistical test\/method was covered too briefly. I learned enough to understand the concepts, but maybe not enough to apply it. I did like the integration of the tests that we have learned into realistic scenarios. I would recommend this class to other students in the program.",
    "The course was a good introduction to biostatistics. I appreciated that the approach was to teach basic stats in a way that was relevant to public health. The material wasn't too technical and was of a level appropriate to what MPH students need. I would have appreciated a few more practice questions (not textbook questions)to prepare for the exams.",
    "The course is good. Its an introductory course and large lecture so it was as expected. It served its purposed well.",
    "Given that this is a required course, I thought it was taught and structured pretty well since members of the class have all different backgrounds. The TAs were very accessible outside of class, which was helpful. One improvement would be to do what we did in Epidemiology I on exams days since there is not enough room for everyone to take it in Winslow- take 2 or 3 TA sections and have them administer it in classrooms. Everyone else can take it in Winslow.",
    "class material taught by instructor was very straightforward, easy to understand.",
    "I took a statistics course as an undergraduate but I'm very glad that I decided to take the biostatistics course since there was a greater emphasis in how it applied to health-related aspects. However, the material seems disorganized and made it harder to learn. As a result, it took more time trying to piece everything together to make sense of it and how it connected to everything else than if it was organized and structured. Perhaps, provide a brief diagram of what will be covered in the course during the first class and continue to bring in the diagram to show what is being taught and how it fits in with everything else.",
    "This is my first time taking statistics, and I thought the course was very well taught. Dr. Claus is an excellent instructor and I appreciate her writing everything on the overhead. The pace of the course and the workload are very reasonable and Dr. Claus presents the materials in a very organized and coherent manner. Her exams are also very fair. To name a few weaknesses, I thought that the text book could have been better and sometimes the TAs were not able to answer some questions during TA office hours. However, my TA, Debbie Chin, for SAS lab was outstanding, and I fully recommend her for next year!",
    "The course provided a comprehensive introduction to biostatistics; however, the material was not well organized until the midterm and then subsequently at the end of the semester, when everything was summarized, and the relationships between concepts were made clear.",
    "The PowerPoints that accompany the weekly lab assignments are very helpful.",
    "awesome professor; awesome class!",
    "this is a decent stat class, but it does not have a particularly engaging teaching style--and class notes could be much more legible. the professor is clearly very knowledgeable and understands her students, so that is a plus.",
    "Good course set-up, but I would have preferred powerpoints",
    "I felt the course struggled to strike the right balance between rigorously teaching the principles underlying statistical methods and simplifying the methods for those students who lacked a mathematical background. The result was that it was often hard to relate the textbook to the lecture material. This was not helped by the use of an overhead light projector for the lectures. This method constantly led to notes disappearing off the top of the screen. I am happy to take notes during lectures - in fact it arguably helps concentration to do so - but I was disappointed to then have to trawl laboriously though handwritten pdf files afterwards to reconstruct missing lines. A textbook that pitched stats at a level nearer that of the lectures might have bridged the gap.There were times when homework clashed with major assessments on other courses (HP510 Policy in particular), and this led to problems when topics appearing in the stats homework were not covered in class until very shortly before the homework was due.The marking of homework and labs was disappointingly inconsistent. Other classes this semester did not grade the homework, but instead gave credit for completing it, provided helpful comments on the homework handed in, and passed out correct answers afterwards. This method means that students get lots of feedback, and homework mistakes become part of the learning process. I would recommend this approach be considered for biostats.",
    "Strengths - it teaches statisticsWeaknesses - everything about the SAS lab. I learned more SAS using it to do non-lab problem sets, and lab just created an extra hour in which I would learn nothing, but yet have to do some busy work.",
    "Strengths: Solid intro to biostatistics; well-organized.Weaknesses: disconnect between SAS lab and rest of the course; lacks real-life scenarios or updated data.",
    "Having homework due periodically helped keep me up to date on the current information and not fall behind before the tests.The handouts in class were very helpful to understand the SAS information.",
    "there should be more interaction between students and the professor.",
    "Set standards\/rubric\/ something for the TAs when they grade labs and homework. It was too much of a toss-up as to what they were looking for.",
    "I think for a first course, the combo of stats and SAS was probably right on for most students, but I would have hoped the SAS labs were less plug and go...I know I learned a bit, but didn't think the labs challenged students enough on cleaning, formatting, manipulation (analysis) and presentation of data.",
    "The course is a good introduction\/review of statistics.",
    "The lab is really helpful. A longer lab session would be better.",
    "Good amount of work load and everything was pretty straight forward.",
    "more lab instruction during lectures",
    "Classes are of very poor quality. I did have difficulties to get the big picture of what we are doing and why based on the lectures. The class was not of help. I learned primarily by myself. I was very much looking forward to this class and am very disappointed!",
    "Strenghts- Clear learning objectives, great TA'sWeakness- Class notes could be more organized, more organized folders for resources in the ClassesV2 website (everything was all over the place).",
    "Very good",
    "SAS could be taught better.",
    "I thought that the class was much more thoroughly taught and interesting than I expected as a person who doesn't really like math.",
    "The class itself and the lab were both excellent. However, the grading of homeworks amongst TAs were inconsistent, which caused some undue stress.",
    "- I think the labs can be improved to require more structured practise time with the program. I felt like I was always taught and worked towards the demands of the homework assignment rather than exploring what SAS as a program had to offer. Therefore I still feel very inadequate with SAS, even after a semester of labs.- Dr. Claus did a good job of summing up what we had learned before each exam (statistical formulas and their applications using tree diagrams etc.)- I would advise that in coming years, the same summary should be discussed at the beginning (and revisited when starting a new topic) so as to direct the students in their learning process.",
    "strengths: Prof. Claus was very easy to understand, able to convey the material wellweaknesses: biostats lab was confusing and difficult, different standards for each lab section (not fair)"

Additionally, she often jumped around on examples\/topics when taking notes, which in turn made my notes messier and less continuous. Because of these two issues, it might be more helpful if the notes are typed\/printed ahead of time and students can just take whatever extra notes they might need in addition to what the professor has chosen to write down (this is how we do it in Epi). It also prevents the student from having to scribble furiously to make sure he\/she gets everything down.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Overall, Dr. Claus is very pleasant, approachable, and it i obvious that she genuinely enjoys teaching.However, there are glaring weaknesses in the lab portion of the class. Specifically, the expectations for each lab are very vague which lead to a great deal of confusion about what is\/isnt expected for the write-ups. I would recommend that the assignment sheet is edited for clarity. IE: \"The following must be included in the writeup:\"Hopefully, based on overwhelming mistakes in grading on the last assignment is indication enough that there are inconsistencies in expectations between TA's based on interpretation of the assignment questions.Also, it needs to be mentioned to TA's and the class that data sets in the book are not the same as data sets on the CD. For example, I used data sets from the CD and was marked wrong for nearly all of my homework 4 problems because the answers used by TA's were based on the problem set in the back of the book (and not the CD).",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was good at explaining the concepts, especially through repetition of the important points. She was also very response to students' questions. However, as previously mentioned, the material seemed somewhat unorganized and made it harder to piece the material together. Since her handwriting was hard to read, students had to pay careful attention to what she said in order to take notes, which may or may not be a weakness.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Please see answer to question 6.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The expectations for lab write-ups were very unclear, and it would help to know when paragraphs were expected versus just answers to specific questions. I strongly recommend rewriting lab write-up instructions for future semesters.It was very difficult to read her handwriting, even when following along in class.It was apparent that she was very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0awesome professor; so insightful&so good at communicating materials to the class",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0the professor is clearly very knowledgeable and understands her students, so that is a plus.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good instructor, clearly passionate about the subject. I would have appreciated more examples of real-life problems in class to make it more interesting",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0See answer to question 6. When an instructor is simplifying complex material the class needs a definitive version of the acceptable simplifications. The textbook used didn't provide this, and the handwritten lecture note slides available after the lectures were far too unwieldy to be useful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a wonderful instructor who can take a difficult concept and make i manageable. Her tone throughout the course was always positive and upbeat, without seeming contrived. I wish she would have spoken more about her work.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very friendly, very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is very knowledgable about biostatistics, but sometimes trying to follow her notes online was difficult. She was always willing to help if I came to her, and I thought overall she was a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0she should pay attention to our response in class, not just stick with her thinking",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor was obviously well informed on the subject; however, this led her lectures into tangents at times, which made them hard to follow.Otherwise, great woman; love her personality.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I think Dr. Claus is great and her lectures were really clear and helpful (I don't know how someone could follow along with the course without attending class). Sometimes she seemed a bit curt when asked questions during class, and some more real examples (like some of the breast cancer studies she used later in the course), would have been helpful within each lecture and concept.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus explains this well and is very articulate. I really love her deadpan humor. However, I wish the course was slightly more organized in terms of handouts and lecture notes so that we have better resources to study from.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is hilarious! Great personality and great instructor once you learn her style. Note-taking is ESSENTIAL",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0excellent teaching method!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very nice professor, but not a good teacher. The lectures were not helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Great teaching skills. Clear objectives. Fair exams.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Great professor",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus is very thoughtful as a teacher and pleasant to work with- her lectures were as enjoyable as could be expected, and she was always very nice if approached with questions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought Dr Claus was great. She was good in lecture considering how early the classes were and was reachable as much as her busy schedule allows. Homework and exam difficulties were fair.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good teaching skills.Very patient while dealing with students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus did a good job - I think I learnt enough.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Prof. Claus was very easy to understand, able to convey the material well. Her handwriting is difficult to read sometimes though."

   "comments": [
    "Debbie Chin was an excellent, adept TA who knew the material well. The biostats labs were fun and I understood SAS much better because of her.",
    "There was a discrepancy between the TAs (that I interacted with) in that some were excellent and more willing to go beyond what would be expected of them compared to other TAs. Or maybe it was that some TAs did not fully fulfill my expectations of their duties.",
    "Julie was great - clear explanations, helpful when needed, a very sweet person.",
    "Julie, my TA, is awesome!",
    "Selina was a great TA for SAS lab. She let us take things at our own pace, but she always answered questions right away when we got stuck.",
    "My assigned TA was Julie.Wonderful! Always answered my questions, and showed me where to find information in the book and showed me where I could get extra practice. She never got frustrated with SAS! Very good, positive attitude!",
    "My TA (Whitney), was not prepared for class. She was not encouraging or helpful. While other TAs walked through steps in SAS, she did not and often let us struggle through it alone.She came unprepared to class and often answered questions wrong. She also treated her two sections very differently, and after speaking with classmates in her other section found out that we were not given the same one-on-one help that they did.I would not recommend her to teach this course next semester.",
    "The TAs did their best but IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT and way below expectation. Answers such as \"well you just know\" and \"just enter this\" are not helpful when trying to understand a complicated program like SAS. Grading amongst the TAs for labs was inconsistent, unfair, and \"based on their own flexibility\". I found it unbelievable that a consistent grading requirements could not be conveyed to the TAs and then to the students. If you want to do well on the labs you have to email the TA prior to handing in the HW to ask for their specific requirements and what they are looking for. TAs ARE helpful, I donot blame them as much as I blame the selection process, and a basic miscommunication between professor, TAs and students. This is a simple program that can be avoided.",
    "As stated earlier, the grading done by the TAs was not consistent. There should have been a formal grading rubric. Each grader seemed to emphasize and place more importance on different things. (i.e. formatting, writing, language, etc.)The TA who ran my particular lab section was really knowledgeable. I do not have any weaknesses to report about her section.",
    "Debbie Chin was a great TA. She was very helpful in my understanding of SAS and problem-solving.",
    "I did not learn from going to lab. For the most part, I just copied code from the presentation and then changed it for my problem. I really don't understand how to write code on my own. The TAs were often unhelpful for homework help if they were not the ones grading it which made the one who was grading it very busy during office hours. It was hard to get help on homeworks for this reason.",
    "TA should be more willing to talk to us.",
    "Debbie was wonderful. She guided us through all the lab assignments and asked us questions about how we can use SASto answer the questions. She explained concepts well and do not diverge off topic.",
    "Debbie Chin- excellent in answering question sand providing help outside the classroom. incrediably responsive.",
    "There was little communication from the TAs, and this led to considerable confusion in the student body. There were discrepancies in understanding of the material as well as what was expected of us on assignments. These issues could have probably been alleviated if there was more communication between them, as well as with the professor.",
    "Whitney was a great SAS teacher.",
    "Debbie Chin was very articulate and patient in teaching SAS. She was an excellent TA.",
    "Julie Kunrath is hands down one of the best TA's I have ever had. She was consistently prepared, had mastery of all material, and presented new information in a way that was clear to a beginner audience. Furthermore, I really appreciated the fact that she wouldn't just give me the answer when I had a question, but rather guided me to figure it out myself using past examples. Finally, she is just so darn nice!",
    "My TA, Julie Kunrath, was absolutely incredible. She was very good at explaining things as well as answering questions for us while we were working on the labs. She was so patient and did a great job of relating to us. It is obvious that she really understands the material and isn't simply regurgitating what is on the powerpoints. Julie is the best! I will move my schedule around for next semester just so she can be my TA.",
    "Debbie-- did an exceptional job. She was knowledgable and helpful.",
    "Debbie was a wonderful TA. She was helpful in and out of lab and was very quick to respond to questions or point me toward another TA\/instructor if she did not know the answer",
    "Julie Kunrath - sooooo great! Always very helpful, and explained things really, really well. Awesome job, Julie!",
    "I loved Debby Chin! She made the SAS lab enjoyable and clarified all issues I had with programming and the course as a whole. She really did a fantastic job.",
    "I like my TA Julie Kunrath!She's considerate and nice.The instructions from her are very helpful!",
    "very helpful, always availabe - Debbie",
    "Whitney, I felt, was not that great of a TA. She rushed through the lab slides and then became frustrated easily with questions. Additionally, there seemed to be a lot of discrepancies between what she said was required from each lab and what was actually required. This was probably my biggest complaint with the class (and it wasn't just Whitney) the TAs throughout the entire semester never seemed to be on the same page, one would say one thing and another would tell you something else. That being said, Julie was an awesome TA and after switching to her lab things improved greatly.",
    "my TA debbie chin was very nice.",
    "Julie Kunrath is fantastic. Knowledgeable, sweet and encouraging. She seems solidly vested in the success of her students.",
    "I had good and bad experiences with TAs in this course. Some were very helpful and knowledgeable. I regularly attended Juli's office hours, and she was extremely helpful. Other TAs seemed less knowledgeable and often gave confusing\/conflicting instructions.",
    "My TA was Julie. She was one of the best TAs I have ever met. She always did her best to understand and help first-year students with respect to using SAS, and it was very helpful. I am grateful for that.",
    "Julie Kunrath was a WONDERFUL TA!!!",
    "The TA was a helpful resource- Whitney Hubbard provided assistance when it was solicited.",
    "I'm not sure how the TAs are chosen, I hope they are NOT chosen purely because of the grade they receive in the course, but a few of them don't seem to understand the material, and a few of them certainly don't know how to explain things or teach, don't respond to their emails, and seem indifferent to whether we pass or fail or even understand what's going on. I was lucky and had Debbie, and I feel that my grade will reflect that I had a fabulous TA who explained biostats, explained SAS, and I have a great understanding and have learned a lot from this class from her, but I feel that the grade in the course was largely determined by what TA you had, and how much they did (or didn't) tell you. Teaching requires a certain amount of training, compassion, and ability to explain things. Please choose the TAs more wisely for the next class, and I feel that if a TA is performing this badly, they should be removed.",
    "Debbie and Julie are the greatest! They are the two most knowledgeable TAs and go out of their way to help students.I wasn't able to make office hours and Julie and Debbie were always willing to meet me outside of their office hours to help me understand the material. In addition, they were always prompt about answering emails.",
    "My TA for SAS lab was Selina. She was a little quick in her lessons of the SAS lab for the day, but she was very helpful in answering questions.",
    "Debbie Chin was an excellent TA. She was helpful both in labs and in office hours.",
    "Whitney Hubbard was my TA. She did an okay job at explaining SAS but seemed a bit frustrated with us and hesitant to help and answer questions. I wouldn't want her as my TA again.",
    "Julie was a PHENOMENAL TA. She was excellent in describing the lab assignment each week and reviewing the powerpoints before the lab sessions. She also was open to questions via email if we were unable to attend her TA hours.One thing that all the TAs in general could improve is to have more consistent grading styles, which basically means determining what exactly is required by each lab assignment and telling all lab sessions the exact same thing. Sometimes it seemed like one TA said \"yes, have summary paragrahs for this week's lab\" while others said \"no, just answer the questions\" which lead to inconsistencies in grading homework.",
    "Very good. being more specific about what lab hw should look like would help...",
    "the TAs were so nice and helpful. especially Julie.",
    "Selena was my TA for the SAS lab. For the most part, I felt like she was trying to rush through the material (Power Point slides) and did not go through the material thoroughly or try to give us other pointers. I also felt as if she didn't want to be there. I attended Julie's lab and had her sub one of the labs and liked her style much more.",
    "Please see answer to question 6.",
    "Selena was an okay TA. She answered questions somewhat dismissively.Julie was phenomenal! She took the time with individual students who needed help on SAS. Very knowledgeable.",
    "Debbie Chin--great TA, very helpful in lab; always willing to answer questions. very clear in her explanations.",
    "Julie was excellent, she was very approachable and knowledgeable.",
    "Please see my answer to Q6. The TA role would be much more positive if the principle goal of homework was to provide feedback and learning to students.",
    "Selina seemed competent in her own skills, but had trouble explaining things to us. Julie substituted one time, and seemed absolutely awesome.",
    "Whitney was reliable and fair.",
    "Our TA would have benefitted from feeling a bit more comfortable with the SAS material and teaching SAS material. Still, very friendly.",
    "Debbie was my TA. Debbie was a wonderful help in SAS lab and always willing to offer assistance via email or during office hours. She was well spoken while explaining the concepts and made SAS lab semi-enjoyable.",
    "the TA for lab is very responsible.",
    "My TA was pretty unhelpful during SAS lab. Aside from reading directly off the powerpoint, she was very hands off.",
    "Julie was my TA, and wonderful. She was very helpful and great a walking the lab through the SAS info. This isn't directed at Julie, but rather the overall coordination of TAs\/Homework assignments\/grading - there seems to have been miscommunication on what was expected lab to lab, and there were numerous emails that could have been avoided had the TAs and Dr. Claus discussed each homework assignment and lab prior and come with one consistent statement to students.",
    "Selina- very helpful in lab but not very helpful with guidance for assignments",
    "Debbie is awesome!",
    "Debbie was fantastic!!!Great teacher, very patient and dedicated.",
    "Great TA's",
    "The TA (Whitney) could have explained thinks better but overall she did her job.",
    "My TA was good in explaining statistical concepts and SAS programming. The problems seems to be what is acceptable to one TA might not be acceptable to another, causing homework grades to be disparate. Better communication before each grading session might be necessary.",
    "My TA was Debbie Chin-Very supportive and intelligent.Extremely patient with all the students.Made the learning environment conducive for learning",
    "Julie was very friendly and very helpful - overall, I think she was a good TA!",
    "Whitney was very sporadic. Some weeks she was great, other weeks she wasn't. In addition, she could be difficult to talk to\/not the most helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course because it is a basis for succeeding in the public health arena.",
    "I would recommend it for people who have an interest in conducting their own research or like math\/statistics. I myself absolutely would not haven taken this course except that it is a requirement.",
    "It is mandatory. I would not recommend it if that were not the case.",
    "I personally got more out of my undergraduate statistics class, but I needed a refresher, so it was useful in that sense. If you are well-versed in statistics already, I would avoid taking it. The introduction to SAS was the most valuable part of the course.",
    "No. I would suggest taking another Stats class. It wasn't hard to get a good grade in this class, however, I don't feel as if I learned as much as I should have.",
    "I would say, don't waste your time going to lecture. Use that time to understand SAS or do the homework instead.I would recommend it b\/c stats are vital to an understanding of public health.",
    "It was a difficult class for me bc I have not taken math in years. I dont know how much I will be using these skills in the future, and find it somewhat irrelevant for my future career. I would recommend it to someone going into a research field, but not someone who is here for a career that does not rely on calculating biostatistics (but we all have to take it so I guess it is irrelevant).",
    "No. Changes need to be made to the structure of this course. Tests are based on how well you take notes, rather than comprehension of the material. Granted, it makes test taking easier and less stressful. Students from our class who had taken a statistics class in undergraduate, who did well, find this class incredibly difficult to comprehend, despite the material being exactly the same.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. The material covered in this course is essential for public health. I would encourage those students with statistical backgrounds to take the course. Although most of the material covered in the course was not new material to me, I enjoyed the review and the opportunity to strengthen my foundation of biostatistics.",
    "The class is great and I would recommend it to any student. The real-life application of the the class are phenomenal.",
    "It's required so you have no choice. If you have a statistics background, it's not so bad. I didn't learn enough SAS to actually use it on my own. Fortunately, a second year told me that no one learns SAS from this course. I feel like this class was just confusing.",
    "I withdraw this class, not because it is bad but I had it in college.",
    "Yes. It is a core in research methodology. When I read research papers and look at their methods section, I have a basic knowledge of what kind of statistical analysis they used and what kind of test it was",
    "helped to better understand the basics of biostats but is not intended for the mastery of SAS.",
    "Yes, good class for basic biostats",
    "This was a great introductory course, and I felt that I learned a lot from the material that we talked about. It was really well paced even with the amount of material that we covered. I would recommend this class as a basic foundation for everything else you will learn at the School of Public Health.",
    "Nice background of BioStats",
    "This course was a basic introduction to statistics. If you have any previous experience with statistics, I would recommend opting out and reviewing the material on your own.",
    "Great course, learned alot.",
    "This is a great Stats class. Take it!",
    "Summary: You will understand biostatistics and SAS after this course. Do not be intimidated if you are rusty with math, Dr. Claus breaks it down for you so that topics build on each other in a logical way.",
    "I think the course is necessary for most applications of epidemiology and public health.",
    "No choice really, but the class is not bad at all. Could be challenging for someone w\/o stats experience, but otherwise is a nice review of basic concepts and applications to health research.",
    "Great introduction to Biostatistics for someone who as never taken a statistics course before",
    "It's hard to say whether I would recommend this class, seeing as it is required. However, I'd say it is a solid intro to statistics, and be ready to do lots of programming in SAS.",
    "I think the course should be required by everyone except those who have a strong stats background. Although I had taken stats before, having SAS lab and going over material again definitely helped solidify my understanding of biostatistics.",
    "So, so!",
    "Yes. Biostatistics is very basic and useful. The course will give you a sense of statistics that support public health researches you will encounter later.",
    "It's required.",
    "This course is a good introduction to bio statistics and finding a teaching assistant who you work well with and can go to with questions is invaluable.",
    "Good. I would recommend to take the course.",
    "Good overview of biostats and great intro to SAS",
    "The Biostatistics course teaches one the basics of biostatistics such as desciptive statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation) and hypothesis testing and linear regression. There is also a lab component that teaches students how to program to analyze statistical data.",
    "It's required to take, so everyone just needs to get through it. I would say really take the time to understand SAS, because SAS is a huge part of the class. Start the homework ahead of time so you can go to office hours before it's due.",
    "I would recommend this course for a fellow student. It is a good oveview of statistical methods that in my opinion are necessary to know in the public health program in order to read, understand, and conduct scientific research. Even though it is a brief overview, it is important and I think Dr. Claus teaches it well.",
    "The course is a good introduction to statistics. While I don't feel like I know SAS, it was a good introduction and will hopefully serve as a great base for Data Management. Its difficult to sit through on occasion, but its necessary for the work we will be doing.",
    "It is a course that should absolutely be required for the MPH degree. Although it does not cover the more interesting material, I would recommend it because it improves your ability to read scientific articles that discuss study findings using biostats lingo (confidence intervals, p-values, etc).",
    "This course is not challenging if you have had a previous biostatistics class. The most challenging and time consuming components were getting familiar with and learning SAS.",
    "easy to understand, straightforward biostats class. I would recommend to anyone.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, even if they have taken a statistics course previously. It gives students a better understanding of how it relates to health-related research and ties closely with Intro to Epidemiology. I also feel that it is important to learn SAS and this course provides an introduction to the program.",
    "It's an essential course for an MPH student, and Dr. Claus is an excellent instructor!",
    "It is an overview of basic statistics and computer programming on SAS.I would recommend it to students who will need basic stats knowledge.",
    "this is a decent stat class, but it does not have a particularly engaging teaching style--and class notes could be much more legible. the professor is clearly very knowledgeable and understands her students, so that is a plus.",
    "Better taught than most statistics courses at Yale, but I would only take it if it is required.",
    "This course could be a lot better with a slight change of approach.",
    "You must take this class, so it's not necessarily worth reviewing, but it will be one of those classes that isn't super hard, but that you just have to slog through.",
    "The course provides a solid introduction to biostatistics. I would recommend it because the material is essential for public health.",
    "Useful and applicable skills are offered from this class. I'm glad I took it.",
    "I would recommend finding a TA who truly understands the concepts because the labs are near impossible if the TA doesn't know what she\/he is talking about. I would also say it's more important to have good equation sheets and learn the application of biostatistics to specific situations than to memorize anything.",
    "I would recommended the course as it sets the stats foundation for epidemiologist. however, given the current teaching style, i's say mostly students would rely on self-study.",
    "Intro statistics, but somehow harder.",
    "Basic stats course, I think it is necessary for any individual that needs to do research or interpret research and my opinion doesn't matter because the class is required. For those that were able to ask out based on previous studies, I do think the school should require participation in the SAS lab, and SAS lab HW assignments.",
    "It's required.",
    "attend class and pay attention to lab sessions",
    "I would not recommend it at all. The classes were useless. You should rather sit at home and study by yourself instead of wasting time to go to the class.",
    "Great course instructor",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "This is a required course and very integral to everyone in public health. The statistical part is not too hardbut there is a lot of programming. So, whenever you can, work in groups, find someone who is quick to learn, use you TAs and professor.",
    "Yes i would recommend this course to fellow student.",
    "Well, it is a requirement! Having said that, it is a good course, a little improvements in the lab design will make it an even better course.",
    "the class and its assignments are pretty straightforward."
