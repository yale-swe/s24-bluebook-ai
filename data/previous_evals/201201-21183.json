   "comments": [
    "Loved this class. You WILL learn A LOT, but you will NOT have all your questions about the New Testament answered. This class could be challenging to Christians because it scrutinizes your holy book (Sonja, who'll be teaching next year, and Dale are both Christians, though). But I found that I grew in my faith because of this class. This class would even be interesting for non-Christians since it deals with one of the most written-about documents in history.",
    "The course introduces the New Testament and also various cultural and historical interpretations of the material. If you are interested in a plain Jane introduction to the text, this is not the class for you. It expects that you read the material and then interpret it and challenge it and engage with it. The most interesting parts of the course involve the different cultural interpretations of the material rather than the presentation of the material itself.",
    "This is a great introduction to the New Testament and to the type of thinking done in the fields of history and religious studies. Both people who read the NT as scripture and those who don't (but are interested) should take this class!!",
    "RLST 150 is an engaging course with a very manageable work load. The lectures are interesting to attend and the professors keep the material going at a fast pace. The paper topics could use more guidance as they somewhat assume more background than an intro religious studies student would have - especially in exegesis. However, overall it was a very good course.",
    "I think this course will be better the next time it's taught since this was the first semester with a new format. More confusing than I anticipated if you don't do all the readings. Overall it's an interesting topic but I never got that into it.",
    "I was taking it cr\/d and did not do much reading, but in general I did not like the class, and would not recommend it. It is not my area of interest really, and I was expecting more discussion of the bible's current influence on modern culture, but it was mostly historically based.",
    "I thought this course had potential. In the end, I really really disliked it. I'm not sure if it was because I felt lost most of the time due to my complete lack of a religious background, or because I was taking it credit\/d and didn't read anything (which is completely doable--super easy class taken cred\/d). I found Professor Martin fairly pompous and obnoxious, which also turned me off to his lectures. I did, however, gain some understanding of the bible and how it has been interpreted over time. If you do have preexisting familiarity with the New Testament, it could be quite interesting and rewarding. Overall, though, eh.",
    "TAKE IT RIGHT NOW. Dale and Matt are amazing and put together a comprehensive view on the NT that you can't possibly imagine.",
    "Take it if you are prepared to write a lot. If a christian, be prepared to meet material that challenges your faith. You might want to talk to someone to guide you through the semester.",
    "take it, it's a great background for understanding what the new testament is all about",
    "RLST 150 is a fantastic course. It will teach you A LOT about the New Testament, and its historical and cultural aspects from early times to our modern world. It's a lot of reading, a lot of writing, but it's definitely worth it. The course will challenge many of your pre-conceived ideas of Jesus and Christianity, but, as a religious person, I never felt that it threatened or shook any of my religious beliefs.",
    "Great, great class! The only thing is, I think a lot of what was great about it was the balance between Dale Martin and Matt Croasmun's lecturing styles and emphases. I heard Matt's not teaching it next year, so I don't know if it'll be as good. There was some really amazing stuff in this class. There were definitely some things I learned that challenged my faith, but it was actually a great environment for it because of the balance between all the things we learned in the class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend RLST 150 to a fellow student.",
    "Definitely an interesting class. I took it to take an academic approach to religion after having been brought up learning religion solely from a theological point of view in church.",
    "Absolutely take it! It's a fantastic religious studies course, whether or not you're Christian or not. It will introduce you to a lot of Religious Studies thought.",
    "This was my favorite class that I've taken at Yale. Love love loved it. Completely fascinating. I'd never read any of the New Testament before as I am not Christian, and I loved that we read the scripture as a historical document. I also really enjoyed the weeks we spent looking at contemporary cultural issues and whether the Bible was pro- or anti- things-- and how it could be used as both. The only flaw I saw with the class was that there was a bit too much reading to keep up with!",
    "Great course. Really fun and interesting. Be prepared to get a new perspective on the new testament than you're probably used to. But it's really col and interesting to hear it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. It is not very difficult (don't be turned away by Dale's speech on grades at the beginning of the semester--everything was graded very easily), and you learn a ton.",
    "You read all of the new Testament and a lot of commentary. It's really hard, a lot of reading, and the grading is up to high standards. But it's very interesting!",
    "The New Testament in History and Culture is a fantastic course. Dale Martin and Matt Croasmun are both fabulous professors who, though they approach the subject from somewhat different points of view, are together one of the most brilliant teaching pairs I've had in 4 years at Yale. Both are great lecturers and very personally engaging teachers. The course's sweep is extraordinarily comprehensive - - you learn not just about the methodologies of biblical criticism and study but also about the actual practices of Christian communities. The treatment of the subject is even-handed--Dale Martin and Matt Croasmun, while they don't comprise all viewpoints of Christianity between them, are able to offer their own distinct and nuanced stances and summaries of other stances. I would definitely recommend this course, for students of all or no religious backgrounds interested in learning more. As a Christian student with over 13 years of religious schooling, I learned a ton and was challenged (positively) a lot in this course. There is substantial reading, but it's all very interesting and the work required in the course is similarly intellectually stimulating (and it's not too much). I cannot recommend this course any more highly--take it!",
    "I really would recommend this course to another student. The course covers the origins of Christianity as well as how the religion is practiced around the world. It is a great exposure to Religious Studies as it is taught by one of the department's best and most dynamic professors, Dale Martin. The class is fast-paced and challenging; a lot is expected of students. But it is worth the effort. I learned something wild and new each lecture.",
    "don't take this if you're just interested in the material because the grading is hard even though its an intro class; good for cr\/d",
    "I absolutely would not recommend. The course was disorganized and unfocused. Dale Martin is a terrible instructor",
    "This class is great. It's easy to fall behind in reading (because there's a lot), but there are very few papers and all the topics are interesting. I would definitely take this class, because no matter your background, the content will surpise you.",
    "RLST150 is on Open Yale as a survey of the books of the New Testament. This year, they condensed that survey into half the semester: we covered the books themselves and did fun synthesis topics as we went along (mystery and magic, sin and evil). Then, we spent the rest of the semester talking about later interpretation and how the text has been\/can be used in issues of modern relevance. (What the New Testament says about money& capitalism, sex& family, and nationalism& empire.)You will learn a lot, but they try to cover so much that you may not leave with an organized body of knowledge like you might with other classes. Definitely not a gut-- they expect you to write your papers with good style, turn in small assignments each section to prove you've thought about the reading, and attend every single lecture (attendance is taken).Overall, a great course.",
    "I loved this class. It teaches you about interpretations of the New Testament, which is much more interesting than simply studying the text itself. Furthermore, it has great paper prompts (although the final paper prompt was not the greatest).I would definitely recommend it!However, I think it needs clearer powerpoints and more help in distinguishing the different literary theories that one can employ.",
    "This was an interesting but odd class, taught by two people who - in VERY different ways - professed to be Christian. One of them (the famous professor of the NT and Historical Jesus classes, involved with Christ Presbyterian Church) says that Christianity absolutely makes no sense, that he can split his brain in half, and cusses at students, and he presents a one-sided THE BIBLE IS NOT TRUE argument. The other (a grad student, young pastor at the fairly new Elm City Vineyard Church) does a better job of straddling the line between academic who says that the Bible has all kinds of flaws but there are x-y-z ways to read it and the Christian who trusts it but wants to figure out what it means. Their class motto was \"doubt everything,\" including everything they said, which in theory was good and fair but when they presented only similar facets of the same view, you never really got a possible alternative to believe.The syllabus is very clear about what the topics and the class format are (various themes, three pretty short papers, the last of which requires you to synthesize knowledge gained in the course), and the work isn't hard. But when Dale seems more interested in getting you to take his point of view on matters [not because he thinks it's important that you know the truth or anything like that, but more because he likes to talk and have peoplethink he's right]than educating you on all different scholarly viewpoints of them, and you realize you don't need to be accountable for ANY of the readings (besides the few papers you mention in your synthesis paper), you just begin to tune out, which is unfortunate because this class had such potential.This was a weird class. It's about the New Testament and ways of reading different books (especially the ways Dale likes). It is not about what Christianity is or what Christians nowadays believe - it really doesn't shed light on that. Did I enjoy the class? Not particularly. Do I regret taking it? I guess not. Did I learn? I definitely learned some, but not a ton, and I didn't love the way I learned it, because it was annoying. How was section? Great - Sara especially was an awesome TA and did a wonderful job of facilitating discussion without being its main contributor.If you know what you're getting into and don't expect this class to blow your mind but are curious, take it. If not, steer clear.",
    "Decent class, all around. Lecturers and TAs were good, and the material was interesting, and there wasn't too much reading. Sometimes felt kind of random in terms of topic selection (I wish we had done more textual and historical analysis of the actual New Testament, but I guess that was the old class before they changed it), but intro lectures are often like that, and the topics did usually end up being interesting."
