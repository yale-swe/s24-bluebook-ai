   "comments": [
    "All you need to know about dust and what little we know about how they form! You also pick up the skills to digest and critique papers along the way. Highly recommended.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, not just for learning about the ISM and star formation but also as a way to develop better analytic skills when it comes to reading papers and working with data.",
    "It's a ton of work: perhaps 2\/3 of my workload while taking 4 classes. With papers to read every week and long, difficult problem sets, it's not a course you want to fall behind in. Although working with others will help for the homeworks (a lot!), you are on your own for the take home exam.",
    "It's a very intensive class that'll you'll get a lot out of. I do recommend it highly.",
    "I would recommend this class, it is useful information and well presented.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to students interested in interstellar medium and star formation. The only reason I would not recommend the course to all physics students is the course workload.",
    "Mainly class about observation of ISM. At the first class, the photo of ISM just seemed like a beautiful picture, but you would understand the underlying physics just by seeing the data by the end of the class.",
    "Astronomy 560 is a required course for all graduate students, so this would not be a recommendation necessarily. That being said, I would not have any reason to warn students who are slated to take the course. The course has adequate and appropriate assignments, well-paced and comprehensive readings of relevant papers, and seems to be very useful for any research one would undertake in both observational and theoretical astronomy."

   "comments": [
    "I now feel like I have a more complete understanding of all the stuff in between the stars, black holes, and other objects we usually focus on. There was much more I didn't know than I thought when I entered.",
    "While I don't necessarily intend to pursue this field, the overview and general understanding I acquired through this course will be very useful for any cross-disciplinary work I hope to undertake in the future. The analysis of papers and proposals, plus the work with datacubes, was all extremely useful and I am certain I will put those skills to use.",
    "It gave me a crash course in radio astronomy, and a lot of experience working with real data in a class. I also gained paper reading and summarizing experience which is obviously helpful. Through this class I learned python, which will probably come in handy later. None of these topics are directly related to my research.",
    "I hardly knew anything about radio astronomy as it pertains to tar formation before this course and feel much more confident afterwards.",
    "Helped me learn a lot about the ISM",
    "Not directly related to my dissertation and research, but understanding the observational limit is essential to consider the physical model.",
