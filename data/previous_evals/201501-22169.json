    "NOT A GUT!",
    "History of Life is a fascinating, colorful lecture course that has been my favorite, thus far, at Yale. Professor Hull and Professor Tarhan are very accessible and it's quite easy to ask questions. If you pay attention in lecture (they can get a little long, but they're interesting), you won't have much trouble on the midterm. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "History of Life is an amazing course that encompasses a LOT of information. If you're man enough to go up Science Hill for class in the frigid winter, then you should take this class. It isn't a gut, but it also isn't a burden in the least if you show up to class and do the readings. The instructors will go out of their ways to help you and make sure you understand all of the topics. It's a perfect course for non-science majors. I mean, who doesn't love studying mass extinctions, dinosaurs, and super scary armor-plated fish? All while being taught by a super friendly and ever-smiling professor. Yeah, so basically this course is great. There will be lectures where you're like \"Oh crap I haven't heard these words since freshman biology\/chemistry in high school,\" but don't worry - the instructors won't judge if you ask them to explain in simple terms. I would definitely recommend this course to anybody and everybody. No, it isn't Structure of Networks or Vikings, but come on - we have more self respect than those who take those courses anyways, right? It isn't a nightmare of a course. Honestly, if you do it right it shouldn't stress you out at all. Take the course.",
    "I would only recommend this class to people who have a good memory for really strange facts. It was a really enjoyable course, I even enjoyed the lab days, but the material is too in depth for anyone to fully grasp. I left the class with an appreciation for G&G majors, but it feels like I just watched a movie in fast-forward with no sound on and have to summarize every detail. I think I spent more time studying for this class than I did working on my thesis and I still expect a B- or C unless the curve is miraculous. I really, really liked taking the class but the exam portion of it is really difficult. Take it if you're really, really interested in the material and don't feel desperate for an A. There's not a lot of work and the course is fun, but the exams are really hard.",
    "Yes, but the workload is a bit heavy and if you choose to take this class, make sure that you have time to put a lot of work into the class.",
    "I would most certainly recommend this class, because I feel that the topic is one of the most important of all. If I ran a school, I would make this class (or something very much like it) a requirement.",
    "The walk to our classroom was long, nearly as long as the Proterozoic Eon. The material covered by the course was extensive, nearly as extensive as Titanosaurus. But I would take the class again. If only to be reminded of how strange the world is and of how small I am.",
    "Good course for non-science majors. Two exams and an essay. Exams are difficult but manageable. At first, it will seem like tons of information being thrown at you, but if you keep up with the readings, it will be fine.",
    "Celli is very sweet and the lectures are fun and interesting. That being said, the sections and tests are pretty bad. Sections are usually useless and mandate making a 20 minute trek up science hill; the tests are way harder than they need to be and rely too much on rote memorization of small details. This is the kind of class where concepts should matter more than fact regurgitation and the final\/midterm could really do with a one page cheat sheet so we're actually learning ideas and concepts rather than cramming dates and stuff into our heads.",
    "If you're looking to learn a ton about dinosaurs, this isn't the class for you. This course is more a geology course than it is an evolutionary biology one, although the two are closely intertwined. It's an incredibly interesting course, but I would only take this course if you're down to learn a lot about geological processes and how they've shaped the Earth and its life. Beware: the exams are brutal, but the curve is generous.",
    "Yes! If you love extinctions and dinosaurs or are just curious about geologic history you should take this course!",
    "History of Life is an overview class of all of life. It is interesting and provides some useful information that I will probably pull out at future cocktail parties. It is almost more evolution than geology. It is a good class for a non-science major in terms of accessibility. I am a non-science major who does not normally take science classes and I felt like I understood the material almost all of the time. It is not a particularly hard or time intensive course, but it is a course where attending lecture (and paying attention during lecture!) is necessary. If you are unwilling to dedicate the class time, this might not be the class for you.",
    "It's a good class, but needs to be refined in some important ways. While it's presented as an introductory level class, it isn't always taught that way. Don't take it as a gut.",
    "Don't listen to any of the haters. This course is great, and you learn lots of cool things, and the professors are wonderful.",
    "History of Life is a good class for someone interested in either evolution or geology, or both.",
    "It is a good and informative class about life since the beginning.",
    "Yes! A great topic. I would urge the professors to be more explicit about what exactly we needed to know for the final, however.",
    "Take it if you are willing to memorize a lot of material, have some experience with synthesizing information across multiple time periods, or like paleontology already,",
    "History of Life gives you a basic understanding of how life has developed on earth over the past four and a half billion years. I would recommend the class. It is a relatively straight-forward science credit, with many applications to our natural world today.",
    "I loved this course!! It's SO interesting and really gives you a better perspective of the world. Would definitely recommend. Prof Hull is nice, funny, and a great lecturer.",
    "Covers the history of life. Interesting mixture of biology and geology, but not too technical.",
    "A very fun course that is accessible to non-science majors while being reasonably challenging and engaging throughout. Plus, labs with specimens from the Peabody!",
    "For a Sc credit, this class is not that easy. The exams are difficult and you need to study a lot. The course itself covers some cool material, but the content is not always presented in a straightforward manner. Lectures were kind of boring, but the professors were enthusiastic. Basically, it was hard to figure out what exactly you needed to know for the exams and major concepts were sometimes unclear. If you are looking for a really easy SC, this is not your class.",
    "History of Life is NOT A GUT. This class is actually pretty difficult, especially for non-science majors, and it takes a lot of work to understand what's going on. If you don't do the readings, you will fail. Basically, don't look here for an easy science class - it's not.",
    "This lecture is absolutely amazing. Professor Celli is passionate about teaching, so all the lectures are really interesting. Although not an easy class, everybody who want to know more about the history of the Earth should take this class.",
    "This is not a gut. Yes, the intro geology designation may make it seem easy, but to do well in the course will require a lot of work."
