   "comments": [
    "The class allows students to learn from a variety of different experiments that enhance their understanding of general chemistry. I would recommend taking this class in the fall because it highly complements the material that is taught in first semester gen chem. I think that the weakness of this class is that there is a lot of work that goes into preparing lab reports and somehow it is hard to see how lab reports contribute to the knowledge acquired in the class immediately because sometimes the date is recorded from apparatus such as mass spectrometers and graphing it does not guarantee a complete understanding of the concept at hand. However, I imagine that lab reports are an essential element of lab. Therefore, I think that there must be more feedback on lab reports.",
    "Way too much attention to unimportant detail, but overall well designed experiments. I would have appreciated more of a focus on chemistry and less on procedure\/formalities.",
    "I think I am really lucky to have been in a class with such few people and think labs could be more effective if they are in smaller groups like mine was if that is possible.",
    "The data sheets are not fun. You get a lot of points taken off purely for small mistakes without any explanation."

    "Yes, take it especially if you have a good TA or if you want to major in a STEM field and you have never taken a lab before. I would however add that lab reports take a lot of time, but that should not be a problem if you start them early and ask for advice from your TA.",
    "If you have to take it, try to get Zach, he was a great TA and made it much more bearable.",
    "Yes, but it is more time consuming than the half credit implies, so beware.",
    "Yes because it is mandatory for a lot of majors."
