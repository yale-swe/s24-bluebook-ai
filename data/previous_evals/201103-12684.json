    "Take it. You know you want to.",
    "Accumulative learning- well structured and good mix of vocab and grammar learning. I would recommend it.",
    "I would highly reccomend Modern Greek to MANY of my fellow students. As an intorductory language course, I think it does a good job of easing you into a new world, and my Greek (class) family means the world to me.",
    "This is a fairly easy class. The professor is really chill and laid-back, and the class has a very fun, casual atmosphere. You meet every day of the week and homework is assigned every day, but the workload is minimal and easy to handle. There is a small fifteen-minute quiz every Friday, a short one-hour midterm, and a one-hour final at the end of the semester. I would recommend this class. Greek is a fascinating language to learn, it isn't too difficult and provides an easy language credit, and the professor is really cool."
