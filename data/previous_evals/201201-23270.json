   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student.I enjoyed the fact that this class was more about thought\/analytical processes and research methods concerning biochemical rates and mechanisms, rather than a pure memorization\/definition\/calculations-based course.The things I learned in this class, thus, seem more applicable to my own research.",
    "Yes--but only if they intend to actually use kinetics later on in life.",
    "Biochemical Rates&Mechanisms is an overview of current biophysical theories and techniques to study enzymatic behavior. This course is appropriately balanced between theory and technique. Several up-to-date examples were used to illustrate taught principles. In addition to the material taught, academic skills, such as how to review an article and how to interpret another's data, were taught. I enjoyed this course and recommend it.",
    "Chem 556 is a survey of enzyme mechanism and some of the techniques used to study them. While the theoretical basis of these techniques is covered quickly, much more emphasis is given to practical examples drawn from papers. There were very few problem sets, which made it difficult to figure out what the important topics to learn were. However, the midterm and final were both open-book critiques\/discussions of papers, and so it wasn't terribly important to learn specific facts. If you get a huge kick out of enzymes, like I do, you'll probably enjoy the course, but certainly won't come out of it with a number of practical skills.",
    "For a student at all interested in biophysical chemistry I would recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me a good background in various theoretical approaches to studying enzymatic rates and mechanisms, as well as an understanding of the techniques that people utilize for researching this topic. I found this class very helpful for my research.",
    "I may actually end up doing kinetics-based research. Although it was not a super in-depth course, I think this class was a nice introduction to the kinds of things I will have to think about later on.",
    "Understanding biophysical techniques for enzymatic studies is essential in much of today's chemical research. I anticipate that I will use both the knowledge imparted by this class as well as the skills developed during it in my academic research.",
    "It deepened my understanding of biological pathways and mechanisms."
