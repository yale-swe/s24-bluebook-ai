    "I would recommend this course because it really provides a solid foundation for all future humanities courses.",
    "Covers a truly extraordinary amount of reading in a mere thirteen weeks. The workload is tremendous, but the experience is extremely rewarding. If you are committed to the course, you will come out with a great appreciation for the great works of western literature. n.b. Get ahead in the reading over winter break. Starting four or five weeks into the syllabus instead of the recommended 1.5 weeks will make your semester infinitely easier.",
    "Take the class. You don't want to miss out on Jewiss' section.",
    "This is a fun survey class that draws on a whole swath of literature. Don't take it if you want to specialize, but do it if you are interested in learning about the canon."
