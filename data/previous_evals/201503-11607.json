    "One of the most fun classes to take. For a course with a WR credit, it definitely has a manageable amount of essays. That being said, however, weekly pset can take a long time if you start the reading to late or don't start writing your answers early. The more you can space out the work, the easier it will be to do, the better grade you'll probably get on it, and the more fun the assignment actually is!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to another student, as it is a great class that covers the search for extra terrestrial life in a small, discussion based class. It is especially good for students who aren't particularly interested in biology or astronomy, but want to learn more to either gauge interest or to try something different. Only reservation: there can be a lot of biology and astronomy at times, especially if that is the focus for your final paper, so there may be the occasional discussion that will go over your head if you forgot high school biology.",
    "Basically, we study the possibility of life in space. We learn about geology, chemistry, biology, and astronomy, but it's never too technical. It's a good class if you're looking to dabble into something new, but maybe not if you're looking for a concrete science course.",
    "This class should really be entitled \"astrobiology,\" which is the exact combination of the two disciplines in its name. You'll learn basic astronomy and biology, how the two fit together to form life on Earth, and then you speculate about how this might be possible elsewhere. I found it fascinating and extremely intriguing, but others seemed less enthusiastic. Also, while the class provides a general overview of its topics, if you really want the juicy stuff, you have to take the liberty of looking things up on your own (though the class will introduce you to ways of doing this, so it's still valuable in that respect). Overall, I thought it was great and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get a science credit without having to take a math-intensive course, or to anyone interested in astronomy and how the universe works.",
    "Good class if your at all interested in astronomy\/aliens\/life. Workload can be a bit much at times, but its fine if you get ahead of the readings. Pretty easy in terms of grading\/work.",
    "I would say it's a very good way to get an introduction into astronomy and astrobiology without having to take a chemistry or mathematics-heavy course. It also helped with my writing and gave me the opportunity to try writing some research papers on a very interesting topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. Class discussion is important for reviewing the readings, which you should know--don't slack off because the readings are the bread and butter of this class. Although what comes up in class discussions isn't always on tests you should definitely go because the discussion really rounds out the course.",
    "The class is extremely engaging, and completely suitable for any non-astronomy major. It's also a fantastic and very painless way to earn a writing credit, especially for any STEM-ish person interested in astronomy\/astrophysics (or ET life). That credit is fulfilled by assigned reading, easy weekly written problem sets based on the reading, and about three essays over the course of the term. The best part is that the essays are usually very flexible--they involve arguing a stance about a book or about a theory, or in the case of the final paper, choosing any astrobiology topic to research. Prof. Faison does a really excellent job of holding discussions that spark curiosity, and the class is a really entertaining and comprehensive overview of all the facets of astrobiology. Professor Faison is is also really laid-back and makes all the discussions entertaining and comfortable. Loved the class, completely recommend.",
    "This course is about the Search for Extra-terrestrial Life, and it is also a science credit, and it is important to realize what these two things mean together. If you're looking for an X-files style, hand on end look into aliens, you're in the wrong place. If you want to understand the various astrophysical and biological facts that allowed for life to evolve and Earth and might elsewhere, this is the class you want. If the second option is something you want, this is a great class! Material is well taught, professor is great, but just make sure you want to know the science as opposed to the mythology of SETI.",
    "If you are willing to put in the time required to understand and complete the reading and problem sets, you will get a lot out of this course. It is essentially a broad overview of the many scientific fields that merge together to form astrobiology -- these include geology, astrophysics, biochemistry, evolutionary biology, and cultural anthropology, among others.",
    "I would recommend \"The Search for Extraterrestrial Life,\" but be warned, its title is somewhat misleading. Only the last third of the course is actually focused on SETI, with the first third centering on basic astronomy and the second third geared mostly towards evolutionary biology. The course is not that time-intensive, but it is not a gut either. There are weekly problem sets which require a fair amount of writing, but there is very little math throughout the course. Professor Faison is very knowledgeable and excited about the topics, but in-class discussion mostly centers around him relaying information in a relatively straightforward fashion, using lecture-style slides, as opposed to the students themselves directing the conversation. Overall, it was an interesting and relatively enjoyable course, and is probably a good first-semester freshman-year science credit for those of us who are not STEM kids.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class, for both the interesting material and for Dr. Faison's excellent teaching."
