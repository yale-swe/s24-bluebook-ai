   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it if you're interested in the subject. You don't have to do too much writing for a Wr credit, but be ready to do a lot of reading. That said, it's all really interesting - the psychology of how we view children, why children's literature is the way it is. You'll never read a kids book the same way.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who wishes to push themselves and learn something new about the way modernism and childhood might be related in literature. It's not an easy course because of some of the texts, but it can be rewarding if you put in the work to read the texts and discuss them in class.",
    "I have already recommended this course to several lower-classmen. It is a good way to learn the modernist movement, and a nice exercise of thinking too. Apart from its actually intense intellectual engagement, the children's literature is always fun to read - who can complain about reading Winnie the Pooh for class?",
    "Whether you're an English major, a psychology major, an undeclared student, or just a person who happens to wander into a Yale classroom: take this class. The reading list is extensive and varied; the assignments, while challenging, are totally manageable; the discussions are usually interesting, and Professor Cecire is good at not making you feel like an idiot even when you are. If you've ever wanted to revisit some classic works of children's literature, or if (like me) you thought you knew what children's literature was and are looking to have yourmind blown open, this is the class for you. I cannot recommend it highly enough!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings can be a bit much at times (the philosophical\/ intellectual readings), but they all have importance and they provide a bulk of the class discussion. Sometimes I wish we spent some more time on the literary works themselves, because some of them were really quite good and deserved more class time, but all in all the reading selection was a great mix and professor Cecire keeps you engaged the entire time."
