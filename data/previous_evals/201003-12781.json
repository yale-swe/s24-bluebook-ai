    "It's amazingly rewarding, but you spend more time on this class than you could imagine. One student got 7 hrs of sleep in 3 days leading up to the presentation. You're frequently up to 3 or 4am. One student was working on it over thanksgiving break with the professor.You probably shouldn;t do your senior project at the same time because it will be neglected for this class. Take as few other courses this semester as possible so you won't be too miserable.But it was completely worth it.",
    "As a MechE Major, no class will teach you more about being a Yale Engineer than this one. It's one of very few courses where you actually DO engineering yourself. Working on a team project sounds daunting at first, but after awhile having to make important decisions comes naturally, even if you're not used to doing so. You'll also feel much closer to your engineering peers after this class. The class is also a ton of work - more hours than you think will be spent working in the machine shop. But it's all completely worth it in the end. Watching something that you designed work (after sometimes several fixes) is incredibly satisfying and cool.",
    "This is why you're a MechE major. Take it, ABET BS or BA, no excuses. Seriously, I had more fun in this class than in any other class ever.",
    "I strongly recommend this class if you are more of the hands-on type and you enjoy using theory for real-world projects. It will be a lot of work, though. If you're not willing to give the project your all, just don't take the class. It's not fair to the people who care that they have to carry your weight."
