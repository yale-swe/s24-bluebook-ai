   "comments": [
    "Yes, though with the reservation that it was very large. Honestly, the course might be best split into two courses either between undergrad and graduate students, ore perhaps one focused on philosophy and the other on history. The downside to that latter (and it is a large one) is that one of the best aspects of the course was how students could watch political theory function as a sort of interpreter between the historical portions of the course and the philosophical. Still, to a student that is admittedly not well versed in philosophy (or political theory), the jargon of the trade was at times quite difficult to keep up with."

    "The course was invaluable in deepening my knowledge of several fields and learning how they could communicate with each other. The course effectively both broadened and sharpened a student's critical thinking (well this particular studentat the least). And the topic as both relevant and engaging."
