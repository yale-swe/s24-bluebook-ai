   "comments": [
    "I learned about the theoretical and practical frameworks around policy measurement, definition, and alleviation. I appreciate most the inclusion of a diverse range of approaches to the problem of poverty.",
    "First, I learned a lot about how anti-poverty policy works on a federal, state, and local scale, which is a very helpful vocabulary to have and allows me to understand the problems with urban redevelopment and other trendy solutions. Second, I learned so much about the role of race and gender in the labor market and in welfare policy, which was fascinating. Finally, I thought a lot about the role of nonprofits and other services in addressing the needs of the poor.",
    "I developed a thorough knowledge of the landscape of U.S. antipoverty policy, and challenges of program evaluation, implementation, and policy formation. I think this is one of the only courses I've taken where the jump in my knowledge and analytical skills has been so clear.",
    "Poverty & Politics in the U.S. did the impossible: it taught its students how to think about large, complex and sometimes abstract problems not JUST in terms of macroeconomics and national government, but ALSO in terms of how they affect real-life people. Before this seminar, I was obsessed with thinking about poverty in terms of how to end it, or how to improve it, or how to change seemingly impenetrable systems, almost exclusively. In some ways, that made me terribly disillusioned about the state of America and the world at large. But Cynthia Horan, a poverty expert but also poor people advocate, somehow, through her above-average, uniquely illuminating and comprehensive syllabus, well-guided discussions, and fruitfully high expectations for us, was able to remind me and the rest of the class if I may speak for them, that poverty is experienced by poor people through small, tangible and changeable waysat work, filling out their taxes, visiting a local clinic. Cynthia Horan helped the class reconcile big dreams for poverty in America with small wins for poor people in American cities.",
    "Learned about the history of poverty policy, appropriate ways to address poverty, and associated challenges. Dispelled a lot of myths about poverty and misconceptions and made me view the topic as more complex than before."

   "comments": [
    "I think the readings were wonderful, but I was disappointed in the conversations in class. I would've liked more conversation in class- it felt like we never got very far in class towards a more complicated understanding of the readings. I also got frustrated by the assessment of the responses. It seemed like there was a particular answer or style that Professor Horan was looking for.",
    "This is an exceptional course. It really challenged my thinking, the discussions were excellent, and the syllabus was so carefully crafted. Professor Horan gave me so much feedback and advice on my two research projects, which has made me a better thinker and writer. She also made an effort to bring students' interests and projects into the class, which was really wonderful. I would not change a thing about this course, it's one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "The workload is high, but it's worth it for sure. Prof. Horan challenges everyone on reading responses and comments in class and works to make sure students develop clear, logical thinking. The course touches on some social fundamental issues and forces students to grapple with them. The reading responses were a great way to focus my thoughts and do this each week. I've learned a ton and my thinking has developed enormously.",
    "Honestly, unsure how it could be improved. A terrific course. We need more courses and instructors like these at Yale.",
    "Strengths - the awesome smart students in the course. Weaknesses - way too much reading, so no one did it all, so then we weren't really having productive conversations."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want to learn how to read and analyze urban policy and have the time to give to it. It's very well-done and very well-taught and to get the most out of class time and the readings, you have to make it a priority.",
    "Yes! It's a lot of work and can be grueling, but it is really helpful in that students gain a firm foundation in the important arguments, discussions, and frameworks in the scholarship and work on poverty. I will carry a lot of skills with me after this class that will continue to serve me professionally and academically.",
    "This is a phenomenal course, one of the best I've taken at Yale. Professor Horan will really challenge your assumptions and make you a better thinker. The readings are good and the syllabus is thoughtfully designed. Discussions are very high-quality. Professor Horan is really supportive - she has high expectations, but she will give you a ton of feedback and support, and she takes the trouble to learn about students' interests and projects related to the class. If you're interested in labor policy, welfare policy, the role of race and gender in poverty, or the impacts of global capitalism in American cities, this is the class for you. I truly recommend it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, horan is a great professor",
    "Yes, definitely! If you're interested at all in poverty policy, especially in urban settings, I could not imagine a better environment in which to rigorously explore these topics and expand your own analytical capabilities.",
    "Yes! To quote my response to an earlier part of this evaluation, Cynthia Horan helps you reconcile big dreams for fighting poverty in America with our potential for small but incremental wins for poor people in American cities.",
    "Maybe. If you don't know much about poverty policy then yes, would recommend. But, if you've already taken classes in the topic then it's probably too basic. Also, lots of work b\/c 2 page reading response every week. Cool opportunity though to take a class with other students who care about poverty!",
    "I was lukewarm on this class. The issues discussed in class are very important -- a must-take for people interested in poverty alleviation poverty -- but the readings ranged from exciting to quite dull. The weekly reading responses were surprisingly painful to write, and Prof. Horan is a no-nonsense grader. Still, Prof. Horan is brilliant and unafraid to challenge students to think more carefully and speak more clearly. As a result, her demeanor can be intimidating and the classroom atmosphere can feel unfriendly; discussion sometimes feels like a ping-pong match with students rallying with Prof. Horan but rarely with each other."
