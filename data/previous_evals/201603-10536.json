   "comments": [
    "I gained better close reading and essay writing skills. I also became better at participating in seminar discussions. I learned how to connect texts to other's we'd read.",
    "My writing skills improved. Through the many exhilarating discussions we had in class, I enhanced my critical thinking skills and develop a deep appreciation for many of the literary texts that I read.",
    "This was the one section where we were always running over time with lots of questions we still wanted to explore and people who still wanted to give input. It was the most enjoyable of all my DS courses, and I think not only did I learn how to write much better (Roffman gives a full page of hand-written comments and annotates your paper very thoroughly) but I also learned to read better. Before this class, I thought reading better meant to some extent reading faster because of the huge DS workload, but this course really taught me to look deeply into the text. There were some fantastic lectures as well, and I really appreciate that Sappho was added to the curriculum since I knew little about her and enjoyed reading 1) her style of poetry and 2) a female author on the fall syllabus. Also, I really gained new perspectives on how to read specific works from some great lecturers for this course: Lamont, Bakker, Duval.",
    "In this course, I learned how to do a close reading of dense texts in order to understand the complex messages and themes made by the authors. I also learned how to evaluate texts in relations to the literary traditions that preceded them, making connections between texts across the western canon.",
    "Closer passage analysis and clear writing",
    "This is a DS course, so we covered as much of the ancient Western Canon as we could in a semester. This course pushed the limits of my writing skills, and my insight into each text was challenged again and again by both professor and classmates.",
    "This course was helpful for improving writing skills like developing clear arguments that flow throughout the paper.",
    "In this course, I refined my reading skills with some of the poems, plays, and religious texts that begin the Western Canon. I encountered many of these texts for the first time, allowing the class to serve as an introduction to several enduring works of world literature. I also continued to develop writing skills for the practice of literary analysis.",
    "I was introduced to some beautiful works of literature that I'd love to more fully discuss someday in a less breakneck-paced class. Don't get me wrongour section was full of fascinating discussionbut there's hardly enough time to do more than poke beneath the surface."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This will probably never change, but it would be so good to spend more time on each work. I felt that our studies of Dante, the Greek tragedies, and Ovid were stunted.",
    "The discussion sections are very engaging and thus, very effective towards fostering a deeper understanding of the text. Conversations were equally shared among every student and every student contributed to the class.",
    "I enjoyed Literature the most out of all my DS classes, which I did not expect at the beginning of the semester. I felt that among the strengths was a great selection of complementary readings and a great structure of section and essay, although this speaks to my individual section. One of the weaknesses -- although something I find problematic for DS overall--was the cost of books that we only read a part of (ex. the two Bibles we had to purchase). Especially for students on financial aid, the cost of some books can be excessive. I wonder if, for the future, these selections can be scanned and distributed. I also hope that more female authors can be added to the syllabus. I also wish there existed some mechanism available for essay editing or some kind of outline\/guidance to what specific papers are asking for. One regret I had for DS Literature was that I never chose to answer more creative essay prompts (ex. compose your own canto, compose your own poem based on Sappho) because I did not know what was expected out of them and feared getting a lower grade than possible with a typical close reading essay.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it allows you to engage with a substantial amount of texts that, when studied consecutively as we studied them, provide you with much more insight than if read in isolation. The only weaknesses of the course were that the amount of reading required in a single week was excessive.",
    "DS is awesome.",
    "We went through a huge amount of literature, which was great but also difficult since we went through them so fast.",
    "I don't know if the Sappho text was of enough substance to merit a place on the DS syllabus. I say this not because Sappho'a poetry is not of a high quality, but rather because it is so fragmented and so few poems are extant in their complete form. I don't know if, in a class devoted to the interpretation of text, a collection of pieces may be enough to discuss with any certainty. Other than that, I loved Ovid and Dante. I was especially impressed by Professor Bender'a final lecture on Dante.",
    "DS Lit for fall semester would be very hard to improve. Roffman in particular leads an extremely good discussion that's always lively and interesting. She also gives tons of feedback and is very good at working on people to improve their writing. All around great course.",
    "This course is structured around a series of interconnected texts, providing students with a progression of responses to and reinterpretations of earlier works. A particular strength of the structure of the course, then, is its emphasis on intertextual analysis. The combined format of seminars and lectures provides crucial context while still allowing for discussion of each work.",
    "STRENGTHS: 1. An spectacularly rich curriculum. I'm going to take this time to single out If Not, Winter by Sappho and Anne Carson, because I've heard murmurings that some professors aren't happy with this translation, and I'd be devastated if they led to its removal from the syllabus. I know that Carson's translation isn't particularly faithful to the original text, but it's fresh and beautiful and full of life, and it affirms the idea that we can still participate in the conversation of Western thoughtbecause see, there goes Anne Carson, mixing her voice and Sappho's and making them both the more gorgeous for that mixture. Writing papers about ancient works sometimes feels like whispering into an abyss. If Not, Winter shows us that it's possible to hold a conversation of equals. That's important. 2. So many great lectures that I can't pick a favorite. 3. Engaging discussion sections. WEAKNESSES: 1. In an earlier year, I'd complain about the lack of Sappho. Thank you for finally including her. I might not have gotten around to reading her for many years if she'd been left out again."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this course.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. The material that we read is amazing and the conversations imprint them in the hearts and minds of the students.",
    "I would strongly recommend Prof. Roffman's section for any students in Directed Studies. She is, in my opinion, one of the best professors in DS Lit, and perhaps DS overall. She does grade a little more strict than other professors, but the rewarding sections make it completely worth it. If you are considering whether or not to do Directed Studies as a whole, that's a different story. If you are a fan of the classics and humanities, then this program is definitely for you. If not...it's a little more difficult to say. The structure of the program (you have to take all 3 classes at once) meant that while I loved my literature section, I grew to dislike DS as a whole. As a first-gen student, I found this a difficult program to get a grasp of in comparison with classmates from boarding schools who had a) learned the material already, b) also knew a range of classics languages, and c) learned in this format throughout high school. The classes often feel divorced from reality and have a definite \"ivory tower\" feeling, especially if your section is filled with other students who have little real-life worries. There is little guide about what an exemplary DS essay should address\/look like, and the balance of the program prefers breadth (reading lots of works) over depth (going into some works more deeply). There is a culture around celebrating DS as a prestigious program, and pressure to do it if accepted because there's simply \"nothing like it.\" That is not exactly true, and I would encourage a freshman with interests in other places to explore them. There's also this pull towards DS because you have 3\/4 of your freshman credits pre-determined for you and don't have to enter the hectic blue-booking fray. You only have 36 credits at Yale! Spending 6 of them on DS is a huge investment. Decide wisely.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in western literature and would not mind a heavy reading load.",
    "Yes, it was challenging but I got a lot out of it.",
    "Oh yeah! This was my favorite class this semester. It was the most challenging course I've taken in college, but it was the most rewarding by far. My writing was greatly challenged and I think my ability to express my ideas about a text has improved in clarity as well. You should take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in expanding their knowledge of the Western cannon.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to several core works of Western literature. The course moves at a quick pace, but the readings, though challenging, are enjoyable. I always came away from seminars with new ideas about the texts, particularly due to Professor Roffman's skillful facilitation of our discussions. Prof. Roffman also provides extensive comments on submitted papers, making this course a valuable opportunity to practice analytical writing."
