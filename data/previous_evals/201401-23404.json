    "I would recommend this to a students who is sufficiently interested in the material to be motivated to do the readings and work without much prompting from the professor. It is somewhat unstructured, so be prepared to be organized and plan ahead on the papers.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think there were some kinks in the syllabus and way in which we approached the world history of slaving \/ human trafficking, but I'm sure they'd be ironed out in years to come. The course was an analysis of slavery, prostitution, and trafficking from a sort of world historical perspective, with special emphasis on the modern perspective of slavery and its definition. It was really awesome to reconsider the institution of slavery not just to condemn it, but to analyze its evolution and how prostitution and trafficking have become appropriated to the term \"slavery.\" Dr. Ward is awesome -- caring, intelligent, thoughtful. Working with her was totally wonderful.",
    "It is a summary of the recent academic scholarship about the origins of the trafficking and slavery movement.",
    "Yes I would recommend it if you would like to understand the debates\/review the scholarly literature on the topics of slavery and human trafficking.",
    "This class was a survey of the modern understanding of \"slavery\" and the implications that this has for anti-trafficking efforts, etc. You come away with a new understanding of the complexity of \"slavery,\" and see the world in a new way. I would definitely recommend it!"
