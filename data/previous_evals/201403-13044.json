   "comments": [
    "If you have to take Micro, I would recommend taking the seminar with Tolga. He was great at trying to keep the class interesting, and he was super helpful in office hours.",
    "Only take the seminar if you're SURE you want to go into econ (major in econ, concentrate in it for applied math, etc.) Tolga is a great professor who is sometimes vague and irrelevant, but also gives good examples of real life stuff that connects to the examples. The curve is definitely worse in this class than the lecture. There's more material (we covered factor markets while the lecture did not) and the problem sets can be confusing difficult, but only bc the specific examples weren't reviewed in class. Seriously, if you're unsure about majoring in econ, take the lecture class and see how that is, and then make your decision.",
    "This course enhanced my interest in Economics and I am seriously considering a major in Economics now. I chose this over the lecture because I feel it is easier to learn and focus in a small seminar setting and I don't need to attend additional sections. Also, there is one mid term instead of two. The curve is harder than Econ 115 (the large lecture class), but very manageable if you study from your class notes, along with some supplementary reading in the textbook. I had done some economics at school and that helped me but a lot of people in my class had never taken economics before and still did very well on the course. Finally, if you have Tolga Koker, take the class! He's the best!",
    "Econ 110 demands your soul. It is an extremely challenging course and necessitates a considerable amount of independent study in order be to able to wrap your head around concepts taught in class. It is the litmus test for would-be Econ majors.",
    "If one has even a slight interest in economics, take the course. Tolga Koker is fabulous and the course will be one of the most interesting classes one can take.",
    "From what I have heard from students in ECON 115, ECON 110 seems like significantly more work and a stricter curve for marginal benefit. While it is nice to have personal interaction with the instructor, I do not feel like the teaching was significantly better than what it would be in a large lecture (but I did not take that course so I am not sure).",
    "The seminar format of this class makes is much easier to understand the material compared to a large lecture. If given the chance, I would strongly recommend taking this course if you are interested in economics.",
    "Take this class. It has a harder curve than the lecture, but you will learn more Econ and won't fall asleep.",
    "The course is separated into two sections, demand-side and supply-side. The grade is determined by a midterm, a final, and twelve problem sets. It's definitely a manageable workload, especially if you study in groups. It's a great introduction to Econ."
