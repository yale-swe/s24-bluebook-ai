    "Definitely recommend it. Your homework is to watch really interesting iconic films.",
    "If you have any interest in Latin American cinema, definitely take this course! It's a great survey and you will have a very comprehensive understanding of the subject.",
    "While Professor Tortora is a very sweet and passionate professor, this course actually ended up being a lot more work than I anticipated, mostly because all films have to be watched outside of class and there are a lot of short papers and assignments that you have to work on independently throughout the year. If you are very interested in film then it is probably a good course to take, but if you're just looking to satisfy an L5 requirement you're probably better off with another option.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to a fellow student because it offers something that no other class in the Spanish department does.",
    "watching movies and analyzing their historical context and the technical aspects. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Focuses on older spanish movies but a good course!",
    "I would recommend it if you are ready to do the work - very rewarding if you are.",
    "I would recommend the course - it's a handy way to learn Spanish, Latin American history, and film in one fell swoop."
