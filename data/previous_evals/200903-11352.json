    "great course, take it. if you are NOT a mechanical engineer and enjoy the product design process, take it. this means designing and fabricating a working prototype, it may be time consuming, but absolutely worth it if you are an engineering student in any discipline.",
    "I would take this class if you are an ME senior regardless of ABET or not. It is really fun and rewarding, that said it is a lot of work, and time.",
    "Yes, amazing class, first chance to build something.",
    "This course is excellent for exposure to a team setting in which everyone must work together to ensure a successful outcome. It mimics the real world in several ways. You will learn a lot about interfacing with a team to achieve time sensitive objectives. You will be exposed to eEvery part of the design and development process - Idea Development, CAD design, Team Decisions, and Fabrication. Definitely take this course if you plan on getting involved with industrial design and development.",
    "You get to come up with a project and then you actually make it! Definitely recommend it. This IS the reason why you picked mechanical engineering as your major.",
    "Amazing course, teaches you how to solve a real life design problem as well as practical engineering skills, should be taken.",
    "Great, hands-on class for MechE majors. Very fun, and highly recommended if you like hands-on design classes."
