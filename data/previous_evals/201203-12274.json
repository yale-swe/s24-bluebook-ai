   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking Statistics 100 and then sticking with the JRS section.",
    "JRS makes a lot of annoying jokes but is a pretty good lecturer. He's clear when he teaches. Gerber, on the other hand, is not at all clear. He cares about his students but lecture was very muddled. It was always unclear what we had actually been taught and what we were expected to have learned.",
    "Yes it's a very good intro stats class. Not gonna change your life or anything but it's a good class.",
    "It's STAT- what do you expect. Take it if you need it. You pretty much have to teach yourself everything. Good luck.",
    "Please don't take this class. It was so easily the lowest point of my semester. JDRS is corny to the point of just not explaining the concepts in favor of his jokes, and if Alan Gerber is teaching the polisci section...I have no words for how frustratingly and incoherently boring that class was. It brought me to tears multiple times. Please just don't take it. Please.",
    "I would say that statistics seems like a useful class but overall you do not learn much. I would not recommend this class, especially if you did not take statistics in high school because it is really hard to decipher the topics, and most of the learning you do will come from the book not the professors.",
    "If you want to learn about statistics, take this course.",
    "It's not worth it. You aren't going to learn political analysis skills. Just take an easy QR and finish up your Poli Sci Major.",
    "This is a pretty boring class, even though JDRS really tries to make it engaging. I ended up zoning out and then learning everything before the midterms by using the Intro Statistics book (a GREAT resource) and the notes JDRS posts online. Alan Gerber does try to be helpful, but I would recommend picking a different section if you're not set on one. His teaching is really dry and I barely could follow along. It's a good class to get you introduced to statistics (I'd never taken a stat course and realized i like it enough to take more stat courses in the future), but much better if you take it with a friend. It's nice to get a chance to learn MiniTab if you haven't used it before.",
    "Like I said before, statistics is important. Statistics is useful. You should learn about statistics. However, this class is poorly taught. I want to given Professors Reuning-Scherer and Gerber the benefit of the doubt, as I'm sure they are great statisticians. However, they are not very good teachers. One-on-one they are better, but R-S didn't explain much thoroughly and often failed to show up at office hours. Gerber was one of those write-it-all-down-on-the-board-without-actually-explaining professors. I think they both meant well, and I appreciate that, but intentions do not help me understand statistics.",
    "Boring but useful. JRS is a creepy and annoying lecturer who is PAINFULLY awkward and corny in class, but at least he posts his slides and notes online.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have time to go to office hours weekly. In office hours work through the entire problem set and receive the answers for the previous one.It is frustrating that people do not go over HW. It is even more frustrating when teachers do not give practice exams or problems before a final and answers to those questions.The first half of this class is an example of how QR classes should be and the latter half is an example of everything that can go wrong with a QR class.",
    "The half of STAT 100 (which leads into this second half class, EP&E 203), was interesting and fun; I learned statistics from the beginning (no prior knowledge needed). Don't get turned off by how crazy JRS seems initially, he makes a great lecturer and is a lot of fun.The second half - once we split into smaller groups - was disappointing. This section: PolySci with Prof. Gerber, was often confusing and tough to follow. Prof. Gerber's expectations were unclear. I'd definitely recommend this class, but not this particular section.",
    "While JDRS is an engaging lecturer, we went pretty fast through the material during the first half. I was struggling to keep up. I liked the section better. Professor Gerber is clear in his lectures and you can tell he really wants his students to succeed. He's also quite (unintentionally?) funny. Though stats didn't come easy to me, I might just take another course taught by Gerber. My biggest piece of advice: GO TO THE TAs FOR HELP. There are just so many of them that you really have no excuse.",
    "The first half of the course was great, Reuning-Scherer is a great professor. I took second half PLSC with Gerber which I regretted. Though Gerber is a real leader in his field, he is a pretty bad lecturer and unless you are super into stats (which I was not) it will be hard to follow what is going on in the PLSC section.",
    "The first two thirds of the semester with JRS provide a great intro to statistics. I wouldn't recommend going into the political science section with Gerber, however, as I had a hard time following his teaching style.If you do take this class, I would recommend printing and binding the lecture notes (at Docuprint or wherever--a friend did it and it's like $15) and bringing them to class. It's only 5 or $10 more than printing them out at Yale, and I regret not having done it.",
    "It's a fine, easy enough, intro STAT class. If you're taking it for EPE, try to take 102. It's actually relevant material to a lot of what you've probably learned in Political Philosophy courses, and Gerber does a good job of making sure you see the connections to the real world. If you just want to take a STAT class, shop around, but this is a fairly easy, survivable class.",
    "Take stats, but in all honesty, don't take the polisci section unless someone who is not Alan Gerberis teaching it. The first half (taught by JRS) was funny, engaging, and easy to understand. The second half (Gerber) was supposed to teach us polisci applications, but we didn't get to that until the last five minutes of the final lecture. All we did was learn more confusing and less useful methods for what JRS had already taught us. While Professor Gerber is great in office hours and really cares for students, his half of the semester was honestly the worst lecture class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Take it only if you need to.",
    "Take it if you need a QR credit.",
    "I think everyone should take Stats. It's relevant in all things, even in humanities courses.",
    "Not the most interesting class, but gives a broad introduction to statistics that is required for certain majors but also generally helpful and applicable to a number of disciplines. Weekly problem sets that are manageable, two midterms, and a final, all of which were relatively reasonable.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in theories. Not if you are particularly interested in the practical application of the theories.",
    "Yes - straightforward, interesting introduction to statistics. Requires some initiative to keep up with the material and stay engaged, but definitely manageable.",
    "I would recommend this section to a student looking to fullfill a QR requirement, especially because a lot of majors require Stat. My only advice is to get the textbook early! I got mine for ten cents on Amazon. Get it early and use it!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class, it's very boring and tedious and harder than it would seem.",
    "you're probably taking it because you have to. If you just want to get out of a qr do something else. Alan Gerber is a bad teacher and the lectures are terribly dull. If you have to take it with Gerber, skip lectures and just learn it online -- I wasted my time going to class and ended up having to learn it online anyways. Second half of the class is competing for worst class I've taken.",
    "I took this class for my QR and feel very satisfied in that choice--and I am that person who gulps even when courses ask for working knowledge of algebra (actually). That said, the whole point is Professor Reuning-Scherer. He's amazing. He's hilarious. He made me understand things but most of all he constructs his course to have so many resources at your disposal. HW help, office hours, notes online and sample exams. He is there for the lost student. I can't say the same for Professor Gerber, and if I didn't have some close friends in the course I don't know how I could have survived his half of the section, even though he himself is a wonderful man.. With JDRS I at look could go to TA's and sessions for the problem set explanations, but Gerber's TA's are not helpful. For that reason alone I might suggest just continuing with JDRS.",
    "much easier if youve taken a stats class in high school. not too bad its definitely manageable but you do need to put some work into it. definitely go to office hours before psets are due - they are very helpful.",
    "Take it if you need statistics for something...it's not really a fun class.",
    "TAKE 102. JRS is great, and makes stats genuinely interesting and exciting and class is great. However when you split into sections, don't take the poli sci section.",
    "Good class if you want to learn the basics of statistics and be able to see if people are blowing smoke when they make statistical claims. Second half of the course was harder than the first.",
    "A necessary course for anything related to science, social sciences, poli-sci etc. It's very flexible in terms of deciding which sub-section you want to be part of, and so quite practical even for undecided majors.",
    "Consider taking Reuning-Scherer's portion of the class. Do not take this class, or any other, with Alan Gerber."
