    "This course taught me how German forests are managed for a range of values, from cultural and aesthetic frameworks to natural hazard management, nature protection, and economic extraction. I also learned how to apply floristic and stand development assessments to a variety of ecosystems.",
    "This course not only provided a great ecological basis for understanding forests but excellently demonstrated how to apply that knowledge to making forest management decisions. This course brought my perceptions about conservation, natural resource management, and environmental management from just a theoretical construct and grounded it in an actual understanding of ecology to the point that I have been able to go to new forests and interpret the history of land use and forest succession. There were several fundamental shifts in the ways that I thought about these systems previously that have been reformed for the better through this class."

   "comments": [
    "They aligned perfectly. This field course was very well planned and implemented.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The greatest strength of this course is the variety of experiences it offers. We saw so many different landscapes, learned about a range of management types, and heard a variety of perspectives.",
    "It would have been fun to take on an individual project related to the course material to try apply what were learning to a topic of our individual interest. The course load was also a bit taxing at times, with all the field trips - however those were very valuable, I'm not sure I would cut any of them except for maybe the nursery and tree pruning."
