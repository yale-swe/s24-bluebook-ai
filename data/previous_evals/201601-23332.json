    "Material covered, some of the assignments.",
    "Great survey of basics, cutting edge research, and principle challenges in understanding the science of climate change.",
    "I liked the paper critiques. I think more paper critiques but lighter assignments would have been better.",
    "The course covered a wide range of topics related to climate science. However, in my opinion, each of the topics were covered deeply enough to have a good understanding about it. I didnt know about most of the topics covered in the course, and the course made me, not just learn about them, but get interested in learning more about some of them.",
    "I liked the opportunity that we get to play with the scientific data and see how climate is changing.",
    "1. Course notes, lectures &readings- well and thoroughly prepared. Both Xuhui and Nadine put a lot of effort in designing and delivering the coursework. The course featured the latest research on climate science which was extremely useful for me. 2. Instructors responsiveness- Both Nadine and Xuhui were available and prompt in answering questions from students. They aso went to great lengths to provide additional reading material and also provided me with additional contacts to reach out to for my research topic of interest. 3. Problem sets- The data rich quantitative problem sets were very useful and provided me with skills in interpreting, organising, analysing and presenting climate data. The various climate modelling tools provided in class were very useful takeaways.",

As this - in my view- is the best primer course for atmospheric & climate science at FES, it could perhaps be treated as a foundations class and allocated lab time to allow for climate modelling simulations."

    "I've been learning a bunch about clean energy and climate policy and this was great foundational grounding in the science of climate change to inform my policy thinking going forward.",
    "Although not just a climate change course, this is a must take for anyone interested in climate change and pollution.",
    "The course was the first course I have ever had on climate science. During the first weeks I took it just for curiosity. However, it quickly caught my interest. I wasnt planning to take any climate science courses when I started my masters degree, but now I am looking forward to take one or two additional courses in this topic.",
    "My focus at FES is climate and energy. The class was perfect for me and was one of the most useful I've taken this semester. From previous professional experience, I have gained extensive knowledge in climate policy and a thorough the normative frameworks that govern climate change. I attended the COP 21 climate summit in Paris and actively observed the main government-led negotiations. From these experiences, I felt that policy practitioners sometimes lacked an in-depth understanding of the climate science in it's totality. I felt that they (practitioners) worked in silo's and had a full understanding of their specific areas but not the full picture. I also felt that I needed to better understand the implications of some global climate policy targets\/political declarations, for instance, the actual climate implications of a 2-degree goal or even an ambitious 1.5 degree goal and its potential to peak Co2 emissions within set timelines. I therefore hope to go back to work in the climate and energy policy space and took this class to gain a broader understanding of contemporary climate science and the full raft of mitigation options available."

I'm particularly interested in practical solutions to energy poverty-related problems and this class shaped my understanding of the science behind short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP's) and optimal policy strategies for mitigating SLCP's in view of LLGHG's. I also had a general idea of GHG accounting and through this course, I learnt proper techniques of GHG accounting which were very valuable. Lastly, as an enthusiast of big data, the problem sets on big data analysis and visualization were useful for me, for example, using data from the NASA GISS to illustrate rising global temperatures through the widely referenced global maps of SST and Mean surface temperature. Having had a strong background in climate policy, the course was illuminating for me as I gained a better scientific understanding of some policy goals\/targets\/commitments such as the R.F impacts of historical emissions."

I think the first assignments scared a few people off from taking the course but the assignments got much more manageable later in the course so I wouldn't let the first assignment deter you from taking the course.",
    "Take it. This is one of the best courses I have had so far at FES",
    "If you have a general understanding of climate policy but wish to gain better insight into climate science, then this course is highly recommended. Some take away skills that the course teaches- Basic climate modelling, GHG accounting, R.F, albedo computations and climate data analysis skills. The course is a great primer for other courses that have a climate or energy component.",
