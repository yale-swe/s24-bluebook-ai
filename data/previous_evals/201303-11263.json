   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class to any student who genuinely wants to develop their poetry. I wouldn't recommend it as a fun jaunt into creative writing, but as an intense approach to self-improvement.",
    "I would really recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing poetry. It is a real luxury to be able to take a writing class at Yale where you get to have some time allotted for writing during the semester. Added to that is the great honor of being able to work with Professor Gluck. Be mindful, though, that she can be pretty restrictive in terms of what she likes and doesn't like, but this class will make you more conscious of your writing. Take this class.",
    "A terrific, terrific course. You will grow as a writer and write under the guidance of a pure and true artist.",
    "English 246 is a weekly writing seminar designed for students who wish to improve their skills as poets. Notonly do you learn as a writer, you also learn as a reader. Though I've heard mixed reviews from previous students of this course, I would highly recommend taking this class. It completely transformed the way I see poetry.",
    "Every week every student submits a poem and three are selected to be workshopped by the whole class. I would recommend it to people who particularly have read a good deal of poetry prior to the course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for someone who enjoys writing poetry already, and who wants to know how to actually write good poetry. In looking at classmates' poems and in scrutinizing your own work, you will be able to put your finger on things that do and do not work in a poem and become much better.",
    "Strengths: you write a poem every week, get weekly feedback (whether written or in class), and learn some techniques of poetic revision. Weaknesses: sometimes discussion can get a little tedious because there are no ground rules for the workshop. Also, there is no set rotation for workshopping, Prof. Gl\u00c3\u00bcck just picks someone every week. There were some people who got workshopped once or twice, and some who got workshopped four times. So that's just something to be aware of. I would recommend it because it forces you to write and allows you to get great feedback.",
    "If you think you have it in you to write good poems, or at least lines of good poems, take the course and appreciate every second of it! You'll be sad when it is over. A lot of negative criticism, but well worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to become a better poet. It will teach you how to write better poetry and think about poetry more critically, and Professor Gluck is great.",
    "Absolutely - without hesitation. It's wonderful to have your work taken seriously by a poet as accomplished as Professor Gl\u00c3\u00bcck."
