   "comments": [
    "The course is a discussion-based class on the different forms of media and their significance in Germany and America. I would definitely recommend the course to another student as long as they have developed good German skills, because the workload was manageable and the class engaging.",
    "Very light course load during the semester, but the final project is far from easy, and takes a substantial amount of time to do well. It's a fun class that is low stress during the semester, and is well taught by engaging instructors",
    "If you got into German L5 and feel like you have had enough focus on the German language this is a good class because we move beyond the language and have actually interesting discussions about Media in the USA and Germany. The topic changes every two weeks or so, and so it never gets boring.(we watched movies!) We also kept blogs and had to post twice a week about anything we had discussed in class! I would recommend it if you want to use the German you've been learning. HOWEVER, as a heritage speaker, I don't think my German improved that much. The department is yet to come up with a challenging course for heritage\/native speakers. On that note, it's always good to have one class that is relaxing.",
    "It's an exciting course in the sense that it forces students to use the German language in an original and unexpected way through the many creative assignments that they give us. On the other hand, although it is a media-focused and therefore a very media-based class, I always felt as if the topics we were discussing were a tad superficial. We would talk about social networks, letters, diaries, gameshows, blogs, and we would see a bunch of statistics on how the Germans versus the Americans use them, but we would never really tackle deeper questions and issues that arise from them."
