    "ENGL 114 is a great way to improve your writing and to get an understanding of what good academic writing really is. You learn to make an argument, support that argument with plenty of evidence, and how to draw your reader in. If you are looking for a good intro to college level writing, I would definitely recommend this course. If you are looking for in depth discussions about a particular topic or an opportunity to read things that interest you, I would suggest taking a different english course that has more of a literature focus. All and all, great course though.",
    "I would recommend this course and say that you will indeed improve your writing skills.",
    "Great course but a lot of work",
    "This course is a course that will help all students with both their English skills and academic growth. I definitely felt like I matured as a person while learning new perspectives on certain issues and discussing them with my professor and classmates. I would most definitely recommend this course to many others.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to improve your writing skills. I recommend Childhood Self and Society with Professor Klemann. We read super interesting readings and the discussions in class really do make you rethink about your definition of childhood. This was probably my favorite class this year."
