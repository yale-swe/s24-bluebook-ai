    "Yes, it improved my ear, taught me a lot about writing for voices as well as formatting charts, and also has helped me a lot in the writing of my own music.",
    "Incredibly useful workshop-style class. One of the few courses at Yale that teaches a practical skill and has you apply it at every step of the way. Take it if it's offered and you're interested in arranging. It is NOT a cappella arranging 101, though. It does require some theory and notation background.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in having a long-term career in arranging for voices or instruments. Professor Klitzis a professional music director, conductor, and arranger (he's currently conducting a Broadway show that he got tickets for us to see and then took us out for drinks and food afterwards), so he knows exactly what he's talking about. It's the most practical music class I've ever taken--he teaches you how to make charts look and sound professional, as well as what kind of things you do and don't need to write down for pro musicians to be able to read what you're writing. However! This is not a class that is about you expressing how creative you are or exploring the revolutionary possibilities of arranging. It's a class that teaches you how to write professional charts that will be instantly readable and usable. Once you have the germ of an arrangement, Klitz will want you to fit that arrangement into a recognizable sound that's not hugely experimental or out there, and once he has an idea of how the arrangement should sound, you'll be editing and adjusting it to fit that idea. In other words, this is not the place to learn how to write music--it's really about arranging and getting creative in pretty specified ways. There are other classes to take if you want to be songwriting or composing in a broader sense. But I found it very very valuable and learned a lot of important information that I could never have gotten from any other course."
