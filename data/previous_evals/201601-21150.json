   "comments": [
    "You learn everything you should know about the world and how government and business interact. This class teaches you the necessary information to go forward in whatever path of study you choose and gives you the basic knowledge on how the world works. I would highly recommend this class to any student at Yale - literally one of the best classes I have ever taken.",
    "Yes, especially one looking to go into political science or economics",
    "Relatively easier class on the political science department. Take it if you want a wide ranging view on government and business around the world. Good stuff enjoyed it.",
    "Not a lot of work, but you learn a lot because it makes sense. Helps you understand the world around you (why China is how it is). Yes, I would recommend this class. It was not difficult but it was relevant information and the teacher was outstanding.",
    "I would say that the course certainly instills a basic understanding of how governments and businesses work together, or don't, and why. Definitely recommended course.",
    "Good introductory class to the subject; may cover a lot of ground that you may already know, but it provides a good foundation for further study",
    "Awesome professor and very interesting class! Even though attendance to lecture was not accounted for, I was compelled to go because the lectures were great. Plus, Prof. Kane has a soothing voice, is very smart, and has a witty personality. These are some examples of things he said that stuck with me: \"we know the price of everything but the value of nothing in this society,\"\"the business of America is business,\" \"capitalism doesn't run on greed, but it may encourage it; capitalism runs on enterprise,\" \"if you are putting your faith in world leadership to solve climate change, then you are in a bad position,\" \"you guys know what an oxymoron is, right? Hint. It's not a moron from Oxford. That itself would be an oxymoron.\" Take his class.",
    "Good overview of the current political system in the world, and how it works in relation with the business in each country.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "It's a class about how businesses and governments interact with one another, offering comparisons between various systems. It's a good class, and is a good part of a civic education."
