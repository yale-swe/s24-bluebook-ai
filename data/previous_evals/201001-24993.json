    "This is mostly a motor control lab. You learn about how to theoretically control a motor, then you do it in increasingly involved ways. First you use a FET switch, then you use a MIAC, then a PIC.It's interesting and useful, but at times yuo don't know what you're trying to do.",
    "Cool class. It's not as cool as it sounds, but it's pretty cool. Despite what the professor tells you, you really need DiffEQ, programming, and electrical engineering prior to this class. Otherwise it's really difficult.",
    "i guess if ur abet you have to take it. if you're not, either spend a summer learning how to program a PIC microcontroller and then take the course, or be prepared to struggle to get the concepts.if you get it, then yea it's really fun to learn how to control motors and stuff",
    "Mechatronics is supposed to teach you how to combine mechanics, electronics and programming when building systems. We learned about microcontrollers, DC motors, and stuff like that. The class doesn't have much of a focus unfortunately, although I can see the \"cool\" in it - Professor Morrell was one of the original engineers on the Segway, for example. There's a reason that there are grad students in the course, though. For ABETs, I recommend teaming up on lab reports and using Alek's help, if he's your TA. Don't buy the book either, it's a waste of money. This course isn't awful; it's actually kinda cool sometimes - it could just be done better."
