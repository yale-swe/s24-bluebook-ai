    "$200 budget as compared to 10 times that last time around says a lot. Particularly when dealing with something as tricky as surfaces vs. something milled. The amount of work hours put in to deal with materials hands on and the budget seemed to be mismanaged.Also there were about 13 in the class and so using the equipment was a struggle when making so many large panels and pieces. 200 was not enough to cover materials let alone cutting costs for some and gave us little or no opportunities to outsource.",
    "Availability of welders was a problem. Also we faced some opposition to using atypical materials in the shop, which seems more like a facility issue rather than students doing something wrong. The ventilation system in the spray booth and the proximity to the spray booth to the plasma cutter should be evaluated.",
    "Shop resources were available, but definitely not adequate. We were constantly pestered for the inadequacy of the school's own facilities. Complaints on the fourth floor of resin fumes from the basement shop should not be any student's responsibility.",
    "More money would have been helpful to actually develop the panels to the level of sophistication Mark wanted"
