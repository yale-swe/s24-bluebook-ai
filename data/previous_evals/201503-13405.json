   "comments": [
    "Great course - as I mentioned in my paper evaluation, I have known health to be socially determined, but getting a deeper understanding of the different ways social and behavioral factors affect health was beneficial to me.",
    "I liked the melange of interconnected topics and most guest speakers were great. Recommendations: provide guidance on concept sheets earlier (so that it's possible to do one for week 1 of class); provide more guidance about paper (and proposal and abstract), by clarifying expectations and intent, especially for people who haven't written research proposals before.",
    "this course is a little boring because I am not interested in it at all this course should be elective instead of compulsory.",
    "I really enjoyed the breadth of topics discussed in this course. I think it could benefit from more community leaders coming in to discuss their work and ways to implement change on a ground level.",
    "Good foundation for social and behavioral science.",
    "workload is kind of high",
    "I feel the workload is too much. Usually there are around 8 papers which for around 20 pages assigned to read. I don't think a student could read all of them carefully. It's just pointless to put so many assignment since no one could really finish them with high quality.",
    "This class felt totally disorganized (especially at the beginning. Sections took way too long to organize) with no clear objectives. The assignments were often explained inadequately and the work all felt like busy work. The lectures were pretty pointless - you don't have to go to do the work. I liked the \"poster session\" a lot. more actual information - one little lecture on theories. the prof and TFs talked about how important theories were...then we hardly even learned about them!",
    "This course definitely felt like a course that was slapped together. None of the readings were cohesive and the assignments seemed to be an afterthought to make students feel like they were doing homework. The final paper especially was poorly designed. We were initially told that the paper was going to be a grant proposal, where we would have to outline our proposed research. However, this eventually turned into a \"poster presentation\" where the posters were printouts of our abstracts. Then, the paper ended up being a fake research paper, which goes against everything I have learned thus far in science education. I will gladly do an assignment where I feel like I am gaining knowledge from completing it, but this final paper was worth 40% of my grade and consisted of fabricated information. What is the point to that?",
    "Too much concept sheet assignment.",
    "I loved this course. The readings were interesting and the concept sheets required us to think about them in interesting ways instead of simply summarizing.",
    "There was no clarity or direction whatsoever for a majority of the papers in this class, specifically the Media Analysis, Midterm, and Final Paper. We were only given a grading rubric to go off of, which was extremely unhelpful. In addition, to a grading rubric, we should have also been given a summary sheet of what was expected of us in writing the papers. Also, I think it was ridiculous to make a requirement of having at least 25 sources for our final paper.",
    "Great course, good workload. Wish there was more instruction on final project",
    "The lectures are interesting, bu t the work, specifically Concept Papers, are long and tedious and only worth 5% each. I would suggest improving the workload and changing the concept sheets.",
    "The course was definitely important to expose us to social and behavioral aspects and determinants which point to public health successes and failures. It helped to explain an, unfortunately, consistently absent social factor in some research projects. Cultural competency, sensitivity, and microagressions should become a part of the course content.",
    "The course is far too basic for those with previous experience in this field. The material is too basic in scope in my opinion. I would be interested in more radical topics or interpretations.",
    "The course as it currently is needs to be better organized. The topics each week are not tied together very well so there is no sense of direction to the course. The guest lecturers and the individual topics are interesting, but they come across less as a class on social and behavioral determinants of health than a weekly psychology\/sociology seminar. As a result, the concept sheets you have to write don't have any real meaning behind them. The midterm itself was very fair - just impossible to prepare for since the lectures are kind of all over the place. And the final paper is worth way too much in relation to everything else considering it does not actually tie together the class in any way.",
    "I enjoyed the class and found it very informative. I found the concept sheets time-consuming but beneficial.",
    "I felt that the course did not meet my expectations. Although obviously the attempt was made to give it structure, I do not think the class was well-structured. We did not cover enough worthwhile topics because class did not meet as frequently as it should have. There was no class the first week during the shopping period or discussion sections for some time. Class was cancelled for exams or centennial lectures. Consequently there were only nine or so topics covered by the course. Given the few class meetings, I did not appreciate having a lecture on how to use the library resources. Structural concerns pertain to other elements, like class organization. I did not think it sensible to assign concept sheets which are a synthesis of material for the day the lecture is given as opposed to the discussion section. I think introducing the material first in lecture and then allowing students to include elements of the lecture in their concept sheet (due on Thursday) would be more appropriate. Also the readings were often too long and too field specific and as such were not fitting introductions to the topic of the week. Consequently it made doing the course readings difficult and discouraged students from actually doing so, leading to limited participation in discussion sections. The discussion sections could have focused more on lecture material. I disliked the debate topics we argued because the positions we were given were too exaggerated to take seriously. Class organization was another weakness. Even though we spent too much time at the start of classes discussing the coming assignments and events, no one was really sure what the logistics would be, namely how assignments would be submitted or how to the flipped discussion period would be run. Furthermore there were problems organizing discussion sessions which should have been predicted given that everyone was taking the same core course earlier in the morning and the periods were to meet outside normal class hours. Even class time on the course catalog did not match the actual class times. Generally I liked the non-concept sheet assignments, namely the media assignment and the final paper. It was interesting doing the media analysis readings and having the freedom to explore a topic of our choosing. I also enjoyed the poster presentation session we had to share our ideas and interests with others. However I found the concept sheets difficult to write because of the need to incorporate a large number of readings which often were rather dissimilar in content. The poster presentation could have been held during our discussion section time. Grading of assignments was also scatter-shot. At the beginning of the year we were given a rubric which was a letter grade with a +\/-, yet the assignments were given a numerical value at times. I appreciated the feedback I received on my TA (Isabel) on my concept sheets and media assignment, but I felt the midterm feedback was highly minimalistic, mostly just underlining which I did not appreciate. This after waiting several weeks to get our grades back. Apparently this was a result of wanting to standardize grades, which is a noble intention. A similar concern delayed the return of the first concept sheets. I would suggest having the different TAs each read one of the students concept sheets in turn so that we can get different viewpoints in our feedback and ensure fairing grading. Another fairness concern was the extension of the final paper deadline to certain inquiring students. Once the deadline was extended for some students, an email should have been sent out offering the extension to everyone. Perhaps the most important critical comment I would like to make is that the course did not fully engage me as a non-SBS student. I think the course, in its first year, needs to do a better job appealing to the Epi\/EHS\/other students taking the course and making us interested in the subject.",
    "Strong discussion. Plenty of ideas exchanged. Assignments were fun. Midterm was not well designed. Would have been more comprehensive and elaborate if it was an essay question instead of multiple questions that have overlap.",
    "I enjoyed the content and readings of the course and found them enriching. My favorite discussion sections were those that involved interactive activities like debates. I would recommend increasing the number of sections that involve activities like that. The midterm was also a great learning tool as it is (take-home essays).",
    "This course gives a great introduction to many important cross-cutting issues and topics in public health. The weakness was the inability to go into depth about certain issues outside the final paper. I also thought that research methods should be more emphasized during the course if the final paper was so focused on it. However, I really enjoyed the structure of the class and the readings. Some of the assessments were a little unrealistic and forced in tying together many different readings but I appreciated the intent in ensuring the students went into depth with the material.",
    "great class that truly opens your view on how you see the world. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "This course is required and I wouldn't have taken it if it had not been. This course should not be required for students in the SBS department. It is very redundant and Interdisciplinary Research Methods in SBS is essentially a more advanced, more challenging version of the same course. There is a lot of busy work required for this course as well--the concept sheets did not add to my learning experience but detracted from it. Trying to cram my thoughts about five different readings into 2-3 double spaced pages was not only difficult but did not do any of the papers nor my understanding of the concepts justice. I found section to be pretty useless as well as far as furthering my understanding of the concepts. The debates were poorly thought out and many of the activities seemed juvenile. The structure of the paper required for the course was the antithesis of everything we have been taught about proper research methods, reducing bias and confounding, etc. The assignment should be changed for next year to either be something that more closely resembles a grant proposal or is an actual research paper or a report on existing research--not something that is a weird mix of all three where we are asked to predict the results of our hypothetical study.",
    "The class is pretty solid - I came out of it with a better understanding of various social determinants of health.",
    "I liked the guest lectures from experts. I really liked the warm and friendly atmosphere created by all of the teaching staff.I thought the concept notes were a good way to learn the material in greater depth, but should have counted for a higher percent of the grade, since they took so much time and were so central to the course (maybe concept notes could count for more and the final project could count for less). I liked when we had debates and activities in section.",
    "useless",
    "It's a good class if you're in SBS\/CDE. If not, there isn't a great overlap between SBS and other topics. For example, I would have wanted to see EMD and management topics addressed more openly in the context of theory, behavior, and social determinants. These were only briefly addressed.",
    "The guest lecturers were great and introduced us to a various interesting topics in SBS. The readings were a lot and took a lot of my study time.",
    "The section was a good chance to discuss concepts. However, lectures often lacked engagement and weren't productive for me. The reading responses were too much- including 5 readings was excessive for the space provided. Amount of time reading was also excessive."

    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0She is really nice and understanding. Is really passionate about the material.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Professor Levy did a great job in teaching the content provided and did an excellent job to bring researchers and professors that were teaching specific to the class topics. She made it an important factor to grade equally across the scope of students and as well as present in a sensitive manner to different identities within the classroom. I definitely respect and appreciate the way she handled the course throughout the semester. She was also kind enough to listen attentively to concerns about the class and implement changes as quickly as possible. She also seemed to worked extensively with the TFs to provide a varied viewpoint on the class and a variety of methods of teaching or exposing subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Very nice, but not able to keep control over class",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0I thought Professor Levy was a great professor and very attentive to her students' needs.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0I feel Professor Levy was very sensitive to the feedback and wishes of the students, almost to a fault because you can't please everyone. I was impressed by her willingness to share certain critical opinions individuals shared. I thought she did a good job fielding and responding to student comments and questions in class. However I did not particularly care for her powerpoints, which I felt had vague text, and her overall lecturing style. After she gave a presentation on a particularly subject, and went back to check something in the posted powerpoint and could not find the slides I seemed to remember. I don't know if I mis-remembered the material which was possible or if the slides were changed. I was doing so because of a concern for a fallacy which I wanted to address in class\/lecture but did not have the audacity to bring up, and which is something of a microcosm for my feelings towards this subject material (forgive my tangent but I feel this might be of interest to Prof. Levy). I seemed to recall seeing the claim that there is a bias against older Americans in this country; that they are seen as less intelligent, physically able, etc. In other countries without this measured perception, the older citizens report lower indicators of infirmities than do older Americans. It was either argued or just implied in class that these biases (presumed cause) were affecting older citizens self-perceptions (presumed effect), which would be a very reasonable argument. However, and very problematically, the argument could be reversed and would be equally valid; maybe older Americans are in worse health\/are more infirm\/decrepit than other older citizens and that is why there is greater bias against them in this country. I feel that particularly in the field of social and behavioral health, extreme attention needs to be given to study designs and arguments so as to ensure that cause and effect are unlikely to be confused, which may have occurred in this instance.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Very knowledgeable, caring about the learning experience of students.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy was a very effective teacher overall. One suggestion I have is to have students break off into buzz groups more often if the class gets very quiet. Sometimes there would be long pauses after questions, and there may be ways to stimulate the students more or make it more of a norm to respond actively in class.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Professor Levy is extremely caring and dedicated. It was a pleasure to take her class.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Professor Levy is great. Truly an expert in her field and teaches great lectures",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Professor Levy seemed to be very knowledgeable about this topic area and to be a very nice person. She worked hard to try to make the course interactive but this seemed forced at times because of the lecture size and the location in Winslow and the fact that students may not have been very interested in the class content (also a result of the course being a requirement.) It would be great if it could be a seminar style class or there could be less time in lecture, more in a dynamic section environment.",
