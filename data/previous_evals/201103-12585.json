   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you go in knowing that you're going to read lots and not always understand everything, it's easier. I learned a lot and definitely became much better at analyzing logical (or illogical) arguments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this. Philosophy is interesting and for some people, it might be there thing.",
    "Philosophy is perhaps the most esoteric of the three sections. The material is incredibly dense (don't be fooled by the smaller amount of reading) and the essays take a demanding level of precision. Whittle is a section leader that is deeply invested in that level of precision (to the point of nearly zoning during section). If you can get on his level of focus, then you'll find this class really rewarding.",
    "In DS, you'll either love philosophy or have to slog through it. Lectures are really helpful to understanding the works--unlike lit and H&P lectures, they work more as summaries of the argument than thesis-driven analyses--but I strongly recommend that you read as much of the texts as you can.There were mixed opinions about Professor Whittle, but I was really a fan. We'd often get bogged down in one facet of an argument, but our discussion of that one facet would be thorough and challenging and engaging even if we didn't get to anything else. With the lectures working as a synopsis of the text, I really didn't mind that at all. You'll get great paper feedback from Whittle, and he gave a great lecture this semester.One of the best things about Whittle is the extent to which he engages students in debate about an argument. Do not interpret him challenging something you say as him disagreeing with you or telling you you're wrong: he'll often play devil's advocate, and even when he's genuinely disagreeing with you he's always willing to hear your side and sometimes even come around to agreeing with you.If what you're looking for from this class is to get through the subject material efficiently, Whittle probably isn't the best match for you. But if you're interested in the process of thinking about philosophical arguments, he's not a bad choice at all.",
    "I would recommend DS Philosophy. It is an interesting and thought-provoking course that exposes students to great thinkers who contributed a great deal to both ancient and modern philosophical ideas. The large volume of reading and the weekly paper-writing are well worth the effort!",
    "DS Philosophy is great. Bruno Whittle is a good explainer but not a very good section leader.",
    "Introduction to Western Philosophical Thought. If you expect to learn paper writing skills that would apply to other humanities or social sciences, you are wrong.",
    "Whittle is great, quirky and a little crazy but great. He really knows his stuff and is really committed to teaching you how to reconstruct arguments from the prose text. He teaches you a lot of things almost without your realizing it.",
    "I liked DS Philosophy. Learned a lot. Probably the best introduction to philosophy, from what I hear from friends taking similar non-DS classes. Can be difficult with Aristotle and some of the medieval thinkers. Wish there was more structure with Whittle, but he gave his students power to take the discussion in their direction and kept his opinions out.Loved the lectures. They were crucial to my understanding of the texts.",
    "Definitely! I love DS both intellectually and socially. I think it's a great opportunity to meet a lot of nice people with similar interests and to read a ton of great books with the contributions of invested and knowledgable professors. I love the structure of DS, because you could take three similar classes outside of DS, but you couldn't arrange them so that they didn't overlap and you couldn't manufacture the support systems that exist within DS. I am a big fan!",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy, Fall Semester is a really interesting survey of Western philosophy inwhich you read philosophical texts firsthand. The lectures are really useful in explaining the works, and in section you often discuss your own interpretations of what the author was saying or the implications his argument has for the world as a whole. DS Philosophy is a great way to try out philosophy without devoting yourself to a particular subject or author for an entire semester.",
    "DS Philosophy will likely be something new to you, for this reason you may find it more enjoyable than your other sections. The ideas you will grapple with in this class are very foundational to Western thought, and engaging them in such a direct manner can be exciting. It's a wonderful feeling to feel you fully understand one of the philosopher's ideas, though this achieving this feeling will require more work than other courses. The reading is lighter than the other DS subjects, but the extra work required to comprehend the often dense or confusing works makes up for this fact."
