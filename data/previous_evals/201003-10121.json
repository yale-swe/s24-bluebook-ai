   "comments": [
    "A class about William F. Buckley. A lot of fun reading and interesting class sessions. The class ends up being a class about American political history from World War II to the 1980s.",
    "Really fun class, lots of reading, but you don't have to do it all.",
    "Take this course. It offers a perspective rare at Yale but essential to having an informed understanding of American politics, no matter what side of the spectrum you may fall on.",
    "Yes. Take this course. Great reading, papers aren't too bad, though class discussion may drag a bit.",
    "There should be more courses like this offered at Yale. William F. Buckley, Jr. is truly a fascinating character. We had some great guest speakers and Professor Felzenberg is really quite knowledgeable. He also takes an interest in getting to know his students. I enjoyed doing the reading for this class. One thing to consider might be the fact that this course ran more like a lecture than a seminar. Even though that disappointed me a little bit, I still would recommend the course.",
    "Take the class. This is my first College Seminar, and I am sooo appreciative of the opportunity to take something like this. This class needs to be a part of the general offerings, but seeing as that probably will never happen, having this outlet for the seminar is even more important.",
    "Yes! Whether you're conservative, liberal, or somewhere in between, you'll learn a lot about how the American right has evolved over the second half of the twentieth century. Buckley's influence extends farther than most people realize, and he's been important even outside the political sphere. Buckley is an interesting character, a joy to read and read about. Professor Felzenberg is also wonderful - just make sure you take advantage of your time with him - have lots of dinners with him outside of class!",
    "It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to take a class about a subject not normally covered at Yale.",
    "This course was really engaging and I learned a lot over the course of the semester. It was a great introduction to 20th century American politics and a really interesting view of a social movement, too. The modern Conservative Movement is really interesting, but also really complex, and understanding Buckley is essential to understanding the movement. In this, the course was really well taught, a lot of reading (like 200-300 pages a week), but very engaging.",
    "A solid class in the history of Conservatism. Be warned that the class dynamic may be far more politically right-wing than anywhere else at Yale. The course is quite reading-intensive, and students who do not do the reading will be clearly unprepared. Additional readings may be assigned as suddenly as a day before the class meets, and you will also be expected to attend several viewings outside of class.",
    "A survey of US politics from FDR to H.W., using the life of William F. Buckley, Jr., as the motivating narrative.Attractive for the study of Buckley--a highly entertaining and engaging character. Attractive too for a conservative perspective of US domestic affairs here at our beloved liberal institution. Beware the extreme difficulty of getting a discussion going in place of Felzenberg's monologue--which, while at times delightful, is often repetitive."
