   "comments": [
    "Great language course, you'll learn a lot without too much work.",
    "Definitely recommended. My Chinese has improved quite a bit, I do wish I took L3 though even though at first I thought it was not necessary. Teacher is extremely fair and teaches well. Structure of class is daily quiz, online discussions (3x) which means you 'go to class' on your laptop for a day. There's one oral presentation and 3 tests, and a final. The amount of effort you put in us directly correlated with your grade.",
    "YES. take this class....don't worry about the work that may seem tedious. IT'S WORTH IT. in so many ways, not just for a language credit. yale's chinese program is top notch and this class is nothing short of spectacular.",
    "Really intensive - great way to learn a lot of new characters.",
    "Overall, the class was pretty challenging but I definitely learned an extraordinary amount of Chinese. I would definitely take it to improve Chinese, but it is quite a lot of work and it meet's everyday.",
    "It's a big jump in difficulty when compared with 132, so be prepared for that going in. Otherwise, the workload is about the same as L3.",
    "I took Chinese school in elementary and middle school, but this year I learned SO MUCH more Chinese than I ever did. We learn formal and advanced grammar and vocab that is applicable especially in Chinese media. I feel more comfortable reading newspapers, online articles, or listening to the news now. I recommend it for heritage speakers, definitely. The work is constant, but it becomes routine, almost. Each unit test is important, and the final is essentially a unit-test, so the work is spread out, not concentrated like most other college courses, which helps balance out a stressful finals or midterm week.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class for those looking to improve their Chinese.",
    "After a stressful CHNS 132, I definitely feel like Xu Laoshi is easier on you this semester than in previous semesters--there are actually days when you don't have quizzes! It might also be that you understand how to study and take the tests better the second semester. The dinner at the end was a nice touch too. I also feel like my Chinese improved a lot--I can read articles online now (with a little dictionary help)! The class also seemed a little too big. Even after a year, I feel like I still don't know the names of at least half the people in the class (granted that might be my own fault).",
    "If you took 132, definitely take it. You will feel a palpable improvement.",
    "Take it, if youre willing to do the work and want to improve your vocabulary and reading skills. It was a lot of work but I definitely don't regret it. Hoping to follow up with trip to China this summer, but this class definitely set a great foundation. Great teachers with great resources.",
    "It's a continuation of 132 but I have to say it was incrementally harder. The vocabulary is more challenging because you start learning political and economical terms, and there are a lot more new words. This semester also has more activities than the last, like more advanced Listening exercises and a harder Oral part. However, Xu Laoshi really drills the lessons into you and you come out amazed at how much your Chinese has improved in such a short period of time. I would recommend taking this semester, even if it's harder\/not required--it's worth it!",
    "This class is structured the exact same way as Heritage L3. If you've taken that, you'll know exactly what to expect. Xu Laoshi is great, as always.",
    "Chinese 142 is a challenging, but very rewarding class for those who truly want to see improvement in their Chinese language capabilities. The work load is heavy, but the gratification you get from seeing your progress justifies every late night you had memorizing vocabulary!"
