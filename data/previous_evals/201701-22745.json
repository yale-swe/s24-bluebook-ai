    "-Familiarity with main debates in the field of philosophy of language -Development of skills and patterns of analytic philosophical thinking",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about semantics and pragmatics.",
    "This course offered an excellent overview of the most pressing topics in contemporary philosophy of language. Although the class (and the manuscript on which it is based) was advertised as an opportunity to consider these topics from the perspective of linguistics, there were not enough linguists in the class to foster any kind of cross-over discussion or perspective. That said, as someone who has enrolled in a few linguistics classes, I am confident in saying that our discussions highlighted some critical assumptions that semanticists and others make in their work today. Highlighting those assumptions undoubtedly helps to improve linguistic scholarship. There were also a few opportunities to consider the bearing of issues in the philosophy of language on other areas of philosophy (epistemology, etc.), and vice-versa.",
    "This course gave me a deep familiarity with a subject that I was largely unfamiliar with."

    "This course is excellent as is.",
    "The primary strength of this course was its sheer breadth. Even as someone who has studied much in this sub-discipline of philosophy, I felt I left the semester with a much better sense of the state of the field than I had going into the class. Some might argue that we covered too many topics in too little depth, but there was ample opportunity, I would say, to pursue any topic of interest either in the term paper or in office hours with the professor. One weakness of the course was that the classes after Spring Break were taught by a visiting professor, and many of the discussions were dominated by other professors in the department who were not present for the first weeks of the class. As a result, it seemed to me that there was somewhat of a lack of continuity between those classes and the rest of the course. I also thought, in general, that we could have spent more time linking the discussions we were having each week with one another.",
    "The course was structured in a logical manner, so I think the concepts built upon each other (to a certain extent). At some points the reading load was a bit heavy, which made it harder to keep up. However, the work was generally manageable, and I have little to critique regarding the class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to another undergraduate student for the following reason: for the most part (by which I mean when Professor Szabo teaches), the classroom discussions are very hard to follow, unless you are very familiar with the literature covered, and your familiarity is of a certain breadth and depth that is almost impossible for an undergrad. On the other hand, Williamson's has its own problem too -- his lectures tended to lack any substantive arguments, and get quite boring. That's been said, the part of this class that benefitted me most was Professor Szabo's detailed comments on my drafts of the term paper, or short notes in which I develop fragments of my ideas -- I found the comments immensely helpful for my writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "There is no better way to get a sense of where this sub-discipline of philosophy stands than by taking this course. Almost all major topics in the field are covered, and while we did not always cover those topics in as much depth as one might like, there were always ample resources and outlet through which to explore further. Zoltan clearly has a personal stake (or as personal a stake as one can get in philosophy) in these topics, and it was riveting to watch him butt heads with Tim Williamson when the latter visited after Spring Break. As is the case with any philosophy of language class, I felt discussion would have benefitted from having a few more practicing linguists in the room.",
    "Absolutely. However, I would caution the student to have some background in philosophy and linguistics before taking the class."
