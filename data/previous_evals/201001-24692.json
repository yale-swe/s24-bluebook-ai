   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think the only thing the student should understand is that this year, the class was more of a lecture than most seminars tend to be. I feel like I was informed as well about a single subject as I ever have been in a Yale class.",
    "Military history for half the semester and then a lot of themed weeks such as \"shell shock.\" I would not recommend this course but think that Total War should be taken instead. If you do not have a lot of experience studying military history, then you may be lost. He is not very approachable and does not put time into getting to know you. While I think the course was very interesting at points, I found myself dreading going to it at weeks. You do not know how you are doing throughout the seminar because your only real writing assignment is your final paper. I would not recommend the course.",
    "Great course, really interesting. Winter is a fountain of knowledge on this subject. Definitely take this course as your Junior seminar if you can. Reading is manageable as well.",
    "The First World War is a very strong seminar that focuses on the military aspects of the war in order to create a strong background for the second half of the semester which centers around the cultural history. It was a challenging course, not so much in terms of the reading, but because of the conversations and paper. I would recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend it for students who want a holistic view of WWI, both because of the importance and interest of the subject and because Winter is such an expert in the field.",
    "Incredible on every level. You get to work with the best professor and lean a lot of great stiff and learn a lot about history as a field in general as well as the topic, and it is a deep topic.",
    "I would recommend the course, but do not come into it with extremely high expectations. I haven't taken Total War, but I loved Professor Winter as a guest lecturer, and I think he is a better lecturer than he is a seminar leader. He is far more interested in conveying his understanding of the war than he is in facilitating student dialogue. No ideas were really pursued in class aside from his own. He is obviously really intelligent and a foremost authority on World War I, so it's worth listening to him, and he pushes you to produce a strong final paper, but don't expect this to be the most dynamic, exciting seminar you've taken.Also, he is tough. Come into the seminar with some thick skin, and put in the effort on your discussion paper so he doesn't tear you apart in front of the class.",
    "If you're interested in the first world war, this is THE class to take. You'll learn more than you ever thought you could about the military, social, cultural, national and political history of the war (a little less on the economic side, though it's addressed as well). The readings are a little voluminous (though always interesting, and not exceptionally heavy for a history seminar), and the final paper is a whopper, but on the whole the workload is not unreasonable. Prof Winter is an amazing resource on the war, as he knows just about everything and everyone and is happy to share lots of that information.A couple of notes: there is probably more serious military history in this class than almost any other at Yale, so if you're into that, this is really cool stuff. Also, if you've taken Europe in the Age of Total War, this class is a great follow-up; you don't need to have taken the lecture first, but it's more helpful than repetitive if you've already taken it (and the few repeat readings are actually a relief on the workload).If you're not interested in the war, then obviously, don't bother; leave space for people more interested instead, since the class is always over-subscrived.",
    "The class is a great opportunity to delve into a conflict that really shaped 20th century history. There is very little class discussion, which I think made for a lack of community but at the same time, it was nice to just soak in all that Prof Winter had to say. There is also very little feedback and only one smaller assignment, so it was hard to know how prepared I was as I began the final paper. That said, it is an AMAZING opportunity to learn about a formative period from a true expert.",
    "This course covers both military and cultural history, and does so with a surprisingly moderate reading load. Professor Winter is great - this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Take it if you can!"
