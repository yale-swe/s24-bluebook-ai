    "Yes, it is an interesting course with interesting literature and a good teacher.",
    "This is a selective overview of the metaphysical debates in metaethics from the 20th century up to present day. Semantic questions are avoided, while more emphasis is placed on debates between competing descriptivist views. Of particular importance is non-naturalist realism, and the course focuses heavily on its appeal (in light of other views' defects) and its problems (in light of other views' \"successes\").I would recommend this course to another student interested in contemporary metaethics, in particular in success theoretic descriptivist views. If there is no other metaethics offering, this one is at least worthwhile. However, for a more general metaethics course, something that covers a wider range of views might be preferable (though I'm not sure how feasible it would be). For the metaphysical and methodological questions, anothercourse altogether might be preferable (one addressing these topics in general, not just as they relate to metaethics)."

   "comments": [
    "It does contribute, this is because of the diverse literature",
    "This provided me with an overview of certain contemporary metaethical questions, and invited me to rethink the promise of non-naturalist realist theories. To the extent that it provided such an overview, it was helpful. But something more intensive could have been more helpful for me, given my particular interests and background."
