   "comments": [
    "This class is really great! It is so fun to write and hear comments and go back and make things better. If you love poetry and want to get better at writing it (and even reading\/analyzing it) this is a perfect class. You experiment with many styles and nuances of craft and it is a lot of fun.",
    "Highly highly recommend",
    "Definitely take this class!! I'm an engineering major, so I was for sure not the strongest writer in the class, but it's inspiring reading works from major poets and getting to write your own poems. You become a better writer from analyzing other people's poems and from learning about poetic craft. Even if you think you don't like poetry, this class will make you see things in a refreshing way!",
    "I remember when I was looking at the evaluations that one said that you get out of this class what you put into it, which I think is definitely true. I had never taken a creative writing class but always wanted to and always loved poetry. If you're in the same boat, this class is for you. We had a great class dynamic and I really needed the deadlines to force myself to write poetry. It was also really useful to force myself to revise, because before I would write something and either leave it or discard it, so it's nice to have poems that actually feel in process. I really recommend the course!",
    "135 is quite a bit of work looking back on it, but it doesn't feel that way for most of the semester. You get to read tons of poetry but it's all great, so it flies by. It's honestly just an excuse to read something fun and to write things you really want to write in the midst of all the other stuff going on. Definitely take this class, it'll teach you so much and make you want to write and read poetry as much as you possibly can.",
    "ENGL 135 is a great opportunity to improve or try out your poetic abilities through reading and workshopping. Professor Chapman is very knowledgable about writing poetry (she's a professional) and gives great feedback. Workshopping your work with the class is a great experience to see what the effect of your poems is on a broad audience, and you'll have 3 poems workshopped. Professor Chapman will also encourage you to memorize poems and do imitations to get you into the habit of working on your poetry every week.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class for anyone who has always wanted to learn more about reading or writing poetry and needs that little push. This was one of my favorite classes to attend every week - Prof Chapman is a joy to have as a teacher, and a wonderful facilitator. She really cares about her students and is sensitive and kind about the emotional content that comes out of poetry - respectful but also guides us to thinking more deeply about poetry. I came into the class not knowing how to write any poetry, and came out with a far stronger poetic voice.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "Reading Poetry for Craft is an excellent class, geared towards making poetry writing feel more accessible while raising your own bar for your writing. The balance of the course is perfect, with just the right amount of reading proportional to the writing, and the structure of the class (with workshops, discussion times, and writing activities) provides a cohesive entrance into the world of poetry writing. I very highly recommend this class-- it was a highlight of my semester.",
    "A great introduction to reading and writing poetry. Fascinating readings and enlightening discussion! Highly recommend the class",
    "Learn how to read and write poetry in an accessible way",
    "This is a wonderful course that you should take if you have any interest in poetry whatsoever (no experience necessary!), whether it is reading or writing or listening. It is extremely fair in work, but still pushes you past your comfort points in terms of analyzing and writing different types of poetry."
