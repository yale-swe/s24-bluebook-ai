   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was probably the most fun I have had in a class at Yale!",
    "At times not incredibly engaging, at times very fun and interesting. Not work intensive. Take if you're in the mood for a lot of abstract talking, creative projects, and minimal workload.",
    "Futurism is a great class, if a little unorthodox. Basically you read various Futurist texts and manifestos and then put those manifestos into practice. Reading is pretty light too, which is awesome! Dean Fabbri wants his students to be Futurists, and his course requires the creation of Futurist poetry, theater, and more. Don\u2019t be intimidated, however, because Dean Fabbri is enthusiastic about all of his students\u2019 efforts and is very encouraging. If you really hate creative projects, though, do not take this class.",
    "Professor Fabbri is splendid, as is this course. In Futurism, we learn by doing, by writing poetry (words in freedom), performing theater, and through midterm and final projects that ranged from book-making to performance art and cooking to painting. If you want to study any movement in depth, this is a great one and never feels repetitive or dull.",
    "Take it if you get in, passionately",
    "This is a great course! Take it if you're willing to step outside of your comfort zone, to think in different ways and to engage with a crazy, avant grade movement in all its manifestations.",
    "Definitely, if you're interested in the history of art or how people were beginning to change the way they processed the things they saw at the beginning of the last century.",
    "This class is definitely an acquired taste. Shop it and see if you like Dean Fabbri's teaching style. Also make sure you like doing creative projects!",
    "Crazy class. Take it and be prepared to learn a lot while having a great time. The readings are interesting and not too long, and the assignments are really fun and a great way to get involved in Futurism. Totally different from any other seminar I have taken at Yale-- so worth it!!"
