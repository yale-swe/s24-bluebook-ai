    "The faculty, trip planning and actual field trips",
    "Students' presentation, field trip, and the leadership from students in organizing the field trip.",
    "The field trips were great, and Professor Oliver does an amazing job of connecting students with leaders across many fields. The class format of student lectures was also great - getting other views of a leadership-related subject was very interesting.",
    "Meeting leaders in New York and Washington D.C. And, interacting with fellow classmates.",
    "Field trips!",
    "The best parts of this course are the field trips and the student presentations. The field trips to New York City and Washington D.C. allowed students to meet with leaders in the places that they work. This turned out to be a very powerful experience! The leaders' stories and insights were very personal, which made them all the more meaningful. The leaders also represented a broad array of levels and organizations, and they each genuinely seemed to enjoy speaking with us about their journeys. The student presentations were also very interesting. The topics were broad, which allowed each student to steer the topic in a direction that spoke to his or her personal experiences or ambitions.",

It provides a really great space to talk about the challenges and opportunities that we will all face as we leave school and re-enter the workforce... and as we progress through our careers. Also, this class requires an average amount of work, with one substantial (but essential!) 3-day field trip to D.C.",
