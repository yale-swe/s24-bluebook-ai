   "comments": [
    "Probably not. A lot of great readings--especially Joyce--but too much secondary literature. This class assigned essays about Ulysses without even assigning all of Ulysses. That's not good. Professor Cleary lectures quite a lot, which is annoying, but less annoying than it might normally be, because this class somehow attracted lots of people who liked to say phrases like \"heteronomous structural ideals.\" (I swear that's a direct quote. Not made up.) If you're reading Joyce, can't you just admire that you're reading one of the greatest things ever written? Don't you just feel sorry for the poor bastard sometimes? Anyway, if you like that sort of thing--lots of Marxist interpretations, feminist interpretations, colonial interpretations and the like--then this class is good. I actually really liked Professor Cleary. He's smart and pretty engaged and a nice guy. But the class wasn't at all what I was expecting, and that was disappointing. At times there were good conversations, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they were the norm.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.It has a lot of reading but a very reasonable amount of writing.However, the course is lecture heavy so I would not recommend to a student interested in an entirely discussion based class.I would also caution students that the course not only focuses on novels, but also poetry and plays so be prepared for varied readings.",
    "A survey of the work of some of the most prominent revival authors. Heavy on history, thanks to mini-lectures from Professor Cleary and presentations by individual students at each class meeting. They drag on sometimes at the expense of class discussion, which always seemed to center on the same five students. Maybe that was their fault?Wonderful reading list, and very manageable and even enjoyable writing assignments. Great course if you're interested in Irish history, politics or literature.",
    "ENGL 314 is a great class that combines literary analysis, history and theory in complex and engaging ways. The work load is very heavy, but if you have the time to put into it you will learn a lot about the literary period as well as different forms of reading and argument. Professor Cleary is a great teacher and incredibly knowledgeable.",
    "Pretty great class. Authors are great, and you really really feel immersed in the era by the end. The authors become real people and their work resonates. The historical period is fleshed out for you and you see how everyone responds in their own way. It was fantastic. Take it, do the work, do the readings, and come away with a better understanding of the development of the modern aesthetic in Ireland.",
    "Not only an overview of the authors of the Irish Literary Revival, but also a lesson in history and colonial studies. Everything, however, is ultimately in service to the writing of the Irish authors, from Wilde to Beckett. I would definitely recommend this class to another student - the reading is terrific.",
    "I would highly recommend Engl 314 to anyone with an interest in Ireland or great Irish authors \u0097 James Joyce, Oscar Wilde, etc. The reading list for this course is fantastic, and Professor Cleary is a wonderful instructor. But do be prepared for a fair amount of lecturing, for a seminar.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because the reading list is so fabulous.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The reading is certainly a nice red apple that you just want to take a bite out of despite this peer review and regardless of the consequences. Don't. There is no fortunate fall. The seminar is conducted like an awkward lecture and, unlike a lecture, he pauses with ten minutes left and just sits there, expecting a great discussion to runneth over. Speaking of running over, he held us for ten additional minutes each class. The professor is really, really nice and offers comprehensive feedback on your paper (you only write one), but is not a good discussion leader. Don't take a seminar that doesn't have a good discussion leader.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student-- with a few caveats. It's definitely a course for English majors, and there's a lot of reading, including a hefty volume of criticism, but the literature is all wonderful and never drags. Prof. Cleary is a wonderful discussion leader and a very understanding and approachable professor. His lectures can be dense, but they really enrich the texts, and after a semester with him, you'll have an incredible contextualized understanding of one of the most fascinating periods in English literature. But because of the workload, you have to be really interested in English, I would imagine, to get something out of the class."
