   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommended. Go to class and you will get more out of it.",
    "alright class--not as interesting as it seems.",
    "Fun, food, nutrition (modern and ancient).Unfortunately, people take the course as a gut. Professor Grimm spots these people early on though and they are very clearly not in her good graces. Be there for the right reasons or you'll have a miserable semester!",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course to people who are either interested in classical civilization, or are interested in food and diet. The material covers both topics and is interesting. You don't need a strong classical background to understand the material, so if you're looking to dip your foot into the ancient world, this is a great place to start.",
    "This is a great class to take if you're interested in food. You get to do a cool research paper in the end about whatever you want, allowing for fun and extended research. You also learn a lot about the time period and ancient Greece and Rome.",
    "If interested either in food or in ancient civilisations, it is worth taking. it is an in depth exploration of the different foodstuffs and beverages in the ancient world, focusing on their production and consumption, as well as philosophical attitudes towards food.",
    "I loved this course, but you'll only enjoy it if you're actually into food and cooking. If you're in it for free food or you think it'll be a gut, you'll be disappointed. Food only came a couple times toward the end of the semester, and a sizable midterm and a 15-20 page final paper are no joke. If you're into it, you'll love it.",
    "This is a wonderful class, offering you the chance to approach this period from an unusual angle (and with regular snacks and tastings!). The readings do feel disorganised at times, as you don't really know what you're meant to be reading, but other than that, the workload is fair - a take-home midterm and a final research paper and presentation on a topic of your choosing. Overall, this is quite a relaxed, but fascinating class, made all the better by Professor Grimm's charm and enthusiasm.",
    "It was a course with some readings every week, even though most people didn't do them. Lots of work for midterm and final paper, other than that it was pretty good.",
    "One take home midterm and a paper. Not a lot of work, but make sure to put the effort into the assignments and write well. Also, come prepared to contribute to class discussion.",
    "Very detailed class, focused on ancient Greek and Roman life, habits, culture and how food played integral roles within this.. Readings were comprehensive and relevant\/helpful in understanding course material. Professor is no nonsense but extremely nice and personal (learning the names of everyone in the class), and is an expert at what she teaches. Enjoyed seeing through the eyes of ancient historians\/philosophers of that era. Not an intense class, but you will seriously get more out of it if you do the readings, and especially get to know Professor Grimm,who is absolutely wonderful and a delight to have had taught as a professor. Know how to time manage for your final paper and project and you'll be fine."
