   "comments": [
    "Greater skill in math reasoning, logistics. Connected back to my high school math",
    "How to construct\/multiply matrices, some basic probability, game theory. Going into the class, I really did not think I would get much out of it because of the remedial math, but I was surprised to find that a lot of what we did was pretty applicable to the intermediate microeconomics course I was taking.",
    "I learned a good amount about matrices and probability in this class. I also slightly learned how to use gephy.",
    "I learned almost nothing in this course. As a non-math oriented student, I signed up because I thought that it would be an interesting and applicable subject alongside fulfilling my requirement, but the way in which it was taught was taught made no effort to be it either of these things. I suppose I learned the absolute basics about the way networks function, but I could have learned so, so much more if this class had been better taught.",
    "How to network and use Gephy.",
    "Statistics. Probability. Understanding of Networks",
    "I certainly learned that connections between things can tell a lot about how something is preforming and is also helpful in making predictions.",
    "I learned more about matrices and applications of networks.",
    "I learned many different math skills.",
    "Matrices and probability",
    "Learned some interesting concepts regarding networks.",
    "I learned about using Excel and Gephi; I also learned new information about probability and game theory operations.",
    "Learned about network theory",
    "Understanding pagerank and eigenvalues was very interesting. The actual evaluative parts of the course, such as homeworks and exams, were highly disappointing. They were like 9th grade level probability questions and very, very simple matrix multiplication.",
    "I became much more comfortable and familiar with mathematical equations used to identify and predict future behaviors and patterns of networks.",
    "Knowledge on networks"

   "comments": [
    "This course could be taught a lot better. The instructors assumed that the class knew a lot of information that they hadn't which made it very hard to follow along. The lectures in class went very fast even when questions were asked.",
    "The organisation of the course is good - all slides are posted online before lecture. Makes it very easy to go back over slides you didnt understand and try to compute all the information.",
    "I know that the psets were short and for the most part fairly simple, but I wish the numbers would work out a little bit easier. It's much easier to understand\/learn new concepts with whole numbers rather than repeating decimals. I also wish there were more examples to prepare for the midterm\/final with because some of the questions on both caught me a little off guard (that is referring more to the final).",
    "I had to somewhat teach myself how to do a lot of the homework problems. I think the professor should make sure the class is still on track and keeping up with her while shes teaching in the lectures.",
    "This course was very poorly taught the professor did not seem to be impassioned about the subject, made lectures incredibly tedious, boring, and hard to follow, and didn't seem to grasp that most of the students in her class were beginners in the subject. She assumed that we already were able to make complex mathematical connections that were above the level required to take the class. There was little to no effort made to make the course relevant to the world we live in, or to engage students and help them to fully understand the material. The course could be improved by hiring a new professor or teaching this one how to work with students instead of just talking at them while writing out extremely confusing demonstrations on the board. Although she was a nice woman, the professor didn't seem excited to teach the class in the slightest, and it showed.",
    "The teaching could be more engaging.",
    "Strengths: final project as a tool to pull together semester's lessons Weaknesses: lectures were sometimes difficult to follow",
    "The course could have more outside resources, like a textbook with more explanations and practice problems.",
    "I could have done better with game theory.",
    "I felt that the lecture material did not provide enough examples and was not connected to the homework enough.",
    "Could be better organized",
    "See above",
    "I thought the strengths was the subject matter and the dedication of the professor and teaching fellows to make themselves available to give additional explanations and examples to the students. A possible improvement would be the ability to add sections to the course.",
    "Doing more practice with the math and the technology"

   "comments": [
    "No because I constantly felt like I was confused even though I went to office hours every week, sometimes even twice a week. The lectures were not very engaging and were hard to follow.",
    "Yes I would",
    "Yes. It's a relatively easy class with a light workload and for the small amount of people who show up to every lecture, you actually get something out of it.",
    "Yes Id recommend this course to others if they are interested in learning how people would act in given situations (game theory). Its a good QR credit.",
    "Absolutely not. It was incredibly boring and a waste of my time.",
    "No",
    "No, it wasn't very exciting.",
    "Yes definitely! Interesting material and the project is great. Tests and problem sets are fair.",
    "Yes, gives me a different insight on a mathematics based course.",
    "Yes",
    "Very low workload. If you bother going to class and studying practice tests, you should be fine.",
    "Perhaps. It wasn't the most interesting in terms of lecture, but completing the homework was not too difficult and, in fact, satisfying because I was doing math I hadn't done before.",
    "It's still pretty much a gut, a good senior year class if you are a STEM major",
    "No. Could distill my takeaways from the course into a 10-minute lecture. Lectures were a huge waste of time. The student quality was embarrassing for Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to non-math majors such as history, political science, and sociology. All of the equations learned were shown to have real world implications in a variety of different fields of study. The final project which is worth 40% of your total grade provides students with an excellent opportunity to apply what they learned to a topic of special interest to them.",
    "yes it is a good QR credit"
