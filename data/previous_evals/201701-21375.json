   "comments": [
    "Warner is an extremely close reader, great at drawing out themes I would definitely not have otherwise noticed.",
    "My essay-writing improved considerably over the course of the semester. Dr. Warner helped me understand how to create and develop an original analytical argument in my essays.",
    "This course exposed me to entirely new ways of reading and writing. I learned how to properly do a close reading and how to incorporate literary criticism and research into an essay, neither of which I had done before. Additionally, this course helped me to understand the importance of having an original, arguable idea when starting an essay. I also became a more attentive, conscientious reader, which was imperative in order to contribute to the high level of in-class discussion.",
    "Class discussion is the heaviest focus of this course - each class meeting provides the opportunity to engage in meaningful conversation about some tough texts. Through several papers, the class helps tighten up analytical writing and pushes you to construct an original argument that adds to intellectual discussion about the works. Also, queer themes run through the literature - very interesting and definitely a perspective I did not expect.",
    "You learn how to write an analytic English paper step by step. The assignments are set up especially well to teach you this skill."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses, normal and good course, Warner made it great.",
    "Sometimes the amount of reading is intense, but you really do learn a lot if you actually do it. Dr. Warner's teaching is masterful, and again if you do the reading you can really learn a lot.",
    "This course had no weakness. Books, essays, everything was awesome.",
    "One strength of this course is definitely its texts; the list on the syllabus is so varied, in form and in time period. It was engaging to switch from such different texts (all important to American literature) week to week. I did find the reading load sometimes to be a lot to handle in the allotted time, but I am grateful in hindsight for the course's quick pace because we covered so many interesting texts.",
    "Strengths include the emphasis on class discussion and the intellectual challenge from reading difficult selections from American literature. I wish we could have more feedback from writing assignments. I would have loved to read everyone else's reading responses - maybe on a class blog? Feedback is always nice, and this course did not have much of it.",
    "The progression of assignments is great. As a non-English major it was challenging, but totally accessible. Professor Warner is great. Reading was super enjoyable. A lot of freshmen, though, some of whom don't know how to participate in a seminar yet."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Close reading, great texts, you leave well-read and a better writer.",
    "I took this course to get a WR credit without having to take ENGL 114 or 120 because I heard those tend to be taught by TFs (though I hear they are good classes). I was very lucky to get Dr. Warner's section; he is a wonderful teacher. I think the other sections of 127 are usually taught by TFs.",
    "Take 127 and take it with Prof Warner.",
    "I would warn other students about the volume of work, but I would highly recommend the course for the books you cover, books so important to our past and present as a country, and books I feel every Yale student should read. I would recommend it also to any student looking to challenge themselves with different spins on the traditional essay.",
    "Absolutely! If you want to not only read some of the greatest American works of all time but also improve your analytical skills, this is the course for you.",
    "Absolutely. This class is a great intro course and totally accessible to non-English majors. Prof Warner is great and the reading is super enjoyable."
