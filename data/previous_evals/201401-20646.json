    "A great course on the literature surrounding equality. It is the perfect combination of economic analysis and philosophy.",
    "If you are interested in distributive justice this is a great course. It really challenged my beliefs and made me think about philosophical issues in a new way (I'm an econ major but took DS). That said, it is much more like a lecture than a traditional Yale seminar. 3 psets that were pretty fair (about the same level of an intermediate micro pset) and then 3 essays that had high expectations. If you aren't moderately comfortable with both psets and essays that require philosophical arguments, then I would advise against this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students, but they should know that it is less of a seminar and more similar to a mini-lecture.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. I think it really complemented well my previous education in theories of equality, distributive justice, as well as my previous courses in economics. Professor Roemer is brilliant: he presents a very elegant argument for equality that integrates economics and political philosophy. He's also been very helpful with problem sets and papers. Workload is pretty substantive, so to fully appreciate the course, do not take it in a really busy semester.",
    "TBH I probably wouldn't recommend talking this class. It's ok, but the grading is pretty harsh and maybe not worth it. The second half of the class is very interesting though.",
    "The most important economics class you will take in your life. It made me rethink my entire life - the privileges I have enjoyed and my engagement with society.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Roemer treats a seminar as a lecture. He emails you his lecture notes before class, and you just read along as he monologues. Then, although the class is under 20 people, he has Yale seniors grade your work. So if you go to him to discuss an assignment, he can't do anything about your assessment. Once I went and he agreed that I was right and the graders were unfair; then he said \"your point makes sense, but what can I do -- I didn't read these papers.\" This was a distribution requirement for EP&E, but I decided to keep it as Cr\/D\/F because I did not trust the graders or Roemer. (I'm not bitter because I got bad grades; I actually did well, but this level of laziness is UNHEARD of on campus. Every seminar leader grades his students' work and does more than lecture during class.) The only things going for this class were: 1) Roemer didn't suffer fools in class and 2) he seemed invested in the topic, at least, even if he couldn't care less about this particular class."
