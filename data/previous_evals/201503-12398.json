    "Math 380 is a great course; the first about 10 weeks or so were nothing amazing (at least in my opinion) but you will learn so much material that you need to know to take other advanced math courses. And then the last few weeks of the course will blow your mind, once you prove the strong form of the Nullstellensatz or learn some dimension theory.",
    "a discipline with a kind of deadly elegance to it.",
    "This course will throw a lot of material at you, but the expectations are realistic. That's not to say the course is easy, but it's fair. It goes through all of Atiyah-Macdonald at any cost, with a large fraction of the exercises assigned. The homeworks are never taken up, but you'll have to do most of them if you want to keep up.",
    "This is a canonical course in commutative algebra that is a must for any math major.",
    "Math 380 is a great course, although the emphasis on exams can somewhat detract from your appreciation and understanding of the material. It feels strange to spend 15+ hours a week doing problems only to switch to essentially memorizing propositions and proofs for the exams, which emphasize quick recall over the ability to come up with a proof on the spot. Other than that, I definitely feel like I understand algebra far better now than I did before taking the course, and I have a much deeper appreciation for the links to algebraic geometry. Sam did a really great job of giving intuition and motivation for even the most abstract concepts.",
    "Take it only if you are dedicated math major, especially if you are interested in Number theory (algebraic, not analytic), or want to learn more about rings and modules. There were a few physics majors in the class, but I don't think they benefited much from the class (apart from the struggling on the psets which strengthens the character).",
    "Math 380 technically refers to the fall semester of the modern algebra sequence (what you can take after basic abstract algebra & Galois theory), but the order between commutative and noncommutative is not always the same, so check on that! For 2015 fall, 380 was actually commutative algebra, the text used is Atiyah and Macdonald, one of the classic texts. With Sam Payne, the course is quite excellent. He really tries to motivate the algebra from a geometric perspective, though this is still quite an abstract intuition to start from. Try hard to follow it from the start, as even though seeing the geometric picture is not necessary to get the algebra, it's a lot better for the algebraic and geometric stories to advance in tandem. The class gives a lot of homework - all exercises from A&M, about 75% of the book roughly estimating. If you're able to keep up with them, you'll truly have a mastery over the basics of commutative algebra. If you can't, which was the case for me, you'll still learn a lot, but maybe only 50% of what was actually available to you. Be prepared to give this class a lot of your time, but there's a really beautiful theory that results!",
    "Graduate level commutative algebra.",
    "The course provides a solid introduction to commutative algebra, which is common ground underlying algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. The textbook (Atiyah & MacDonald) is extremely concise, and one must spend much time working through the many exercises in order to really get a handle on the material. I feel that Sam is a very thoughtful instructor. I always appreciated his lectures, especially his insightful perspectives on and context for the material. He expects hard work, and he offers consistent, valuable support and guidance along the way."
