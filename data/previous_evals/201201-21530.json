    "FREN 151 with Mme Charney is a great class. Mme Charney is super nice, and she's always willing to keep up the discussion if you don't want to. This class is good practice to hone grammar skills as well.",
    "No",
    "FREN151 helps students to solidify their proficiency in French, using numerous (rather depressing) texts and (rather strange) films to help with this proficiency. Focus is nicely balanced between grammar, speaking, writing, and vocabulary.",
    "A good course--more work than you might expect, but manageable. I found it improved my writing much more than my speaking."
