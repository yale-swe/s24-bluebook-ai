   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, because it helps one think critically not only about ethnographic writing, but about all kinds of representation. Helpful for anthropologists, sociologists, historians, American Studies, etc.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in doing ethnography and has an interest in literary theory.",
    "I took the course mainly because I was hoping to pick up some skills and experience in reading ethnographies and engaging with social scientific literature in general. I would say that this was probably not the goal of the class and that it was my mistake. I feel that the intense dose of theory was probably more helpful to someone who would like to know how far from the conventional methods of writing one can go in one's own work than it was for anyone interested in figuring out what ethnographies--even experimental ethnographies--actually do.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to anyone--especially anyone in any field interested in writing about people and life. It was a reading and discussion course and also a thinking course. Kate is an excellent instructor and picked out an assortment of really thought provoking texts that I can go back to over and over again and still find something new and helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in doing ethnography and anyone who believes that the choices one makes in representation and writing (in any field) have real consequences. I am confident this class will make me a better writer and more sensitive reader.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in not only ethnography, but the politics of writing and representation."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me to be more thoughtful about issues of representation. It also helped me become more comfortable with theory and literary criticism. I particularly appreciated the interdisciplinary focus of this course, and its investment in challenging the boundaries of who can claim to do ethnography, as well as the boundaries of ethnography and literature. A wonderful, wonderful course.",
    "I found this course more intellectually interesting than truly helpful to my work, but this was certainly not the fault of the course.",
    "I don't think I can adequately answer this---but basically it helped me through a crisis. The course helped me recognize a freedom, focus, and responsibility in and for my work.",
    "This course will be integral to my dissertation and research, both in methodology and writing. It also deepened my appreciation for the place of ethnography within my discipline and within the academy more broadly."
