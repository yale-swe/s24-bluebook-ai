    "The weekly tests were a lot and weren't very conducive to learning. Otherwise, the class was good.",
    "Great course! Maybe could benefit from mandatory speaking tables. During my time at Yale, I also took L1-L3 Italian. We were required to attend a table once every month. I found the tables extremely helpful for carrying a basic conversation in Italian. Also, I think one test every 2 weeks would be sufficient. A test per week did not allow enough time for concepts to sink in, and many students found it stressful to cram for a test every Monday.",
    "I thought that the french tests seemed a little excessive and hard to manage when other tests were the same night.",
    "I learned a lot of French and I owe that to my amazing teacher Julie Hugonny. She was so unbelievably chill and such a patient but firm teacher. The tests every week were kind of dreadful but I guess they kept me in shape."

    "Yes. Youll learn a lot. Be warned though that there is an at times overwhelming amount of homework and the tests every week are annoying. Your enjoyment of the course depends a lot on who you take it with."
