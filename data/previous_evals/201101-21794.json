    "When else are you going to be in an Italian play?",
    "Yes, I would, but as long as they are fully aware of how unbalanced the workload is: extremely, extremely heavy at the end. I'm telling you, this is one of the most demanding classes I've EVER taken at Yale. Just keep that in mind. But if you put the work in, you WILL reap the rewards... it's fun!",
    "This class is unlike any other you'll take at Yale. You read a play by Luigi Pirandello \u0097 this year it was Enrico IV, about a man who falls off his horse and hits his head and thinks he's king Henry IV from the year 1077 \u0097 and then divide up the roles and put on a full-scale production by the end of the semester. Along the way, you learn how to analyze a piece of Italian literature and how to memorize and perform huge monologues in Italian. Best of all, you get to be really tight with the 10 or so other people in the class with you. This class improved my language ability but by FAR the best part was the people. The professor, the TA (Carol Chiodo this year) and the other students were just great. Yes, the work picks up in the last week of classes when suddenly you have to scramble to pull the production together, but it's worth it at the end.",
    "Do this class. It's really hard but a lot of fun.",
    "Pirandello is certainly the most unique class I've taken at Yale. The course description describes it pretty well--you'll read the play, then rehearse and perform it. Along the way, you'll do a few quick assignments, but the vast majority of the work is the rehearsals after spring break. If you have a big part, memorizing lines outside of rehearsal will be the biggest part of the time commitment; otherwise, attending rehearsals takes 2hr\/week until the last week, when you'll have 3 hour rehearsals every night. (Don't plan to have anything else big for other classes that week!) You'll also be responsible for the logistical\/production aspects, which can be both interesting and annoying.Now, as for my recommendation...this is a tough one. On the one hand, I look back on the class as having been a really great experience where I got to see all our work come together with a great class of people. On the other hand...\"La Monica\" is different from much of the Italian department. She's not a warm person, and she can be downright mean at times. You've been warned. However, all in all, I still think I'd do it again because of the class of people I got to work with and how fun it was in the end.",
    "Yes, take this course. You don't need to be an Italian major or even be that good at Italian. By the end of the course, your Italian will have improved, no matter what level you enter as!",
    "It's a nice fifth course, and it's a good course to take if you want to do Italian but don't want to study really old literature. It's a fun experience if you get along with the people in the class, even if you don't know them before the semester starts. There's not very much busy work (only a little), you'll get to really use Italian on an everyday basis, and Enrico IV is a FASCINATING play.",
    "Fun, but not overly fun"
