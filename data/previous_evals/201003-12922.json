    "I highly recommend going this route towards the senior essay requirement if you have done some of the work for it ahead of time. Do not wait until the semester of to start thinking about your thesis. Start brainstorming early and do as much research as you can the summer before - the semester is a lot shorter than you think and you have to do a lot of legwork if you want to do well.",
    "If you are willing to be self-directed, take this course. You get as much as you put into it. Make sure that you have a topic that will really pull you along through the semester. Without one, it might be better to write your essay in a seminar."
