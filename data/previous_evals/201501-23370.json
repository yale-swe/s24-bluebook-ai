   "comments": [
    "This is a great class, in which the amount of work you put in is almost exactly proportional to the reward you get from it. Professor Jones' feedback is thoughtful, generous and encouraging. The class atmosphere was also great: critical without the bitter tears of resentment.",
    "Wonderful.",
    "This is a great workshop class for higher-level fiction. Professor Jones is the best, really funny and smart and she cares about the work and the students.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class and would not have asked for a better first experience with Advanced Fiction. The professor was approachable and I did not hesitate to ask questions or for guidance. She also had a great sense of humor and I kept a lot of things in my memory because of how she said them. The beginning of the class is characterized by manageable writing exercises weekly. And then most of the rest of the class involves reading other classmates' work and writing a short letter to them on what you loved about their essays, and what you thought could be improved. I loved that although we were a class of twelve, I felt like Professor Nalini had a good sense of who I was as a writer and as a student",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you get in, take it you'd be an idiot not to. This class was one of my favorite classes ever at Yale. You'll be surrounded by classmates who are intelligent and committed to good fiction and led by a professor who's all the more intelligent, HILARIOUS, and committed to good fiction. Nalini is an excellent discussion leader, as well as an excellent critic, and will give you very keen and insightful feedback on your work. She'll also teach you a lot about fiction and writing and tell you to take risks and push your boundaries. The class is also intense in a good way. Because you're expected to turn in two short stories (that are anywhere between 10 to 20 pages long) that you'll present to the whole class and to Nalini, you'll put in so much work to your stories and get a lot out of doing so + the actual workshop where you'll get really detailed feedback. I've learned so much about fiction and writing and don't think I would have had it not been for this class. Take this class!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their fiction writing. I would recommend it to anyone who might be hesitant about creative writing but enjoys workshop settings.",
    "Among the different advanced workshops offered, I would definitely recommend this one. It does not stray in any significant way from the typical creative writing class, but it was very well managed, and Professor Jones is a fantastic person to get to know! I would recommend this class just for the opportunity to work with her.",
    "You'll spend the semester reading other people's work and coming up with two stories of your own. Prof. Jones is delightful and funny, and she'll make the class seem like a safe space to try something new. The class is as much work as you put into it, so if you spend time on your stories, you could turn out something great; if you don't, it can still be a good time. You'll focus on character development in the discussions, but you also have the freedom to take the conversation wherever you want it to go."
