    "Ornithology is a great class if you're a nonmajor looking for a Sc credit but don't want to waste time on a gut class. It covers a whole range of topics related to birds - Evolution, Feathers, Feathers, Physiology, Neurobiology, Migration, Songs, Reproduction, Conservation, etc - and dabbles in a whole range of the sciences, from chemistry to physics to biology. I came into the class with no science knowledge beyond AP Bio and AP Chem, and that was more than enough for me to understand everything that was taught in the class.It's not the easiest science class by any means. You have to attend lecture to do well because for many subjects, he goes into more depth than the book does. It's pretty far up Science Hill and early in the morning so you really have to be committed to show up and do well. There are two midterms, a final, and a research paper, and while they're all manageable, none are too easy either.Overall, I would recommend the class because Prum is a great professor who lectures well (he always kept me awake and alert even at 9:20am) and the subject is really really interesting. It's not the easiest way to get a Sc credit but it's easy to commit to it and show up to class because the lectures are good. You don't need to take the lab to get a lot out of the class - I didn't take it - although if you do decide to take it, I think that's worth your time as well.",
    "Interesting class (especially if your grandma is a birdwatcher), with information that's specific to birds but can also inform you about the larger topic of E& EB.I definitely recommend taking this class, for science majors and non-science majors alike (just know that you shouldn't take it as a gut class - I'm recommending it because it's very interesting and engaging).",
    "Yes! Take this course! I decided to take this course at the last possible minute because a friend recommended it to me the night before I really had to decide. This class is different from any other science course at Yale, mostly because it incorporates everything from physics to psychology to enhance your knowledge of birds. Even if you don't think you're a bird person, take this class. You really won't regret it.",
    "This is one of the best classes you can take at Yale. Great for non-science majors too, if you need a Sc credit. You will want to attend every lecture, since the content is fascinating and the professor completely engaging.",
    "You don't learn to identify different birds. That's what the lab is for. You learn about general evolutionary and behavioral studies of birds. Why they do what they do, and how they do what they do. It's really cool stuff. The big paper at the end is a pain, but it forces you to learn a lot about a certain topic. The tests are hard, but if you study well, you'll do well. Take it. it'll change the way you see pigeons on the street.",
    "This is a truly fantastic course, one you could only find at Yale. Prum is at the top of his field, and yet finds a way to make the information interesting and accessible to both science and non-science majors. For anyone who has ever had any interest in birds or biology, this class is a must. Just make sure you start your paper before reading week!",
    "A real science course for non-science majors. Phenomenal. Definiately not a gut, but the golden standard for what science classes for non-majors should look like. Recommend it without reservation. Just be prepared to put in the study hours.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "A remarkably good course for a none science major to take. Through birds it manages to go into many different areas of science. I really got into the course and found myself fascinated by the topics presented and the examples given. It should be said that the tests are quite difficult and graded harshly without much leniency for the wrong word or a missing phrase. Also, there is a noticeable difference between people taking the lab and those not taking the lab and for those not taking the lab it feels like you are at a disadvantage. All the same, yes, absolutely.",
    "Ornithology is a great class; the material is fascinating and Prum is an amazing lecturer in addition to being a genius and leading researcher in the field. The workload is not bad, and if you're looking for a science credit this is a much more interesting and engaging way to do it. But you should really take the lab if you want to get the full experience. The lab adds so much to your knowledge. Take the lab.",
    "Great course. You get to learn everything there is to know about birds. Prum is fantastic. Take it!, it's worth getting up early.",
    "I would definitely recommend Ornithology. I thought that the material was very manageable and interesting, perhaps somewhat challenging for a non-science major, but quite refreshing and different from other science classes for a science major.",
    "Fantastic, in-depth survey of all things birds. Prum is one of the best speakers I've seen at Yale, and his expertise truly comes across both in his enthusiasm and in his ability to effortlessly explain even the most complex of topics. The course is not so much a \"birding\" course as it is about the biology and evolution of avian life. I enjoyed dealing with dinosaurs in the course, which was something I hadn't studied really since the 3rd grade.",
    "For anyone with a real interest in life and natural biology. Good for non-science majors with a passion for the topic and neat for eeb majors as well. Definitely would recommend!",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "Definitely--it's a great way to fill the SC requirement, and the tests are very reasonable (though you have to study). The paper is fun, just give yourself about a week for the research\/writing. As a humanities student, it was a really refreshing, engaging course. Prof Prum is wonderful!",
    "Absolutely. It's interdisciplinary and the material is just fascinating.",
    "Ornithology is a great course that serves as a science credit in an offbeat field. It's not easy and classes are at 9:20 on science hill (3 days a week!) but you come out with a much more appreciative outlook on the doings of our feathered friends--but actually. It is not an ecology course (that's what the lab is for if you have the time), but you will learn how birds fly, how they sing, and how birds are really dinosaurs to name a few. If you can wake up, take it. Prof Prum is also sooo good.",
    "This is a fun and rewarding class, and I feel like I know a lot about birds. But they are also very hard graders. The things that I had going against me were the 9:20 AM time (if you get there late you miss out on lots of information, and most people I know had pretty incompletely notes because it's hard to stay awake in class), the fact that I was not in the lab and therefore was at a disadvantage in knowledge even though the exams are the same for both lab and non-lab students, and the fact that my senior thesis and our second exam were due the same day this semester. I also was unfamiliar with playing the science exam game, where you have to give answers that pretty much fit an answer key, and if you fall short you get points off. It's really easy to lose points on the exam.",
    "A really interesting course if one is interested in the subject. A very thorough overview of avian anatomy, physiology, life history, ecology, etc. It's not worth pursuing this course \"just for the science credit.\"Not a lot of work (just sparse chapter reading) during the body of the course. However, make sure to take accurate notes in order to study for the 2 mid-terms and final. Also, the term paper is lengthy.Also, I was fortunate enough to take the lab but I can't really see how one could get a lot out of this course without it.In the context of the lecture course only, Professor Prum is clearly a knowledgeable, enthusiastic teacher. However, he has a tendency to be disorganized and generally moves too quickly through the material. Given that his PPT slide's are mostly pictures, it is often difficult to study the information adequate for the exam considering that Prum moves through the information relatively quickly.",
    "Very good. I'm a non-science major who likes bio and took the class to mix up my schedule (how many humanities seminars can you take in one term without offing yourself), and it was great. Learned a lot, even taking it Credit\/D.If you make it to lecture most of the time, you will learn a lot; otherwise you will learn nothing, because it is really just the lecture (reading the book is only supplemental--consider buying an older edition, which I got for $10 instead of $80 for the new one).The paper is not that hard. It's 10 pages, but you can just do a lit review and it just didn't take up that much time in my semester. Tests are also thoroughly reasonable.",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Prum is a great lecturer and you will learn a lot about birds that is fun and interesting. It's just three exams and a final paper, and if you go to the lectures (probably a sticking point for most people as they are early in the morning on MWF) you will have no problems on the exam. If you talk to Professor Prum about the paper, that shouldn't be a problem either.This is a great science credit for non-science majors, and it doesn't feel dumbed down like many non-science major courses do."
