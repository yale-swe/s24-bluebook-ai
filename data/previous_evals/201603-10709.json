   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the farm bill and agriculture in the United States. My writing improved through workshops and talking about writing techniques in class. Overall, I became much more aware of the food crisis in this country.",
    "I learned how to properly write a scholarly research essay, and learned about America's agricultural system.",
    "- Detailed knowledge about the Farm Bill, sustainable agriculture and so on - Academic writing",
    "I learned to better understand the resources that are available in the english department. I also learned how to better write essays, especially what is expected in revision.",
    "I learned how to write a proper paper and how to conduct research promptly.",
    "I think my writing did get better and I understand now the huge field of food.",
    "Dr. Stuart did a tremendous job in revealing how our food is not simply just grown on farms, but impacted by many other factors.",
    "I learned about the expectations of a Yale English course. I was challenged to read lots of material, absorb it, and discuss it and write about it. It taught me to speak up and that hard work was necessary for success.",
    "Since I had not written any of my papers for school in English before, this course was highly valuable for me in acquiring more writing skills and learning how to write in an American style. I was also very interested in the topic of the American agriculture system and its effect on the whole world. The course showed me how essential it is for everyone to be informed about this topic!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the learning curve decreased throughout the course. It seemed like after the first month, we were learning significantly less about the farm bill each day. However, in that first month the learning was excellent.",
    "Strengths - Students learn relevant and detailed content, from different readings and perspectives - Fun e.g. ugly christmas sweater lesson, guest speaker - Great professor Weaknesses - Some readings get repetitive - A lot of readings for some weeks - - Class discussion can get quite repetitive e.g. regurgitating points from the readings",
    "The strength is in the seminar style because it allowed for great group discussion. The professor was also very helpful with any of our questions. The weakness lie in the fact that there are very few papers and we are expected to make major leaps in writing in very little time.",
    "I really liked how this class was so discussion based. I thought it was really good how we had so many chances to read each others work and edit together.",
    "I thought the class was a little too focused on how to write a 5 paragraph essay. The strength was the size.",
    "I think this class was helpful in bringing me up to speed in writing at a college level. I think the class material ended halfway through the class, though, and that the rest of the class was a little aimless.",
    "The courseload was too heavy. There would be hours of reading, and then a required online response\/journal and responding to others, then discussion in class. It was honestly too much to handle in such detail expected.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it guides you and shows you how to organise your time to write papers in college. Another strength was the small amount of students in the class. This number facilitated conversations and helped everyone to thoroughly engage with the topic. A weakness was the uneven distribution of workload throughout the semester. Sometimes we got nearly no homework, and the next week there was a huge pile of work to do. There could have been even more of an emphasis on teaching students how to write even better."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with any interest in the food system. Even if you don't know anything about it, take the course. You will learn so much, and you will begin to think about how we produce and sell food in this country. The topic is really interesting which makes writing the essays fun.",
    "Yes, great class to learn how to write at the college level and interesting if you care about farming in America.",
    "Take ENGL 114 if you want to improve your academic writing, take this section if you're interested in learning about the food system. The class really goes into a lot of detail and there's a lot of reading, and I definitely feel a lot more knowledgeable about food and farming issues, and what needs to be done. Professor Stuart is very nice and gives a lot of feedback and help during office hours.",
    "It was a fantastic course that is great if you want to learn about the agricultural system in the country, as well as if you want to enhance writing skills.",
    "I definitely would. I think this class was so interesting and helped me improve my writing skills so much. I learned how to see the bigger picture and connect everything from what I'm learning to the world around me which was really awesome.",
    "Yes if you do not have a really, really strong writing background but otherwise take ENGL 120.",
    "Yes--This is an interesting topic that is extremely relevant in today's world. That's what keeps it interesting. Also, learning to shape your own opinions on these things is a big plus.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students who feels like he\/she needs more practice in learning how to write. I would not take this course if one knows how to write well."
