    "This class was way better than doing a project course by myself. Accountability to my peers and Mark helped me get my stuff in on time, and I got much better at explaining my hypotheses via repeatedly having to clarify them to our group. I really enjoyed it and think every disciplinary area in which we have MEScs should have such a class. It's like a lab group for a doctoral degree candidate - you just benefit so much from having peers to hear you out and sound ideas off of.",
    "This class is super useful if you are interested in the scientific publication process, or learning how to look at and present a scientific study. It would not be useful for someone with a strictly management focus.",
    "This is a very hands-on course that provides students with useful analytical skills to review scientific literature in silviculture and provides a step by step approach to writing scientific papers. Students undertake scientific studies in the field to investigate silvicultural issues and assisted through hypotheses formulation, data capture and analyses and presentation of report.",
    "Top of the notch class. Really what I came to look for at Yale.",
    "Question 10 - this course is so helpful and informative for any masters student working to develop their research project into something you can clearly express both in a journal article and in a project presentation."

    "Pizza and beer. Just kidding. Literally, everything. Discussion of papers at the beginning was great - really set the tone. I would have liked a third paper to review perhaps - one more on the line between accept\/reject. I think we could have done one fewer round of presentations (or made it optional), and having us hand in our entered data before Tgiving would have helped us each make sure it was actually entered. Not for review by Mark, so much as just so we actually made sure to prioritize it. It's quite a bit of hand-holding, but whatever -this class works, and that's what matters. I love that you're requiring us to hand in our drafts and get comments (even if I'm behind on getting mine in).",
    "The many draft deadlines.",
    "The opportunity it presents for independent work and the system of peer-reviewing that enriches the whole exercise",
    "Getting a jump start on processing all my data and getting my presentations and thoughts put together. Mark is great and very helpful as are the other students in class. We are all very invested in the success of these projects and so it is great to work together.",
    "The very interactive process of writing your own paper while constantly getting feedback from your professor, TAs and peersTHis class is priceless, really helped me a lot developing my writing, reading, analyzing and synthesizing skills",
    "Having deadlines to keep me on track for progressing with my research.",
    "The encouragement to make progress on the introduction, methods and preliminary results of my research project. The ability to not only write and get feedback on written work, but also practice articulating your project in a presentation form in front of peers, professors, and doctoral students. Holding composure and clearly responding to difficult questions is very useful building confidence and presentation skills."

   "comments": [
    "A little bit more professorial direction (more teaching and less redundant presenting) between the second and third round of presentations would be an asset. More statistical help (perhaps require a meeting with TAs well-versed in at least multivariate stats?) would be a huge asset as well.",
    "This year's class was sizable and maybe it should be smaller given the configuration of the course. it's a trade off because you loose peers with different points of view while you gain more reviewing time from others for your paper"

    "I am an MESc student - what could possibly be a better fit? By having an actual class structure it ensured we put the hours in each week, and kept our summer experiences and the resultant data in the foreground. I only wish this course met the semester before students went and the semester after, since that (I think) is when it's most needed. The students here really need labgroups or some kind of within-discipline peer support network. This did that job.",
    "It provides the tools and capacity to publish scientific work of high quality for journals and thus contribute towards silvicultural knowledge",

You're crazy not to take this course if you are a forest-studying MESc or MFS.",
    "Make sure you stay on top of assignments and your data, so not let things build up until the end of the semester.",
    "This is a very intense course that draws on many other fields of study. One needs to understand silviculture thoroughly and be able to apply that knowledge to solving problems. A good knowledge of statistical analysis is required. A great learning experience.",

    "Take the class, you won't regret it.It's a phD level class perfectly suitable for any environmental science student, although forest science people fit perfectly",
    "If you do better working under deadlines and with the help of your peers, this is the class for you. I really valued it.",
    "Take the course in the first place. The only drawback I found was that I almost did not take the course because I had no idea it was offerend and what the course was about based on the title. Only by word of mouth did I discover how valuable a course this would be."
