   "comments": [
    "Professor Miller is an amazingly nice and really knows the material well. The class really gives you a full historical background of Indian Americans and their development from the time they first came to America til today. I actually learned a lot and really enjoyed this seminar.",
    "material is ok, not much work, professor is good, more anthropolical-type material than i expected",
    "This is a pretty straightforward class. You learn exactly what the name suggests: the history of Native Americans through an economic lens. Expect to learn things you didn't know and also think about things you do know in a new way. Miller is a fabulous professor. She is extremely good at leading class discussions in a way that is productive but does not devolve into a lecture. She also puts in a great deal of effort toward the end of the semester in helping students with their papers, meeting multiple times to go over the nuances of each paper and provide helpful and specific advice. The workload is pretty typical for a seminar: a long research paper at the end, with short \"referee reports\" along the way, along with a group presentation and a standard amount of readings per class. Overall, this was the best class I took this semester, and I highly recommend it.",
    "Professor Miller is amazing! every class was engaging and enjoyable, which is pretty hard to make possible with how long seminar classes are. i was never bored! take a class with her if you can!",
    "I would recommend the class, as it is not too heavy on the work load and the topic is more interesting than it seems at first glance.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a serious senior econ seminar. It's a fun class, and you will learn a lot of stuff you probably didn't know, but you won't learn a lot of econ.",
    "On the easier end for a senior economics seminar. Professor Miller isn't that engaging and spends much of the time lecturing, so it's more of a \"mini lecture\" than seminar. That said, the material\/readings were really interesting and Prof. Miller is very, very knowledgeable and helpful with your final paper. There's definitely less work on a day-to-day basis than your average econ class",
    "A not-so-interactive seminar on a fairly interesting topic. Learned a lot, but never knew how I was doing grade-wise throughout the semester. Only basic readings every week, minimal assignments, grade has to be based almost entirely on final term project\/paper.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in American Indian cultures. It actually has very little economics in it, so if you're expecting rigorous economic interpretations, you will be disappointed.",
    "Pretty straightforward class with some interesting readings. I'd take it if you were a senior and wanted an easy class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class for an Econ seminar. Professor Miller is really nice, and she has a very organized way of structuring the class - first she provides historical background, and then we move into discussion of the readings. The class is not too econ theory heavy and is more focused on American Indian history. Overall, it's a fun, relaxed, and interesting course to take, especially senior year."
