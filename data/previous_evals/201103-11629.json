    "Do not take this course as an undergraduate. The material is interesting, and Professor Spiegel is a good guy, but there is not enough time in the semester to learn the same amount of material as the grad students and you will probably not have the necessary background to do well on the exams, which do not have anything to do with the lectures. Or the problem sets. Which also have nothing to do with the lectures. It's a difficult class with interesting, relevant material and VERY difficult exams.",
    "Very hard course with much assumed prior knowledge. You need to take it, but take it CRD-Fail.",
    "This is a hard class, and pretty much just grad students."
