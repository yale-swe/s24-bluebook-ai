    "NOTHING",
    "I learned more about quantum physics, in particular a lot about quantum mechanics and Einstein's work.",
    "Learnt basic physics language -- what quantum mechanics is, what the big bang theory is etc. Reading the assigned articles helped to impart insights as well. Basically earned a working, elementary grasp of the subject.",
    "Learned a lot of fascinating quantum physics and relativity.",
    "In this course, I got a foundation in \"pop quantum physics.\" I learned very interesting concepts about quantum physics at a conversational level.",
    "I learned a bit about quantum physics. I don't know if I learned any new skills, other than learning how to cram skim scientific articles.",
    "This course really gives you a good overview and understanding of a wide range of topics relating to quantum physics, from the origin and composition of the universe to black holes and time travel. In particular, you learn to formulate your own opinions on these topics, as there are many cases where physicists do not agree on theories. I believe that this was the most worthwhile takeaway from this course, as I now have enough knowledge to understand the ever-evolving field of quantum physics and can continue to develop my own theories about our universe(s)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is SO BORING and disorganized. You cannot learn quantum physics without the math.",
    "Weaknesses: class is long, low interaction, much more like a small lecture than a seminar. Material can get very dry and confusing--not much discussion in class that helps clarify information. Strengths: some information is interesting, material that you wouldn't learn elsewhere. Class work and time required each week is manageable.",
    "Strengths: the topics chosen were relevant and highly interesting. The TA (Salvatore) is super helpful. Weaknesses: Prof Harris explains concepts very poorly. He skims through slides and really doesn't spend enough time explaining things in class. Instead, he assumes that just by reading the readings alone we'll understand all these foreign concepts. That's just not true for non-science background students. :( I wish he spent more time carefully and slowly explaining concepts in class rather than skimming through them and saying that things are \"simple\" or \"straightforward\".",
    "Fascinating material. Would have been helpful if we did a little bit of math to better understand the details of certain concepts, especially rekativity.",
    "Strengths: straight-forward, transparent, not too much work Weaknesses: material was inherently hard to understand and Professor Harris didn't always cover concepts thoroughly",
    "This course is strong in that Professor Harris genuinely cares about teaching quantum physics to non-Physics students, which is pretty rare. However, it was weak in the course structure. We superficially learned a lot of different things with very little common thread to unite different topics together. I don't think the homework assignments made us learn the material, and there was far too much reading. I thought it would've been much more effective to use class time to learn the material, and then have homework assignments that made us think a bit more deeply, such as exploring the implications or interpretations of different topics. I was really interested in this class because I thought we would be learning about quantum physics and then talking about the interpretations of it, as that's what the syllabus conveyed. However, we didn't have conversations in class that would lead to this. For all it's worth, this class could have very well been a lecture given how it was structured.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it is more theoretical than mathematical. Although math is obviously an instrumental tool in physics, this course is aimed to help students understand the many theories that exist in physics and to help them create their own opinions. It is not expected that the students become quantum physicists, rather it is for students that would simply like to understand what the universe we live in is made of and how it behaves. For this reason, the assignments consist of readings and reading responses, which are primarily taken from online scientific articles. The readings are very interesting, and the structure of the class is effective in that students must spend some time on their own thinking about and trying to comprehend the theories before class to answer the reading response questions, but are not expected to get them entirely. This way, class time is spent filling in gaps in knowledge and covering trickier concepts instead of teaching the very basics that were covered in the readings. One of the only weaknesses of this course was the length of the quizzes. We were only given 40 minutes to write 7 or 8 short answer questions, and I found that this did not leave much time to really think things through if they did not come to mind immediately. However, this was a great course!"

   "comments": [
    "No. The course is boring and you learn nothing. It's not even easy enough to be considered a \"gut\" so there is no point in taking it.",
    "No, I do not. Unless you are someone who already knows about quantum physics or are very good at understanding vague concepts, this class will be challenging. The course load is very manageable, but the material is difficult and class isn't very helpful (or interesting during various weeks). It's clear that the professor cares about the info and the class, I just don't think he knows how to best facilitate learning for the average student. Not necessarily an easy science credit--the material is difficult to grasp and class does little to help with that.",
    "If you want a qualitative SC credit class (with absolutely no math), yes. If you're interested in the topic (like I was\/am), yes BUT with the caveat that this course is a lot more poorly taught than it appears at the onset. The syllabus is very enticing but the quality of teaching is lacking.",
    "Great science credit for non-science majors who don't want to do any math.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student in general but especially to students looking for an interesting but balanced science credit.",
    "Yes!",
    "I was really interested in this class because I thought we would be learning about quantum physics and then talking about the interpretations of it, as that's what the syllabus conveyed. However, we didn't have conversations in class that would lead to this. We superficially learned a lot of different topics in quantum physics with very little common thread to unite different topics together. I don't think the homework assignments made us learn the material, and there was far too much reading. As a result of our lack of knowledge\/understanding and because of Prof. Harris's style, we didn't have conversations in class that would lead to deeper understandings of the implications of quantum physics. We just memorized a lot and filled out tedious homework assignments. That being said, the final paper was fun to write, but that comes at the very end and is completely on your own. I came into this course extremely excited about the relationship between physics and philosophy and ready to explore it, but this class fell a bit flat. Also, it's not a gut.",
    "If you are remotely interested in science or even think you might like to know more about what is being discovered about the universe as you are reading this, take this course. It is not your typical physics course where you're asked to calculate how far an object will travel if shot at a certain angle, this class focuses on theories rather than calculations, and discusses topics ranging from the Big Bang to time travel. The readings are often tricky but very interesting, and the reading responses are not difficult, but make you think about and really understand the topics discussed. And no physics background is necessary to do well in this class. I found that I learned a lot about a bunch of different topics, some of which I found more interesting than others, and I was able to form my own opinions about current debates going on in the world of quantum physics. This class will let you understand what physicists are currently studying and will give you the background that makes reading scientific articles much less confusing. For the final paper you can choose any topic at all related to anything that was studied, which gives students lots of freedom to write about something related to their major or other classes they are taking. Most importantly though, this class makes you ponder the meaning of reality, your sense of time, how little we know about the universe we live in, and other spooky concepts like quantum entanglement."
