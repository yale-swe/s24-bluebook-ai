   "comments": [
    "Economics 110 04 was one of the harder classes I took my first semester. I would only recommend a student to take ECON 110 in their first semester if they are planning to major in economics or are genuinely interested in the subject. Though I would recommend taking the seminar over the lecture. While it may seem more intensive, I personally feel that one learns more because there is more interaction with the professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It is the foundation of your economics and you will enjoy it if the subject matter is even moderately appealing to you. The curve isn't as hard as people say it is.",
    "Econ 110 is a standard intro micro course that hits all the big topics. I would strongly recommend the section if you can get into it. While many students prefer Koker for his personality, you will learn much more from Simons.",
    "You learn the majority of the information in the textbook - you read it from cover to cover - and the curve is harder than the lecture but I think it's totally worth it. If you can handle graphs and enjoy math you'll find it easier. If not, you might have to put in some more time but you will learn a lot!",
    "This seminar is for people who already took micrecon in high school and want to become familiar with a economics professor. Otherwise, I would have chosen the lecture over the seminar.",
    "Take it if you want to do EPE or Econ as a major. Don't take it just for your QR. Be as prepared as possible for the tests as the curve is not very forgiving and not knowing one question on each test can be the difference between an A and a B.",
    "I believe that Economics 110 is a valid option to Economics 115; the seminar affords you more intimate interaction with the professor as well as a great bonding experience with other Econ students due to the fact that one almost has to collaborate with others in order to study and work on Problem Sets together. From what I have heard from students in 115, 110 also goes more in-depth into introductory topics from 115, so I believe that 110 also gives you a better base of knowledge to work from if you are looking at taking higher-level classes in economics work.",
    "Fairly difficult. However, if you read the book before lectures, and attend lectures, you should be alright.",
    "Take this class only if you are seriously considering majoring in Economics or have taken Econ before. The course is very fast paced, and the psets are challenging. Shop this course and the lecture that way you'll get a better perspective of the workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student with some degree of economics background.",
    "A worthwhile class for those interested in economics. The workload is not too backbreaking, with only 6 problem sets (of which 1 is optional), 2 midterms, and a final.",
    "Not easy. Be prepared to work hard and be on top of your work. The professor is helpful, but not too much.",
    "Econ 110 is a thorough and challenging introduction to Microeconomics. There are 6 problem sets, two midterms, and a final exam. If you've never been exposed to Econ, it will be challenging, but definitely not impossible; don't let other feedback scare you away. The curve is definitely hard, and the material is more difficult than what you'll encounter in the lecture, but even if you've never taken Econ and you don't want to be an Econ major, this class is SO WORTH IT. You will learn an incredible amount, and a lot of the material is quite fascinating and applicable to everyday life."
