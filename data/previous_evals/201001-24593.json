    "Enviro Studies 125 is a great summary of climate change processes and history. I would definitely recommend it to someone, if they are sincerely interested in being knowledgeable about climate change beyond what they've heard from Al Gore.",
    "An intersting course. Essential for anyone who wish to have a meaningful discussion about our changing climate.",
    "Well, for those of you who are really interested in this field, I would recommand it. But if you just want to get an easy science credit, it may not be what you are searching for.",
    "This class starts easy but the second and final tests were very hard. These tests asked very specific information, and to get full credit for a question that asked something like \"Give some reasons why...\", you had list five possible answers, where in most classes two or three good answers are enough to get full credit. Going over notes in reviewing for the tests, it seemed like I knew the material well, but the tests are quite challenging. Only five short problem sets though.",
    "I would recommend the course because it is interesting and I learned that the environmental changes seen today are not new to Earth's history. Wettlaufer's tests were straightforward and doable, but Pagani's tests were very convoluted and difficult. Does not require you to read the book, although it would be very helpful, but you must attend lectures because slides are not posted.",
    "Yes and no. Material was interesting but the class overall was taught in a strange way. The problem sets were either super easy or impossible and the exams were a little strange. As in some one word answer questions were worth 10 points, it just seemed a little unfair if that was the one fact that you had forgotten."
