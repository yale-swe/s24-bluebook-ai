    "Arabic is a tough language to learn and Professor Elbousty makes it as enjoyable as it can be. Good mix of teaching and practice, at home and in class, and good classroom atmosphere.",
    "You should take it. I honestly don't know anyone who regrets starting Arabic here. The instructor makes the course, though. So if you don't get Elbousty, I'm not sure how worth it you'd find the course. I didn't feel like I was retaining a lot of the knowledge until it came time for one of the tests and I was surprised by how much I could recall. You start to get the hang of things and it's a very enjoyable course.",
    "I would recommend it Arabic L2 to another student. It's overall a well-organized introductory course that covers a massive amount of material while encouraging the development of a friendly atmosphere.",
    "Arabic class will give you what you put in.",
    "Great class. I learned a lot. Very straight forward.",
    "It is a continuation of ARBC 110. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I recommend this course! Definitely take it!",
    "Arabic is a challening language and you can't get around that. However, I have found the department here to be good, and have had good experiences. I would recommend it to someone with a purpose for it or looking for a challenge, but don't take it just for the requirement.",
    "Great look at Modern Standard Arabic - take it if you're interested!",
    "A solid follow-up to 110. The workload isn't too bad as long as you don't forget about the online assignments and let them pile up, and the tests and quizzes are pretty manageable. Professor Elbousty is a fair and patient instructor, but he tends to focus a lot more on grammar and MSA. If you want to learn the dialect then they almost expect you to study abroad and pick it up that way."
