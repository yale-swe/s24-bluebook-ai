   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student, not that they have a choice. I would also recommend that they take it seriously. As stated above, it is a great opportunity to get introduced to lots of professors and their work.",
    "PLSC 510 is not a comprehensive introduction to the study of politics. It is quite an introduction to the Yale Department of Political Science, and a valuable opportunity to meet and learn about the faculty.",
    "A broad and interesting introduction to the Yale Political Science Department. A good chance to get to know cohort-mates better.",
    "It might not be applicable to say that I would recommend this course since it is required, but I would tell someone who is taking it that it is very useful for introducing themselves to the political science department. I was grateful for the chance to meet so many faculty members and for being able to read and discuss their research with them. Anyone taking the course should invest time in it only for this reason. Another reason that the course is useful is that it is a good way to introduce yourself to the wide array of subjects which political scientists study. There are numerous issues which one can study and a wide variety of methods with which one can research those issues. Intro to politics gives substance to that abstract sense, and it can help identify previously unfamiliar topics which you would like to study further.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. As I said above, it is extremely helpful to meet the department faculty.",
    "The course surveys contemporary scholarship by Yale faculty members in a workshop format, centering on student questions. Very useful experience."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't say it deepened it so much as broadened it, and I think that is a better objective for this course. I am not sure if this topic will become my dissertation topic, but I was able to use the end of course paper to start working on a research proposal, so the one assignment was certainly helpful in terms of the longer term objective of having a research agenda going.",
    "Although this class was a nice introduction to the Yale Political Science Department and its faculty members, this is not to be confused with Political Science more broadly. Only one of the professors I expect to work with appeared in the class, and the coverage of material was idiosyncratic. But I feel more knowledgeable about the Department overall, and that is valuable.",
    "In addition to introducing me to department faculty, the course provided a helpful introduction to some of the major topics in political science subfields.",
    "The course provided a great opportunity to hear about current scholarship and research practices.",
    "This course contributed to my understanding of the political science field as a whole."
