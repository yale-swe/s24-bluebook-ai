   "comments": [
    "Its not as bad as people make it out to be.",
    "well written tests not enough homework to ingrain concepts",
    "The course should have better teachers\/instructors with more experience in teaching.",
    "I think that there's a range of experiences across sections. Some students feel better prepared than others.",
    "I feel math is an incredibly important subject and to have professors who dont particularly know how to teach hurts the students a lot more than in any other case. In addition, pitting series before volumes makes no sense. Why suddenly stick in the most complicated material and hope for the best?",
    "Your opinions of this course is really entirely based on the experience you have with your professor. I took Calc AB in high school and have a very strong background in math overall. I took this class as a QR credit but also because I enjoy calculus in general and find it understandable as long as you put the work in. Unfortunately, my professor was a grad student who did not know how to organize lessons or make them understandable at all, so this class was a terrible experience. The review sessions for the midterms and final essentially taught me a semester's worth of math in a few hours . Going to these sessions for the midterms and final was incredibly helpful but also proved to me how much better my experience in the class would have been if I had a stronger professor.",
    "A strength of the course is the way in which each exploration correlates with the lesson being taught this helps provide some insights and background information so that students have a chance to see the material before it is introduced in class. The course could be better organized in the way each lesson is taught. In my experience specifically, the instructor failed to establish a solid foundation on the general concepts being taught and aimlessly expected students to complete exercises without there being a discussion on the lesson being taught that day.",
    "I was very content with this course. The peer tutor hours were extremely helpful, and I always found my professor to be available to help when necessary.",
    "Weakness is the focus on rote memorization"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a challenge in mathematics",
    "yeah, but make sure to study hard for midterms and try to understand things conceptually.",
    "Not unless the student has a very strong math background in calculus II already. Many of my classmates took this class in high school and seemed to even struggle.",
    "Only if they were a STEM major or if it was absolutely necessary for their major.",
    "I mean, yeah, its a basic math. You dont really have the option of opting out.",
    "I would recommend to the student if he\/she is prepared to carry out a great portion of the learning on his own because in my case class lessons did not suffice.",
    "Yes. I personally love math and this course was a great for strengthening my skills in calculus. I would recommend to anyone who likes math.",
    "Unless you are genuinely interested in the content that is taught in this course or need to take this course to fulfill a course requirement for your major, I would not recommend this course because you would be signing yourself up for a lot of self-learning. Although the workload is not that much, you are required to teach yourself a lot of the content because the instructors' teaching skills are sub-par.",
    "No, could take much more engaging class to fill requirement."
