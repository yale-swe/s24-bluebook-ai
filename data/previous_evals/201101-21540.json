   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. The end is a bit challenging, but very doable.",
    "Only take math 120 if you need to take math for your major! This class is completely different from what you learn in Calc BC or 115, so be prepared to learn!",
    "Its one of those intro math classes where you learn techniques and nothing else. If you are interested in real world applications in physics etc. take 151 instead.",
    "its essential to any one who will have to deal with math",
    "If you want to take math, you kind of have to take it. Its not too bad if you keep up with the problem sets, but its easy to slip behind a bit, and if you do it can be very tough. The tests are very hard.",
    "MATH 120 is tough because so much weight is placed upon the final exam. There are few opportunities to improve one's grades. The class is also tough in that there is not much of a focus on practical examples of the topics covered, so they are hard to conceptualize. However, that's to be expected in a math class. On the whole, however, the work is manageable as long as you do the homework and don't save studying for the day before the test.",
    "Mathematics 120 is a challenging course that covers a lot of material, however, if Minh-Tri Vo is your instructor, in my opinion, you will have a better and much morefulfilling experience in learning the material. The class can be made especially difficult in that many students taking the course have previously taken multivariable calculus which can greatly affect the grading curve.",
    "highly recommend. so much fun!!",
    "Very difficult and I will not retain anything... which outweighs the material being interesting. Take it only if you have to.",
    "This course teaches you multivariable calculus. Take it you have a good grip on single variable calculus. I took the course after only taking Calc AB my junior year of high school (I didn't take Math 115). There are no application related problems - if you want to apply the concepts to science or engineering, take the engineering version of multivariable. The tests are much harder than the homework - beware.",
    "The course is manageable although not mindblowing. Minh is a great professor and you should definitely use him as a resource if you're in his section. I hadn't taken a multi class before this so I definitely put in work to master the concepts before getting the chance to rehearse them. I found the learning the material rewarding but that was largely an independent effort. Be sure to study the practice exams because they're very different from the emphasis of class time, which was the largest frustration of the course."
