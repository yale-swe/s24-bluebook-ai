And as a person who follows politics constantly, I found it very exciting to be able to study models that allowed me to see political situations in new lights. Now that the course is over, I'm also proud of the fact that I feel that I genuinely did understand most of the material and can retain it after the class, which I suppose is a testament to the overall strength of the content and the way it was presented.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor is great and I think the course is reasonably organized. The TFs were also very helpful. The one improvement: there should be answer keys available to all of the problem sets and review materials. The TFs gave very thorough feedback on problem sets, but it would help if there were keys to all of the practice problems before the final.",
    "Strengths: Clear lectures, straightforward problem sets and tests, helpful discussion sections. Professor Turner directed us to many useful alternative resources besides the textbook. This course teaches you to think about interactions, elections, economics, etc. in a whole new light, and makes some aspects of politics much more intuitive. Weaknesses: The textbook, Osborne's Introduction to Game Theory, is dense, difficult to follow, and written in the language of proof-based linear algebra. However, Professor Turner addressed this shortcoming by providing us with other resources that were much easier to learn from. The course could be improved if the lecture slides were proofread prior to lecture, as typos or inconsistencies in strategy labeling sometimes make it difficult to take notes.",
    "Its a very straightforward class, which makes it easy to understand. But then it also becomes hard to make it to lecture...",
    "Professor Turner is absolutely the highlight of this class. He is simply beyond fantastic and will make your adore Game Theory. I also found the content inherently interesting and being able ti explore it with such an amazing professor made this class truly excellent. It was fun, organized, and well taught, and you will come out of the class having the knowledge and practice to do such problems.",
    "Professor Turner is a fantastic, enthusiastic teacher. Really great course. Would recommend speeding up the first unit to allow more time to study BNEs\/PBEs.",
    "Professor Turner is an incredible instructor. He made what could have been a dry topic interesting. I can't think of any ways the course could be improved.",
    "The course was great! The lectures were incredibly helpful and the PSETs manageable. The exams were also very straightforward.",
    "This is taught to help you learn the content which is great. The TFs and Prof. Turner are super approachable and really good at explaining stuff. The last week of lectures was kind of boring, so perhaps cut that and look at things like juries instead for practical implications.",
    "not too tough. First 2 thirds is super basic, tail end pics up a fair bit. Professor Turner is very very very disorganized and plays it off as a joke but like... every set of notes had typos and often it was something in an equation \/ formula that actually impacted learning ability. It says a lot that he showed up 15 minutes late to the final, holding the whole thing up, and no one was really surprised.",
    "At the moment, the class is okay. While Professor Turner is an engaging lecturer, the material is really dry and hard to follow. However, it's not hard to pick it up yourself just by looking at the slides. There will be many times that he recommends reading the textbook, but I wouldn't recommend doing that as the textbook is dense and uses different terms\/notation from the lectures. That being said, the class is really easy. To put it into perspective, the average on the 2nd midterm was a B+, and this caused the professor to institute a new policy to override your midterm score with the final (if better). In addition, the final was basically problems from the homework assignments with slightly changed values.",
    "The course seemed to be structured around other courses outside Yale.",
    "- a lot of the material taught in the lecture was not helpful when doing the pset. I had to use mostly outside resources, I eventually stopped taking notes in class because I noticed the info wasn't needed or helpful (I still listened to absorb)",
    "This course is a solid intro to game theory. It could use more real-world application of these mathematical insights.",
    "One of the biggest strengths of the course is that it did a really good job of fostering a collaborative learning environment. I was able to find a study group that was incredibly supportive and all were engaged with the material. I found lecture to be more involved than average and certainly more dynamic. So, the overall environment for learning and the way the material was covered in lecture was all very strong. I also think the content was broken up accordingly. The weakness I found with this class though was section. The dominating sentiment myself and others had is that section was usually either redundant or not completely relevant examples. It was taught well, but it sometimes felt as though it was not the best use of time for the course. But that was by no means a dominating factor in the overall experience with the course, which was very positive.",
    "Strengths: Interesting information, manageable problem sets, straightforward final exam Weaknesses: The \"trick\" questions on midterms were annoying and sometimes made studying pointless.",
    "Professor Turner is well liked and super engaging in lecture. He goes through the material in a very detailed manner and makes sure that the processes to solve games are described in an understandable manner. That being said, most of the game theory taught is not difficult and is not as dynamic as it should be to effectively describe complicated game theoretical scenarios. Sometimes, we would spend a lot of time on the simple concepts and speed through the more difficult stuff.",
    "This course was generally pretty well-paced, giving us enough time to get familiar with each of the concepts and with their associated problem-solving approaches. I also appreciated that the lectures were built around solving specific examples, and gave us really good intuition for the topic. The tutorials were also very useful, and they often served to solidify the knowledge learned in class. At times, it felt as though the lectures were a little too short, since we often ran out of time before we could get through the slides. I also wondered if the course was a little too relaxed\/if we had learned too little, especially since we spent a substantial about of time learning about pure strategy Nash equilibria during the first third of the class. Since it was a class that did not require substantial math background, only the simpler topics were tested. It was a great, well-taught course but I was left wondering about the things that had perhaps not been taught.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures but sometimes we would spend lecture dwelling on things that were pretty easy to understand and then we'd skip over hard parts.",
    "This course had a great start but ended... not great. The class just was not very organized and often we had to resort to Youtube to figure out what is actually going on. It was difficult to know how the heck we were supposed to answer the problem sets until the TA explains the topic in the next section, when it's already too late.",
    "This course is incredibly straightforward, and the content in the problem sets reflect the content in the exams. However, there are some lectures that are entirely unnecessary and the material is never seen in problem sets nor exams. In the future, they could either 1) be more clear about what is and is not important or 2) cut out the extra untested material.",
    "I loved this course! There were lots of resources, the lectures were engaging, and the professor was amazing. The one thing I would suggest to improve was section - I wished it was just as engaging as class.",
    "Strengths: The teacher! For what could have been boring material, Professor Turner demonstrably tried to make the class as engaging and interesting as possible. He also constantly provided moments for in-class feedback to see how students were doing and also tried to provide more that one source for each type of material we covered in case we did not like the way one textbook taught the information. He was incredibly reasonable and fair in his grading, which I appreciated. Weaknesses: The material never got hard. Perhaps for some students that is a strength, but I left feeling like I only got a watered-down version of game theory without much to challenge me. On more than one occasion we would spend a good amount of time going through easier questions and then Professor Turner would rush through harder supplemental material he had on slides, perhaps knowing that he wouldn't test us on those concepts. This was frustrating for me, because I think (based on scores) the class had the capacity to be pushed further.",
    "The Psets were very helpful in learning the material. I wish Professor Turner would have done more examples in class.",
    "Strengths were how the exams looked pretty much like the problem sets, so there were no tricks or curveballs for the most part. The biggest weakness was how little the \" for political science\" was explored. There's definitely room to do a lot more with how the content can be applied to real politics.",
    "I think its well structured, evenly paced and covers a good range of content. It could probably move a little faster at times, but in general its good.",
    "Strengths: I did learn about game theory, which is something I've been wanting to study. The professor is great and the TA is one of the greatest of all time. It's also very, very easy to do well. I'm not even saying like \"if you put in the time you will do well.\" I mean if you don't put in time but you have a basic understanding of like algebra you will do well. Also he posts all of the slides and gives a really good textbook and there are a ton of office hours so if you're NOT getting something (or if you skipped a ton of class) no sweat. Weaknesses: it's just...SO easy. Like I would sit in class because I felt bad for skipping the past couple weeks and I would end up on facebook the whole time just cuz he explains it sooooo slowly. I get it, it's a math class designed for non-math majors--but still it was kinda boring to listen to. That being said since the slides are so good, I could afford to doze off and just learn it on my own time.",
    "The biggest course of the strength was the relevance of the material and the helpfulness of the TAs. I think a weakness is that the lectures sometimes moved through the material too quickly - i think pre-made powerpoints may not be the best way to teach the material, instead I think writing out games on a chalk board and solving them the way we would on a problem set or exam would be incredibly helpful.",
    "The psets often explicitly referenced the books instead of just having the problems in them, which is a problem for certain people that decided they didn't feel the need to buy the book, but still had to find one to reference just to get the problems.",
    "The course started on a higher note but as the content grew more complicated, Prof. Turner was a bit more unsure of himself in lecture, which lended to some confusion. Overall, the content of the course was fairly easy though.",
    "The material is interesting, but lecture slides are not engaging.",
    "Strength: its easy, weakness: its too easy",
    "The course was taught at a very reasonable pace in order to ensure that all students were on the same page. The course could be improved by posting solutions to the problem sets after they are graded.",
    "Strengths is Prof. Turner, who was engaged, energetic, and clearly cared a lot about the lecture. TFs were also great, especially Collin Schumock. Lectures were sometimes boring but I think it may just have been the material and nothing to do with the instructors.",
    "Strengths were section. Weaknesses were lecture: I just didn't pay any attention because the slides were too convoluted trying to explain everything with words.",
    "It would be nice to go through more problems in lecture, since game theory is such a necessarily hands-on subject. The sections were only enough time for one or two problems a week. I feel like we spent a tonnn of time on easy stuff (static, complete information games) and not enough time on harder stuff towards the end."

   "comments": [
    "I mean, it's a required course for me. So if you need a game theory credit that's not ECON 151, then sure.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Turner is great. He is very enthusiastic and makes it fun to come to lecture. He has perfectly structured this course to teach game theory to somebody who has never been exposed to it before. The homework is short, straightforward, and enlightening, and the tests are very fair. This course will give you the skills to analyze interactions between multiple people and determine each person's best course of action. The most interesting parts of the course are when Professor Turner explains how simple game theoretic models reveal broader truths about politics, markets, etc. That is, he uses simple math to teach you something valuable about interpersonal interactions in this world.",
    "Yes!",
    "Without a doubt! Professor Turner is hilarious, and you'll have so many stories to tell. It's engaging, fun, and useful content, and it's not too stressful at all. There TFs and professor all make sure you understand the material but are also very understanding and kind. Take it with Collin as your TF!",
    "Yes, take it with Professor Turner! Fantastic teacher & really interesting course content.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Game theory helped understand the structural elements of electoral politics in a new light. Professor Turner makes every lecture fun and engaging. I genuinely looked forward to class every Monday and Wednesday.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, if they are looking for a course that is pretty easy and does not have too much work. If they are looking for a course to learn about policy or political theory, this is not that course. But if they are looking for a course that involves strategic decision making, but does not involve tough math, this is a good course for them.",
    "If you're looking for a QR this is pretty manageable and the content is pretty easy to learn if you practise and go to section. Lecture can be dull but I think that's to do with the content as Prof. Turner is really kind and engaging.",
    "Yes, very interesting material, not too hard, and pretty a pretty fun class overall.",
    "If you need it for your major and need to knock out a requirement, why not. but if you're looking for an exciting class, def not",
    "Yes! Take this class! It's a great SO\/QR credit. As a STEM major, it was probably the easiest class I've ever taken at Yale. The problem sets don't take much longer than 30 minutes to an hour a week, and the exams are very simple.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student only if he\/she was interested in PLSC\/econ.",
    "Depends - if you work hard the material is understandable but the tests are often wacky and unrelated to what we have learned, or at least too conceptual to apply what we concretely learned.",
    "No. I didn't find the material very interesting",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend this course first to people such as myself who are not interested in the STEM field and are intimidated by any sorts of math whatsoever but are looking for a credit that will still engage with them intellectually. Game theory is definitely that class. The professor is wonderful and I was surprised by how much of the material I was excited to learn. At the end of the day, I feel like this course is an exceptional QR at Yale and is just a very interesting subject to begin with, so why not give it shot?",
    "Yes. It's not a gut, but it's definitely a good way to get your QR credit.",
    "I would recommend if you are looking for an \"econ-esque\" class for political science purposes and not necessarily for understanding the economic part of game theory. There is not much homework being that the problem sets are not that difficult and do not take up so much time. Professor Turner is engaging and charismatic.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class because the teacher and the content were excellent.",
    "This class teaches you how to think and approach different problems in similar ways. I truly enjoyed my experience in this class and liked how I was challenged to think like a game theorist rather than just learn game theory",
    "Yes! It's a very fun class, and it's not too stressful. I'm not sure what proper game theory is, but my understanding is that this class definitely moved at a much slower pace than the other class. However, I did learn lots about game theory, and I'm also pretty confident in my knowledge\/grasp of such topics, and as a whole I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Yes, this was a great course, interesting content that was well taught.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed the class as a nonstem student and felt like a learned a lot! And it wasn't too difficult~",
    "I took this to fulfill a cog sci requirement, it was perfect. Not too challenging, but interesting.",
    "If you want an easy QR, yes. Not really useful beyond that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Ian is funny and a great professor, and I actually learned a lot about game theory that I can apply to other disciplines.",
    "Yes!! It is a really fun experience and it changes the way you think about decision-making and policy.",
    "Yes, professor Turner is very engaging and makes the material super fun to learn. I found the class to be intellectually stimulating but very fun to take as well.",
    "Take this if you need an easy class",
    "Yes! I would. Honestly one of the most enjoyable lectures I've ever attended. I found the material extremely fun and at times very relevant to ways in which we understand how people make decisions around us. For those of you who are required to take a game theory course, I couldn't recommend this one more.",
    "Yes",
    "Strongly recommend. It's very straightforward and you will do well if you put in the work on the front end. The basics of game theory are good for anyone to know and this course delivers them in an approachable way.",
    "Yeah for sure, its a really digestible way to learn Game Theory.",
    "I'm gonna be honest. If you are at all, AT ALL, a math person, this class is dumb easy. I didn't go to lecture for the last 4 weeks and got over a 96 on the final. He doesn't assume you know what a derivative is or an infinite some. Basically, it's like a class where you do some weird version of sudoku all day. This was the single easiest course I have taken at Yale to date. He also posts everything all the time and is suuuuper generous with exams\/homework policy. At times, This class was so easy that I would hate it just for being so mind-numbing. But it's a gem. If you're interested at all in the subject, have any understanding of math, and want a bit of a break--here you go.",
    "Yes it is a good introduction to Game Theory.",
    "Yes, a very interesting course that will help people understand many polisci papers and concepts much better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student either with a game theory requirement for their major or who wants to be able to understand (at a basic level) the game theoretic models used in political science literature. If you're more of a quantitative learner, however, I would likely recommend taking the Econ version of game theory.",
    "Yes, it was an enjoyable course. Fair amount of challenge; not overwhelming and easy to master",
    "I think lectures could be much more structured and having better guides than just the slides online for when we are doing psets. At the current moment, if you didnt understand the lecture the first time, lost track, or didnt get something in your notes, you had to go and learn the content on YouTube, hoping its the right topic. I liked the content of the course so I was mostly engaged, but I would say I wouldve learned more deeply and wouldve developed an actual liking to game theory had I taken a different course. Perhaps take the spring version of the course.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was extremely interesting and educational while not being very challenging if you have any real math background. It was an excellent course to take in conjunction with a bunch of courses that took a lot of my time.",
    "Yes, if you need to fulfill a game theory requirement, absolutely take this one. Course was one of the easiest I've taken at Yale. Also a great way to get a QR, or get an easy A\/A-.",
    "This class was my favorite class this semester- If you have any interest in anything political science or logical thinking, try it out! Ian Turner is an especially great professor.",
    "Yes, if you want a surface knowledge of game theory.",
    "Yes, it's great first course on game theory if you have no background whatsoever, and want to learn about some of game theory's applications to government.",
    "Yes, if you need a qr credit, but probably not otherwise.",
    "I would recommend this but with CAUTION. At first it seems really easy, and it is, until you get to the second half of the course (around the middle of the second unit). It eventually becomes REALLY difficult, and while it is not impossible to do well, it will take a lot more work for you to understand the material than it did for unit 1. That said, Professor Turner cares more about you understanding the material than just about any other professor I've had. His generous (cumulative) final exam policy (replacing any midterm exam grade if final exam grade is higher than any midterm score) shows that he really cares you actively make efforts to go back and learn\/practice material you didn't master. Just make sure you go to office hours for PSETs and that you have a GOOD TF. Mine was not great, but I went to Collin's office hours for help and he explained things amazingly well. I can imagine that students in his section struggled less with the material.",
    "If you're interested in game theory only yes. Won't get much out of the political science aspect though.",
    "Yes.",
    "If it counts toward your major, yes! If not (but you're interested in decision making\/logic games), still yes. It is very gutty during the first half. DO NOT let that fool you. It picks up fast, and once you fall behind....you're in trouble! But it is a very manageable QR if you don't miss class\/sections\/psets! Little reading required."
