   "comments": [
    "This course covers recruitment, violence and civilian involvement in civil wars. The readings are a balance between theory and case studies. If you know a lot about the subject or know nothing, you will come away feeling like you really understand the extent of the field. Discussions focus on learning how to do a good critique of theory and research design. I highly recommend the course. It was always interesting and well organized, and Professor Arjona is very knowledgeable and approachable.",
    "Good seminar. Good professor, manageable workload, interesting subject--though more technical and less sexy than the class title suggests.",
    "Good seminar.",
    "This is a good class to take. It's not too much work but enough to make sure you get something out of it. The readings can be a bit dry, but class is always interesting and Professor Arjona is a fantastic teacher. If you think you'll be interested in the subject definitely shop it-I don't regret taking it.",
    "Must take! Covers all the essentials in civil war literature. Professor is amazing.",
    "Great seminar if you are really interested in learning why people join violent organizations in civil wars. Additionally, it provides a great seminar for political science majors who want to learn how to effectively analyze political science literature, and how to write great political science papers.",
    "For someone passionate about the subject matter and wanting to discuss with peers, this is the ideal class. The small environment might turn some people off to the class if they don't actually want to discuss the readings, but for those genuinely interested in the different facets of civil wars, this course is ideal.",
    "Rebels in Civil Wars is a class about rebellion in modern history (roughly from the 19th century to today). It covers all sorts of aspects of the phenomena, from violence to recruitment and motivations of the groups involved. It's a really great class, and it gives you the chance to understand the dynamics of a very complex subject.",
    "Really cool class, very focused on the political science of rebel groups. If you're looking for a policy based course, this probably isn't for you, but if you want a wide scope of cases of civil wars (from Bolivia, Columbia, Peru, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and many more) and theory involving the origins of violence, this class is for you.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale! Lots of reading, and you do have to do it all, but completely opened my mind to the different structures one can place many different characteristics of a rebel group in. If you are interested in studying civil wars, TAKE IT !! Professor Arjona is great too.",
    "Yes, it was a good class.",
    "I thought the class was good - the reading especially was really interesting. I was much more interested in the case studies regarding Latin America and Africa, and preferred those over the theories articles. I also thought 9 in the morning was a little early for a 2 hour class, and it made it a little difficult to concentrate. While it was nice to have someone go over the articles in the beginning, I also felt it was used as an excuse to not finish all the readings sometimes. The discussion lagged a little at times, partly because the students didn't always do the readings and partly because it was so early. However, I thought the papers were a nice way of learning in depth a particular case study, which I really enjoyed.Professor Arjona is obviously very intelligent and knows the material really well. I actually wished she would take a more pro-active role and talk more about her knowledge rather than hearing more from the other students, who don't know that much about the topic. She was available to the students, but could have given a little more feedback on the papers and presentations. Overall, though, I felt she led the class well and I definitely learned a lot from her.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the course topic and are willing to keep up with a heavy reading list.",
    "This course is a very efficient overview of many aspects of rebel behavior--interaction with civilians, internal hierarchy, what determines success and failure, etc. The course covers the major theories about why rebellions form, who chooses to join rebellions, what determines the goals of rebellions, and so forth. We covered the same civil wars frequently enough that by the end of the course, I felt like the class discussions were actually fairly informed and we could weigh theories against one another. Professor Arjona runs the class very well and is good at keeping class discussions going."
