   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to someone very interested in music of the Romantic era and with a particular interest in engaging with the difficulties of traditional analysis as music get more and more chromatic (as \"the rules\" start to break down).Analyzing highly deformed sonata structures and slapping Roman numerals on Chopin is hard. If you think it's worth your time (and it certainly was worth mine), sign up.",
    "Required course for music majors first of all, but you should take it if you enjoyed 210. Music 211, in my opinion, is more interesting (sonata theory is great, schubert songs are beautiful, and romantic era needs no explanation); the classes also tend to be even smaller than 210, so everyone needs to speak up! If you're not comfortable with that, that's something to consider as well, because participation does factor in. This is a course in which your grade accurately reflects how much you actually think about the music.",
    "It's a great class even if you're not a music major - you get to analyze Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Wagner, and some of the greats in between. There's interesting harmonic topics, lyrical analysis, and fun model compositions as well - worth a go for sure, and the workload isn't bad at all.",
    "Take it! Wonderful class and follow-up to 210.",
    "Not as much model composition as I'd hoped for, but it's a fun course. Very little work in our section for the last month or so of classes."
