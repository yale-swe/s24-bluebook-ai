    "I got to read a lot more of Shakespeare. I learned a particular and interesting style of close reading too.",
    "I improved my writing, and in particular, incorporating close reading in a longer paper",
    "Really made me engage with the text, close reading and perfecting my writing",
    "Nothing develops English close-reading skills better than a careful study of Shakespeare's writing, in which the tragedies take first place (for me, at least). I only wish we had more time to delve into each work, to trace the motifs and structural parallels between them.",
    "I greatly improved my ability to analyze and write on literature. Talking about the plays and hearing other people's contributions helped me see how the same text could have so many valid interpretations. I enjoyed hearing from the professor and the other students and in turn providing my own thoughts in discussion and in y papers. I also had a chance to read well known plays that have impacted academia and popular culture for centuries."

   "comments": [
    "I wish we had spent longer on each play because the way we were moving through them made it such that we didn't get to cover all the material.",
    "Best Shakespeare course I have taken at Yale",
    "The structure of this course already encourages students to read the texts carefully, but having student-led discussions in the first half of each seminar would maintain the level of engagement throughout the semester. (The beginning of the semester was quite strong in that respect -- then the seminar meetings lost some energy, discipline, or a combination of the two).",
    "The in-class discussions are absolutely fantastic and exactly how an English class should be organized. Prof. Quint often provided key concepts or background information that gave further insight into the works, and I appreciated this information. The workload is very manageable, and Prof. Quint provides excellent feedback for improvement on papers. The biggest weakness of this course is probably just the pacing of the time spent on works (we started running out of time for works near the end), but spending more time to flesh out ideas on a particular work justifies the pacing."

   "comments": [
    "No, I would not recommend this class. Spare yourself the trouble and just read the plays on your own.",
    "Yes, if you want to read more Shakespeare, take this course!",
    "Please take this course. I think the best Shakespeare course taught at Yale. He is a harder grader but really makes you engage with and learn the text.",
    "Absolutely. Who wouldn't want to spend some of their undergraduate years reading monumental texts like King Lear, Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, Winter's Tale, Henry IV (well, parts of it)?",
    "This is a great course for anyone who loves literature and who loves Shakespeare. I hugely enjoyed it, primarily because it was everything an English class on works of literature is supposed to be--reading from selected works and in-depth class discussions on each of them. Every day in class was a day to see more into the text and hear others ideas about it means, and I found this rewarding in and of itself since it makes the class interactive, but it also greatly deepened my skills of analysis. The course gets the best known of Shakespeare's tragedies as well as other of his works. I can't say that I would have motivated myself to read them on my own as much as I might have attempted to read such plays in my own time, and so I'm really happy I got the chance to read these works and discuss them with others who are also interested in them. Prof Quint is a great professor and will work with you on your writing. The workload is also pretty moderate for an English class--only three papers total, as well as weekly discussion posts. Shakespeare's writing is timeless for very good reasons, and I highly recommend this class as a means of exploring it."
