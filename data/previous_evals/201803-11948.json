    "I gained a rudimentary understanding of the Spanish language.",
    "This course gave me a strong foundation to continue learning the Spanish language and interact with Spanish speaking cultures.",
    "I feel I drastically improved in my ability to communicate effectively in Spanish as well as my grammar.",
    "I learned basic skills in the Spanish language, from grammar to vocabulary to culture. It was a great course that really accelerated my learning in an unfamiliar language.",
    "I learned how to speak Spanish, though it isn't necessarily grammatically correct most of the time.",
    "I learned how to have basic conversations in Spanish using weather terms, clothing, food and more.",
    "I furthered my knowledge of the spanish language, but also latin american culture",
    "i learned basic spanish very well!",
    "I've gained the ability to speak basic Spanish with people with a vocabulary previously inaccessible to me.",
    "I was very impressed by the fact that we were able to learn a new language (to the level of basic communication) over the course of three months."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was highly interactive and provided multiple avenues to engage with the material through writing, reading, speaking, and listening. This course relayed material about many topics. Overall, I was satisfied with the course, but while learning the language the schedule was rushed, and I did not retain as much as I could have given more time with new, difficult concepts.",
    "I loved this course, only critique is I wish we learned more about Spanish culture.",
    "The strengths of this course are its organization and attention to detail. It has the Supersite, and daily lessons in the book as well as the Course Packet. The structure is demanding but exactly what you need to learn a new language. There were no definitive weaknesses that I saw. The course managed to cover reading, listening, oral, and the information from the book.",
    "Certain material wasn't covered as well as others, so when I was tested on things that were only briefly touched on (ex: que, quien, quienes, lo que) I still didn't full understand them.",
    "My professor Giseli was very engaging. However, I thought the course packet wasn't helpful. Additionally, paying $200 for a course code for a textbook that provided homework that wasn't as helpful wasn't that great.",
    "Strengths were that most classes were highly engaging, and regular assessments meant we didn't lose focus. Weaknesses are that considering how expensive it was, the textbook was not used enough\/was not helpful enough.",
    "Overall the course was extraordinarily strong, I learned more Spanish than I could have thought I would in such a short time span. The weakness would have to be how much material we covered in such a short time span, it was hard to synthesize a lot of the material later in the course.",
    "Strengths: very intense and therefore, insures that you leave having learnt a language. It is a very interactive course and encourages group activities and communication. Weaknesses: I felt at times that the online homework was not very helpful. Furthermore, most students already had experience, which made it feel like I (someone who had never even interacted with the language) was playing catch up a lot of the time."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a good course. However there were many students in my section who had taken spanish in high school, so I was at a disadvantage.",
    "This course provided enough practice to be able to communicate ideas in Spanish to a limited degree, which is why I would recommend it to other students. There was plenty to learn, but overall my skills definitely improved.",
    "Yes, this was by far my favorite course of the semester. Giseli is amazing as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's intense but worth it if you want to gain an understanding of a new language.",
    "If that student was interested in Spanish then yes, I'd recommend this to them. If you aren't interested in learning a new language though and have no interest in putting a lot of effort in outside of the classroom then I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would recommend. I took Spanish high school but this course allowed me to fill in the gaps and build upon it. It isn't simple at all even given high school Spanish",
    "Yes I would, a highly useful skill to develop, classes were fun and workload was easily manageable",
    "Yes, you will learn a lot as long as you engage in the class.",
    "Yes, I would. It is difficult as you grow older to grasp a new language. However, the structure of the course is such that it makes sure that you are grasping the language well. Where it usually takes years to learn a language, this course makes you fluent in the basics very quickly."
