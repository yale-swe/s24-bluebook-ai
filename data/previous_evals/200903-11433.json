    "He made me cry in our first meeting. And then made me realize I deserved it. He's that good.",
    "This is a class for people who know how to write generally but would like to hone their skills in the short story form. Also, do not apply if you don't have a reasonably thick skin - Caz is tough (albeit in a very constructive way) - and you will not survive the semester if you cannot take being criticized.",
    "This class is a straightforward workshop in writing short stories. You only write two stories the whole semester, and they will both be workshopped by your peers, so it does put a lot of pressure on those two weeks. I would recommend the class to people who are serious about writing and not afraid to get some strong criticism from their professor and their classmates. That said, this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale because it vastly improved my writing and it has caused me to seriously consider a career in fiction. You won't get a better professor than Caz.",
    "This is your typical workshop class, just with people who are really good at writing and literary criticism. Each week, two students present their short stories and the class and professor discuss. During the first half of the course, you provide written feedback for each story, and during the second half, there are a few writing exercises. You end up with 2 stories, only one of which is revised--it's somehow not as intense as intro fiction writing. As with all workshop classes, a lot depends on your fellow classmates--I found people well spoken and to the point in their criticism--but Caz is great. He can be harsh at times, but his comments are extremely accessible and spot on. He defines the writing process as something considerably less nebulous and touchy-feely than I have previously experienced, making the prospect of churning out a story seem less like a black hole. It's not a super dynamic class (this could have just been us), but it's great for your writing, and worth it to learn from him and your classmates.",
    "This was my first fiction workshop, so I can't really describe it in terms of other fiction workshops. I don't think I like being in a workshop. I also think it's important, if you take a workshop, to ensure that you are a writer outside of the workshop and not just a person who only writes for other people (for professors of writing especially). Although the exposure to other writers is good, and it is very valuable to have the help of Caryl Phillips, who is a great writer and teacher.I did not particularly enjoy this class or find it inspiring. I saw it as a way to get the help I knew I needed in my fiction writing, to develop my set of tools a little bit better. I didn't find the workshop experience-- sitting around the table describing in-progress work (almost all of which, my stuff included, was somewhat less good than it could have been because of the awareness that we were turning in rough drafts)-- particularly enjoyable. I think I would just die in an MFA program. Yet for all that, I really enjoyed being in class with Caz, and the powerful wake-up calls he gave me about my writing and what I could do to make it better. I feel reinvigorated to write with what I've learned. So, I admire and love the Caz's teaching, although I'm not sure how much I like the class. Give it some real thought. It may be helpful and even necessary to you, but for me going to workshop wasn't a thrill. Still, I think I am glad I did it.",
    "English 465 is a rigorous, advanced fiction workshop. Classes are conducted workshop-style, and students are expected to be serious and self-motivated. It's a challenging, rewarding, and ultimately very enjoyable class, but I would recommend it only to serious writers of fiction."
