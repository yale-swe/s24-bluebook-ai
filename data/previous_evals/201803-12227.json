    "Cannot force student participation - I think in the future there should be a rule that laptops are not allowed during class, but reading out loud should not be required.",
    "A more lively discussion would have been nice. The required reading did make sure that people were present and awake though!",
    "NB: I am a PhD student taking this course due to a scheduling conflict with the normal doctoral ethics course. However, (a) most if not all incoming PhD students this semester were in this course; (b) the standard doctoral ethics course was being taught in conjunction with the math department and was not specific to computer science; and (c) this course was also unsuitable for industry training. As such, I consider this criticism relevant. Ethical research and engineering is a serious problem right now in computer science for both academia and industry. The contempt shown for these concerns by the department in the size, scope, and seriousness of how education in relevant ethics is taught goes beyond disappointing to being disturbing. An ethics course should cover meaningful, practical questions likely to be faced by students in the coming years and decades. How do you handle collaboration and grant money originating from states with authoritarian governments? How to handle being asked to build facial recognition technology, or self-driving cars, or algorithms for making cash bail judgements, or content filters aimed at content deemed \"unseemly\"? These are not minor questions, and having a bunch of students (many with uncertain English fluency, which may be uncomfortable for them and\/or mitigate effectiveness of the lesson) read off slides about Therac-25 and simple, trite examples of academic dishonesty serves no useful purpose. I've personally worked in industry as a security engineer and the company I worked for undertook some actions around vulnerability disclosure that I considered ethically questionable. This course would have provided no relevant guidance to that situation. An ethics course should be a full semester, have readings and assignments (not to the extent of a full course perhaps, but not insignificant either), and be taught in conjunction with a relevant expert in scientific and engineering ethics (e.g., a historian, philosopher of science, or bioethicist), not exclusively by a research computer scientist. This course was frankly useless on the topic where it is perhaps most relevant for that not to be true. I'd strongly recommend the department take ethics more seriously. It's disturbing that I'm now considered to be \"educated\" on the topic from what was covered within this course.",
    "Overall good",
    "Okay",
    "It is a good course.",

    "N\/A",
    "Strengths: detailed explanations regarding each knowledge points. The course gives very wide coverage and told us how to behave ourselves in different situations."
