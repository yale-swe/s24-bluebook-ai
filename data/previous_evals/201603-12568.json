   "comments": [
    "I gained a greater understanding and appreciation of twentieth-century literature and the way that it expresses and reacts to political realities. I found the experience of writing the seminar paper to be challenging and extremely valuable, and the instructor was willing to help me think through initial stages of development.",
    "This class provided a helpful survey of the period it covers. But more than that, the instructor's engagement with the course materials helped inculcate a very strong, supple, and conceptually rigorous sense of the possibilities and affordances of a method of politically sensitive literary criticism that does not proceed from an anterior agenda, but emerges from an attunement to the assigned readings and their historical stakes and significance."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class had a very strong syllabus and did a great job encouraging participation. At times we might have benefited from clearer attempts to sketch relationships among the writers we covered -- stylistic, historical, or political. We might also have benefited from at least a few preliminary arguments about the period itsel, even if they were simply heuristic.",
    "We read a huge volume of work. Though I found most of it interesting, I often couldn't spend enough time on any one poem or novel to gain useful insights. Maybe I didn't approach this course correctly--maybe I wasn't meant to read everything, or I should've read selectively. But I did try to read everything and I think my contributions suffered as a result. Also, I wish we'd read some E.M. Forster, but that's of course subjective."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, certainly.",
    "Yes, I would, regardless of whether the student has a particular interest in this period. I say that because the course dealt deftly with large political themes and did a good job showing us how to read for those themes, how to engage a writer in his or her own terms, and how to distinguish and\/or relate aesthetic concerns to political ones."
