    "This is a really fascinating college seminar that is both intellectual and lighthearted. Professor Behre guides a discussion through centuries of skeptical thought and challenges to religious orthodoxy. I think it's a great course for both atheists\/agnostics and devour believers.",
    "good class, pretty chill. Readings were relatively reasonable and we had some interesting discussions in class. Dr. Behre is very good. perfect 5\/7 would take again",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the subject matter and want to discuss further, definitely take!",
    "One of the best decisions I've made at Yale. Take it!",
    "This is a history course about the origins of skeptical thought. A fair amount of reading but the discussions in class are really interesting. Professor Behre starts the class out with a theoretical question regarding atheism usually in the modern world. This class really forces you to think about how atheists are perceived today. We need more classes like this at Yale. Besides that, Professor Behre is a joy. Take it if you're at all interested in the subject and look over the syllabus.",
    "If you are an atheist, agnostic, or questioning believer, take this class. In fact, take it if you are deeply devout; it would have been great to have a challenging viewpoint. You will learn the history of western atheism from the ancient Greeks to the present day. Professor Behre is a good lecturer and a wonderful human being. Class is at its best when she gets discussion going. She is a role model for how to put your Yale education to use. My personal beliefs grew more mature and better-informed for having taken this class, and it prompted many amazing conversations with family and friends of all faiths. This is what a Yale seminar should be.",
    "This is not a class about the philosophy of Atheism, or why it is better\/worse or how it should be compared to modern-day religions at all. Rather, this class carefully looks at the history of the main ideas held by skeptics throughout Western History, and discusses these topics from various viewpoints and perspectives. Amazing class!"
