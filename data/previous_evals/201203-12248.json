    "Latin 3 requires a firm grasp of not only grammar but also history. If you are interested in the ancient military conquests of Caesar and classical civilization in general, you will be passionate about this class. Otherwise, I imagine it would be pretty tedious...",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course for a fellow student. I would summarize it as an excellent opportunity to gain a firmer grasp on Latin prose through reading Caesar as well as some Cicero and Tacitus.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Latin 131 to fellow students.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to improve their Latin prose comprehension.",
    "This is a great course for someone who has taken Latin before but wants to go over the basics again. You do as much review as you translate, and it is in a very comfortable environment."
