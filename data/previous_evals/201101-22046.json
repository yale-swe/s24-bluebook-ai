   "comments": [
    "The material for this course is interesting, and taking a class with Kang laoshi is a very unique experience. However, you must know that there is no way of knowing what your grade will be. The tests and quizzes do not always test your knowledge of the material. You will encounter random questions whose answers you and everyone will disagree with. But no matter how much you try, Kang laoshi will not listen to your reasons. Kang laoshi's criticism will be harsh, but don't take it too personally. Take this class if you want to keep on practicing Chinese, but keep in mind it will be a completely different experience from any other Chinese class at Yale.",
    "Absolutely - this is a great class that trains your ability to write in Chinese. I learned alot of vocabulary to describe specific situations such as how to describe a scene or a story.",
    "When I took it, majority heritage speakers. I had taken 4th yr, including time abroad, so I could keep up in class conversations, but reading and writing assigned essays took me considerably longer than most of my classmates, so I felt that in time alone, I was at a disadvantage. Also Kang Laoshi was not particularly interested in me and my work. If you don't mind that (I didn't), and if you're ready to write 7 two-page (single-spaced) essays in Chinese, go for it.",
    "I would only recommend it if you take it Credit\/D. The grading is a little ridiculous, and the workload can be intense if you are not 100% completely fluent native speaker. Will improve your Chinese writing for sure regardless of level.",
    "It depends on what you want to get out of an L5 Chinese class. It's definitely a significant amount of work, and your effort isn't necessarily reflected in your grade (unlike many other Chinese classes at Yale). If you're a native\/heritage speaker, you don't really learn that much, but if you're not a native\/heritage speaker, then you learn a lot in that class. Kang Laoshi is definitely interesting as a teacher, but he can be extremely frustrating at times because there is no discussion in class: his word is final. If you want to get better at writing, you definitely get a lot of practice, but again depending on your starting level, the comments and corrections he gives may or may not help you actually get better at writing."
