    "Good class! Be prepared to put in a lot of work though! That said though, the class has great structure and Professor Chen is a great teacher--very caring and competent. She'll go out of her way to make sure you learn Chinese to the best you can! Just do your best, and things will work out!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn more about Business in the realm of Chinese Commerce. It does help to understand a little bit about business concepts beforehand but it is not necessary by any means. If you take this class, be prepared for 6 essays and 6 oral reports (one every two weeks). The workload is really quite manageable and Chen laoshi is an absolute gem!",
    "YES",
    "Chinese for Global Enterprises is one of the best classes you can take with one of the best profs out there. It will give you practice with business\/economics related Chinese that is so useful if you plan to use Chinese in a career context later on down the road, or just be able to have intelligent discussions or understand newspapers and journals in Chinese. There are two major components to the class, which we do in alternating units. One is a textbook that takes case studies from Chinese companies, and the other is supplementary texts that are taken directly from real Chinese articles, ranging in topics from China's transitioning trade position to the stock market to fair trade and all kinds of things in between. We get regular writing practice and experience with presentations, as well as good practice reading and discussing texts. Chen Laoshi is amazing. She demanding but very supportive, super talented, and cares immensely about her students. She will basically just make your day, every day. I will continue recommend this class to everyone for as long as I am at Yale!"
