    "yeah. you improve your russian a lot in the way that you need to if you're a russian-speaking american.",
    "Like most classes at Yale, Russian 122 is what you make of it. You can do the minimum work that has to be turned in and maybe get a little better by being exposed to Russian on a weekly basis, or you can diligently study the grammar and improve soooo much. The workload isn't too bad most of the weeks, but you have to put in the time to study on your own to improve.",
    "A class specifically tailored for native Russian speakers. It addresses all the problems and challenges of learning to write well as a native speaker. Really fun, engaging, and interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It gives you a basis for Russian grammar, and develops reading and writing skills.",
    "Definitely recommend. It's a great course.",
    "This is a great class for heritage speakers who need to improve their writing - spelling, grammar, vocabulary... Everyone works at their own pace from where they started. I think that if you barely know how to write at all, it's tough at the beginning to catch up, and if you're already pretty advanced, it might be a bit boring throughout the semester listening to grammar and spelling tips. Otherwise, it's great - Julia is really laid back and an easy grader. If you want to finally improve your Russian, take the class!",
    "I thought the course was well taught. I had come in with conversational Russian; my writing and reading abilities were practically nonexistent and I had never taken formal Russian lessons beyond kindergarten. In a span of a few months, I was able to write about and read short stories and novellas. Professor Titus has been teaching for a long time and understands that everyone comes in with a different level of Russian, so the course is accessible to native speakers of all levels. Breaking up into two groups based on ability levels worked out well in the assignment of homework, but I would say that the group with less Russian language experience had quite a lot of work cut out for it (as would be expected). Overall, a great course if you want your Russian abilities to improve.",
    "RUSS 122 01 is designed for students whose native language is Russian. The course helps students to improve their language skills in writing, reading, grammar, and vocabulary.",
    "Lots of work, more than the average class. I improved a lot in my reading and writing. For grading, be prepared to be compared with students who came into the class knowing how to read\/write in Russian."
