    "Some language skills, including speaking and grammar.",
    "This was the first of the French modules where I felt I truly engaged with French grammar and with the material as a whole instead of just doing homework and taking tests. I've gained a more complete understanding of French through this class in particular, which makes it less daunting to go into French 140 with the knowledge I have now.",
    "I vastly felt my French improve.",
    "So much grammar!!! It was exceptionally helpful with si+ clauses and vocab.",
    "Greater proficiency with elements and nuances of the language in several different forms (writing, reading, spoken, and listening)",
    "I was able to learn a lot of French.",
    "I learned how to apply class material to a test, however do not feel as though what I learned can apply very much outside the classroom. I have a stronger grammar basis now, though.",
    "I gained more fluency in reading and writing, and expanded my vocabulary."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Course was overall poorly designed - in terms of language pedagogy there was a significant amount of understanding behind grammar and language missing, and the homework was not at all useful or engaging. Course could be improved by making homework active work instead of passive listening work, with more explanations and rules, etc. to guide understanding of a foreign language's grammar. Vocabulary, for example, could be learned through understanding of words in different contexts rather than through memorization or through familiarity with 1-2 texts.",
    "This is a good course for really forcing you to spend time with the material and really engaging in order to do well. It is rather difficult at time, but it is a good class that provides a good environment for learning - doesn't move too quickly, facilitates retention through repetition, etc. However, the workload is so intense at times that the class burns you out with about a month less to go and it makes it very difficult to keep the same level of engagement because you're so tired of it.",
    "The focus on grammar is great for the level and the texts are relevant. Mr. Curtis was wonderful and engaging. My one complaint is how outdated the homework is, I don't think the passive fill in the blanks are up to date with modern language pedagogy.",
    "Strengths: Super engaging. Everyone has to put a lot of effort into it Class material was good and relevant, although challenging I was never bored. Weaknesses: An A is a 94 not a 93! I wish we did even more speaking french THe redactions didn't count for much",
    "This course, in my opinion, was much more effective in improving my spoken French than previous classes. I would also say it gave me a more improved ear for the language. Some of the homework assignments, however, were a bit redundant.",
    "The strengths are that it obligates you to really drill difficult grammar concepts and understand them, however the rest of the course and everything we studied was solely to do well on the exams. I do not feel like I am able to apply what I learned outside of that. I also think there was not enough discussion in the class to help speaking ability.",
    "We started getting supplemental work to prepare for tests after maybe the second test. Doing this earlier in the semester would help.",
    "Much of the course material was dated or organized in a bizarre fashion. The class could use some updating.",
    "One of the weaknesses is that there is not much speaking throughout the course."

    "Great course for really solidifying your understanding of French as a language, in terms of grammar and sentence structure. Lots of work, kind of exhausting, likely necessary if you're taking it at all.",
    "Yea",
    "no. take an easier language.",
    "Yes! But I would warn them that French is very difficult and they should take Italian if they want something easier that will get them the same credit!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone hoping to improve their French skills. This class definitely helped me become a more confident speaker and listener.",
    "If your interested in taking a language where you can honestly improve your language skills, this course is good.",
    "If he or she enjoys the french language enough, then yes, because then it opens the door to take other french courses. Otherwise, it might be very unenjoyable.",
    "I'd recommend this to a student who is committed to French and has a consistent work ethic.",
    "It's a difficult class, but absolutely. As long as you put the work and effort in that the course demands, you will be successful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a good way to learn French and my skills have improved."
