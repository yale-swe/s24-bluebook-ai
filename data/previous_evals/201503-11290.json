   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone looking for an overview of Macro and International Econ concepts. Don't blow off the reading, the textbook (especially for Macro) is very helpful and will help you follow along in class better.",
    "It's a very informative class and Sigga is a great professor.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, with the caveat that they need to have a solid level of math background in order to learn from the models presented in the course.",
    "I would recommend this course with the caution that students need to be prepared to do more math than the syllabus indicates. Also, I would recommend previous knowledge or experience with macroeconomics or an explicit understanding that a significant amount of additional reading\/studying on the part of the student may be required to synthesize all the concepts covered in class.",
    "I would recommend this course as a refresher\/survey course in macroeconomics, international trade, and international finance for students with a strong interest or some background in those subjects. If you are interested in using the topics it covers in a future career, this class gives you the basis for further study in those subjects. I think it is especially useful for students who have taken more than just the basic \"Principles of Macroeconomics\" course - those who have learned the AD\/AS model before, for example."

   "comments": [
    "This course is essential for global affairs. Even for policy topics not directly related to economics, an understanding of the way macroeconomics and the international financial system work is necessary to understand why things happen in international relations. The class helped me grasp some of these economic concepts and improve my understanding of some of these international policy dynamics.",
    "This course will help me to somewhat better understand the macroeconomic factors at play in International Relations (exchange rates, trade, etc).",
    "As a student with less of a macroeconomics background, this course was an invaluable introduction to a range of subjects I plan to use in my future career."
