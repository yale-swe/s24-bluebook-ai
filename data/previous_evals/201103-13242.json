    "The seminar was terrible. It was incredibly narrowly focused, and it did not allow for enrichment of students in the division at all. Almost every lecture revolved around air pollution and lacked depth.",
    "Lectures were interesting overall. I was disappointed with the attendance by other students. Since formal attendance was not being taken, many students saw this as an opportunity to skip. Seeing as this is a required course for EHS students, it seems unfair that they can skip with no repercussions while other attend with diligence and this goes unrecognized.",
    "Standard seminar with guest lectures each week.",
    "I think that it may be good to expand the types of people and topics we see come in. It would be great to have some people from FES who are doing environmental work, many of us would be interested in a more broad definition of EHS, as opposed to just cancer and air pollution. If we could get more out of this box - I think attendance would be higher and students would enjoy the seminar more. I think part of this is a scheduling conflict - FES has their major Wednesday seminar at the EXACT same time, which MOST EHS students would like to attend, but we can't, because this seminar is at the same time. In addition, this seminar is of much less quality than the seminars and research presented there, so I think many people go over to see the FES one. We should have something as interesting, we are public health students and we're interested in health, but we really need to expand the definition of EHS.",
    "Varied from week to week. Some lecturers were great, others absolutely terrible.Since this seminar is required for EHS students someone should really be taking attendance. On any given class only about half of the students (sometimes less) would show up.",
    "The lectures were very similar to last year's. Thus, I didn't really learn anything new.",
    "This course has the potential to provide students with helpful insight into the Environmental research being performed at YSPH. It would be nice to see more research from Yale Forestry, though, as a lot of their work would certainly intrigue YSPH EHS students.",
    "Should NOT be required for second-year students. Much of the presentations and content is EXACTLY the same from year before.",
    "Fresh ideas, interesting topic, relaxed environment."

    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Dr. Zhu is incredibly approachable and tried to engage students in the lecture. However, since his responsibility was to design the calendar of guest speakers, his job was poorly done.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0He did a fair job in organizing everything. However, I found him to be very disrespectful to the presenters. He often had his phone out and was checking his email or texting during the lecture. This does not set a good example for the students. Moreover, the sound on his phone was often on, so you could hear him typing, etc. I find this to be very disrespectful to the presenters.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Interesting mix of speakers\/lectures; no other basis for evaluation",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Yong has done a good job running the seminar, however, he seems to bring in people who maybe he knows or maybe he finds personally interested. This seminar is supposed to be for the students, and I think it's been apparent this semester that most of the seminars have not interested students (lack of questions, lack of paying attention, etc).",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0I didn't really interact with him much, so I can't give an evaluation",
