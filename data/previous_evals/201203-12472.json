   "comments": [
    "Incredible books, basic and boring lectures, not-to-mildly-rewarding papers. I'd just read the stuff over the summer; the lectures don't have many added insights anyway, and you won't have to hurry so much.",
    "Dostoevsky in Translation is very much worth taking. You don't always read stuff this good at Yale.",
    "You could always read Dostoevsky by yourself but this course provides a wonderful setting in which to do so. Professor Brunson is a thought-provoking lecturer who also happens to be incredibly kind and approachable. Without the historical context and critical analyses that she provides, the experience of reading and writing about Dostoevsky may not have been as thrilling and rewarding as it was. I only wish that we could have covered more of his works.",
    "This is a very good survey course of Dostoevsky's writings. Professor Brunson gives very insightful and illuminating lectures. However, the readings are long and it is a lot of work to keep up.",
    "Definitely take this if you are ready to handle a LOT of reading but want to get familiar with Dostoevsky. The man is not only a writer, but definitely a thinker and philosopher--which makes this class so much more than a literature class. Professor Brunson delivers very sophisticated and complex lectures--I enjoyed them, but I see how it mightchallenge people who don't enjoy listening to an extremely literary oration for 50 minutes.",
    "This is an absolutely fantastic course; it's actually my favorite class that I took this semester. Molly Brunson is a goddess and has incredibly engaging lectures. From the first lecture in shopping period, she had me hooked on the class, and I knew I had to take it even though I literally knew nothing about Dostoevsky. She has a very insightful analysis on each book that we read, and she even connects the themes within the books to Russian contemporary cultural movements or historical events. Honestly, I couldn't say enough good things about this class. TAKE IT.",
    "The amount of reading for this class is really staggering. I fell behind early and never really caught up. That said, the reading is great. Professor Brunson's lectures were always good but never great. She handled background information well and always included some kind of interpretive analysis in her lectures. That said, she never shocked or surprised me. Her lectures felt dry and never inspired the kind of awe a writer like Dostoevsky deserves.",
    "Take it! Everyone needs to read Dostoevsky, and what better place and time to do it? This class is excellent, and Dostoevsky will help make your dark and broody college years a little darker and broodier.(Just do the reading on time.)",
    "I can't recommend this course enough, it was the best class I've ever taken. PLEASE take it if you have any interest in Dostoevsky\/have never read any of his works before!",
    "Dostoevsky is SO much fun. If you keep up with the reading. If not, you'll feel anxious, won't get anything out of section and won't fully appreciate lectures. A course like this, with 3 very manageable papers and a final, is thus a slippery slope: there are not real penalties for not reading. That being said: Professor Brunson is a superb lecturer, you'll learn a bit about Soviet imagery, and you'll get to read EXQUISITE BOOKS. Just take it for the books.",
    "Yes absolutely. A great opportunity to read Dostoevsky's works and have a good professor explain what is going on in them.",
    "If you've ever ever been interested in reading Dostoevsky and haven't had the motivation to read anything of his on your own, this is the perfect course for you. Every single page I read in this was absolutely terrific, and I'm so glad to do it. TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a lot of work, but it's even more rewarding. Even though there's a ton of reading, it's very worthwhile and it'll help you think about life in a new way. Dostoevsky is amazing, Prof. Brunson was great, and if you get a great TF like Vadim, you're set! Take this class!!!",
    "Definitely. If you are a bibliophile, like I am, you should definitely take a literature course. And since I recommend reading Dostoevsky to almost everyone, I would say that the experience is better with an expert explaining things. There is a lot of reading, but as it's enjoyable, treat it as a break from all of your other classes. You'll have no trouble keeping up."
