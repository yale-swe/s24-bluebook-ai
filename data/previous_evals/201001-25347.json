    "This is a body-centric and textual study of the past 50-60 years of dance in america. We read shcolarly articles as well an choreophers biographies, watch dance films, and perform some kind of movement study each class, whether its yoga-centric, hard-core cardio, really intimate weight sharing exercises, etc. He even brings in a few dancers from famous dance companies (okay, i didnt know they were famous before the course, but trust me, youll learn what a craaaaaazy opportunity this is) to teach master classes near the end of the year. We even went to see a performance in new york one weekend. I would definitely recommend this class to another student- i mean, really, when are you going to get the chance to express yourself through dance, to get credit at YALE for meeting in a dance studio in sweats twice a week, and telling your sotry through dance. and the cahnce to do all of this without the requirement of dance experience or knowledge at all??? seriously, TAKE THIS COURSE. It's one of those you need to take before leaving Yale, and if you do not, you should really regret missing such a great opportunity.",
    "This is a great class! You actually dance and even learn several different styles from guest dance teachers. Prof. Tracy is fun and very nice. Class each day consists of a discussion of the dance style you are studying, perhaps a screening, then a chance to put that theory into practice by doing your own choreography.Take this class. It was always fun and I left every class smiling.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in dance! However, there still is work for this class. Class time takes up more than 3.5 hours per week, and there are lots of readings and videos that you have to find time to watch.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Seriously. I'm not kidding. I don't care if you've never done a dance step in your life. It will expand your ability to collaborate and think creatively, and will be all-around AWESOME. Plus, Professor Tracy is fantastic."
