   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class. The readings are engaging and, really, it's all the stuff you should be reading in the spare time that Yale life has taken away from you. Rolf Potts is a great instructor - he gives good feedback, grades fairly, and goes on all of these awesome international adventures. The class featured a series of guest speakers who are working writers, which was probably my favorite part. You have to write five essays (each of which has a first draft that you turn in). I didn't think that the workload was bad at all, and in fact, the essays are fun to write. (Or maybe not 'fun' but definitely worthwhile).",
    "It can be fun. It can be rough. Do it if you feel like it.",
    "LOVE this class--a classic, must-take course while at Yale!",
    "I totally recommend this class. Your writing becomes so much more natural, creative, and honest.",
    "Pretty much any Yale student would benefit from taking English 120, and Rolf Potts is a great teacher. This is a class that will teach you about writing, improve your skills, and also teach you a few things about yourself if you're doing it right.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENGL 120 to anyone who wants to improve their writing. It's fascinating and definitely worthwhile.",
    "Definitely take this class before graduating, it's one of the more famous courses that Yale offers and rightly so. No matter what your major is, the ability to express yourself in your writing is an invaluable skill regardless of your eventual employment. It will make you notice things in writing that you would not have noticed before, and will make you more critical of your own writing, even if its just emails."
