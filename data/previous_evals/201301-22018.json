    "Yes. But only with Farina.",
    "This class requires you to be able to learn on your own. Professor Farina is amazing--he really is--but the expectation (which is definitely not explicit) is that you learn Italian on your own and apply it\/refine it in class. That said, this was by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I really liked my classmates, the way in which we learned the culture of Italy, our discussions on everything from polemic political issues to our creation of stories, and how we watched films and went to the YUAG. It was a great experience, truly. You won't regret taking this class with Michael.",
    "This is a really awesome course and a great way to learn Italian quickly. The actual class time is fun, and the homework, while lengthy, is not painful.",
    "I highly recommend this course. However, due to the rapid progression through the curriculum, students with no prior exposure to a Romance language should NOT take this course. This course assumes an understanding of grammar and syntax that, in my opinion, only comes with having studied another Romance language."
