    "Understanding of metrics challenges and basic construction of a metric",
    "This class was highly applicable for me, as I'm interested in working in sustainability strategy for food companies. I learned how to think through materiality assessment, stakeholder engagement, sustainable investment strategies, true value accounting, and developing relevant metrics to test a solution to a problem. Through relevant guest speakers, I saw how practitioners in the field apply these skills in their work.",
    "How to build and execute metrics for corporate responsibility.",
    "This is a very practical course which teaches you about the frameworks you will use as a sustainability professional to build metrics and ways to think about sustainability metrics more broadly.",
    "How to make metrics and indicators, starting from the stakeholder, all the way to a concrete, measurable metric. Lots of insight into ESG concepts, the financial side of sustainability. Lots of learning about corporate sustainability in general.",
    "Practical tools in measuring sustainability challenges and working toward solutions.",
    "Very useful knowledge on sustainability",
    "This course was useful in providing tools and methods for measuring corporate environmental performance. It gave an insight into the concept of materiality and how this plays out in investment decisions by investors. The course also explored how companies prioritize issues that are material and the standards for reporting."

    "Todd is a great teacher (as I'll discuss below), and brought in very relevant guest speakers to show the applicability of the concepts we learned in class. It would be great if the last two assignments were a bit more spread out, and if there was an introduction for each assignment at least three weeks in advance.",
    "Strengths: very practical knowledge, good projects. Weaknesses: Boring, a little too much listing things out, could go into a little more depth.",
    "Strengths - insight into corporate structure and decision making, based on the metrics they think are important. Weaknesses - assignments were not well aligned with course content.",
    "The bulk of the course are the four projects, which allow application of topics covered in class. The projects are useful, and I think the level of engagement and effort given to the project determines how much students get out of the course overall.",
    "Maybe explain the cases a bit more and give concrete examples"

    "Take this course if you want to learn how to set sustainability targets for corporations, which many sustainability management jobs will require.",
    "It's a very useful course",
    "Be prepared with more than enough questions , i.e. know what you really want to get from the class and go for that aspect , because it's so wide and applies to every facet of society."
