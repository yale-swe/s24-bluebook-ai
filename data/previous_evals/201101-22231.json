    "I very much enjoyed this course. Alexandrov's lectures were useful and professional and the texts were of course magnificent. You know what you're getting with this one: you read a lot of Tolstoy and talk about it. Worth taking for sure.",
    "Professor Alexandrov is quoted on the book jacket of your translation of War and Peace - no big deal. He's one of the world's preeminent Tolstoy scholars and a wise, engaging lecturer. You'll read War and Peace, Anna Karenina, some novellas, and some short stories. You'll enjoy every second of it, too. The class is surprisingly diverse: we had Russian majors, Literature majors, Physics majors, Math majors.",
    "Solid Lit class with a big mix of people--science people taking it Credit\/D\/Fail, English types, grad students, random middle-aged people. Appeals to a wide range of people. There is a reason why it is one of the cornerstone courses at Yale.",
    "This course is really wonderful. It's not worth it if you aren't going to read the books, but if you are, it's amazing. Professor Alexandrov is so knowledgeable and passionate about Tolstoy, it infects the students. He is a riveting lecturer and so smart you can almost feel the waves of intelligence radiating from him. This is a GREAT course, for people who want to be literature majors and for those who have never taken a lit course. Definitely take this at some point in your Yale career.",
    "Tolstoy was an incredible course. You get to read two of the greatest novel in the Western Canon, and directed in your reading by a fabulous professor. Professor Alexandrov's lectures were always captivating, but not in the showy manner common to many celebrity professors. My TA was also very good, and I feel that writing the two papers helped deepen my understanding of the readings. The reading is heavy, as it must be, but consistently enjoyable.",
    "DEFINITELY recommend. One of the best classes I've taken. These are absolute classic works, but there's no way I would have gotten this much out of them without Professor Alexandrov's lectures. He's truly a master of the subject. This is probably the only class I've taken at Yale that I would say is even worth auditing, if you don't want to take it for credit- it's that good. It is a TON of reading, but totally worth it. Big sense of accomplishment for finishing it all.",
    "If you ever wanted to read Tolstoy and really get what he's trying to say- take this class.",
    "LIT206, Tolstoy, is a great class for anyone wanting to read two gigantic works of Russian literature, or to become very familiar with Tolstoy. I wouldn't recommend it to any student who's reading-shy, because there's a lot of reading, and I, an English major, even had trouble keeping up. It's spread out pretty nicely, so as long as you don't fall behind on any given week, you'll be okay. The lectures are generally good, although not the best I've had at Yale (as some people will likely suggest). Prof. Alexandrov is fun to listen to, and gives a good atmosphere for reading Russian lit.",
    "A great intro to Tolstoy! If you like literature, I would highly suggest taking the course. There is a lot of reading, but if you read Anna Karenina over spring break, the second half of the semester is much easier.",
    "If you ever wanted to read Tolstoy, then yes! The lectures help you get more out of the books than if you were to read them on your own. Not much written work for the class (2 papers on topics of your choice and a final that will pose no problems at all if you show up and stay awake in lecture). The reading load is intense though. Don't take it if you don't think you'll read (that's the point of the class).",
    "If you want to read War and Peace and Anna Karenina, which are two great books, I can't think of a better way than taking this course. Apart from the reading, there isn't much work. If you enjoy the books a lot, the papers will be easy. And if you've read the books, then the final is really easy.",
    "If you want a good excuse to read Tolstoy, take this! Professor Alexandrov makes the works seem very accessible and gives you a great road map for reading them. I know I will read War& Peace and Anna Karenina again and get even more out of them, as he provided me with a great foundation. I wish I had taken the course credit\/d as a non-lit major but if you want more accountability for keeping up with the readings, don't do that. That said, you will have to devote your entire life to this course if you take it for a grade because the reading is so intense.",
    "YES TAKE THIS COURSE. I took it as a second-semester senior, which I would highly recommend. When you look at the numbers, it's ton of reading, but it never feels like it when you're in class. You WANT to keep up with the reading because a) it's great stuff, and who doesn't want to be able to say they read War and Peace and Anna Karenina in one semester and b)Professor Alexandrov will literally give some of the best lectures you've ever heard at Yale. The final is long but all essay-style IDs, which are easily recognizable, and there isn't a midterm. There are two short papers, instead, both of which are not a huge burden. The most important thing is, though, is the material and lectures are fun, engaging, and make you feel smarter. Take it, you'll love it!",
    "This course was fantastic. I would certainly recommend it to another student! Professor Alexandrov is a captivating lecturer and a great guide through the best of Tolstoy's literature. Reading War and Peace and Anna Karenina may seem daunting, but it is a fulfilling challenge and the stories are enthralling. This is one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Prof. Alexandrov is a fantastic lecturer who will lend you very meaningful and interesting insights into the literature he teaches. Be careful and ask around about the TAs, though - grading can seem pretty arbitrary and some sections are dreadful and awkwardly silent.",
    "Great Class. It doesn't seem like a lot of reading, but it's easy to fall behind (and not easy to catch up once you have) so stay on top of it all. Professor Alexandrov gives some great insights into the world\/life\/mind of Tolstoy.",
    "Great course! Professor Alexandrov's lectures add a lot of insight to the reading. The War and Peace weeks have the most reading, at around 250\/week, but it's all enjoyable. If you read Anna Karenina over Spring Break, then you won't have much work for this course after Spring Break until you have to write the second paper and read a few more short stories at the end.",
    "Great class. Don't take it credit-d like I did, because you won't finish the books and they are definitely worth finishing. It is an amazing course and not too difficult at all, so you should take advantage of the opportunity to do these readings. I did not put any time into the class and really regret it. If you work for it and are willing to read these books in full, do it.",
    "If you've always wanted to read Anna K or War and Peace, now is your chance. You'll get a lot more out of them if you take it was Alexandrov as your guide, plus you'll probably actually finish them. Lectures are great! Also, read most of Anna K over spring break so you don't fall behind.",
    "Literature 206 is a survey ofTolstoy's works that includes selected short stories, War and Peace, and Anna Karenina. The most intensive work is the reading, as there are only two papers and an easy but interesting final (if you read everything!). The professor is one of the best at Yale and gives amazing lectures. The TAs are all very eager to help and the section is rewarding. I would recommend this class to any student at Yale who enjoys reading and wants to read some of the most challenging (length-wise) books in the Western canon. Yes, War and Peace and Anna Karenina are long, but they fly by, because they are insanely well written and the characters stay with you long after you have read the final page.",
    "Take it! You'll read wonderful books and be pushed to think about them. Also, Alexandrov's lecturing style is both tremendously compelling and weirdly hypnotic.",
    "Do not take this class. Read Tolstoy on your own. I found out part way through the course that I really dislike Tolstoy, which made this class unbearable. It's not even worth a CR\/D\/F as a senior. Please, don't do it.",
    "Tolstoy is a solid course. The pool of students taking it was incredibly mixed. Section was sort of a mess because of the diversity. And Professor Alexandrov's lectures were great but had a fair amount of introductory and simplistic content.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for any student willing to dot he work. It is true that there is really a lot of reading. And, this class is either satisfying nor doable without keeping up on the reading. But, if you are able to keep thereading under control, it is one of the more fulfilling classes at Yale.",
    "This is an extensive introduction to Tolstoy. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes. Readings are captivating, and Alexandrov's insights on the text are illuminating and beautiful.",
    "TAKE IT. Best course\/lecture you will take at Yale, regardless of your major.",
    "Yes! I'd say you get to read some superb works and have them backed up by these wonderful lectures that I (at least) would choose to go to just for fun! Also, a really wonderful teaching fellow! But be ready for a lot of reading!",
    "Definitely take it! It is the epitome of alife-changing Yale course. If you want to see a passionate and brilliant instructors and read groundbreaking literature, there is no need to think twice.",
    "You read War and Peace, Anna Karenina, and some Tolstoy short stories. I'm not a Lit person at ALL,but I really enjoyed this class. W&P and AK are absolutely must-reads; take it for them! Alexandrov is also a good lecturer.",
    "Take it! A great course. Professor Alexandrov really knows his stuff, and his lectures are interesting and engaging. He not only analyzes themes and symbols in the text, but gives historical context in Tolstoy's life for those themes and symbols. The course involves a LOT of reading (200-300 pages a week), but it'sall really good reading that you should probably aim to read at some point in your life anyway. Try to read Anna Karenina over spring break.",
    "This is a terrific introduction to the Tolstoyan canon, and a course that is not to be missed at Yale. Thousands of pages of reading, but every one is worth it with Prof. Alexandrov's guidance through the mystery of Tolstoy. The material is captivating and the professor could not be better or more brilliant. Take this course.",
    "A good class. The workload is by no means unmanageable, especially if you do your best to keep up with the reading. Professor Alexandrov is a good lecturer. His modes of textual analysis can get a bit 'small-scale', thereby obscuring the greater meaning of Tolstoy as a thinker and artist. That being said, his way of interpreting a text is probably a helpful one, especially when coming up with paper topics. However, the real value of this class is in the reading, in Tolstoy, and in what you take with you beyond the last lecture, paper, and final exam."
