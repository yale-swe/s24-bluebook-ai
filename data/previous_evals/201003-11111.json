    "The students gained a lot from the discussions in class, and were able to utilize the expertise of their colleagues for research.Also, the class is able to attract students outside History of Science, History of Medicine, and the diversity makes the class much more interesting.I strongly recommend HSHM 706 to another student.",
    "This course examines the practices and frameworks of collecting nature over the course of the 16th to the 21st century. Each week one book frames the discussion, which often opens up a range of issues related to collections, to scientific practice, and to cultural history. Field trips to Yale collections also form an important part of this course, one which makes the issues discussed truly come alive. I would highly recommend this course to specialists and nonspecialists alike. The material is engaging, the books are interesting, and its appeal to people from a range of backgrounds promotes provocative interdisciplinary discussion."

    "The research paper for the seminar could develop into a chapter of my dissertation, or possibly, become the launchpad to think of a possible topic for my dissertation. It has provided me with an opportunity to write up the research done over the summer and fall, and identify areas for further research.",
    "As a non-specialist in History of Science, this course provided me with a great deal of new knowledge about the practice of natural history, in particular. However, as my work often looks at empire, exploration, and collecting, the topics covered deepened my knowledge of these topics.My own research incorporates a history of collecting, and this course gave me the opportunity to explore those issues in a more focused manner than I had previously been able to do. I found writing the research paper fulfilling and likely will help inform part of my dissertation and future research.",
    "As a historian taking her first history of science course, this course was a fantastic introduction to the questions and methods of historians of science. One aspect I found new and extremely helpful was our discussions of how knowledge was created across time from collections--this in particular seemed like a discussion that I would have been exposed to only in a history of science course. More generally, I found this course to be a useful lesson in reviewing secondary works and in asking creative questions of primary sources. This course has contributed greatly to my dissertation research: I plan to work the research I did for Professor Strasser's seminar paper into a chapter of my dissertation. There are new questions I will be able to explore in my research, thanks to the enriching discussions we had in \"Collecting Nature\" led by Professor Strasser."
