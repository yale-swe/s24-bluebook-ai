   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I definitely developed many critical skills for executing experiments. The course gave insight to all aspects of experimentation, including learning the history, performing the experiment, collecting and analyzing the data and then communicating the data through a lab report and\/or paper. I also found many of the skills that I gained to be helpful in conducting research in labs outside of the classroom.",
    "I learned how to dissect sheep brains",
    "I learned how to dissect brains in three plans, simulate action potentials in various ways modulating different parameters, and use equipment and computer programs to record data from the nervous systems of earthworms, cockroaches, and crayfish. I learned quite a lot about the structure of the brain and all its component parts, and also what brain functions these components are important for. I also learned about action potentials in incredible depth, at a level of detail and nuance that I did not previously know existed. And I learned a bit about the structure and function of the nervous systems of the worms, cockroaches, and crayfish mentioned before. I also learned how to analyze the data consisting of nerve signals recorded. This is a very brief summary of things we learned in this course, and leaves quite a lot out. There is much more that is covered in the lecture portions of class that I did not mention here.",
    "Understanding of neural anatomy and electrophysiology principles",
    "I developed a more informed understanding of how the scientists work. The in-class labs were really helpful for developing very specific but helpful skills in animal experimentation.",
    "This class allows students to dive into the science of psychology and neuroscience through lab experience."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was really strong in that it helped you learn difficult concepts through experimentation and learning first-hand. In this way, I felt that I gained a better grasp of the difficult neuroscience concepts. Some of the labs were very long, however, and I felt that it may be better to slowly go through a shorter lab and learn more accurately than to have to rush through a long one.",
    "Great course! The labs are a lot of fun, and totally manageable. Sometimes I was a little uncertain as to how the lecture content actually matched up with the labs. I only wish that there was more time spent working with the invertebrate preparations. I had a lot of fun with this part of the course and would have really enjoyed a few more weeks of performing these data collections.",
    "The strength is in the experimentation portion of the class. We got to work with some really cool organisms (sheep brain, cockroach leg, earthworms, crayfish). The weakness is that the lectures at the beginning tend to run long and are generally pretty boring and repetitive of information we've all learned from other classes. The class could be improved by making the whole period experimentation and learning through the labs rather than before them.",
    "It can be improved by allowing more collaborative work among students and encouraging the exchange of ideas beyond lab partners. A strong sense of camaraderie was definitely missing in the course which might have contributed to more polarised results.",
    "I really enjoyed the balance between the lectures and laba. It was well planned to allow for enough preparation before each lab and then hands-on experience in the actual lab experiments."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I learned a lot and had fun at the same time. Seeing as it was more hands-on than most classes, the time went by much more quickly than it would in a normal lecture.",
    "Take it! Donegan is a great instructor who really cares about teaching this material. Lab reports are very straight forward. Overall, a great neuroscience lab\/lecture that is not too terribly challenging so long as you are attentive and engaged during the labs.",
    "This course is much harder than the alternatives, so I probably would not recommend it since you will likely get a better grade in an equivalent research methods class.",
    "Yes, this is a great course that you can learn a lot from in a sort of exploratory way. A large portion of the learning you do in this class is through the labs each week, and Professor Donegan designs the course to be very effective in this respect. The workload is definitely manageable and relatively enjoyable. If you're interested in neuroscience, this is definitely a worthwhile class.",
    "Yes",
    "If they need to take it for their course requirements I would. Otherwise not particularly.",
    "This is a great option for the research methods classes for psych majors!"
