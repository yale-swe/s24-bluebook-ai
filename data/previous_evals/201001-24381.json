   "comments": [
    "Yeah. basically 0 workload.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you are interested at all in economic history. I didn't know much about it before taking the class, but it became clear that there are a number of topics that are applicable today and you get to read papers by economists who are extremely relevant now - such as Bernanke and Romer. The papers reflect the readings for class and the final examination is comprehensive and fair. A good class for economics major especially. History majors and others interested in the historical element might find it a bit technical.",
    "",
    "Take this class only if you are looking for an easy econ credit without problem sets and if you have already taken econometrics or statistics. You'll realize by the end of the class that attending the lectures is not really necessary as the two papers are only mildly related to the reading and the final topic questions are given in advance.",
    "I do not recommend. It's not hard but that doesn't even make the class worth it.",
    "A great course - delves into all the major aspects of American Economic History. Comprehensive without being superficial.",
    "it's ok overall but gets really boring at times. No clear focus and a lot of statistics\/econometrics involved",
    "the benefit of this class is that there were no problem sets, only two papers, and the final exam questions were given to you before hand. however, these pluses were far outweighed by an indifferent, inexperienced ta and a very confusing and frustrating class structure. by the final, nearly half of the class still had no idea what any of their grades were from the two previously handed in papers.",
    "Interesting lectures if you like economic history. However, if you aren't experienced with econometrics, you will struggle with the assignments. If you aren't an econ major, I'd take it credit-D.",
    "American Economic History is a class unlike any other at Yale. The unique mathematical and statistical approach to history is fascinating, but unfortunately it is beyond the grasp of most Yale history majors. The one thing that I would stress is the immense amount of prerequisites in mathematics, economics, and statistics that the class requires. DO NOT take this class unless you are comfortable running regressions and doing statistical analysis. For the economists, on the other hand, this may be a good class, since Professor Chabot is fairly approachable and lenient in his grading. The lectures tend to be tedious, however, and the readings are all fairly boring economics articles."
