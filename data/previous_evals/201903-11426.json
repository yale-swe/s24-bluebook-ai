    "DEFINITELY TAKE A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR ELBOUSTY! He is a genius in his field and you will never ever encounter such a passionate Arabic teacher! He loves his classes and research and within the first minute of meeting him, it becomes apparent. The course is put together in an amazing manner, which leaves a lot of flexibility for you and your fellow classmates to take it in whatever direction you want. The learning environment is very inclusive and you touch on many relevant topics that are very useful to know in Morrocan. I have never laughed this much in a Yale class and that is what makes this course extremely distinct. You get to learn from your peers a lot and the group work is very fun. Do not hesitate for a second when it comes to classes delivered by Professor Elbousty!",
    "Rigorous moroccan darija dialect- studied in detail the grammar and vocab of Moroccan Arabic and how it relates to MSA",
    "I learned a lot about Moroccan culture and how different Moroccan Arabic is from Modern Standard Arabic.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in learning Arabic beyond grammar. Through learning Morrocan Arabic, I got a deeper understanding of the Morrocan culture, as well as differences and similarities between different dialects."

    "Professor Elbousty always goes out of his way to assist his students and is a model of how every professor should be. I strongly believe that he should receive an award for being an exemplary model of what a professor teaching undergrads should be like at Yale. I have never seen a professor at Yale put this much effort into his classes and he should definitely get recognition for this. It is also amazing how he remains in his office until around 11 pm nearly on a daily basis! His doors are always open for his students and he encourages us to use office hours if we have any issues. As far as I recall, there was not even one time over the past three years when I left from his class not smiling or not looking forward to the next class, even on days when we had exams! It is easy to say that he remains to be the best professor I came across at Yale! If you are thinking of taking an Arabic course, definitely take it with Professor Elbousty, especially if you want to hone on your literary skills he is among the worlds top Arabic professors and is widely respected by leading scholars in the field especially in the Arab World. I expect him to get full tenure at Yale over the next year - that simply tells you how good he is and he fully deserves it! All the students love Professor Elbousty and that is for a reason!",
    "Great structure to the grammar and vocab learning, could have been more discussion of Moroccan politics etc but great class",
    "There could be more opportunities to promote retention of the material"

    "The quality of teaching we received from Professor Elbousty was second to none. He knew his stuff extremely well and always came to class very prepared to deliver the material. We learned a huge variety of literary skills in Moroccan and were introduced to many useful topics. Everyone in the class was open to different interpretations and this opened the door for lots of constructive and fruitful debate. Through this class, we were able to learn how to speak in Moroccan close to fluency - it was even better than the few classes I took during my summer in Morocco. We discussed many topics using the dialect ranging from the family to describing directions. In addition, Professor Elbousty teaches in a very accessible manner, which means that we had students with varying abilities in the class!",
    "Yes, if you have the requisite MSA background and want to dive into dialects then do it!",
    "Yes, it was a very enjoyable course.",
    "Yes. Please take this class because Ustath Jonas is one of the most amazing professors you will meet at Yale. He makes your learning process easier, and more fun! I encourage you to learn about different Arabic dialects beyond the grammar and vocabulary of the classical Arabic language, and this class is just the perfect fit for that. Since this is a small seminar, you will also get the chance to challenge yourself, participate, ask questions and get to know your professors and classmates well."
