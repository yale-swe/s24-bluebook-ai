    "If you are interested in art history and in British history, this class will be perfect.",
    "Yes. Do it if you're interested in art and music in GBR.",
    "A good overview of British art and music from 1500 to modern day.",
    "This course is interesting and covers a huge range of time and material. Professor Barringer is fantastic. Every lecture is different and engaging. The balance of looking at images and listening to music makes class move very quickly. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "Such an enjoyable class! If you are interested in Britain, I don't see how you cannot love this class. I feel a lot more cultured too and can tell you all about British composers (something I knew practically nothing about before). THere's too much reading, but honestly you don't have to do it all.",
    "It really is a great class. Shopping it, you'll find just what you'll be covering. It's difficult to summarize here."
