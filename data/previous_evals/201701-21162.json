   "comments": [
    "General introductory statistical knowledge at a reasonably rigorous level.",
    "I learned how to think about extend the knowledge that I developed about probability in STAT 241 to data sets and to think about things statistically. We also learned how to derive things from scratch, which was cool. Some of the coolest things we did in the class were maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratios.",
    "I learned more about the details of statistical methods, why they work, and where they came from.",
    "Insight into the nature of statistical tests and results",
    "I gained a solid theoretical foundation of statistics and the methods that were used in developing the tools that we use today.",
    "Good course to develop statistical theory. Great follow up to 241 and it is simply a must take for upper division courses.",
    "Basic knowledge of statistics.",
    "I gained a more theoretical perspective of the statistical tests by taking this course, understanding the motivation for the procedures of certain statistical tests as well as how various tests are related to each other.",
    "Knowledge: maximum likelihood estimators, linear regressions, statistical distributions, analyzing means and variances of various parameters Skills: developed my ability to apply calculus and linear algebra to statistical distributions insights: the value of statistical theory, which it took almost all course to really appreciate",
    "I thought this was a pretty great course. I learned a lot about different hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, testing different models, and a review of Stat 241. The psets were not too much work, and the exams were fair.",
    "Honestly, not a lot. This class was pretty impenetrable.",
    "Lots of theory in class but homework problems are mainly calculations.",
    "I've learned how to create predictive functions.",
    "Generic introduction to statistical techniques, parameter estimation, maximum likelihood measures, hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, etc.",
    "I learned the various theories of different statistical models. I did not learn what their relative benefits\/weaknesses as well as I would have liked.",
    "I gained a deeper knowledge of the theory of statistics.",
    "You learn the theoretical underpinning of statistics. Useful for informing you on how to think about statistics in the future.",
    "Knowledge of underlying mathematics behind statistical concepts",
    "I learned the basics of statistics, and key concepts of how to use and implement statistical tools.",
    "Deeper understanding of statistics - principles of parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, etc. More generally, the course was a good opportunity to gain further general mathematical experience.",
    "A deeper theoretical and intuitive understanding to statistics work",
    "I learned about the fundamentals of statistical theory, as, I suppose, was the intention. I developed a deeper intuition for how certain tests are constructed and why they are valid, which I find incredibly useful.",
    "I learned the basic mathematical foundations of statistics--precisely as the course title suggests.",
    "I got a foundation in statistics and data analysis that built on the probablity theory I learned last semester.",
    "Well we perfected the skill of algebraic manipulation, which is what a lot of the homework required to prove results whose practical application, need, or derivations were never well explained in class. The textbook was excellent though, a saving grace considering how pathetic the rest of the class was and how we learned barely anything in lecture. Oh wait but we did learn some new skills! Manipulating data sets with R and Minitab - not in the classroom though. Why, you ask? Because we had a series of 3-4 homework assignments which required us to analyze data using R, WITHOUT being taught how to do it in this class. Now a very fair question to ask is, \"Well isn't that fair game if STAT 230 is a prereq for STAT 242?\" Well.. it's not.",
    "In STAT 242, we learned a number of different commonly used and important methods for statistical inference. These methods were all derived using mathematics and probability theory, so we also learned the mathematical foundations of such methods. Overall I learned a bunch of useful tools for analyzing data.",
    "This was a great course that really solidified for me the transition between probability and statistics. I learned a lot of the proofs underlying distributions and statistical tests, which was definitely better than memorizing formulas.",
    "The class was divided into several components: 1. We began with a review of the Central Limit Theorem and other topics from probability. 2. We then proceeded to an in-depth look at various estimators: the method of moments estimators, maximum likelihood estimators, and Bayesian estimators. 3. Next, we spent several weeks looking at hypothesis testing -- one-sided and two-sided T-tests ... 4. The next weeks were spent on ANOVAs. 5. We concluded by studying linear regression for several weeks."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Kind of a mediocre course. Barron is an average lecturer, not always super clear and goes on tangents. Textbook is terrible. The general outline of what is taught is fine, but a better textbook would be good.",
    "Homeworks were good; class was difficult to follow. Presentation of material felt disorganized, exams were too easy and too few- not enough opportunity to distinguish true understanding from little mistakes unrelated to understanding => could be stressful.",
    "This class was taught pretty well, and the assignments were a good level. The exams were very fair.",
    "I felt that the lectures could use a significant amount of work. They were not particularly engaging and very easy to get lost in if you stop paying attention for a little bit. I also feel that the data analysis section at the end of the course should be done in class with R, not with minitab. The vast majority of students do have macs, and its a huge pain to have to deal with a software that few use outside of the class.",
    "Barron is not a great lecturer. The material is interesting, but I often found myself very bored in class.",
    "It was not very interesting, unfortunately. I found it very hard to be engaged during lecture. I'm not really sure how this course can be improved, because I do not believe that I understand the subject matter\/applications of it well enough to know how it could be taught better. Mostly it was frustrating because for the majority of the course, I did not know why we were learning what we did-- for a portion of the course it had obvious real world applications, but a lot of it was hard to find meaningful.",
    "A definite strength was the weighting on the homework: I don't think anyone skipped the homework or tried to do things last minute. I think that the weakness of the course was that we moved rather quickly in class, often with assumed understanding, and random cold-calling that wasn't so productive.",
    "The homeworks were out of a textbook, I think it would have been nice for the professor to be more engaged in this front of the class. The homework felt like busywork at times.",
    "The board was kind of hard to see in Dunham Lab, maybe moving the class to a different room would make lecture better.",
    "Highly theoretical. Not a strength or a weakness, but I feel like Professor Barron struggled to emphasize the value of this theory and why we would want to know it well.",
    "This is a pretty straight forward course. You go to lecture, take notes, read the book to fill in gaps, and do the psets.",
    "This class is not hard but is extremely boring and taught in a fairl uninspired way. Even simple concepts were over complicated.",
    "Course could use a better syllabus and maybe some accompanying notes. Expectations were clear and the course was straightforward, however.",
    "There could have more help hours with a TA or peer tutors. I had a hard time tying together lecture material to the homework.",
    "Lectures weren't very helpful and pretty confusing. Homework was very different from the lectures.",
    "strengths: straightforward, fair exams weaknesses: massive amount of topics covered",
    "This course could be improved by a 1) better textbook 2) more conceptual knowledge to make sure we understand the tools and what their relative benefits are and 3) professor barron talking about this more in class.",
    "Although a bit more straightforward than STAT 241, this class is not great. Professor Barron's lectures are disorganized and not really helpful, and the TFs sleep through class and are not capable or willing of any kind of instruction.",
    "This course did what it set out to do well: impart theoretical knowledge to students.",
    "The professor is not good at organizing his thoughts. He is clearly brilliant at the subject however.",
    "The weakness of this class was the fact that the blackboard was always dirty and the lighting in the room was very poor so it was hard to see from the back.",
    "This course could have been better structured and have a more focused set of lecture notes.",
    "I thought the pace of the course was perfect - very manageable but still offering deep understanding of the material. The fact that the course stuck to the textbook for most of the material was also very helpful. I also liked the types of problems that were assigned - they allowed us to get valuable practice on the most important concepts. A minor criticism: I don't know how feasible this is, but it might have been better for me if the computational aspect of course was taught in R.",
    "This is not a terribly difficult course, although a good (think, really good) grasp of probability theory is assumed. Discussion sessions with Professor Barron are often much better than his lectures, as we have the time to go through the conceptual and intuitive reasoning behind what has been introduced in the class. A good class if you want to know the mathematical reasoning behind t-test, F-test, degrees of freedom etc.",
    "Lectures were sometimes scattered and the TAs were extremely unhelpful. The exams were very fair, but the homework sometimes tested for general math acumen (e.g. recognizing that an expression can be written as the product of indicator functions) instead of focusing on relevant principles. I really liked the progression of the course (topics and their order) and thought it was very well done.",
    "This course was very disorganized and I feel like I learned nothing throughout the whole semester.",
    "It is very effective in presenting the basic mathematical foundations of statistics, but not so effective in teaching data analysis. While I appreciated the mathematical analysis of OLS near the end of the course, for example, I don't think the course should have spent any time on the applications of OLS--that sort of thing is best left to an econometrics or applied statistics course. It felt out of place and incomplete in light of the detail with which we discussed previous topics.",
    "As a standard introductory course, I feel obligated to do more than give it a middling review. I think this could be improved in many ways. First, get more TAs. I think this would for students who need help to understand the material beyond lecture. Second, I'm not entirely convinced that the lecture conveys *fun*. I think the point of an intro stats class should be to convey the importance and methods of a field, not merely be an overview of common statistical techniques. On the course structure side, more emphasis should be given to the principles behind the entire course (such as normality of things, etc). Like, why should degrees of freedom matter? If we focus on what it means to think in a \"statistical\" way, we can easily cover 20% more material, but still have more fun in the process.",
    "Lectures could have been better organized. TA support by Xinyuan Chen was truly amazing. I learned a lot of helpful material.",
    "Strengths: This class covers a broad range of very interesting topics, such as estimators, hypothesis testing and fitting data through a regression. The topics are also presented on the syllabus at a good pace. Like I said earlier, the textbook is excellent, a wonderful tool to have when the alternate source of learning is STAT 242 i.e. lecture, is utterly useless. Weakness: The instructor. Let's discuss Prof Andrew Barron's choice moment. Before Exam 1, we are all extremely worried about what to expect because of the \"perfect uncorrelation\" between what was taught in class (whatever little, that is) and what showed up on the homework. So Prof Barron held a review session which, to his credit, was very good. Now, Exam 2 covered a lot of abstractions in its syllabus and a lot of data manipulation on computers, so naturally we were worried again. The exam was on Friday, April 28th. So on Wednesday, April 19th, a student in the class wrote to Prof Barron asking for some details like what will be covered and what won't and when the review session would be conducted. We know that he finally opened the email only 48 hours later and then never responded to it. Friday April 21st, a week before the exam: Prof Barron goes about class as usual and behaves like there's no exam the next week at all. Monday April 24th: Same behavior. So after class, I went up to him and asked about the structure of the upcoming exam, if he'd upload the solutions to the psets, (Something that was very much needed because the TAs grading was limited to circling a problem area with a curt, incomprehensible comment about what was wrong in graded psets) and when there would be review sessions. His answer, which shook me, was as follows. He said, \"It'll be everything after Exam 1 and I'll think about the homework solutions. About the review sessions, I have a review session every Monday, but seeing as none of you come to those, I don't see why I should have one for this exam.\" When he said \"review session every Monday\", he was referring to his OPTIONAL, weekly DISCUSSION SECTIONS every Monday 7-8PM, when so many students have section, and hence can't make it. And it's not even the timing of the section that I'm objecting to as much as I am about the fact that his \"nobody shows up\" logic is: i) Inconsistent, because we had a review session for Exam 1 ii) Extremely petty iii) EXTREMELY PETTY",
    "Strengths: Covers ground very in depth, psets were challenging but doable. Tests reflected course material well. Weaknesses: Prof. Barron was an ineffective lecturer at time. Spending two weeks on MiniTab was not very productive.",
    "The main strength of the course is that the homework really drills you well and force you to get a grasp of how to apply the methods being taught in class. Also professor Barron explains concepts clearly and loudly to the class. Overall, the course is well taught, with helpful assignments, and un-stressful exams. The two weakness of the course are the textbook and the chalkboard. The textbook has a great array of questions that make for great homework problems and some useful appendices; however, the theorems presented in the textbook are poorly labeled and organized. As a math major, I have seen textbooks that clearly box their definitions, and number their theorems, and order them in a way that facilitates learning. The textbook we used made learning theorems and definitions trickier (with a lot more page flipping). For example, theorems were labeled A , B and C instead of given names or perhaps chapter labels such as theorem 7.2. Also, the textbook (and actually our lectures + homework) taught us t, chi-squared, and F-distributions very early on, then didnt use these concepts for a long time, and then suddenly sprang these concepts back upon us when halfway through the hypothesis testing unit. The textbook definitely did its job well, but was not the most user friendly. The other complaint is that the chalk board in the Mason Lab lecture hall, is simply chronically dirty and very hard to read.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, good pacing. Weaknesses: the material was sometimes confusingly presented in lectures, and in ways that differed from how it was presented in the book.",
    "Improvement: teach the material BEFORE giving homework on the material.",
    "Strengths: The content is well-organized and the problem sets provided ample opportunity to practice new ideas learned in class. Weaknesses: It's early in the morning and some lectures were hard to follow.."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it sure, it does also give a good conceptual understanding for what underlies statistical analysis.",
    "Yes. STAT 242 is an important bridge to upper level stats. The textbook is passably good, and the homeworks help you learn the material pretty well. The lectures themselves are not very helpful, and while Prof. Barron is generally nice and enthusiastic, he is not very good at explaining things.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in statistics at all. It's very useful in other statistics classes, such as STAT 361 and STAT 365. It helps you develop a rigorous understanding about how those techniques work.",
    "If you have to take this class, Barron is a good person to take it with. Class isn't the most interesting, but the homework and tests are fair, and you will learn the material one way or another and do well.",
    "This course was quite honestly pretty horrendous. I'm not usually one to complain about courses, but this course was especially poorly designed, with bad lectures and tedious problem sets with that get very little feedback. While the course isn't particularly difficult per se, it just became a major annoyance this semester. Only take this if you have to.",
    "Only take it if you must for a major or to get to higher-level courses you're interested in. The material is interesting, but it's not worth it if you're a social science or humanities major.",
    "Yes, because it's required for a lot of things, but I don't think I'd recommend it unless you a) really enjoy theoretical statistics or b) you need it for your major or as a pre-req for another class",
    "It was very different from probability theory (which was a class I enjoyed): this class had a lot of difficult PSet problems but the tests were mostly about having some understanding of how things were used and applying formulas.",
    "It is a great course to develop statistical theory. Great follow up to 241 and it is simply a must take for upper division courses.",
    "I think if you're taking this class, you're taking it because you have to. If you're considering taking it even if you don't have to, keep in mind that it can be a lot of work at times.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want understand the theory behind various statistical tests. There is some practice with statistical software in this class, but not much in terms of \"real-life\" statistical analysis.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the math\/stat\/CS\/data science majors. For some majors it is required, and overall I think it is a good intro to start thinking about problems in a statistical way.",
    "Not a bad course. Good workload, clear expectations. Lectures can be tough to follow.",
    "take it if you have to, the material is important but the experience isn't great",
    "Take the class if its a requirement for your major. Otherwise, only take it if you're really interested in the subject.",
    "Only if it is necessary for their major.",
    "Maybe. I think that the course teaches people important background skills for theory of statistics, but that taking a course like stat 230 could probably teach you much of this as well.",
    "This is an objectively good statistics class. Prof. Barron invests a lot of effort into making sure everyone understands, not just the enthusiastic people in the front row. If you take this class, go to the weekly section! Barron holds these personally to go over class material and answer questions. I can't emphasize enough how much an excellent instructor makes the class interesting and worthwhile. You probably have to take this for the stats major, but if you're an econ\/math major considering Stat 241\/242 or Econ 135, I would choose the Stats sequence (as an econ-math major who took 135). The stats sequence explains the concepts in much more detail, and you'll probably remember it more accurately.",
    "You probably have to take it, so my advice to you is to learn how to be an independent learner, and take advantage of as many outside resources as possible. Neither Professor Barron, nor the TFs, nor the Rice textbook are particularly helpful. Form a good study group and work with your classmates, consult other online resources for help, seek the help of peer tutors if they're available. I found the content of this course to be slightly less challenging than STAT 241, but the course was organized more poorly. You should also know that familiarity with either R or Minitab is essentially required, despite the fact that this is not stated in the syllabus. The last few weeks of the course rely a lot on computational tools, so make sure you have at least a basic understanding of one of the two (if you have taken STAT 230 or are concurrently taking it, you will be more than fine).",
    "I achieved my goals by taking this course.",
    "If you are thinking about taking it, its probably because you have to.",
    "This is a pretty standard statistics class. Barron does a good job at trying to explain things and the course is graded fairly. Would recommend if you want to learn statistics.",
    "Yes, I think the basics of statistics is critical for anyone these days.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I had taken two statistics courses in the past (one in high school and one in a psychology department at a different school), and I found that I understood basic concepts in much greater depth after this course.",
    "One of the few good theoretical statistic classes at Yale. Most of the topic of the class fall nicely into a good balance between mathematical reasoning and real-life applications.",
    "~Course is a bit scattered and homework can take a bit, but the exams are fair and you get a really nice appreciation for fundamental statistical theory and the motivation behind things like t-tests, which is very elegant and useful.",
    "This is an important foundational course for the theory of statistics, and it helped me much better understand what I was doing in my various econometrics courses. This should be taken alongside an applied statistics course.",
    "NO. FRANKLY, I THINK THIS COURSE SHOULDN'T EXIST. Sure, if you want to tick boxes under your statistics major, feel free to endure the course for a semester. But if you really want to learn statistics, you can easily get as much out of it if you read the textbook (granted, not many of us have the discipline to do that).",
    "I think that it is an important class to gain a foundation but could have been better organized.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student in one of two circumstances: 1. You need it for your major, in which case good luck, and I'm sorry. 2. I really hate this student and wish the worst for him or her.",
    "Avoid this class if you can. Prof. Barron is not a good professor especially if you aren't programmed to be a math genius and speak in complex math vocab all the time. It's harder than Stat 241 as most of the people who continue on did well in 241, but with hard work it's doable.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. You simply, learn a lot of very practical statistical techniques and concepts, but are taught them in a way that you can understand them well (i.e from the mathematical foundations perspective). As a math major who has taken a fair amount of hard math classes (MATH 230-231, MATH 244 , MATH 305, MATH 310, MATH 325, MATH 350) this class felt like a walk in the park (and I had only taken STAT 238 before not 241). There is a decent amount of homework but it is all manageable and there is nothing that will stump you make you scratch your head for hours. It more feels like high school calculus where you learn a method, and then solve a bunch of problems in the textbook that are direct and obvious applications of the method. As I am sure you felt in Calculus that you learned A LOT, I felt the same way here. The curve is also pretty nice: Among the 60 undergrads there were 25 A, 20 A-,9B+, severalB, B- and C according to his post term announcement.",
    "Yes, this is a good intro course for people who want to go beyond memorizing formulas and broad concepts in statistics.",
    "This course gives a rigorous theoretical background to mathematical statistics. If that subject at all interests you, definitely take this course. Hopefully you can take it without Andrew Barron, as he is often impatient and full of himself when trying to explain key concepts and answer questions. I pretty much gave up on understanding the linear algebra behind linear least squares regression, which is pathetic for a course like this. Again, take it if you can, if Prof. Barron does not teach it.",
    "Absolutely. The content of this course is important to EVERY field of study. If you want to have a reasonable understanding of any academic research paper, you must take this class. You'll learn about hypothesis testing and ANOVAs, estimators and linear regression, and the general framework through which statistics are presented. The content is well-organized, the problem sets are manageable, and the tests are fair. I highly recommend this course to everyone.. as long as they have an understanding of probability (STAT 241)."
