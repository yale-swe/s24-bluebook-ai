    "If you're even looking at taking the Capstone, you have to do for the Global Affairs major. That being said, definitely an incredible way to cap a major that has its share of problems.",
    "Required for the major but every student should look forward to the class.",
    "Professor Malvesti did a fantastic job with this years Capstone. Get to know your fellow Capstone members early on, and youll have a great experience. It was certainly one of the more fulfilling academic experiences Ive had at Yale. You have a good amount of leeway in deciding what to research, and this years subject matter ended up being genuinely fascinating. For the most part, the workload is manageable, but therell be weeks when youll be up late trying to hammer out literature reviews, case studies, presentations, or final drafts. Working on all this with a group of fellow students, however, is both fun and good preparation for the real world. If you manage to get into Professor Malvestis section, go for it. Shes unbelievably conscientious and efficient with feedback and with scheduling all the logistics of interviews, trips, etc. (Those trips and interviews are a great time and super useful by the way.) This Capstone alone made me glad to have majored in Global Affairs."
