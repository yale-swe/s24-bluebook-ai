    "You sing and\/or play early music, and learn about it.",
    "So much fun and so much wonderful music!",
    "Fun course. Not much work at all. Sometimes the professor gets other students to conduct\/direct a piece though, and then your enjoyment may vary depending on how you get on with the student and his\/her style.",
    "A wonderful class, as always!",
    "Take it! Grant is a spectacular musician, and we have the opportunity to perform really cool stuff that you could never do elsewhere. There's solo opportunities and you can pick up period instruments for the first time. Yay.",
    "A fun and relaxed fifth or sixth class, suitable for music majors and non-music majors alike. I took it as a classically-trained singer looking to explore an alternative style of music that I had never come into contact with, and was not disappointed. The class never delves too deep into music theory, which I liked; all you need to know how to do is read music (relatively quickly and accurately) and sing\/play the right pitches at the right times. It made a nice change from my other classes not to have written homework assignments, and our performances in the Beinecke library were lots of fun.",
    "Great way to get exposure to early music in a fun and collaborative setting"
