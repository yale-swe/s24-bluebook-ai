    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. The topics and class logistics were well thought out. Justin is extremely insightful. Even though students had a lot to say, I would have liked to hear what Justin had to say a bit more. I liked having someone from the class be a leader for a topic but I also liked when Justin led the discussions. The readings were way too much. I liked being challenged to speed read but I felt that I was not absorbing everything I could have been, although the class discussions helped with that.",
    "Thank you for such a wonderful class!",
    "Farrell is great. He provides a lot of space for discussion and conversation. That said, I wish he would have led or at least directed conversation more often. At times the class was too free-form, more like a coffee shop chat than an actual seminar. Interesting and pleasant, but it could have gone deeper. I would have also liked more content, rather than vague or thematic musings on certain topics. I expected the class to be a lot more contemporary than it was - there was an awful lot of history which, while valuable for context, wasn't strictly what I was hoping for.",

    "Discussions! Readings! Student projects! Everything was great!",
    "The variety of topics covered and the incredible insight of classmates and professor.",
    "The subjects were arranged well - I like the format of discussing a different issue each week, along with associated readings. Readings were well chosen across a range of sources, and aligned well with the subject at hand.",
    "The reading list and course outline that Justin prepared were fantastic. Seminar-style classes encouraged group discussions and critical thinking. Topics include those outside traditional environmental curriculum that were very thought-provoking and eye opening. A wonderful academic and personal learning experience.",
    "Justin's American West class is hands down the very best class I've taken at Yale so far. There were so many wonderful parts of the course that made it great: - bringing together a group of students with different interests and backgrounds but with a common interest in the West to create a cohesive and fun classroom dynamic - using each consecutive week to address a different aspect of the West and allowing each student in the class to take ownership over a chapter and week - diverse and incredibly engaging readings - allowing us each to develop unique projects over the course of the semester and encouraging us to use these projects as a springboard for future work - the classroom dynamic AND THE BBQ",
    "The class project was very flexible and I appreciated the way it was structured. Guest speakers were good. Topics and readings were very compelling and relevant.",
    "Farrell is great and he makes a very open environment for discussion",
    "The final project, readings, class discussions."

   "comments": [
    "I would find myself zoning out a bit when students were summarizing the readings. Maybe next year students could be encouraged to present power points to be more engaging or present the topics in small groups so that they come into class with a dialogue as apposed to just a summary.",
    "I really enjoyed having each student take ownership of a week and segment of the course but I think instead of simply summarizing readings, each student could be more creative in the way in which they want to engage their classmates in discussion and summarize\/share\/present the materials. Sarah's railroad song is a great example but I think that's just a start! I also think it's fantastic to get each student to submit discussion questions before class, but I think asking each student to bring up at least one of the questions in class would be an even more effective way of engaging students and ensuring that these questions were answered and wrestled with.",
    "The weekly topics (themes) and readings could use some fine tuning. This was the first time this class was offered, and it was very well done, so I think it's expected that there will be some small changes for next year. I don't think there is a need for a week to discuss projects mid-way through the course (that could just be a lecture). I also think the amount of reading could be higher for some weeks. I liked having two guest lectures--I hope there is more of that next year. Perhaps Prof Farrell could coordinate something with the Westies SIG. I really enjoyed getting to read the instructor's forthcoming book. I wonder if the course would benefit from a short lecture in some classes--perhaps 45-60 minutes--and then discussion. I like having some framing before jumping into a discussion. It does not need to be a regurgitation of the readings, but broad framing of the issues being discussed. Just a thought for consideration...",
    "Perhaps the weekly discussion leaders could try and change the format each week. Be more creative.... use creative media... etc. Also, I liked how toward the end of the semester we began the discussions by going around the room and hearing about each individual's experience with the topic. It helped my personal awareness of the issues."

    "Because I have worked in the West and will continue to work in the West after I leave Yale, this course complements my great personal and academic interests in a way not many other classes have. Because I so identify the American West as the area I want to work in, this class has been incredible in giving me a background in, knowledge of, and friends I can find in the West.",
    "Most of my work is based in the American West, so I was really looking forward to this class. It turned out to be more retrospective and abstract than I would have liked. Perhaps that's the nature of sociology?",
    "This course strengthened my connection to the west. It allowed me to explore questions that I have thought about countless time... and it helps so much to hear other people's opinions. This was my first sociology class... and it was incredibly helpful. It also allowed me to explore my research areas from a different perspective that will be a tremendous asset in the future."

    "Because I am from the West and interested in past and current issues",
    "I took this course because I love the landscape of the American West and wanted the chance to learn about it in an academic setting. Once I graduate from Yale, I will return back to the West with aspirations of making this landscape and the communities on it more resilient, cohesive and genuine. I took this class to better prepare for that by giving me an overview of the most important dimensions\/topics of the study of the West as well as the chance to learn, think and talk about these issues with others equally as excited about the West as I am.",
    "I am very interested in the American West and there is no other course quite like this at Yale. It was a small course with engaged participants and a good instructor.",

I was most surprised and learned the most from the discussion of the contemporary West--through the reading materials as well as (and especially) from Leah's presence in class. I also did not anticipate how much I would enjoy and learn from the others in the class. Because it is such a small group of people, I think it's really important and beneficial to establish a trusting and respectful community from the very start because it makes the class truly wonderful.",

Be creative and don't be afraid to use this as a springboard for projects you'll pursue over the summer or after graduation. Also, HAVE FUN!! Have fun with the readings, the other people in the class, your project, and the process of learning about the American West.",

I built everlasting friendships, pondered important questions that have always baffled me, and have an awareness about important Western themes (i.e. individualism, conquest, treatment of American Indians) that will make me a better environmental manager."
