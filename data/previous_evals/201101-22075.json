   "comments": [
    "Typical language course. Lots of work and tests, but totally doable. I wouldn't recommend pairing it with other really difficult classes or super intense extra curriculars though, not that you can't do it, just it will be difficult to also have a life, if you're striving for an A\/B that is. You can totally pass and do other stuff.",
    "This course is intense. Its a great way to learn Spanish, because taking two hours a day will FORCE you to pick up on the material whether you want to or not. I would definitely recommend this class to students who don't want to waste their time in L1-L2 over two semesters but just keep in mind that it is a lot more work.",
    "I felt this class went a little too fast for my liking. It was hard to go through a chapter in a couple days. Then when it was time for a test there were 4-5 chapters on it. Professor Sabe was great and really nice, but I felt I would have learned Spanish better in a slightly slower moving class.",
    "I would recommend it if you are really interested in Spanish. Otherwise, it is VERY time consuming and feels rushed at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Except for the whole 9am thing, this class is great. Not too much work, but a lot of material in not that much time. You will get a lot done and feel really good about yourself when its done. If you want to learn spanish, take this class.",
    "I loved this class and I'm so glad I took it. I would definitely recommend it if Lourdes is still teaching it. I know 100 minutes of class every morning sounds like a lot, but you'd get used to it. Plus, you get to know the professor and the other students very well and it starts to feel less like being in class. I'm amazed at how much Spanish I was able to learn in one semester. If you're really interested in learning the language, this is a great way to do it. That being said, I think the class could be difficult for anyone who hasn't studied a romance language before. The homework and the fast pace of the class might have been overwhelming if I wasn't already familiar with a lot of the grammar from having taken L5 French.",
    "Take this course if you actually want to learn Spanish and if you're passionate enough to make the sacrifices that the course entails. By the end of the semester you will be speaking Spanish better than your friends in L2.",
    "Straight up, you learn a lot of Spanish. If you're in it to learn Spanish, it's a fantastic course to take; if you're in it because you think it'll be an easy A, I would reconsider.",
    "Spanish 125 is definitely a lot of work, but Lourdes makes it fun and worthwhile. She is dedicated on making sure the students are learning, and she does not mind putting in extra time to help those who aren't doing so well. Expect homework every day and a lot of projects\/oral exams. But also expect a fun teacher who wants you to succeed.",
    "Will you learn Spanish? Yes.Will this course crush your soul a bit? Yes.I think it was worth it, but it might not be for everyone.",
    "I recommend it only if you are committed be in class for 2 hours each day and study more after class.",
    "If you want to start learning Spanish, take this class. I feel like I have come away from the term with a grasp on the language. I was, however, not sure about whether to take the class at the beginning, afraid of the workload and the 9:25 start time. Despite my fears, the class was manageable. There is nightly homework, of course, but it's not bad \u0096 the biggest commitment is the class time (close to two hours everyday). While you do spend a lot of time in the class room, Lourdes is a dynamic instructor, keeping class exciting with new activities and exercises and always encouraging participation from all.",
    "I would recommend it providing that you know what you're getting into. There is homework every night and 2.5 hours is long. But you get to know the other students in the class pretty well, which is nice."
