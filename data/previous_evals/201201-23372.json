    "This class covered really important information, but honestly, it just went way too fast to be comprehendible. To adequately cover this material, I think Financial Concepts should be offered as a real, full semester 2-3 credit course. There is just no way for people with no background in financing (which represented the majority of the class) to gain anything valuable from the current setup because you are just constantly trying to play catch up and Prof. Burke just goes way too fast (because she has to). I wanted to like this class, but I just couldn't because I didn't get what I wanted out of the class.",
    "In short, this class attempts to cover too much material in too short of a time frame. This is perhaps unsurprisingly - and also not necessarily overly problematic. I don't expect to get a deep understanding of financial management in 12 hours; but it does provide a brief introduction and allows you to become familiar with the language and concepts. It is geared toward for-profit companies and I will likely never need to do the calculations we did in this class as I intend to work in the non-profit sector. However, it gives me the language acumen and background to start to position myself to oversee the budgets of projects and organizations.",
    "This course is REALLY useful for people without any financial background. Yes it moves quickly and is a little painful, but it is worth it to know how to read a balance sheet and understand finance-speak.",
    "I found that the pace of this class went a bit too quickly. I understand that this class is a PSC but could this class be offered as a full semester 3 credit class?",
    "This course was very helpful and should be made into a full semester course so we can learn more about the concepts introduced, as well as other financial skills that are relevant to all FES students.",
    "I think that the biggest challenge this course faces is teaching enough material in such a short time. The result was a really rushed course with out time for examples or clear explanations. I think the pace was too fast: there were too many brand new concepts that all built on each other - I never felt like I had time to digest what was being taught before moving on to the next topic. As a result I did not absorb very much.",
    "These skills will be applicable for any future employment.",
    "I wonder if this course could lose a section of materials that is covered, in order to cover less over a longer period of time in order to slow things down a week.",
    "Finance is not easy for me, so I was very impressed that Maureen was able to teach me so much in just a few weeks. Her class materials are extremely thorough; she clearly works hard (and successfully) to make the subject accessible.",
    "Great job putting the material for this class together.",
    "I thought the pace was a tad too quick and the presentations are loaded with so much information that you invariably have to reference them when doing the homework. That speaks to the usefulness of the materials, but also to the dizzying amount of information crammed into 6 or 7 class sessions. 80% of the material tought in this short-course is going to be very valuable to MEM degree-holders. This course deserves to be spread out over a semester and kept about the same level of intensity throughout. If it's all about repitition, repitition, repitition; why not give people the chance to practice over an entire semester?",
    "This topic was clearly very much in demand, and I thought it was a critical offering at F&ES. So many other courses we're taking (well, especially cross-listed with SOM) reference the kinds of concepts that were taught here. Maureen did a good job translating this stuff, and the examples (Good Fish, for instance) were very helpful.",
    "Its just a tough course to teach. A ton of material covered in a very short amount of time. Very top level, which means it is hard to retian anything as a student. Maureen did as good a job as one can do though and the assignments were helpful."

    "I had a proactive study group that met on the weekends to discuss the material and do the homework. But, we still struggled because the material was so dense and we were unable to fully grasp the concepts in class.",
    "Maureen is wonderful and goes out of her way to learn the names of students - impressive in such a large class.",
    "Very useful if quick overview of financial concepts.",
    "The homework - that's really where I learned the material",
    "These are critically fundamental tools for any professional to learn. Should be mandatory, or better yet incorporated into an early crash course\/ MODS",
    "I learned some of the vocabulary that finance experts use and how to begin to understand financial statements.",
    "The course itself was great. Maureen does a nice job of explaining these concepts to beginners in the field. In addition, it was great to have the class at night. The class was informal, and the in-class exercises were helpful for learning the material.",
    "The homework really helped to solidify concepts taught in class. The posted lecture notes were also very comprehensive and easy to follow.",
    "The use of actual examples. For example, it was great to see an example of how a wind turbine was financed.",
    "The very clear explanations, and the extensive guidance for home works, which were carefully written such that completing them was not onerous, while at the same time, thorough understanding of the material was required",
    "Very concise presentation of the most important and useful infos.",
    "Maureen did a great job of providing clear and easily to follow notes and slides.",
    "The course materials (powerpoints and outlines) were very detailed and provide great references for applying the lessons of the class in the future.",
    "The introduction it provided to financial analysis, which is useful for anyone really.",
    "Just being exposed to some of the language and basic concepts that we will see throughout our careers.",
    "To get familiarity with the technical terms.",
    "learning how to use excel (at least a little bit) and the basics of financial terminology and assessments",
    "Introduction to financial concepts",
    "Learning applied skills",
    "Learning about how corporations approach financial management and evaluation of company values\/stock.",
    "The problem sets were very helpful and reinforcing. Also Maureen's lecture notes were very helpful in making sure that you understood the course material before doing the homework.",
    "Doing the homeworks in teams was incredibly beneficial, and even fun.",
    "the quick feedback on the homework at the beginning of class.",
    "Maureen took lot of personal interest.",
    "Very detailed and thorough examination of the basics",
    "How approachable the material was and the professor's ability to teach it.",
    "Cracking the codes of finance speak. I actually had taken a few classes prior to this PSC that required I do a lot of googling and wikipedia-ing to keep pace, and so this \"intro\" class actually helped me gel a lot of what I self-taught in fits and bursts. Learning what the strict definitions of various financial terms was = also helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "Needs. More. Time. Period.",
    "The evening time slot is tough but realistically unavoidable.",
    "I appreciate that Maureen tries to give us more understanding of the financial sector than she then tests in the homework, but I wish the notes went into more depth on the most important things instead. I would have rather had to do a supplemental reading about how the stock market works, for example, and devoted the extra class time to the homework concepts.",
    "The amount of material that is covered - too much for 6 classes",
    "It can be hard to follow the instructor during class; there's a lot of material that, while clearly organized, wasn't always explained clearly.",
    "Some of the harder concepts needed to be broken down and explained with a little more time. It seemed that the pace and difficulty of the concepts covered was very steep and the easy concepts that we talked about in the beginning of class could have been addressed with less time so that there would be more time to talk about the more challenging concepts in later classes.",
    "I think there are some other financial management skills that would be really useful for environmental managers. While some of us will end up working in the corporate sector, seek investors for business start-ups, and\/or interpret financial statements, many more of us will go on to manage work groups or NGOs that have to deal with budgeting for grants and\/or dealing with fund accounting and projects to determine funding surplus\/gaps for staffing.",
    "The pace.",
    "It needs to be made longer to go deeper into some of these concepts and address other related concepts.",
    "Cannot think of anything - would like to know the material more I depth, but time did not allow",
    "Minor critique - the ppt slides could be designed in more of a standard format (more reader friendly) as they would be useful as printouts\/notes.",
    "This course needs to be offered over a longer period of time. Six classes is not enough time for this material. In general, more finance classes should be offered. MEM students shouldn't need an MBA in order to understand basic finance concepts. This class is a start but due to compressed nature, it falls just short.",
    "Perhaps the timing? I understand that scheduling is an issue but dealing with large numbers at the end of the day is not very conducive to learning.",
    "Moves a bit too quickly and tries to cover too much ground for a 1-credit course. Might work better to focus on fewer topics and cover them more in depth.",
    "a bit too much work for one credit, at least compared to other 1 unit classes",
    "Should be earlier in the semester.",
    "The first two classes progressed very well and then I felt like we were speeding through material and I wasn't fully understanding everything I did before starting the homework. I think the course should be more than 6 weeks. It is not a course suitable for the professional skills courses. It should be an actual 3-credit course.",
    "Hmmm the powerpoints are still a little bit dense.",
    "More homework to drill the concepts into my brain! Also could have moved faster\/covered more content.",
    "the pace and length of the course. also, the homeworks are a tad bit meticulous.",
    "No complaints. I do think maybe add another TA for such a big class, though.",
    "It is a difficult problem but it is hard for me to imagine doing any financial analysis after this course. I guess it is good exposure but perhaps eliminating some of the lectures and spreading out the others might be a good idea. This 1 unit course could easily be two courses. One could be taught in the fall, one in the spring."
