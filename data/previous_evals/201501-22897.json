   "comments": [
    "Very straightforward math course. Read the textbook and you will be fine.",
    "The material in this class isn't really that hard but they way it's taught makes it seem much more confusing than it actually was. Professor Osipov is a terrible lecturer. If he's teaching the class, I would only take it if I really had to. The textbook isn't that much clearer either. Take this class only if you have to.",
    "Good solid math class. Don't take if you've already taken it in high school though--you will be bored.",
    "Standard linear algebra class. Osipov is the man, though - his exams are straightforward (although check your math, because the arithmetic can get tricky), and his Psets at the right level of difficulty. Lectures go a little slowly (especially at the beginning of the year), but he's very understandable. 4\/5",
    "math 222 was a very straightforward but good math class! highly recommend. if you read the textbook and go to class you will not have any problems.",
    "No, sorry, it's not my thing. I don't know who is taking this class, but I'm a math person who would recommend people who love math take a different version. I'm sure it's very valuable for engineers, but i'm not one, so can't speak to that.",
    "You know exactly what your getting when taking linear algebra. It is not difficult material, and the class is not a ton of work. With Professor Osipov, exams are very fair, so it is very easy to do well in the class. My one warning about taking the class with Osipov is that the class moves very slowly and does not cover the same amount of material as other linear sections. For students just looking to get credit and learn a little bit of linear, that's fine, but for a student like me who wants a strong foundation in linear for further math pursuits, I was a little bit unsatisfied.",
    "Take it if it's required, otherwise no point",
    "This class is not overly applied and lacks structure, but is ok for filling requirements.",
    "Prof. Osipov is a very nice man who seems to have a passion for the course. Unfortunately, his grasp of the English language is tenuous at best and the lectures are very dry. If you are open to self-teaching yourself, the tests aren't that bad.",
    "Good intro to linear algebra",
    "Linear algebra, nothing great. Andrei is a nice guy, but we did much less than the other linear class, so if you're serious about learning as much as you can don't take his section. If you just want a relaxed class, take it with him.",
    "I really enjoyed Linear Algebra this semester. I think that the material is incredibly interesting, and would highly recommend the class. Although the lectures themselves were often hard to follow, the MIT online lectures along with outside help from Prashanth made the work very manageable. I am very glad to have taken this course.",
    "AMTH 222 is a course that focuses on the applications and the fundamentals of Linear Algebra. I would highly recommend this course to anybody who is looking to learn linear algebra at a slower pace with a good teacher.",
    "This class was extremely interesting. If you are good at math and understand the material it is not difficult to do well and the workload certainly wasn't arduous. I enjoyed being in this class very much!",
    "A course that was a decent survey course to linear algebra and matrix operations. The class focused heavily on computations but it was fun to see what numbers could do and how they could relate to each other. 11 problem sets made up 40% of our grade, the midterm was 20%, and the final, 40%. Andrei was not always the most clear instructor, but this was made up for by going slowly and making sure he made smooth transitions between topics and theories as well as making the midterm and final the almost the same as the practice tests but with the numbers changed.",
    "If you're considering this course, it's probably because you need to take it for your major (and can choose between this and 225). If you know that your workload is going to be tough next semester, this class is the one you want to take. However, if you need an intro to proof-based math, you definitely should be looking at math 225 instead.",
    "Lectures are pretty dry at times. Do the problem sets and the practice exams and you should be fine.",
    "MATH 222 is a great course if one is interested in studying anything related to quantitative calculations. It is extremely relevant to statistics and economics. Of course, MATH 222 does not only have to be for those who are studying math, statistics, or the sciences.",
    "If you like proof based problems, go for Math 225. If you prefer more application questions, math 222 is the right class for you. Attend lectures to see if you can follow the professor. Going to class is not a requirement (even the professor himself specified that) as long as we submit our work",
    "Boring and poorly taught. Honestly, so boring. The problem is this: the subject is, I think, a very interesting one--when it was explained to me by others I wanted to learn more. In this class, however, I felt like I was dying of boredom every class. At the beginning of the course, Professor Osipov told us that we didn't really have to show up to class and we could just watch lectures from MIT online, which was immediately a red flag. He meant well, I guess, but his style of teaching was so haphazard and indecipherable that I spent the majority of the class doing other work and then learning the material online and from the textbook. Osipov is certainly better than Schultheiss, from what I've heard, but if there's anyone besides the two of them TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THEM INSTEAD. Seriously.",
    "I would still recommend it but the student is better of self-studying.",
    "One will know if they want to take linear.",
    "a bit of work, very interesting, VERY easy to do well",
    "Basically, taking MATH 222 with Professor Osipov makes your life a lot easier but will not teach you the material as well. Most problem sets took under three hours, and most of us did not feel a need to go to lecture. Yet on the midterm, we all did well. That being said, I felt like I didn't learn the material that well and we only progressed halfway through the textbook, if even. For someone who was just trying to get a requirement out of the way, I opted for the easier version. If you want something more intense though, look somewhere else.",
    "You probably are looking at this course because you have to take it as a prereq. If you're taking it with Osipov, know that you won't be challenged at all and that you'd be just as well off reading the textbook on your own and not going to class all the time. He is a very clear lecturer but he might go too slowly for your taste. The class itself it pretty straightforward, and the exams, at least for this semester, were very similar to the practice exams.",
    "This was definitely the easier Linear Algebra course. None of the concepts were overly complicated."
