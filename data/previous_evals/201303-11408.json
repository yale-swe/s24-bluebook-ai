   "comments": [
    "This was a good course for learning how to write scientific papers and how to give professional presentations. I would recommend this class.",
    "Since this is a requirement for the major, there's not really any way you cannot take this class. However, even if it weren't a requirement, I would still highly recommend that you take this class. It gives so much insight into the types of research going on here at Yale, and is an excellent feeder into the senior project requirement. You will get so much more out of it if you actually read the papers every week, trust me.",
    "Well you have to take the class if you're a BME senior.",
    "You have to take it. If you don't have a research lab, it could be useful for finding one you think is interesting. Otherwise, just follow the instructions for writing the papers and you'll do fine.",
    "You have to take it if you're a BME senior. It's not too bad--the lectures are interesting, but you're not tested on them, so you don't need to really take good notes or pay close attention (which is stupid, since you have to go to this class). The papers are fine--they are very structured and the expectation is that you include the financial\/economic aspect of the issue about which you're talking. It seems like the class is focused on coming up with ideas that will either make or save money, not so much about the science, which is silly and seems misdirected.Do a good job on the papers and you'll be fine.",
    "Fine class, a lot of outside classtime and a decent amount of work in terms of presentations and papers. But I liked learning about professors' research and papers were interesting.",
    "Weekly faculty lectures were generally interesting. The rest of the course is based on scientific presenting and writing, including a grant-like final paper, which I enjoyed. Not too much work, and I felt like a learned a lot.",
    "There is no reasons you are taking this class except to fulfill the major. It's a fine class, some busy work. Make sure that you work on the papers early.",
    "The class requires a lot of work since you have to do multiple papers and presentations but overall it is very helpful in developing important skills if one wants to enter academia. Prof. Papademetris really helped me to be able to writer better papers and make better ppt presentations so that it is organized and incorporates all the information needed.",
    "BME senior seminar is great. It's required for BME so you don't really have a choice, butyou're in luck, cause it's not bad. Each week, there are professors that give lectures about their research, which is pretty cool and informative. There are a few group presentations (and one individual presentation), and several writing assignments. Overall, the workload isn't too bad. Professor P and Sandy (the TA) are really helpful and give you great feedback on your presentations and writing assignments. Good and enjoyable class!",
    "There is a significant amount of work writing and presenting in this class. For both, there are smaller group workshops done outside of class time. Class time is primarily dedicated to lectures from various BME faculty, which can be a hit or miss given the wide range of topics BME covers. Overall an interesting course that teaches a lot of practical skills for scientific presentations and writing, but be prepared for work and scheduling outside of class. Though, chances are you have to take this class anyways.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I appreciated the breadth of biomedical engineering research that we were presented, and I liked how we were able to listen thoughtfully instead of having to write down every bit of material for an exam (there is no final exam). However, I did feel like this class had too many essays that took a lot of time. And I didn't like how this class frequently required us to schedule group meetings with the professor outside of class - it seemed like the prof just wanted more class time so he made us meet outside of class almost every week."
