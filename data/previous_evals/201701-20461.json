    "Worked on my own project - independent learning is always a good experience.",
    "Increased my experience in computer science, by applying CS knowledge to a specific project.",
    "I learned to conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty mentor.",
    "I learned a lot of practical things that aren't covered in other cs classes. I also learned how difficult it is to guess how long it will take to do various tasks as well.",
    "I gained good experience in terms of working on a long term project (where I mostly was setting my own pace). This was an important thing to do.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's both a strength and a weakness: the amount you get out from the project depends on how much you put in. It can be nice if you have a really busy semester, as it's possible to only minimally engage with the project for a while and then kick it into the gear in the last few weeks. But then the end result can feel a little less satisfying. This can be remedied by just spending more time on it.",
    "The course would be better if it was more structured: common guidelines for all the advisors, regular checkpoints, some way for CS majors to see their peers' projects.",
    "I think getting things started sooner would be good. Practically a third of the semester is going by the time you are really need to get going.",
    "I really liked my advisor, Dragomir Radev. He cares a lot about the students he was advising, and was very available to give help and feedback (and also knowledgeable!).",
    "This course is entirely dependent upon how much a student hopes to get out of his\/her research. If a student chooses to be engaged, they can get a lot out of the course. A potential improvement might be to implement some way to ensure a student is putting it consistent work throughout the semester, such as weekly check-ins, required meetings with advisors, etc.",
    "More structure from the department would have been nice",
    "It's very adviser-dependent, so just make sure you have either a clear sense of your project (if it's your own idea) or an adviser who has a lot of time to communicate with you.",
    "Pretty self driven, 490 is entirely what you choose to make of it"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Find something interesting to you, and try to make a project of it.",
    "Well you have to take it for the major. My advice is to talk with your advisor often early on if you actually want to do an engaging project of a reasonable workload, vs. one that just satisfies graduation requirements. It can be easy to pick an ambitious project, then just let other priorities pile up and not work much, and be ultimately beaten by this course's unstructured nature. It won't keep you from graduating, but might leave you disappointed in yourself.",
    "This course is required for the computer science major, so there isn't much choice. However, it's an incredibly unstructured thesis course that doesn't really encourage students to learn about their peers' work. I'd recommend that when you take this class, pick a project that you actually care about, and take a look at the other projects at the end of the semester.",
    "It is required so you have to but I really think the freedom they give you is nice. Also, you have the opportunity to learn a lot, and depending on what your project, make something useful.",
    "490 was the epitome of my Yale career and made it truly special. It is a chance to hone your skills (for me web dev). It is a chance to contribute to society in a meaningful way as long as you put in the effort - take advantage of it. And definitely have Professor Silberschatz as your advisor if you can - he is great!",
    "You have to take this class; pick a good advisor and do a project you enjoy",
    "You have to take it, but just make sure you pick a good project that you're happy to spend a decent amount of time on, and that you've planned out extensively with your adviser.",
    "Gotta do it if you want hte degree I guess"
