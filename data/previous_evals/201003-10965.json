    "I would say that this course is a good introduction to the use of math in biology, but would stop short of recommending it to someone without at least some knowledge of math beyond introductory calculus. The applications in biology were clear, but I think the actual math got short shrift.",
    "I think it is really beneficial. However, if someone already has a good training in basic maths contents, auditing some part of the lecture could be a more efficient choice.",
    "A good introduction to a broad spectrum of math techniques that can be used in biological research.",
    "It is a class that involves a survey of introductory Mathematical concepts in Statistics, Linear Algebra, Differential equations and Fourier Transform. I would recommend this class for a fellow student if s\/he will need these mathematical concepts in his\/her future research\/career. However, if one expects to learn anything about MATLAB, s\/he should not take this class."
