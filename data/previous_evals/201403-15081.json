   "comments": [
    "This course is a probing exploration of the philosophical concept of self-interest and the various ways it has shifted and changed over time. The readings were excellent, and the discussions were consistently thought-provoking. Professor Sabl is extremely bright, put a lot of time and effort into preparing reading questions to help guide us, and was quite organized at running the seminar. On the whole, the course was quite good, although there was a big disjuncture between the first half, where we were doing older philosophy readings (Rousseau, Smith, Hume, Hutcheson, etc.), and the second half, where we switched to reading contemporary economics and political science articles. In an era saturated by market values and the rhetoric of self-interest, it's really important to think deeply about what self-interest implies and its tangled history. I recommend taking this class if you're at all interested in politics, philosophy, political philosophy, and\/or economics.",
    "If you are interested in political theory (and especially if you are also interested in economics) take this course. The beginning of the course involves a lot of the classics (Rousseau, Smith, etc). It's interesting even if you've read those works before, since the class considers all of them through the lens of self interest. The course then steps away from strictly discussing self interest, and the class reads more modern works by Becker, Shapiro, and the like. The one thing I'd change is the structure of papers. We had a midterm paper, another \"midterm\" paper due right at the start of reading period, and then a term paper due at the end of reading period. This will probably change if the course is offered again, but just something to keep in mind. I'd recommend this course.",
    "It is a good class that helps you understand a topic from many different lenses, althoug it can be dense at times.",
    "This class is a great opportunity for someone who wants to see the real intersectionality of ethics, politics, and economics. Despite professor Sabl's idiosyncratic foibles, he will make you a better writer and his reading questions will give you a brand new take on the material.",
    "TAKE IT. Excellent course with an opportunity to do some really deep thinking on a subject that's really important to understand (and pervades many fields)."
