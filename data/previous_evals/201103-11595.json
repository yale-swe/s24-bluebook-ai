   "comments": [
    "This is a must take. It's a whirlwind tour of the French literary tradition from the 19th century up to the mid 20th, and although the pace can be daunting at times, the work is absolutely worth it. Professors are always fun to listen to, and lectures are never dull. If you can, take the French section; it's really the way to get the most out of the course.",
    "Yes. Take it.Fantastic course. One of my favorite at Yale. The structure that Professor Kaplan and Samuels thought of was effective - Samuels, the 19th century specialist, teaches the 19th century novels while Kaplan asks questions at the end of lecture; Kaplan, the 20th century specialist, teaches the 20th century novels while Samuels asks questions. The dialogue at the end of each lecture helped ensure that students were asking good questions as they engaged with the texts.Of course, the literature is great and well chosen.There's a lot of reading, though. Keep this in mind.",
    "The Modern French Novel is important for anyone studying literature, for as Prof. Samuels will tell you, the 19th century French novel is responsible for creating the world.",
    "I'd recommend to someone who wants to read the novels but might not otherwise have the motivation to.",
    "Loved this course. The novels are wonderful and section discussion was really great. It's a good survey course of Modern French literature and the professors are very engaging and clearly passionate about the material. Definitely recommend.",
    "If you love French literature--then beware, it's A LOT of reading, but absolutely worth it! Each lecture was amazing, and the two professors are extremely endearing and captivating. If you like to spend a lot of time on each book in depth and do a lot of close reading, then you must know that you will be asked to read books very quickly--200-300 pages per class, and each book will only be discussed for 2-3 lectures. You'd be surprised, though, by how focused and in-depth and analytical the lectures get. Overall, even if it's just for the professors, take the class!",
    "This was one of my favourite classes at Yale. Professors Kaplan and Samuels clearly love their material and their enthusiasm is infectious, every week lecture was astonishing. The books are some of the most powerful and important in the French canon and you'll feel like a truly educated person after being able to actually give reason to why you think Proust and Camus are geniuses. As an added bonus, the assignments are very easy and the grading is generous. Take it!",
    "Build your schedule around taking this course. It was outstanding.",
    "Take this course, whether or not you know if you adore French lit. This course is an excuse to read incredible books. Do it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! I am not a lit major, but this was my favorite class at Yale. The professors are amazing, the book list is riveting, and the work is completely manageable. One in class midterm (2 essays, no ids), one 10 page paper, and then a take home final with 2 4 page essays.",
    "You read great novels and get a good sense for the French literary canon. Professors Samuels and Kaplan have different ways of viewing the texts and it's interesting to see how each of them thinks.",
    "Yes-- this a fun literature class that doesn't involve much work outside of reading the texts (lengths vary though). It's clear the Profs. Samuels and Kaplan put a lot of effort in picking out the syllabus and both of them clearly love French lit, which makes it fun.",
    "If you have any interest in French literature, or would like a general taste of French literature, I would recommend this course.",
    "Modern French Novel is a two-professor-led tour through some of the most seminal books in French literature. The teaching model--in which one professor teaches 19th-century works, the other books of the 20th century--was effective. But while the workload isn't particularly heavy, the reading is long, so be prepared to spend several hours a week engaging with each text if you have ambition to read them all (which you should--most are great).",
    "I would only recommend it if you have a real interest in French literature. I took the class for the classics that it assigned--The Red and the Black, Old Goriot, Madame Bovary, Proust, etc.--and I found myself disappointed once the class transitioned into the modern period and started reading more obscure works\/more recently minted \"classics.\" If you just want to read some French classics, I would just try to find some time to do it on your own, rather than to take this class. That said, there were some very insightful lectures on French literature and the books assigned, and those were probably worth attending.",
    "Definitely take this course. It will make you understand why the French were once so highly regarded in the world. These are books that you should read.",
    "It's an unmanageable amount of very important works. I would take it C\/D\/F unless you are a very fast reader or you have already read a couple.",
    "It's a good introduction to the most important French novels of the 19th and the 20th century and the professors are respected scholars in their fields. I think the course is flexible enough to accommodate to students ranging from undergrads unfamiliar with French literature to grad students in the French department. I'd suggest those with knowledge of French to definitely read the novels in the original and be in the French section, which can be very engaging. The downside to the course as a whole is that it is really fast-paced, so most of the time we don't delve in too deeply into the works, and that might a little off-putting sometimes.",
    "A wonderful class! There's a lot of reading, but it's generally really enjoyable, and the lectures are great.",
    "If this course is offered, take it. The reading list is fantastic. The professors are some of the best at the university. The non-reading work is very light. I have ended every other semester wishing that I did more pleasure reading. This course provided my pleasure reading. You don't need to be interested in French literature to like this course.",
    "The Modern French Novel is a great course if you like discussing fiction and want the hipster cred of being knowledgeable about French literature. You'll be really well off if you've dealt with these books before in another class or if you have time to finish a book a week."
