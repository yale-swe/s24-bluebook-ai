   "comments": [
    "I thought a lot about how the minute conversational interactions I have every day are governed by the different linguistic and philosophical ideologies that we talked about in class and on the news. At the beginning of the course, we talked a lot about technical, small pieces that all fit together so that in the end of the course, we kind of talked about broader ideas and theories. I think that my writing got better too because I was given enough guidance to spark my interests from the prompts and enough space to write how I like to.",
    "This class enlightens the student about how exactly language is able to have such immense power and shape politics and culture. Most of my friends strongly believe words are words and not actions, and this misunderstanding l truly believe limits their conception of and understanding of the world.",
    "I learned about language from the perspectives of traditional philosophy of language modern philosophy of language and socio-linguistics. I learned analytical skill which can be applied to different speech practices. We spent most of our time covering uncooperative speech practices. These were always illustrated with examples from contemporary politics and contemporary news channels. I developed many insights as to how language can be manipulative and dangerous. Finally we covered the topics of neutrality, the limits of free speech, and how cultural freedom is connected to freedom of speech and democracy.",
    "We were exposed to a variety of contemporary literature in which philosophy of language is expanding its realm towards the fields of political speech and propaganda.",
    "How language functions, sometimes in problematic, non-idealistic, and pejorative ways, and how linguistic theories can serve to understand\/analyse the social issues such as discrimination, oppression, marginalisation, stigmatisation, etc"

   "comments": [
    "I ended up writing one longer term paper instead of two shorter papers and so I went into finals period with no formal grades in the class which was a little anxiety inducing. But Professor Stanley is really available in office hours (although you might get double booked and have to wait a bit) so I didn't feel like I was up a creek without a paddle. The strengths were definitely the professors--it was like a weekly podcast with Jack Balkin and Jason Stanley about law, politics, language and philosophy. The class could ask questions when we were confused, but it felt to me like I was getting twice the bang for my buck because I got to listen to two great minds in dialogue. They didn't always agree but it was always a great conversation to watch. The whole class then had the intimacy of a seminar and the content of a lecture--which I loved.",
    "I loved this course!",
    "The clearest strength of this class in my opinion were the professor's knowledge of the subjects discussed. Prof Stanley and Prof Balkin, in addition to both being very knowledgeable on the subject, also had discussions between them which served to illustrate and illuminate different concepts while keeping the class engaging. The weakness of the class is that given its once a week format a lot of the reading done for homework would not be covered in depth due to a lack of time and a focus on the most prominent topics among all the readings assigned .",
    "It was instructive to have a philosophy professor and a law professor present with us, as they respectively offered their expert views on the mechanistic aspects of linguistic philosophy and on the sociocultural\/legal ramifications of such thoughts.",
    "Each class was really intriguing. Reading materials, comments from the professors and classmates, and paper assignments were so interwoven (although we have covered a range of the issues related to linguistics and epistemology) that I could enjoy thinking about social phenomena in relation to their background linguistic functions. The class was diverse, in terms of materials, viewpoints, and backgrounds of the classmates, so I never felt bored"

    "I thought it was a great opportunity to learn from two great minds and discuss super interesting topics--language, power and the ideologies involved in both. I was a little intimidated at first given my lack of philosophical background, but it was not a super intense philosophy course. I had to google some names when I was unclear, but I was able to follow everything with relative ease and clarity. Some of the grad-students' questions were a bit verbose and confusing, but that's not the whole class.",
    "Yes. Very engaging readings and class discussion, though more from professors than fellow students. This did not bother me since I was always fascinated by what the professors had to say.",
    "Yes, definitely. For linguistics majors, philosophy majors, cogsci majors, poli sci majors, humanities majors, etc. Especially considering the current political climate, everyone could benefit from this class. The presence of grad students in the class is sometimes intimidating, but you realize pretty quickly that they don't know any more than you do. I would definitely recommend taking Stanley's Philosophy of Language before this though, as he often references it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student independent of major. I would however, recommend some basic knowledge of philosophy of language or of Prof Stanley's previous work about the topics covered in class.",
    "Great course for debunking the common misconception that \"philosophy never engages with pragmatic issues.\"",
    "Yes, it is necessary for people interested in social issues to reflect upon the functions of language that constitute and reinforce such issues (although I with the class could be a bit less American-centred).",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course. I would recommend it to someone who a) knows they're interested in the topic, b) has prior experience with philosophy, and c) is okay to listening to a two-hour lecture each week. Even though this is a \"seminar,\" there wasn't much discussion. Mostly Professors Stanley and Balkin (both brilliant!) would talk and banter. The seminars did not often make me feel like I better understood the material or readings. And we often wouldn't even get to most of the readings. I think this is a good course for someone who is very self-directed and doesn't care much for structure. The topic was absolutely fascinating though!!"
