    "Yes, Italian is a great language to take at Yale. I have really enjoyed L2 Italian, and also would recommend Griffin Oleynick as your professor!",
    "Take it! It will be a lot of fun and you will get a good grasp of the language. Don't expect to be fluent, and be aware that it's not a very practical language to learn. But those facts make it even more fun!",
    "I highly recommend this course if you want to learn Italian. You will put a lot of (daily) work into it, but you will get so much out! The work is manageable, with daily homework assignments, weekly compositions, and about a test every week and a half or two weeks. The Italian department is filled with a lot of really great people--you won't be disappointed!",
    "This is a class in which finding the right teaching style is important. Some professors prefer to lecture while others prefer a more conversational style. It is overall a fairly normal language class in terms of workload and difficulty.",
    "Italian 120 is a great course that allows students to begin to feel comfortable with the Italian language. I would certainly recommend this course to any student wishing to learn a new language, as the Italian department is amazing and the language is very fun to learn.",
    "At the beginning of freshman year, I wasn't even sure I was going to take Italian, but deciding to bite the bullet and take an \"impractical\" language was one of the best decisions I've made. The course proceeds at a good pace and is highly enjoyable. The instructors (I have had two) are very good teachers and also kind people, which is important when you spend an hour with them every weekday! The department is close-knit and friendly, and if you are waffling about which language to take, I highly recommend Italian.",
    "Italian II is simply the second level of the Italian sequence. It is not leaps and bounds harder than Italian I, and it will feel more or less on the same level as Italian I to people who took it. I would recommend Italian in general to anyone who wants to take it. In my opinion, it's the best language offered at Yale."
