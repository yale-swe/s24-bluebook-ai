   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student who actually enjoys building things and learning with hands-on types of environments.",
    "Yes I would recommend Chem 562 to another student. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and there is no work outside of class. As an undergrad, I recommend it all the time to my MechE friends, and if you have any interest in building things, this class is an awesome experience.",
    "Excellent course for learning about machining and production.",
    "This was easily my favorite class at Yale. You will learn basic machining skills by machining the components of a model steam engine. The class is not stressful at all (4 hours\/week in shop; no homework, no tests), and I still felt like I learned a great deal. Best of all, you actually get to make something in this course, so after it's all said and done you have something to feel proud of. (Send it home to Mom--she'll love it.)",
    "This course was very fun, interesting, and probably the most practical and useful course you could take at Yale. You make a miniature steam engine! Isn't that cool enough?!",
    "Yes. Teaches you the fundamentals of machining, mostly by hand, with a little bit of CNC work.",
    "This is a must-take for anyone who wants to learn how to machine. I needed the skills to complete my projects, but I can see that this class is very useful to anyone who would like to expand their technical education. Learning how to make parts is very rewarding, and in addition you get to learn commonly used standards and techniques. If you take this class you will spend an enjoyable afternoon in the machine shop once a week.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take this course if you plan to use the machine shop. It's really excellent. You may find you will also learn to be careful and pay more attention to detail in other aspects of your life and research!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is one of the better classes I've taken at Yale. You do a kind of work that uses your brain in a way that most classes won't, and to keep you from wearing out, you get a cookie break part way through!",
    "This class was my favorite class. The professor was great and the class was fun. There was even a cookie break half way through! Students learned about all the machines in the machine shop while working to make a steam engine. Everyone got to take home a working steam engine (which never fails to impress anyone who sees it). I would definitely recommend this class."

    "(Mechanical Engineering undergrad) This course increased my knowledge of machining operations in both a theoretical and practical way. I was able to learn more about the design process and its implementation in the right order in manufacturing. I saw examples of the manufacturing of tools that I had learned about previously. I also was able to frame the properties of some materials in my head now that I've seen how easy or difficult they are to machine.",
    "This course allowed me to gain a much better understanding of machining and manufacturing. Now, I can manufacture custom parts to specification.",
    "This course was very useful in helping me understand both the technical art of machining, as well as provided me with useful and practical information with dealing with measures and tolerances. As an undergraduate, I cannot comment on it's usefulness to my non-existant thesis.",
    "Fabrication of components is incredibly important for my research and my work,knowing these skills has been invaluable to enable my research as well as to enable me to think about experiment design effectively. It's also widened my view of what is possible to build and design and helped me think about these things in a new way.",
    "I taught me how to make parts. It taught me how to design and manufacture parts for my research.",
    "I think that this course contributed to my understanding of physics in a more physical way. It grounded my understanding of material science a bit.",
    "It has enabled me to be of more help in my lab. I have been able to use the skills that I learned in the class to outside projects where I have been able to machine parts for my research."
