   "comments": [
    "It's not perfect but it's a good quantum mechanics class covering some really important material (scattering, fermions and bosons, second quantization, perturbation theory\/transitions etc.) so I would recommend it.",
    "PHYS 608 is a solid and manageable continuation of the standard graduate quantum physics sequence. It will probably be less technical than PHYS 508 (assuming the professors take similar approaches to this year's pair), with more focus on intuitive applications of quantum formalism. Interesting and educational, and not too much work.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in QM and physics, after taking PHYS 508.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is an important review of all the major calculational tools necessary in quantum mechanics and the assumptions that they require.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a good course to enhance your understanding about quantum behaviors.",
    "Hi Jack is teaching the course, it will be a great educational experience.",
    "I would recommend this course, the lectures are clear and you learn a lot by doing the homework problems.",
    "A good second semester quantum course. Accessible to undergrads after 508.",
    "See above responses.",
    "Extremely thoughtfully and clearly taught. My classmates and I were always truly excited to attend Prof. Harris' lectures. The lectures were sensitive to our time, well-organized, and managed to include our input in a way that led to some very interesting discussions. Prof. Harris is a legend!",
    "highly recommended, especially with Jack Harris at the helm. Probably the most useful course you'll take if you go into any kind of work involving quantum mechanics.",
    "I would highly recommend PHYS 608 to anyone interested in quantum mechanics.",
    "An overview of the advanced topics of quantum mechanics including perturbation theory (all types), scattering, and an introduction to second quantization. The class requires fundamental knowledge of quantum mechanics, but by the end, many of those concepts will become second nature. I highly recommend this course due to the material, but especially if Jack Harris is teaching.",
    "Muy bueno."

   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of material in this course which is highly relevant for physics so I am pleased.",
    "There wasn't a whole lot in this course that was brand new to me, but it was delivered in a very clear and easy-to-understand way. I feel ready to apply quantum physics concepts to more advanced second-year courses next year.",
    "It is important to come with a good fresh understanding of QM fundamentals, ideally following PHYS 508 in the semester before taking this course. I am sure the materials learnt in this course will be useful in the future, and even during this semester, some of the techniques covered were helpful in other courses and research.",
    "The lecture about Landau Zener Transitions was what inspired me to develop some coupled mode theory for my research.",
    "As stated above, I will certainly use the material from this class in my research.",
    "I have a better understanding of approximation methods and how they apply to real world systems.",
    "My undergrad quantum class was too hard so I missed out on a lot of basics -- I think this class filled some of those gaps for me. A number of the topics are relevant to my research.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of quantum mechanics and many-body theory, which are among my main areas of research.",
    "Although this course does not apply directly to my research in astrophysics, the continuation of my study of quantum mechanics allowed me to become comfortable understanding the bizarre physical implications of quantum mechanics and made the mathematical notation second nature for me."
