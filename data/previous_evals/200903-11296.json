    "If you've got to take Math 112, be sure to take it with Conor. He makes the material incredibly easy to understand, and has a good sense of humor that makes the course much more enjoyable. I was concerned, because I have heard negative comments about the introductory math courses at Yale, but my instructor quickly rid me of my worries and made the class far better than I could've expected. I visited a number of sections of this course and Conor's is by far the best. As a side note, it seems like the best way to approach the material if you need extra help is to ask an instructor with a very specific question in mind: know exactly what you need help with, and they'll be better able to provide this help.",
    "best class ever",
    "It should be a total breeze if you've taken calc before, so if you have, be ready for some rather some rather dull hours.",
    "MATH 112 is a basic intro to calc course. If you get the opportunity, try to take it with Conor Frailey. He is fantastic.",
    "Typical calc I course, what do you expect? Take it if you're trying to learn math or need it for major.",
    "Don't take 115, just take 112. It's still challenging and will solidify your foundations. You'll be glad you did it, especially first semester freshman year. It's pretty standard material (calc AB) but put through the yale-filter, which you'll feel right away on tests.",
    "If you need a math credit, go for it. It is hard work if your brain does not work that way (like mine), but the instructors are usually very helpful and with enough dedication, you will find yourself understanding mathematics much better. Not a blow-off class by far, however, and do not expect it to be.",
    "Take if you like math or need it as a requirement. otherwise its like calculus in high school if you took that.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to definitely solidify their confidence with Calculus. The class moves at a good pace if you have seen the material before but if you haven't, it might be a little much but it is nothing going to extra help sessions can't help.",
    "Math 112 is the math course to take if you feel your calculus background is shaky and moving into advanced integration would be too challenging. My high school did not give me a firm ground in the 112 topics, and 112, while not incredibly difficult, strengthened my grasp of the concepts incredibly and I feel very well prepared to move onto the next levels. I would highly recommend this course--I had some friends try and take it with absolutely no calculus background and were in over their heads, but most people (usually with some familiarity with deriving at least) found it quite manageable if not easy. I was never bored, however, or felt I was wasting my time. Conor Frailey made it a wonderful environment as well. Get in his section if possible! Great class, though a basic.",
    "If you took BC calculus, take it and it'll be easy. But don't just push it to the side because you can really mess up that way.",
    "It's harder than the Calc AB you took in high school, but it's the easiest Calculus at Yale.",
    "It is a good course if you need math but have never taken calculus in high school, or if you took it very long ago. It is a little bit boring, but it should be - there is nothing you can do to make calculus interesting. If you finally decide to take this course, make sure to choose the section with Conor Frailey - otherwise, you will sleep through the entire course."
