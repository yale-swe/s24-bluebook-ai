    "Not too taxing in terms of actual departmental requirements. You will get out of your lab work what you put into it, and in that way the course is highly independent. I liked giving my presentation during fall semester, and it allowed me to think and clearly plan the direction my research will take in the coming semester.",
    "Take it! Much better, in my opinion, than 475. One semester is not enough time to run a sufficient number of experiments or to really understand what you're doing.",
    "You should definitely take it but makes sure you have a good PI and it is in the field that you are interested in.",
    "This is the basic 1 credit each semester senior project for a BS (as opposed to 475 that gives you one credit for one semester for a BA, or 495 which is two credits each semester). If you find a good lab it is fun. The course requirements are a 1-2 page summary at the beginning of the semester of what you are going to do, a 5 page grant proposal at the end of first semester, a 15 page paper at the end of the second semester, a poster at the end of second semester, and a 12 minute presentation either first or second semester (they assign it to you). There isn't much interaction with the professors in charge of the course (only during the presentations) so it is all up to if you have a good PI and mentor or not.",
    "Research and sitting through horribly boring research presentations with no dinner! MCDB department, you are being really cruel to your students!",
    "Take it because you have to for a B.S.",
    "Senior thesis research. Work 10 hours\/week in a lab in the fall semester, write up a 3 page proposal at the beginning, and a 5 page NIH-styled grant proposal at the end, go to three sessions of project presentations at the end of the semester. You have to do a senior project so you can't really get out of doing it. Depending on your lab it might be better to do MCDB 495, based on the time you're going to be spending in lab.",
    "It was ok I guess. I was going to do research anyway and this forced me to put in a little more time. Be sure to have a focused game plan for the semester and make sure you keep up with it, as I didn't really produce any good results this semester (which can get disappointing when putting in ~10 hours per week). Do it. Also, I'm a junior non-science major, so it's not that bad."
