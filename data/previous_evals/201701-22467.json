   "comments": [
    "As I entered my final semester as an electrical engineer, I hadn't taken any math classes beyond the prerequisites. So entering this class on graph theory and stochastic processes without any experience was intimidating. But by the end, I had not only the basics in both these areas down, but also a desire to strengthen them. This class was a perfect intro course in networks, and it made me excited to start my PhD with Professor Tassiulas this summer",
    "I learned about an entirely new field (stochastic network science and queueing theory) and experienced my first graduate course. I learned how to apply my knowledge of statistics, algorithms and optimization to new problems, and read cutting-edge academic papers.",
    "I was exposed to a variety of problems and approaches to solve them. I learned that certain categories of problems are solved in their general form, while others require a more problem-specific approach. I also became familiar with certain concepts and techniques."

   "comments": [
    "We cover a lot of material in this class. Some on the cutting edge of the field. The problem sets were challenging and engaging, and the final project was a lot of fun. This is a rigorous course and the seminar like feel makes the content easier to digest",
    "It is very positive that we go through many topics. This though necessarily means that we cannot spend a lot of time on each one of them and understand them in depth. Solving the assignments in class after the deadline is very helpful. One possible improvement could be to give a rough schedule of topics that will be covered in the beginning of the semester (e.g., in the syllabus), and every time make more clear how what the topic under discussion exactly is, how it relates to other topics seen before, and how we are going to approach it. In other words, an overview in the beginning of the semester and also of every lecture of what we are going to do would be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course if you're a math-inclined EE or CS major. You'll learn everything you need for the basics of queuing theory and you'll feel really satisfied after you complete some of the homework problems. The work is very reasonable and this is a rewarding class.",
    "I would recommend this course to an advanced student (EE or CS major who has taken probability, algorithms, and other high-level math classes) and is interested in the subject matter. It's a graduate course, so there is no hand-holding, but the problem sets and grades are really secondary to being able to learn about a new exciting field.",
    "Yes, if the student has interest in the area, it is a great overview of the field."
