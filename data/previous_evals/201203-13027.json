    "DS Philosophy teaches you a lot in a short period of time. Sonny was clear and made good use of the chalk-board with his explanations. He was affable in class discussion and available for office hours though he could have been better in terms of guidance and feedback with the papers.",
    "This is the hardest part of DS. But perhaps the most enjoyable, if you like doing something you're not used to!",
    "I would definitely recommend ANY DS class! DS is wonderful- it is exciting and you will see the world in a different way. It is the foundation of Western thought, and the 3 courses are organized very well to show how this is one huge dialogue of ideas. If you are interested in the humanities, definitely take this course! And don't be intimidated by the coursework- it's a lot but it's doable, and you just need to figure out which readings to do fully and which to skim.",
    "Eh, philosophy. Doing the reading doesn't do much for you, but Professor Elizondo was very good at explaining things in a lecture-like format. The stuff you read for DS Philosophy is very important but not always comprehensible or interesting the first time around. I'd certainly recommend the class, though, as a way of broadening your intellectual horizons or whatever it is that people do in college.",
    "Directed Studies: Philosophy was a fast-moving overview of the highlights of ancient and medieval philosophy. Of the three DS courses, this one was my least favorite, though still worth taking. It requires a different style of thinking from the other two, much more logic-based and less creative. It was also the most different from any high school class. Professor Elizondo was thorough at explaining the concepts, but section was dry or unorganized at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Philosophy! You get an overview of philosophy starting with the ancient Greeks. I had never taken philosophy before, and I LOVED this class. You get to talk about all these abstract ideas, and you can't help but relate them to things you experience everyday. Philosophy at once feels incredibly useless and also like the most relevant thing you could ever study. Most of the learning occurs in the seminar discussions, which are very personal and thus incredibly helpful. If you're at all curious about philosophy, take this!",
    "I would recommend Professor Elizondo's section to any student with even a little interest in philosophy. He deconstructs arguments and analyzes them piece by piece, which helps you grasp your reading well. He is a knowledgeable, charming professor whom you will grow fond of.",
    "I thought this was the best class in ds, especially if you can get Elizondo. Fantastic professor.",
    "Archaic ideas but fascinating if you view it as a history of philosophy, where you get to study great writers via their original texts. Very helpful in teaching you how to write philosophy papers."
