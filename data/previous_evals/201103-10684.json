   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend it for anyone who is working with semiconductors or devices as a basic, core course.",
    "ENAS509 is a course that teaches one to understand where electronic properties of materials comes from. The reasons why a material behaves the way it does (electronically) is shown through arguments from quantum mechanics, carrier concentrations, and chemical bonding.I would highly recommend ENAS509 to any student that will be working with materials for electronics because it is necessary to understand how these materials behave at the most fundamental level.",
    "Yes, definitely. This is a really great course for microelectronics track.",
    "It is a good course that offers good depth as well width.I will recommend it to other students.The reason is as the answer to previous question",
    "The course has a heavy workload. The subject matter is relevant to both device based and materials based research projects. I would recommend the course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to my fellow just because this course covers many important things on general microelectronics."

   "comments": [
    "Though this course did not really apply to my discipline or profession, it provided a solid background knowledge of semiconductor materials that I otherwise would not have had and am very grateful for. Because semiconductors and high-efficiency devices based on them are such hot topics, it is really nice to be able to understand WHY and HOW, to be an informed citizen of the engineering world!",
    "This course is a great introductory course to materials for electronic properties. It has been invaluable to understanding physical behavior of materials in my research.",
    "Electronic material knowledge is the fundamental to my research. And this course helps a lot in my research.",
    "Because the content of this course covered fundamentals on electronic materials, it helped understand my underlying research much."
