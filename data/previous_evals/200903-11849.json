   "comments": [
    "This is a fun and very informative course, but don't expect it to be all fun and watching Planet Earth. There's a lot of reading, some of which can be dry, and both a paper and a final. Take it only if you're really interested in the subject matter and can devote some time to it.",
    "It was a very interesting course, there was some overlap with EEB 122 but it remained interesting. Professor Alonzo is an involved lecturer and the workload was reasonable.",
    "I should absolutely take this class again if I had to go back and decide again. The work-load is manageable and one comes away having learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely take this class. There is certainly overlap between this class and the introductory evolutionary biology class (122), but the delivery is much better and more in depth. It's a great class for someone interested in science who isn't necessarily an E&EB or sciencemajor.",
    "Great class if you're interested in the science of animal behavior. You'll learn about the evolution of various animal behaviors, how ecology affects behavior, and how animal behavior is studied. Suzanne Alonzo is a really good professor.",
    "Overall good course, but it suffers from the same problem as most upper level EEB courses, which is redundancy in core material. This is not an easily fixed problem if the professor wants to keep the course accessible to non EEB majors. For example, most of the modeling and theoretical material was covered in general ecology, and at a higher mathematical level....The textbook leaves much to be desired. Though it was well written and was better than many books in its citation of specific scientific papers, its serious lack of original illustrations made it hard to grasp at stages. Reading it felt like reading a giant review paper, and it lacked the logical, stepwise approach characteristic of a good textbook. It may have been more effective and much cheaper to just assign portions of the original literature (available for free to Yale students).Along this line of thought, I think several short problem sets would have helped to learn the material as well and to keep me on track with the material.",
    "I would recommend this class. The subject matter is interesting and is also presented in a very interesting way. I consider a class to be good if it fulfills one of those two qualities, but E&EB 240 is one of those classes that fulfills both.",
    "Totally recommend this class",
    "A good topic of study for EEB majors however most of the students taking it are not EEB majors and so it is taught without as much biological rigor."
