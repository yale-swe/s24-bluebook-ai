   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if Sarita is teaching it!! She is fantastic. But be prepared for the section to be unhelpful and to be more work than expected.",
    "Take it with Sarita!! She is one of the coolest people you will have the pleasure of learning from, and she's hilarious. The class is very helpful if you want to work on your ear-training, and Sarita makes it a lot of fun. Do yourself a favor and practice your keyboard stuff more than once a week!",
    "Yes. It is a great way to get a better understanding of melodic, and harmonic progressions of music. Also my ear has gotten so much better. I'm really glad I took the course. I am a better musician.I recommend taking Music 205 or 210 at the same time though.",
    "Definitely a worthwhile class. It starts out relatively easy but quickly becomes quite challenging. If you take this class, take it with Sarita! She's a fantastic instructor and is always happy to spend extra time with you if you need it. Keyboard lab is a pain but if you're taking another theory class that involves understanding voice leading it really ties in.",
    "This class is a fun and laid back experience. If you want a music class that is chill and well taught, take this class. The material isn't very hard, and everyone is at a different level with the various areas of the class (chord\/scale recognition, dictations etc.). Sarita is AWESOME and really jolly, so regardless of where you are at, take this class! (although you should know a little bit about how to write and read music first).",
    "Absolutely. This is a good class for anyone who is interested in improving his\/her ear-training abilities or the ability to realize figured bass on piano. I feel this was one of the most applicable courses I've taken at Yale since I saw improvement over the course of the semester in my ability to \"understand\" what I was listening to. Great course with a great professor- I highly recommend taking it with Sarita Kwok, because she is awesome."
