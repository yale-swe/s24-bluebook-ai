    "This is a great introduction to French society and culture and a good way to keep up your French if you're already at an L5 level. Worth it!",
    "Somewhat easy but good practice for conversation and fluency at all levels.",
    "I would take this class for 3 reasons: 1) to fulfill requirements for the Linguistics major, 2) to fulfill requirements for theFrench major, 3) because one is really interested in French current events. The course is somewhat different from French 150, there are not nearly as many grammar\/vocabulary assignments, but there are 300-500 word reactions due every other class. Course materials are comprised mostly of French media: newspaper, magazine, websites, and journal articles coupled with TV clips, movies, and selected readings from a textbook. I would recommend this class as it was interesting and I became much more fluent in both writing and speaking. It is a bit of a time commitment: it meets three days a week and there is about 3-5 hrs of homework for each class.",
    "If you want to learn about contemporary French issues, I would take this class. You cover a lot of material and learn a lot. That said, I would only take this class if you feel confident in your French abilities. It has a pretty high workload, and the professor is really big on cracking down on any errors in your French, so if your French isn't solid, you're likely to have a lot of difficulty with this class."
