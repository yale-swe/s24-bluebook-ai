   "comments": [
    "It is a great course for those interested in an interdisciplinary, intersectional approach to women's health in the American context. Professor Inhorn was careful to select students from all disciplines represented in the \"applicant\" pool before the course. The make up of the class was befitting of the subject at hand.",
    "yesinteresting material for reading and reflection.",
    "I'd summarize it as Marcia did, as a feminist reading group. We read books and get together and talk about them for 3 hours a week. I'd recommend it to anyone who finds that description appealing but also to those that don't. I think the class benefits from having a bunch of generally like minded people (in the sense that they're largely progressive and feminist minded), but could also benefit in a different way from having people perhaps not so like minded or maybe who don't see how the subject matter fits into their field of study. I think that having at least a beginning understanding of what intersectionality is, why it was adopted by so many thinkers, and why it continues to be employed would be helpful for a great many scholars in just about any field (whether to benefit their work directly or rather just generally enrich their life and how they understand the world.)",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in race, gender, class, and intersectionality in the United States. I think it is a beneficial class both for public health students and anthropology students. It was useful exposure to a range of interdisciplinary approaches to writing and research.",
    "the course is essentially a feminist book club kicked into high gear. the reading load is intense but you will be inspired and stretched to think about issues in a way that you never have before. i highly recommend this course.",
    "i would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a contemporary, more activist-based anthropology course."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped tremendously with my research. The interdisciplinary approach was integral to looking at women's health from all angles. As for vocational discernment, this course reinforced my interest in pursuing policy advocacy work centered on reproductive justice.",
    "Allows for the exploration of many different issues that have enriched my academic experience at Yale.",
    "It was good to read ethnographies. It also just helped with reading in general. To have time just to really sit and read in depth a book and then think about it's content AND how and why it was constructed was just generally good for my head and thinking about any work that I'm going to do or am doing.",
    "The writing assignments - book reports - were useful in terms of developing a professional skill. I will take away methodological insights as well as a better grounding in intersectionality theory, both of which will influence my future work.",
    "i feel like i am more cognizant of issues surrounding poverty and discrimination. the course taught me to take a more nuanced outside the box approach to analyzing health.",
    "made me more aware of the activist side of anthropology and possible avenues of research within the US."
