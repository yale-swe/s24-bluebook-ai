    "DO IT. This class was my favorite one that I've ever taken at Yale. Unfortunately Prof AJ won't be here next year and her brilliance is definitely part of how much I loved it but I don't think that'll change the fundamental flavor of this class. Alternating weekly letters to another student in class\/tumblr posts to our class tumblr, and the final project (which actually turned out to be quite a lot of work, but it was work I wanted to do and honestly I got so much out of it) are the extent of the work, but you'll find that the thoughts and convos generated in this class really carry outside of it too.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. It's a really wonderful experience. Great readings, interesting and creative assignments, and supportive professors! The weekly letter writing assignment is a great way to engage with the course material. The final project takes a lot of time but it's definitely worth the effort!",
    "WGSS 380 pushes the way we see the internet and objects as an innate, apolitical, and distant things, and urges critical thinking in new ways both for students and for the field of gender studies (and the intersections therein!)",
    "Would recommend. Be prepared to do a lot of work for the digital street project.",
    "A wonderful reading in digital feminisms and feminist technology studies--and a creative set o projects and discussions. Great professors!",
    "If you are interested in the ways that gender and sexuality intersect, especially in relation to media, art and popular culture you should really take this class. The reading, though difficult at times, will open your eyes to many new dimensions for your thought, and the project is really something you will be proud of when you finish it. Being a part of the DOCC is interesting as well, even though the class could broaden that connection and make it a cornerstone of the class instead of a path to explore at certain points. Regardless of the class's flaws, if you're interested in a WGSS seminar, definitely at least shop this class.",
    "Take this class! Because this was the first year it was taught, there were some kinks . However, the class was amazing and with another year there definitely is room for it to become even more awesome!",
    "The class primarily involves the application of theoretical questions to \"media objects,\" as supplemented by the creation of those objects. I would absolutely recommend it to any student (WGSS\/humanities major or not) who wants to delve deeper into the media that surrounds them."
