   "comments": [
    "Course to learn how to present based on how other people present. Could be more consistent. Course should be graded or at least other incentives should be offered to get the students more involved.",
    "This course was alright. It was nice to have an opportunity to present. Additionally, I thought it was a good chance to gain experience presenting on a topic that we are not necessarily familiar with - it's more difficult than presenting on our own projects. It was also an excellent opportunity to spend some time one-on-one with a faculty member. Also, the papers we read were interesting. But since we are not forced to speak or think critically, I don't think we get the full benefit a class like this has to offer.",
    "Typical seminar class. I might recommend it if there was more variety to the papers that were covered.",
    "This class is a discussion based seminar (though that was dependent on the topic and faculty participation) that gives us a chance to read in-depth on hot topics in the field of genetics. It gives us good practice in working on our presentation skills with positive criticism and feed-back. The presentation portion is the only reason I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "This is a seminar class REQUIRED for genetics graduate students.It's required.",
    "It's a helpful course.",
    "GSS is a good way to practice and get feedback on your presentation skills while reading papers on key topics in the field. It provides the opportunity to work closely with faculty and discuss science in a more laid-back environment. I would recommend it (although it's required..so I doubt I'd ever be asked.)",
    "this is a required course for second year genetics students",
    "It is a course that allows for building one's skills at critically discussing and presenting current scientific literature.",
    "I can't recommend this course, its required by the department.",
    "The course is designed for 2nd year Genetics students to present a paper each semester and improve skills in giving presentations, and critical thinking and evaluation of scientific papers."

   "comments": [
    "I learn a bit more on what I do well when presenting, but didn't learn so much on what to avoid in more complicated papers.This course didn't contribute much to my dissertation\/research.",
    "I think this course will help me when I qualify. It has helped me become more comfortable with some of the faculty members in the department. Also, presenting on a topic not related to my project was a useful experience as I will be doing this to a greater extent in my qualifying exam. This course is definitely helpful.",
    "It helped with presentation skills, critical analysis of paper topics and reading scientific literature.",
    "It helps me polish my presentation skills and learn knowledge of other fields of genetics. So it's quite helpful.",
    "The course let me read some good papers in different field.",
    "It was nice to read and focus on papers from different areas of genetics. I think it's important to have a grasp on the state of the field as a whole. We didn't read much that directly relates to my research, but I'm sure practicing\/getting feedback on my presentation skills will prove useful.",
    "It provides opportunities to read and discuss research I would not come in to contact with if I was just focused on my research. Although it was not related to my research, the course provides practice for presenting and discussing research papers.",
    "This only really deepened my knowledge of the topic that I had to read on, which was only related to what I'm doing in the fact that its genetics."
