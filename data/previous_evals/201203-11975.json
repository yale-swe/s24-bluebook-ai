    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to students who want to polish their French and become even more advanced. The works that were assigned as reading\/film watching were enjoyable and discussing them in class was always fun. I enjoyed the grammar activities\/games in class as well as the improvisations. If you put in the work, your French can improve drastically by taking this class.",
    "I would recommend taking it. It's a great way to fulfill your language requirement.",
    "Great class. I really felt that I improved my French a lot, although I would say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more writing-intensive than \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvanced conversation\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not. Other than that, I really enjoyed the class, and definitely take it with Mme Allain if you can!",
    "Sure. It's a fun class, and not that hard.",
    "I would recommend French 150 for anyone who is near-fluent in French. If, however, you received a four or less on your AP exam, whatever the course description says, I strongly discourage you from taking this course, even if you qualify on the entrance exam. I received a 4 on my high school exam and felt I was in a little over my head. It was the hardest course I have ever taken. The workload is heavy and the pace is fast. It is not for the faint of heart.",
    "Only if you really want to continue with French. I didn't really feel like I got much out of the class, but I think that was in large part due to my teacher, so just make sure you shop around when picking your class.",
    "Take it to keep improving your french. Make sure you keep up with the short questions."
