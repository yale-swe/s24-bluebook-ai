   "comments": [
    "This course was a great science credit for students broadly interested in neuroscience and ethics. There seems to be a lot of room for any student to find a niche interest in the class material. The articles are very interesting and Professor Fournier is fantastic.",
    "Highly recommended! A really fun seminar on a fascinating topic. Class discussions are always extremely interesting and almost everyone participates. The workload is very manageable and Professor Fournier is great! Overall probably one of the most enjoyable classes I have taken at Yale. Not quite sure why it is a science credit though, not very science heavy at all.",
    "I would summarize it as a science credit with a relatively minimal workload that seems interested but ended up not being that interesting. I would not recommend it.",
    "Definitely recommend it, all of the topics in neuroscience that survey classes usually skip",
    "I'd recommend it, assuming you're interested in the subject and don't mind doing some difficult science study readings. Discussions are really interesting and ultimately end up in an ethics debate. Really fun.",
    "CSYC282 is a great class in concept, but I think it needs a few more trial runs for Neil to smooth out the kinks and add the appropriate amount of structure and clear instruction it was missing. The discussions were often little more than conversations between the presenter and Neil, with occasional clarifications or random tidbits added by other people every so often.",
    "Great class, not too much work (besides final paper, which was about anything neuroscience-related), very conversational, but not very structured (+\/-). Still, would definitely recommend",
    "I would recommend the course if you want a laid-back very intro-level survey of neuroscience popular topics and you have no background in neuroscience and reading science\/psychology papers. A class like this would be very good for whetting interest but not for people who already have developed interests in these areas."
