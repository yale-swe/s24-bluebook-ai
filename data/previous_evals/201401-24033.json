    "A large part of the course is to use software to do LCA. It would be great if we could have classes in Stats Lab or somewhere similar to practice using the software. Otherwise the understanding of the software and LCA might be potentially shallow.",
    "",
    "The class could have been taught in a lab setting with more time spent on running simapro(software).",
    "Really engaged instructors that guided and pushed your thinking on LCAs.",
    "A challenge of this course is that team projects do not really get underway until towards the end of the course. This means that a lot of the lectures seemvery theoretical and conceptual until the latter part of the class, when things begin to make more sense as the theory and concepts are applied through the group project. However, the homeworks early on in the semester were very helpful for understanding the theory \/ concepts. I really liked these homeworks and felt I got a lot out of them. In fact, to some degree, I think I learned more from the homeworks than the group projects.As for the group projects, it seems some students had better luck than others in terms of getting a project that was both manageable in scope and had a responsive client. I think projects should be vetted better by the professors. (Offer fewer projects but make sure they are vetted better for 1) manageable scope for students just starting with LCA; and 2) have responsive clients.)Overall, I'm disappointed that my project was not a good one for deepening understanding of how to conduct an LCA. The project was too broad in scope and the client was too interested in economic assessments rather than environmental assessments, which is really what the course is about. In the end, I feel my project was a failure, and I do not feel comfortable standing by the project recommendations. I think the problem is that we were simply trying to accomplish too much from the get go. This led to too much focus on too many things, meaning each aspect of the project was not carried out in a way that was particularly robust (i.e. relying on too many assumptions), etc. I wish the professors had been more involved in the project all along, so that they could have helped to get us back on track when we got derailed (by not figuring out how to bring the project into a manageable scope).If the professors keep the course format the way it is and continue to have the team final project be a major component of the course and grade, then I think the projects should be vetted better. An alternative approach would be to have less emphasis on client projects and more emphasis on (continued) homeworks throughout the semester.",
    "Course moved very slow particularly in the second half of the semester. More engaging class work might be a better way to keep students engaged and practicing the tools and frameworks from lecture",
    "Great class! I learned a lot from the assignments, lectures, and readings. However, I do have to admit that the class experience is highly dependent on the project\/client that students are assigned. I was fortunate enough to have been assigned a wonderful client.",
    "Class time wasn't always the most productive. I think it would be helpful to teach this class through examples rather than generalized lectures. I learned the most from the in-class exercises with the Ikea Frying Pan example.",

    "The hands-on parts of the course always seemed rushed-through, and any kind of interactive exercise was absent from the last part of the course sessions. It would be better to prioritize these kinds of things over increased lecture time.",
    "The Software presents challenges working in groups as the files could not be shared among group members and had to work of a master computer.",
    "It is important to realize that students are new to this concept and the language used in the class was very technical. Even after reading, it takes little time to adapt the language of the topic. So the explanations must be adjusted accordingly.Instructors were way too fast while explaining. The main objective is to learn to do a LCA and not become an expert of all aspects of it with this one course. So certainly excessive details provided via slides can curtailed. Go slow in the class while explaining.",

    "The last part of the classes weren't very coherent in terms of the content.",

    "Just continuing to make sure that the project deliverable is on the right track throughout the semester would help. Continuing to stress the completion of the model, since that really takes up a significant amount of time.",
