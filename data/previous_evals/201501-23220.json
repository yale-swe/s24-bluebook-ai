    "Take this course if you love Hitchcock (which you should) and want to get to know his work better. You do not need to be a film major to enjoy this course.",
    "I wouldn't take this if you only have a passing interest in Hitchcock films. If that's the case, just watch the movies on your own. If you are really interested in discussing the finer points of each of the films, then I would recommend the class.",
    "fun class! i had never taken a film course and i was fine to take this class, although i was definitely not on the same level as other people",
    "Totally recommend for anybody. Light work load and awesome subject material.",
    "Interesting class not a ton of work - take it",
    "A fun course. The only real assignments are the papers, since the readings are never discussed. Watch a Hitchcock movie on wednesday and discuss it on thursday. A great way to get inside the head of this incredible director.",
    "This class was seriously a blast. If you love Hitchcock films, try your best to get into it. Professor Peucker is one of the leading experts on Hitchcock, so it's really an opportunity you don't want to miss. The class was frustrating at times because it was really obvious that only two people were doing the readings, and as a seminar, that hindered discussions. But if you get a really enthusiastic group of students, I can imagine it would be one of the best classes at Yale (it's certainly one of my favorites so far).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was my favorite class ever."
