    "Course had sort of a strange list of subjects that it covered: started with a lecture on two on muscle stuff, then we dove deep into kinematics, kinetics, and dynamics. There was a brief moment when we talked about some cool math stuff, like some basic group theory (mainly talking about SO(3). That was the first half of the semester. The second half we learned about muscle physiology and about the Huxley model of muscle.",
    "mathematical modeling, basic principles of muscle movement, critical thinking about scientific literature",
    "In this course we studied muscle from an anatomical and mathematical perspective. Anatomically, we looked at the hierarchical organization of muscle. The major mathematical tools that we learned about were rotation matrices, the Jacobian and hill's model of myosin-actin interactions."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the course, though it felt a bit scattered at times. Like we were doing stuff with no clear reason why. Madhu was very good at motivating topics along the way, but even so I felt a little confused as to the trajectory of the class.",
    "Madhu is an awesome professor and you can tell he really cares about the class--lectures are challenging but engaging. There could be a clearer narrative of why we're learning certain concepts as we go through the course because it didn't really seem to come together at the end. I liked that there wasn't much homework but I think a little bit more homework\/some math problems given at the same time as learning the Jacobian, linear algebra concepts could be helpful for reinforcing the concepts, since it's hard to learn math if you're just watching someone else do it.",
    "The strength of this course is that it covers a wide range of topics at the intersection of engineering and biology. Since most engineering classes do not focus on the natural world, I found this course to be engaging and refreshing. It is also unlike other engineering classes in that it does not have a single textbook, nor will your assignments always relate to one another. I can't really pin point anything that I would like to be different about this class."

    "Absolutely. Madhu is an amazing professor and the class is a great opportunity to explore a cool thing in depth. I'm coming more from the math and physics side, so I really liked all the lectures on mechanics, dynamics, and kinematics. Some of my friends in the class were coming more from the biology side, so they liked the muscle physiology stuff more. Regardless of your background, there's something for everybody in this class.",
    "Yes, with some caveats. The material is interesting and lectures are engaging, but they will certainly stretch your brain so be prepared. A good math background is helpful since the class is a lot of linear algebra and being able to think quickly about math helps you keep up in lecture. Almost no homework--we had 3 psets and a project, all were interesting. Madhu is a fantastic lecturer but is very busy, so it can be hard to get support in the class if you need it. Honestly I think I learned more math than biomechanics in this class and I got a lot out of it, even if it wasn't what I was expecting. Don't expect to get an A.",
    "This class uses math to look at biological systems from the perspective of an engineer. If that sounds interesting to you then I would definetly recommend taking it! The p-sets are interesting and comprise most of your final grade. Start them early and take advantage of the collaborative nature of this course by working with your classmates."
