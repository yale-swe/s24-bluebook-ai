    "I learned a lot about historical research and managing a long-term paper timeline.",
    "I learned that writing a book is hard but do-able. Passion will sustain you much longer than anything else.",
    "The Senior Essay taught me how to write a long, complicated, multi-faceted piece of non-fiction. Throughout the process, I also learned how to work with the US National Archives.",
    "I learned soooo much from writing my senior essay. This truly is the most important thing you will do in pursuit of your History degree. I learned so much about how to research effectively, how to break down a large, intimidating project into something manageable, and how to write a narrative in 50 pages. This was unlike anything I had ever done before, and it was incredibly rewarding.",
    "Research skills, independent work, severe cramming",
    "Great experience",
    "I do feel I was able to bring my history coursework together and produce new original research.",
    "This was such a great experience to dive into a topic and to explore how to make an argument within widely read material. I visited an archive for the first time while working on this project, which was an amazing experience.",
    "Valuable insight into how to conduct an original research project.",
    "Primary source analysis, evaluating all of the secondary material on a subject, carving out a distinct niche in the historiography, archival research, and time\/project management skills.",
    "This was the defining assignment of my time at Yale and the culmination of all of my training and studying as a history major.",
    "I learned how to develop and write an original 50 page piece of work, something that I have never done before.",
    "I really enjoyed working closely with my advisor and feel like I really learned a lot about how to do in-depth, primary source research and write a solid paper.",
    "Learned the methods of in-depth historical research and writing. Also learned a lot of content specific to my thesis topic.",
    "I learned what it means to actually do historical research.",
    "I developed skills that made me an effective primary source researcher."

   "comments": [
    "The history thesis is a signature and essential part of a Yale education for majors. It's fun, interesting, challenging, and important.",
    "Extremely laissez faire. This is probably a good thing, but there were moments where I felt unmoored.",
    "Overall, I thought that this yearlong essay-writing process was extremely rewarding, and I am very glad that I did it. However, the most frustrating part of the whole process were the intermediate deadlines throughout the year required by the department. I did not find these useful, and, instead, found that they actually distracted from whatever other analysis\/writing I was doing at the time so as to be able to get the milestone assignments completed on time.",
    "Your experience with the senior essay will depend immensely on whom you choose as your advisor. I can only speak for my own experience with my exceptional advisor, but I know that many other history majors had experiences which varied drastically from mine. One specific suggestion I would make in terms of the timeline of due dates that seniors are given would be to add a deadline for an outline.",
    "Advisors make all the difference, and if yours doesn't really care about you, you have no way of really engaging fully. Also communications are very poor and there are a number of meaningless checkpoints that actually detracted from the finished project in my opinion.",
    "I really enjoyed working with my adviser because she added even more structure to the existing framework of the thesis process.",
    "Would be useful if more writing took place in the first semester; I found that I was writing nonstop for about a month during the second semester, which was fairly stress-inducing and all-consuming.",
    "Fantastic in every way! Very well organized and the expectations are clearly delineated.",
    "The due dates throughout the year seemed a bit arbitrary, and while the handbook was helpful in explaining how various parts of the essay fit together, a little more detail at the beginning of the year would have been useful.",
    "The deadlines and requirements (specifically where and when to turn stuff in) listed on Canvas and in the PDF senior essay handbook often conflicted and caused many students stress.",
    "The process for the senior thesis is incredibly flawed in the history department. The handbook has things in it that have been there for two decades or more, and the grading structure is outdated. You get some random reader at the end of the year, and the grade is completely arbitrary. There is no rubric, so your grade is generally going to be up to a tenured professor who may decide they just dislike the subject you are writing about. Whatever your advisor says might not actually happen. You could get an A if you do really well, or if you just get an easy grader. You could get a B if you get unlucky with the grader. I believe this structure needs to be fixed because most other departments let the advisor grade the paper. Be prepared to lose distinction with no good explanation other than the grader didnt like the topic you spent a year on.",
    "I think that having deadlines along the way are helpful to ensure that you're following along and are keeping up with researching and writing the paper. I feel like there could have been more check-ins along the way in the second semester, though. It felt like we were just all of a sudden told to go write the entire thing.",
    "Strengths - chance to work with an advisor on a year long research project. Weaknesses not many, but some of the assignments in the first semester don't seem all that helpful towards progressing towards the final product, specifically the 3-page primary source analysis.",
    "It would be helpful to have an actually meeting time to workshop with other history majors.",
    "The process is pretty unorganized on the department's side and puts a lot of impetus on advisors to make things clear for students.",
    "Having to write an essay in the spring of senior year is stressful for many of us and takes a bit away from our last year at college."

    "You have to take it if you're a major, and it's a really wonderful experience. Pick your adviser wisely and get started early.",
    "YESSSS",
    "Yes. Be a history major.",
    "If you are a history major, you basically have to take this class. To the juniors reading this--start early! Start doing your research early, start your writing early, start your editing early! The amount of time you have to complete the project feels like it compresses as you get the end, so be sure to leave enough time at the beginning to get going on it! Also, remember that you have to have the entire thing bound by Tyco before you hand it in, so leave time for that too!",
    "Absolutely. I have never worked so hard on a single project in my life and it was difficult and rewarding. The final product is something I am really proud of.",
    "No",
    "Yes writing a two -semester thesis is highly rewarding",
    "The thesis is required, but I highly recommend getting invested in the process.",
    "Yes!",
    "grading standards vary wildly amongst readers, so no.",
    "Yes definitely! I would recommend the year-long essay, as it really gives you a chance to comprehensively evaluate your topic, travel once (or maybe even more) to collect primary source information, and produce the presumably longest academic work of your Yale career. I am very grateful I did the year-long essay and know that I will cherish my final product for years to come.",
    "No, I would not recommend this to another student unless the history department fixes their grading process. The process is outdated and is completely arbitrary. Your grade depends on a random reader. If Professor Jennifer Klein is the director again, she tends to give a random reader not even on your recommended list. This could be good or bad, but you have no way of knowing until after you spend a year putting together your work that can be quickly dismissed. I recommend doing the 1 semester thesis rather than the full year and just get it out of the way. Until they fix the year long thesis process, it is broken and not worth the time. You get absolutely nothing out of it.",
    "Absolutely. I know that it's required for a senior history major to take this, but I still think everyone who writes a paper will enjoy this process immensely.",
    "If you're a history major. I would definitely recommend the full year thesis over the one semester.",
    "Yes!",
    "Good",
    "I think that every history major should do a full year thesis.",
    "No",
    "You have to do this for a requirement for the History major."
