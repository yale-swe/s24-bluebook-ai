   "comments": [
    "The class is somewhat time consuming and pricey,but overall it has been my favorite class at Yale.",
    "Most definitely if you have the money and time.",
    "If you are interested in photography, take this course, you will have a really great time.",
    "Very relaxed class, with much darkroom time required, but this can be done at the time of your own choosing. Very beneficial, although I feel that if I had taken it with Lisa, I would have learned so much more. But not nearly had as much fun!!",
    "Take it because its fun and you really challenge yourself in each critic. But remember that the dark room is very timedemanding",
    "Intro. to Photography was a general introduction to the medium. The focus was on the students and their own personal creation of artwork. Though we did learn about some important photographers, the majority of the learning came from the hours spent in the darkroom trying to perfect one's personal technique.I would definitely recommend it because I ended up in love with photography, and I must assume that a large part of that love is a result of the course. It was extremely fun, engaging, and interesting.",
    "Art 136 is a great course. Intro to Photo was my first art class since high school. I'm glad I decided to take it and will definitely follow up with another photo class. Keep in mind that the workload is pretty heavy. Yet, it is a rewarding experience when all is said and done, and I am proud to say that I have taken up a new interest.",
    "Intro Photo is a good class to learn about the history of photography (and photographers), and the technical aspects of making a photograph. It seems to be as good as the effort you put into the class. Sometimes, it was frustrating when it seemed there was no direction to the class, or guidance on how to make better photos, but in the end, it was definitely worth it. Phillip was just letting us figure out (more on our own) how and what to photograph. I would definitely recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in photography - not just taking pictures of your friends - and willing to put in the time and energy necessary to make good photographs.",
    "Fantastic introductory class. Very challenging and time-intensive, but if you put in the work, you will be rewarded. Teaches you the basics of photo technique, but also reviews the major works by 19th\/20th century photographers.",
    "A LOT OF WORK, they are really not kidding when they write this. and really hard to do exceptionally well. take it to learn photo, work ALOT, but keep it credit d.",
    "This class is not an easy A. It requires a lot of work. Unfortunately it is difficult to tell when someone has put in effort and when someone has worked for 20 min. Be prepared to spend far too long in crits without getting any beneficial feedback.",
    "Basic photo class, take 2 rolls a week, make prints, lectures\/conversations about famous photographers",
    "Learn about photographs and make some photographs. A great change of pace from normal academic work yet quite challenging too. Nonartists - take it if you have any interest, you won't regret it. Phil is a great professor and a good man."
