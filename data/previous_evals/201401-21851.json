    "Absolutely, if you can get in!! He was a great advisor for a senior essay as well!",
    "AAAAA This is a pretty good poli sci seminar, though it got kind of wishy washy towards the end and kinda boring because circuitous discussions about random things and such. Good class overall for the selection of topics though.",
    "PLSC 214 is a great opportunity to delve into the literature on gridlock and other aspects of the contemporary political system.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I think it suffered from four fundamental problems: first, the syllabus felt like a collection of discrete topics arranged in arbitrary order, rather than a set of topics that built a coherent narrative about the politics of public policy in the United States. Second, the grad-undergrad dynamic in the seminar was not conducive to strong academic discourse, producing at best lackluster discussion and at worst a hostile environment for undergraduate contributions. Third, the weak focus on the assigned readings led to classes frequently devolving into repetitive Republican-bashing. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I left this course without being able to say I learned anything about about any particular area of public policy. There's clearly value in developing general theories about the relationship of economic inequality, for example; there's also value in closely examining specific case studies that can nuance and complicate our understanding of those general theories. In crime policy, there are politics of race, class, and gender (to name but a few) that deserve to be examined in their proper historical and policy context. Unfortunately, this class lacked those sorts of careful discussions. In short: unless this class undergoes major revisions, there are many better undergraduate seminars in political science for policy-minded undergrads."
