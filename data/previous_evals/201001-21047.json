    "Documenting the world is a great class for every humanities student interested in empire, hybrid identities, the imagination of the Other, or diaspora communities, and would like to address these questions from a non-textual perspective, i.e. looking at paintings, drawings, illustrations, etc. to understand transcultural history. It was a very challenging, productive, and intellectually stimulating seminar, also in terms of class presentations: remembering the final presentations, I was truly impressed how art historians approach transcultural research."

    "I have been interested in topics like transcultural exchange and borrowing, and the imagination of the Other for a while. Addressing these questions through the prism of art \u0096 using images and material objects to trace cross-cultural transfer and the perception of other cultures - was a new and very stimulating approach, which significantly refined, deepened and expanded my understanding. I will certainly make use of these insights in my dissertation, however, I guess even more of it will go into my second, or my third book!"
