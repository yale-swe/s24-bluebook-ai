    "If you're interested in reading plays and writing your own then you'd be remiss to not take this class. Do the work though, it will be obvious when you're BS-ing. Depending on how you write, this class could be painless or a struggle bus.",
    "DO IT! I LOVED this course! It was a fantastic introduction to the world of playwriting. The readings are a revelation -- I've been buying a bunch of additional plays to read for pleasure throughout the semester. Of course, the meat of the class is writing scenes. You will end the semester with a one-act play that you can (hopefully) be proud of. It's not a writing course that will necessarily improve your writing skills per se, but it's different kind of writing. It's fresh -- it's about pacing, it's about building a compelling story. RAISE THE STAKES! FIND YOUR EVENT! Prof. Margulies is the most charming man you will ever encounter. His kindness matches his boundless talent. He is sharp, full of wisdom and a great mentor. This class was by far the most fun I've had in a workshop setting. If you get in, you'd be crazy not to take it.",
    "If you get into this class, definitely definitely TAKE IT! Prof. Margulies is an awesome teacher, especially because he is a practicing playwright right now, so his teachings are practical rather than purely theoretical. It's so fun to read 1-3 plays a week and workshop your own writing. I am very interested in playwriting, so I would definitely recommend this to anyone even vaguely interested in playwriting, but honestly I feel like the class would be super fun and rewarding even if you just love writing in general.",
    "Good class. Though I wish Professor Margulies more directly addressed the principles and pitfalls of effective playwriting: particularly based on his own experiences as a playwright.",
    "Yes, I'd absolutely recommend this class. It's a fantastic use of your time if you're interesting in writing, and a totally worthwhile experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. I read some fantastic plays that deeply inspired me and made me love theatre even more than I already did.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested in an intensive study the art of writing plays with one of the greatest voices of modern American playwriting. Professor Margulies leads his seminar through a study of major works of 20th Century American and British theater. Over the course of the semester, Professor Margulies coaxes out various techniques, approaches, and styles of playwriting that have been pursued by accomplished playwrights. Along the way, Professor Margulies challenges his students to experiment with different forms and styles through various exercises. The course culminates in the writing of a one-act play. The highlight of the course is the opportunity to workshop writing with the class and Professor Margulies. Students taking this course should be prepared to write weekly and share approximately ten pages of new work with the class every other week. The opportunity to workshop new work is very valuable and so students who take their writing seriously (rather than writing something the day before the assignment is due) will benefit much more from the course. For students who are interested in playwriting or are simply exploring another form of creative writing, this is a class not to be missed.",
    "Great way to jump right into playwriting."
