    "I would recommend this section to any freshman who wants to improve their academic writing ability.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. It's a really good way to become a more critical reader and a better argumentative writer, and it will change how you evaluate your own, and others', writing.",
    "English 114 is a class in which you analyze documents, construct arguments, find tensions in other's arguments, and really understand how to logically structure a paper. You look at structure, scope, argument, and archive. I would recommend it this class to anyone. Even if you are able to take 120, like I was, you should take this class because it really allows you to delve into argument analysis. Also, you may be able to get an article published!",
    "It's a great english course where you become a more critical reader and writer. After this course, you are able to more easily identify problems within a work, and you become better at elaborating on this problem. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The topic is interesting and not like a typical English class.",
    "Very fun class because the topics are always relevant and forceful. If you need to fulfill a distributional requirement, this is definitely the class to take.",
    "This course is great for those that need a writing credit. I would definitely recommend it for anyone needing a writing credit and wants to take an English course",
    "It is a good introduction to college writing, so I would recommend it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course for anyone seeking to improve his or her writing skills.",
    "A look at debates across cultures and disciplines that will change your perspective in ways you could never imagine."
