    "Due to the emphasis on theory, I was introduced to many new ideas and perspectives concerning the spatiality of literature. I believe that the theory aspect of this course was particularly strong, and provided a theoretical base from which I can pull for subsequent research papers. Additionally, I found that the way we approached texts by focusing on space to be unique and productive. I thoroughly enjoyed the course."

    "The course is really great in theory. But, there was too much material. This made seminar discussion feel disorganized and, often, unproductive.",
    "Strengths: -Lots of theory -Exposure to a wide variety of authors, both theoretical and literary -Productive and engaging discussions in class that engaged directly with the texts Weaknesses: -At times the reading load was too much, and I sometimes felt that I could not thoroughly absorb the material in a week's time."
