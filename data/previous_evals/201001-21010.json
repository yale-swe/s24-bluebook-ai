   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend the course. It is informative and interesting, even for students who are not primarily interested in phonology. The homework assignments are manageable and relevant, and the format of the class seems organized and well thought out.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in current phonological theory (ie OT).",
    "As an extension to phonology I, this class is more in depth and serious look at phonology and theoretical approaches. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in phonology.",
    "Phonology II takes students through phonological theory of ca. 1980 to the present, focusing in large part on Optimality Theory, which has played a pivotal role in linguistic theory since the early 1990s. Students learn to produce high-quality OT analyses as well as to consider the broader theoretical issues involved with this method of analysis. Homework assignments vary in their length and difficulty, but they are manageable. A working understanding of OT is essential for any student of linguistics, and this course does a great job of presenting the theory."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned contemporary theories used primarily for phonology but which also can be applied to other subdisciplines within linguistics. This fulfills general program requirements, as well as providing perspective on the state of the subfield of phonology, and providing a background for approaching a variety of problems using current theories.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of a subfield and increased my level of understanding the workings of phonological theory. Since phonology is not my particular area of study, it is not immediately obvious how the course has contributed to my research, but it has offered an introduction to a framework which has been extended to many subfields. I feel as though I am now better prepared to understand the literature which has adopted this framework.",
    "I have always been interested in phonology, but my lack of knowledge about Lexical Phonology and Optimality Theory held me back in my ability to read and assess recent and current phonological literature. It is likely that I will use several aspects of what I have learned in this course in my future research."
