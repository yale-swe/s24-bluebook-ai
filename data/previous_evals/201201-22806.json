    "English 120 is a creative non-fiction writing course. Despite its reputation for a heavy workload, if managed correctly, it's definitely manageable. The essay topics are interesting and allow for personal\/creative answers that end up being fun to write about. I would highly recommend Professor Wepler and the course in general because I believe they improved my writing skills without the course being a stereotypical intro writing course.",
    "Professor Wepler is a great professor! He is really flexible on his deadlines and assignments, which is really handy when things are stressful in life and for other classes. He is also a great discussion facilitator and made discussions very interesting while keeping the atmosphere relaxed. He is a bit harsh on the grading but provided very valuable feedback. The class is a bit demanding and the workload is quite heavy but very worth it for the readings and improvement in your writing.",
    "English 120 is a fantastic course for anyone who acknowledges that they could benefit from learning to write better. The course also teaches you to become a much more active reader, and helps you develop the ability to recognize the importance of subtleties when trying to communicate a message in prose. Of course, this skill transfers to other areas outside of prose and is thus a useful framework \/ perspective to develop. The peer-peer feedback and exercises were fantastic and I very much enjoyed getting to know my classmates in the small section. The consistent writing, includes drafts and exercises, force you to constantly think about your writing, and thus consistently develop throughout the course as you build upon your techniques.",
    "Readings for each class, an essay each week, response letters every other week and a style challenge each week. You will only get out what you put into this course. Do not take it if you are not prepared to work hard on your writing.",
    "English 120 is a great introductory writing course. I believe it bettered my writing and raised it up to a college level. Granted, writing papers every week was a little taxing, but it really helped me improve my writing skills. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Introduction to the world of writing as an art. Let go of expository academic essays for a semester. It is a must take at yale.",
    "YES!!!! If you consider yourself a genius writer, take this class. If you consider yourself a bad writer, take this class.",
    "I would like to start with a little note on the difference between English 114 and 120. I was very confused about this as a freshman, and after taking both courses, I do not feel that the classes are adequately explained to students. They are two very different courses, and English 120 is not necessarily harder than 114. In fact, I found 114 to be harder. Both are challenging in very different ways. 114 is more about academic writing and 120 is creative nonfiction. So, do not be intimidated by English 120 and definitely do not write off 114 as easy or remedial.English 120 is, as most who have taken the course will tell you, a fun and challenging class. The readings are great, and the course both improves your general writing skills and allows you to write creatively, something that you are not able to do in most other classes.Professor Ryan Wepler is a wonderful teacher, and I am very glad that I took English 120 with him. Classes were always engaging and productive. More importantly, he was very approachable and willing to work with students outside of class. For each essay, we had a mandatory one-on-one meeting with him before the final draft was due, but he was more than willing to meet outside of this mandatory meeting. He was always helpful in brainstorming and working through ideas for essays before the first draft was due. If I had a question over the weekend, he responded quickly to email. His feedback on writing was encouraging (he always praised the best parts of our essays), but constructive. I also liked the six-essay structure of his course--some of the other classes only do five. With six essays, each essay counted a little less, and we also got to do an experimental essay, which was so much fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student- it is a staple of the Yale experience, in my opinion."
