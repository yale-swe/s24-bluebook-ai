   "comments": [
    "STRENGTHS:Overall great course. Please see question 7 for a more thorough explanation.I felt as though this course provided me an opportunity to learn, without being scared that I do not have what it takes.WEAKNESSES:Some of the guest lecturers could have delivered more concise information. They guest lecturers were overall good, but should be reminded that they should be introducing the topic (i.e. pathogen, host, transmission) in addition to the specific vaccines, lab techniques, etc. Some had an appropriate understanding of their role, while it seemed as others were giving specifically a lab talk.",
    "Should be advertised as a discussion course.",
    "The idea of this class is great but poorly executed. I liked how different presenters were brought in to talk about each parasite. However, the structure of the discussions were redundant and not always useful. First of all, many of the papers were ill-matched to the scientific background of the students, making it difficult for anyone to contribute anything meaningful to the discussion. The discussions were surface-level and never really critiqued anything (also probably due to lack of background in the class). Also, the student presentations of a paper that the entire class has already read, critiqued, and discussed themselves was boring and counterproductive. Instead, the student presentation should be on a related paper, that would give new information to the class and enrich the following discussion.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about parasites. The guest speakers were all very interesting and the course's discussion based structure helped me improve my scientific reading and critical thinking skills. I would recommend the use of the Resources section of classesv2 instead of the announcements page for article posting. It would also be beneficial to students to have access to articles to be reviewed at least two weeks in advance.",
    "-liked the variety of topics covered; perhaps a little too much emphasis on malaria-great guest lectures-liked the weekly paper analyses-found the final assignment challenging but enjoyable-Diane was responsive to students and clearly very knowledgeable; quick turn-around on assignments",
    "Strengths: interesting approach to the subject; presentations by faculty included a broad range of aspects from diagnostics to the status of disease worldwide.Weaknesses: the biochemistry\/immunology background that was the basis for some of the papers may require supporting reading and information to enhance the understanding of these particular articles.",
    "The topic of this course is great. The execution really depends on the students in the class - our discussions were really weak, which definitely took away from the course, but it has the potential to be great.",
    "This course was a very good introduction to eukaryotic parasites. I really appreciated the written discussion analysis we did almost every week. They allowed me to think critically about the papers we read and to analyze them and think of ways in which the work could be improved. This class really helped me to improve my scientific analysis skills. The student presentations were a great way for each of us to lead the class in discussion and I really liked that we each gave our opinion of the discussion paper at the beginning of each class. The guest speakers were all very knowledgeable and gave us good background on the diseases being taught.",
    "The format of this course (1 or 2 lectures followed by one discussion) is excellent. I appreciated having the foundation of a lecture before preparing discussion analysis papers on the topics. I also appreciated having the guest lecturers who could give more insight to their own work. Very excellent.",
    "This is a great course. The guest lectures keep the content cutting-edge and interesting. The assignments and discussions improve skills for critically reading and understanding scientific literature.",
    "This course excelled at providing great levels of detail in the study of several different parasitic pathogens, though sometimes the details got in the way of learning about the disease itself as they became increasingly complex."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt is an excellent instructor. I believe that she taught the course to our level of knowledge (some students have lab background, others do not; some know NTDs well, others do not, etc). She was very responsive to student questions, emails, etc. and was readily available to meet in person as well.She provided a good structure to the course, from an intro lecture, to a well-planned semester schedule that accommodated both guest lectures, student presentations. She picked appropriate readings for the course.The grading scale seems fair, and I was encouraged to work hard b\/c Diane provided valuable feedback.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Effective",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Encouraging to the students but not always aware that the class lacked backgrounds for many of the papers chosen for discussion. Also, her lectures could be more interesting if they were more interactive and discussion-based themselves.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt was very approachable. I learned a lot from the comments that she left on my review articles. Thank you!",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt was very helpful throughout the semester; the description of assignments outlined the class goals clearly and most of the articles and information selected for this course was recent and easy to approach.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr McMahon-Pratt is a wonderful professor and an excellent teacher. She did a great job teaching the various topics we covered and she made sure to keep the class engaged as we went along. She was very good at answering questions that students may have and she always encouraged us to think critically through the papers we had read.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Excellent, patient and understanding instructor.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0She has a sincere interest in making sure her students succeed.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Very knowledgeable, always able to answer even the toughest questions about parasitic diseases. I think a collaboration between the student and professor when choosing which papers to present could result in more interesting and engaging presentations."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Students should not be scared away by the \"cellular and molecular\" description of the course title, as I almost was. I do not have a bench science background, so I was afraid this may hamper my success in the course. While I certainly learned more about cellular and molecular techniques, and had do to some additional reading on my own, I feel as though a background in this is not necessary to succeed in this course.",
    "Not as exciting as it sounds. To truly take something away from this class, you should probably have a pretty rich background in immunology, biochemistry, and lab techniques. The discussions are redundant but the visiting lectures are often pretty interesting - again, especially if you have the adequate background to appreciate them.",
    "I enjoyed this course and learned a lot about parasites and how to critique scientific articles. I also learned a lot from my peers' comments.",
    "-would recommend, especially if have a background in microbiology-liked the structure of the course very much",
    "A seminar style course that looks at the major groups of parasites and the disease they cause. Emphasis on the neglected tropical diseases, supported by current research from Yale faculty and peer presentations and reviews.",
    "This course was a very good introduction to eukaryotic parasites and I would highly recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Good course. Interesting. Great speakers. Make sure you have time to do the work.",
    "Learned a lot from this course, but it's a lot of work",
    "A great course with a new and in-depth view of parasitology today. Full of new information and great guest lectures.",
    "This is an excellent look at severl different parasitic pathogens and some cutting edge methods to control them. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the study of parasitic disease."
