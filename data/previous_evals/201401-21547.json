   "comments": [
    "A survey of some major literary theorists of the 20th century. I would recommend it only if the student is interested in Lit Theory.",
    "Beware the cross-listing. This is definitely a Literature\/Comp Lit class, and not an English class. If you are an English major, be prepared to adjust to all the differences in approach between the two departments. It kind of takes a while to get used to how Literature people read - what counts as good evidence, for a ready example. It's a pretty fun course, and you will get a good introduction to a bunch of writers. You may not understand each one completely, but you will know which ones interest you and merit further exploration.",
    "I avoid philosophy\/theory like the plague so I was worried going into this class, but with the way it's currently structured, you can get out of it as much as you're willing to put in. The quizzes are fairly straightforward, and there is a lot of leeway when it comes to paper grading. If you love theory, Professor Jacobs gives great lectures explaining and taking apart all of the thinkers, and you can go in depth with all the works. If you are taking this class because you have to for the lit major, you can get by learning certain \"platitudes\" from each thinker and reciting them for the quizzes and integrating them somehow into the papers.",
    "As a prereq course for the Lit major, I thought this class would be a bit boring - never was I more happy to be proven wrong. This class is both engaging and challenging, and it really pushed me to consider the fundamental elements of literature. Questions about writing, the possibility of communication and knowledge, and why studying works of literature actually matters are discussed at great length with great sincerity. I took this course as a freshman and am so glad I did. The background in lit theory that I gained will be extremely helpful to me moving forward, and I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in theory.",
    "You are most likely taking LITR 300 to fulfill the lit major requirement. Even so, I enjoyed the course and thought that it helped lay groundwork for how to interpret works in a specific and \"scientific\" way (our final paper allowed us to do just that). I had never previously been exposed to the works of Barthes, de Man, Derrida, etc., and probably wouldn't have read them on my own. Lectures sometimes got a little bit repetitive, since we often ended up applying the theory\/criticism at hand to the text itself, but overall, I would recommend LITR 300.",
    "Prof Jacobs is great! Exceedingly brilliant, clearly. Great reading list. Interesting lectures. Take it!",
    "If you're thinking about taking ENGL 300, don't be intimidated by the readings. The instructor and section leaders do a wonderful job of making it palatable.",
    "This isn't a \"survey;\" you won't emerge with an understanding of literary theory's \"narrative\" or \"historical development.\" And that's because no such narrative exists. Professor Jacobs is incredibly thoughtful and lovely and personable. Lectures may be hard to follow -- don't beat yourself up if you don't understand Foucault or de Man -- but Professor Jacobs has fascinating things to say about each text.",
    "With Carol Jacobs, this class is not at all what it sounds like--i.e., not a survey class, and kind of also not an introductory class. It is, however, an awesome, challenging, thought-provoking class. Basically, you won't get much context or historical background for any of the texts, but you will get to see a genius close-reading really difficult theorists in lecture twice a week. The assignments--close-reading a passage from the readings and then putting a theorist in conversation with a text of your choice--are great, and the quizzes aren't difficult. The readings are almost all very challenging, but if you put in work on your own and in section and resign yourself to not understanding everything, they're really rewarding.",
    "LITR 300 with a Carol Jacobs is a really good introduction to literary theory, even for those of you who have never studied authors such as Benjamin, Foucault, and Derrida before. The class is not a survey so much as a selective study of some of the most influential authors; professor Jacobs does close readings of each author's texts over several weeks. If you do the readings, watching her untangle each work and discuss the possibility of interpretation can be fascinating. If you don't, the lectures end up seeming pretty dry."
