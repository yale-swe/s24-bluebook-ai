    "The class has many intriguing and inspiring readings. And you can do a thorough project on almost any topic you are passionate for.",
    "prof. wexler is a phenomenally engaged and generous professor. she's very clearly committed to the type of feminist pedagogy that this seminar discussed - she practices what she preaches! and thank goodness she does, because it makes for a wonderful seminar environment, unlike any other i've taken. the lab component is a great chance to learn a LOT about the many digital tools you can use to produce the final project, and also to personally engage with some of the technologies that are considered and questioned in readings and in seminar. the course is one 'node' of the multi-university DOCC - distributed open collaborative course - called dialogues on feminism and technology. the DOCC is huge and full of possibilities, and being part of it means that the experience of the course can extend as far and continue as long as you want."
