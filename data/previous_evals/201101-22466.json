    "This class is nearly impossible to review for future classes because it was driven so much by Professor Nassar's personality and she is leaving this year. If it is ever offered again, though, take note that this is not an *Introduction* to the Modern Middle East, but rather an introduction to Modern Middle East *Studies*. There is a good reason that it is a 400-level seminar. If you want an intro to the Modern Middle East take Professor Foster's excellent survey course. That having been said, if you are a NELC or MMES major, a course where you look at the discipline itself is extremely valuable, and I urge you to take it.",
    "Hala is leaving so I imagine whoever teaches this class will do it quite differently. An interesting class though",
    "Since Prof. Nassar is leaving Yale, this class is likely to change considerably. I found the readings to be, on the whole, very good; if you're not going to get the chance to read Said's Orientalism in another setting, you should take the class so you can read and discuss it, granted that it's still on the syllabus. Also, discussion in my class was not very fruitful; make sure that both the professor and your classmates are interested in fluid discussion.",
    "Note: this is an introduction to the study of the Modern Middle East, NOT an introduction to the Middle East. If you don't already have a solid basic knowledge base on the Middle East, this is not the class for you.That said, I enjoyed the class. The more effort you put into it, the more you get out of it."
