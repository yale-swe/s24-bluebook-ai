   "comments": [
    "I learned that Global Environmental History is not a clear-cut field. There are a lot of competing theories as to what has happened and why and each one is debatable. I also learned that droughts are a defining cause of civilization collapse, that variability in climate is as dangerous as high\/low averages, and a lot of the vocabulary needed to talk about enviro history.",
    "I learned a broad overview of the environmental climate fluxes since the start of the Holocene, human responses and interactions with environmental change, and the rise and fall of modern civilizations.",
    "This course taught me how to identify the major periods of transformation in global environmental history, from the dawn of humankind to the present. The vocabulary associated with this history, I am sure, will prove invaluable to my future academic career in environmental studies.",
    "I learnt a very general history of the strat of civilisation in mesopotamia and it's progression to the present day. I learnt about the archeologicaltechniques employed to recover data.",
    "I gained an understanding of how climate events influenced the development of human societies starting in ancient times and how that data is collected and evaluated.",
    "I learnt a lot from this course! There are a lot of readings but are worth doing.",
    "I learned how the environment affects the course of human evolution and human movement patterns, and contributes to the rise and fall of civilizations.",
    "We learned about the relationships between environmental crisis and human civilizations. In particular, we learned that drought was the main factor when determining the survival chance of ancient civilizations. We also learned how archaeologists collect data and are able to study the climatic conditions of thousands of years ago.",
    "I have learned much more about ancient history and civilization."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Its fascinating course material. I was able to remember why I enjoyed it because I wasnt overloaded with work. Weaknesses: I wish there was more discussion of the overarching themes and how those inform our understanding of the present. There were also some topics for which the connection to environmental history was unclear.",
    "Strengths: the lectures are clear, straightforward, and interesting. Weaknesses: while the class content is interesting, it would have been improved with a higher degree of organization. I also would have appreciated reading responses to make students accountable for the assigned readings (I'm pretty sure one out of the 30+ students did the readings...) They really were interesting and if there had been an incentive from the teacher - perhaps a reading response and\/or short student discussions during the lesson - they may have further enhanced the student experience in the course.",
    "It was a really interesting course and the prof is very passionate about the subject, so that made coming in at 9am easier. The professor should give an outline of the lectures thats a little more detailed, however, because he had a tendency to go off on tangents.",
    "The strengths of the course lie in much of the subject material, much of which is fascinating to EVST and ARCH majors. However, the course load is extremely heavy, but almost none of the readings were actually necessary. For instance, students who spent a couple of hours preparing for the midterm, but hadn't done the reading since the class's start, received perfect scores on the midterm. Additionally, the class periods are very long. Although the material is certainly interesting, it is difficult to sit passively at a computer or notebook and listen to Professor Weiss' lecture without losing interest after the first 50 minutes or so.",
    "I loved this course as lecture and readings are very interesting. However the course was quite disorganised.",
    "Lectures were sometimes interesting but often felt disorganised. The syllabus was out of date. The exams were fair and straight forward, for the most part.",
    "The course has a very interesting topic; since its title is \"global\" however, it would be great to include more regions outside of the near East in future semesters.",
    "The material was really interesting and Harvey Weiss knows so much. I wish that the lecture notes had a little more on them because it was often difficult to take notes in class.",
    "I thought some of the lectures were a little difficult to follow along with at times, but when slideshows were used in the lectures at the end of the semester, I found it a lot easier to follow along.",
    "The course could definitely have clearer specifications for the assignments.",
    "The course was somewhat disorganized, but was very interesting."

   "comments": [
    "If you need an easy 5th class take this class. I never did the readings and still did well in class. There is only a midterm, a (very short) paper and a final. Both exams were short answer\/IDs (so very easy). Material isn't that interesting and Weiss tends to go off on very long tangents and take very long pauses in the middle of his sentences.",
    "Yes, and I already have. I really enjoyed my time in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course as a low-workload, yet rewarding educational experience. I learned a lot from the lecture and Professor Weiss is a very engaging, if eccentric lecturer.",
    "Great 5th credit - not too much work, only a midterm, final, and small final project. Dont take it if you cant make it to 9am lectures, as lectures are far more important than the readings.",
    "The class is great if you are looking for a course that introduces you to an interesting subject in no extensive depth, or if you are looking for a course that requires minimal effort. However, if you are looking to spend time thinking about and learning about the natural history of our planet, or if you are looking to come away from the class with a newfound appreciation for the role of humans in the world, this is likely not the course for you.",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting gut. I came out this class wanting to learn more about many topics we covered and wanting to finish reading the books we started.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student-- I found it a very good introduction to the field of archaeology and a compelling argument in favor of climate as a force that shapes us as much as we shape it.",
    "I would recommend this to a student looking for a history class or a social credit with a manageable workload.",
    "I would recommend this class as a 5th class. You learn a lot and it is interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload was manageable and even enjoyable at times, and I understood why I was doing it. Class was interesting to go to.",
    "Yes! This course was super interesting and although we study the climatic conditions of the past, the relevance of the topic in our present makes it all more important to take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was extremely interesting."
