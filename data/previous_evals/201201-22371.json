    "If you are pre-med, you have no option. If not, please dont bother.",
    "i would say you learn a lot of detail about molecular biology but it's definitely not a low-stress class, especially with isaacs at the beginning, weekly quizzes, weekly discussion papers, and fast paced lectures. I would kind of recommend it but not a lot.",
    "Yes--very good preparation for the rest of biology you will take at Yale.",
    "MCDB 200 is a great way to understand more about molecular biology. Anybody who is interested in biology should take this course, especially if you want priority when trying to take MCDB 201L",
    "Something to take if you need a biology\/life science credit, but have already placed out of the introductory biology course with an AP or SATII test. Not recommended otherwise; lectures were dry and papers were a struggle to read.",
    "An excellent course, I really enjoyed the weekly quizzes and and non cumulative testing format, it was a great improvement over what was there before. If you are looking for an interesting challenging biology class that doesn't involve the raw amount of time required by cell bio. or the boring nature of developmental bio. look no further this is your course!",
    "A decent overview course that focuses on the central dogma. There are weekly quizzes that are ok, and the lecturers are all fine. Professor Pyle was particularly good.",
    "Run away from this class. Super interesting and very relavent material taught in the worst way possible. AWFUL class with AWFUL professors, filled with freshmen pre-meds who are annoying. Easy weekly quizzes and hard midterms, you never know what is going on with the class. Also, Farren should be removed from his teaching position because he was the worst part of this class.",
    "So the first thing to be aware of when thinking about taking this class is that the format has changed. It's no longer graded through take-home exams. Now, it's 50% even split between one midterm and one final with a further 35% from weekly quizzes, and the last 15$ from participation. That being said, the class is not terribly difficult and the lectures were even pretty interesting (apart from Isaacs'). But, the weekly quizzes are a pain to study for and it's not until the middle of the semester that you'll really hash out a good way of studying for them as well as doing the 50 other things you do (c'mon, be honest). If you're pre-med or a MCDB major or thinking of doing anything related to biology, I would definitely recommend this course. But if not, there are many other science classes out there that you'll probably find more interesting and less stressful.",
    "no. take a different biology",
    "This year was the first year many big changes in MCDB 200 were implemented, and thus we were kind of like guinea pigs. The class went from 3 take home tests to weekly quizzes, one midterm, and one final. The weekly quizzes were sometimes a little ridiculous. You really need to study the material well in order to do well on them. Sometimes the reading was way too much for just one week. There is a ton of memorization in this class. You will benefit from using the lectures as your guide to what is important. The papers we discussed in section were very difficult. I would have liked it if section had a little more to do with the material taught in the lectures, like a review or discussion of the concepts from the class itself.",
    "Take it if you need it. This or genetics can satisfy your credit for pre-med, and this class might be a little easier on the grading side. Perhaps this class will not be as fascinating though as genetics. I suggest you go through shopping period and see which one is best.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for a detailed course on the central dogma. The setup of the course is pretty rough (a quiz every week), but preparing for the quizzes just helps you study for the midterm\/final. There are also discussion papers, which are mostly a pain simply because of their complexity. But for an intro biology class, it does a good job providing a stepping stone from something like AP Biology in high school to some harder biology course like Cell Biology.",
    "Decent class for a bio credit. Easier than cell bio, though if you're a bio major (I'm not) you don't have a choice. Reading the book is hard to find time to do and the lectures are sufficient, but reading significantly helps.",
    "Its pretty foundational information (and probably why the MCDB track is now requiring either this or genetics), but the book used is just way to dense. The lectures are mind-numbing (thought not really the fault of the instructors, material is just way too detail oriented), full of rote-memorization of random enzyme names, factors, etc.",
    "Yes if you plan to be a bio major or do pre med",
    "MCDB 200 was a good course that delved very deeply into DNA and RNA systems. I wouldn't recommend this course to someone who just needs to fulfill a science credit. If you liked biology in high school and are willing to put in the work (because this course is a lot of work if you want to do well) then this course might be right for you. The grades were pretty well distributed over different assessments, and if you went to lecture and reviewed the lectures, readings, and papers then you should do fine in the course.",
    "I would say bio 200 is a great molecular biology class that goes very in depth into DNA and RNA. I would recommend it to another student interested in the subject.",
    "I would say just take cell bio",
    "MCDB 200 is an advanced introductory course to the biology major which focused on DNA and RNA. It has the potential to be a great class with the right teachers. THe course also included a guest lecture by Professor Ron Breaker, the discoverer of riboswitches, which was really excellent. He was a great lecturer and his material made easy to understand.",
    "A much better class than I thought it would be. The mix of professors was great (although Isaacs wasn't the most engaging professor) and the material was incredibly interesting. Very relevant for pre-meds and not too much of a time commitment.",
    "I took this course under the impression that I would only be taking 2 take home exams and a take home final and was distressed to see that the format was changed to match the Cell BIo format. Having a weekly quiz made me keep up with the material and made studying for the final a lot easier. Weekly quizzes made the course more work than expected and so more work that MCDB 120 (which I shopped til the first midterm and then dropped to take this class). I did TERRIBLE on the first half of the quizzes and they count for 35% of your grade so bc of that i hve NOOO idea what my grade is. The 2nd have of the course on RNA was much easier but the 1st on DNA was more interesting to me. I think that this might be a better option that MCDB 120 if you actually study for your quizzes (which I didnt learn to do til late) and the format will probably ease you into Cell Bio.",
    "I would recommend it for a student who needs a bio credit and is interested in nucleic acids. I definitely think the interest in this class was more interesting to methan cell bio was, but I haven't yet taken cell bio.",
    "This is a difficult course; it focuses on very small details in a very concentrated area of biology. If AP Biology was your only prior preparation for this course, you will probably have to put in a lot of extra time to understand the vocabulary and concepts in this course.",
    "Because the structure of MCDB 200 was completely overhauled, our particular class was understandably the guinea pig. In having the structure of weekly quizzes and discussion sections along with a midterm and final, the class could have gone either really well or really poorly, and that is exactly what happened. The section of the course taught by Professor Isaacs was probably one of the most stressful periods of the course. The material was not very well taught. The discussion papers were difficult to understand and frankly just too advanced for the level of this course (Professor Isaacs himself was not much help when it came to these papers). The quizzes required complete memorization of all the slides that were shown in class and seemed just too difficult. Professor Pyle's section was great though. The quizzes were not extremely easy but were generally fair. The discussion papers were manageable, and Professor Pyle was always very helpful, and genuinely excited about the information being taught, leading us to be just as excited. I would suggest that Professor Isaacs change his expectations on a course of this level. The new format of the course was not terrible but hopefully in the future, the expectations for us as students get restructured as well. If you are genuinely interested in the subject matter (DNA, RNA, a little bit of proteins), then I would say go ahead and take the class. If not, then another Biology class would probably be more helpful (this can only be counted as an elective) and less stressful (at least for the first part of the semester).",
    "Yes.",
    "It is what you would expect. Boring, informative, and about molecular biology. Farren was a nice guy but really couldn't lecture. Pyle was a great lecturer. My main regret from this class is that I didn't attend class as much as I should have.",
    "MCDB 200 is a good introductory course to the molecular processes of the cell, especially those concerning DNA and RNA. I would recommend this course to premedical students as a way to get a handle on DNA and RNA.",
    "I would only recommend it to someone who needed it for a certain requirement, this is not the kind of course you take \"just because\"",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course."
