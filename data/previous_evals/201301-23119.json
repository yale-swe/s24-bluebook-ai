    "Take it! This is a fun class that will change the way you think about anthropology, archaeology, and the relationships thereof. It is also fun class that is flexible and allows you to more or less direct your own study to focus on your own areas of interest, whether you entered the course with them or discovered them along the way. I took this class because of Anne Underhill, and so should you. When I walked into the classroom for the time, I was struck by the warmth with which she treated everyone and with the genuine interest with which she treated her subject. If you do not take the time to go to her office hours and get to know her a bit more, you will be missing out. Take it, whether you are an archaeology major or need a SO. It will work well for you either way."
