   "comments": [
    "This course tackles a broad and complicated subject with a pretty good success. Professor Summers is enthusiastic and insightful, and does his best to continue the conversation if a student presentation lulled. The professor has a diverse knowledge background, on both China and History of Science. He'd often interrupt class briefly to explain a basic scientific process -- i found this enriching and interesting. Each week we covered an interesting topic, but often times we wouldn't have enough to discuss to pack the entire time. This course could definitely be improved by incorporating a central text that might give a little more structure.",
    "The course material of the class spans everything from the ancient times to the Maoist era. Very informative and not too much work. Professor Summers is a great professor and knows a lot about Chinese science and science in general.",
    "Readings were interesting, and the final paper was actually really fun. I learned so much about the topic I chose to write about, and really got to utilize the analysis and presentation skills I worked on all semester.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students with a background in Asian history, and it is also helpful to have some knowledge of Chinese characters. I would say understanding more about Asia is necessary over knowledge of science."
