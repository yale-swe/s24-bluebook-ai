   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. The readings were very challenging but once I did start to understand the arguments within them I really enjoyed them and enjoyed the introduction to philosophy it provided.",
    "DS Philosophy (2nd semester) provides an excellent overview of the development of modern Western philosophical thought. Reading thinkers like Kant, Berkeley, Mill, Descartes, and Nietzsche will be challenging but rewarding. I would strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in philosophy or the history of ideas.",
    "DS Spring with Professor Saucedo is excellent. Raul is very personable and helpful (he often ate lunch with the class after section!) I thought he was very good at explaining the arguments as well.",
    "Survey philosophy course, I would absolutely recommend it and Professor Saucedo.",
    "A continuation of DS Philosophy, the second semester begins with Descartes and moves into the present day, continuing the survey. I personally enjoyed this second semester more, as the more modern philosophy is reflected in common modern assumptions about the world, more so than the ancient. From what I heard, all of the philosophy professors seem to be excellent, but I can say from my own experience that Professor Saucedo elucidated arguments very clearly, while allowing for much student dialogue. Any consideration about DS should be about the program as a whole, so when choosing whether or not to continue consider the workload collectively, and how thorough of a treatment you want as a whole. Taking the Spring Philosophy portion, though, it certainly felt worth it, with what seemed anin-depth treatment of the thinkers' ideas.",
    "Prof. Saucedo was excellent. He had good command of the material and explained it well. He spoke just the right amount, letting the students drive the discussion on more straightforward philosophers and taking more charge for the more abstruse philosophers. He took an interest in the students and was friendly within and outside the classroom. He devoted considerable time to the class and to the papers, organizing peer editing sessions as well as providing in-depth comments on the papers. I highly recommend both DS Philosophy and Prof. Saucedo.",
    "I truly enjoyed this course. It was very comprehensive. We covered the most famous philosophers after the ancients. I really learned a lot from this class as well as analyzed years of philosophical debate on various topics. The texts we read on morality really changed my perspective on life. I would definitely recommend others to take this course. It familiarizes you with the most influential Western philosophers.",
    "This class is a great way to get a sense of the scope of the questions that philosophy deals with. It is also a way of figuring out if philosophy is of interest to you in the first place. Even if you find that, having understood what the point is, you still don't find it interesting, I think the ideas are a very important part of the western culture and are especially important to learn in this overview form if you decide not to take further philosophy courses.",
    "Mind-blowing. Take this.",
    "If you liked first semester DS then i'd recommend continuing. The philosophy you read here is more contemporary and often much more confusing. If you thought Aristotle was dense, let me introduce you to Kant and Hegel. However, I found this semester to be very rewarding.",
    "take it- genuinely changes how you look at the world, and is a personal as well an an intellectual journey",
