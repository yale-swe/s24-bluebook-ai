   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about Realism in general, both visual arts and literary, and about the Russian origins and context of Realism in particular. There was a good balance between specific subject knowledge, including secondary historical readings and specific works of art and literature, and more abstract theoretical considerations.",
    "I mostly received HSAR 605 as a chance to rehearse content from my core competency as an art historian, with an eye towards the oral examinations in year three of study. Although many of the readings were familiar to me (and read in tandem with my TF assignment, this semester), I found myself gratified to be reading theoretical\/methodological texts that felt vital to the Slavists in the Room (e.g. from Jakobson, Ginzburg, Eikhenbaum, Paperno, Bakhtin, Morson, Lukacs, et al.)which just added to my neither-nor-ness (i.e. neither art historian nor Slavist, with partial competencies across both fields) as a scholar, an attribute about which I am (wait for it) ambivalent. The scholarship review presentation was very handy. I find myself now quoting on cue from Katia Dianinas book, as a result of putting together the 20 minute monologue on the text. While I was highly skeptical of the courses syllabus project (insofar as it was just more work, on top of assembling bibliography for a research paper), but it was ultimately a fun exercise (insofar as it was a chance to forge, or simulate my own syllabusgraphic design tasks where I am asked to produce an accurate mimesis of a document, in the style of another artist, always strike me as neat).",
    "I learned about the methodology of interdisciplinarity, about close reading and looking, and about critically evaluating patterns of historiography. I also learned about how to compare national schools of art and thought."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Brunson is a remarkable discussion leader, who does a beautiful job of shaping conversations without stifling or forcing them. Her incredible knowledge of the field and judicious selections of secondary readings gave us a solid ground for conversation, and she has a knack for asking just the right questions to prompt deep engagement with both texts and images.",
    "Its hard to pin down why having the Slavists in the room for this course was more successful in than previous courses (i.e. HSAR 671). Both this course and HSAR 671 balanced their syllabus pretty evenly between visual and literary texts, but I think the distribution of Slavists to art historians favored the former and that might have something to do with it. Several of the Slavists were trained as Slavistsas russophone language scholarsbut they expressed an active interest in working more with objects, and so possibly approached our work with paintings and photographs and prints more favorably. In any case, I enjoyed spending time with them and thinking in tandem with them. The main weakness of the course is breadth versus depth. I felt I read far more texts than we ever had a chance to consult in the few hours of the seminar, which is a common complaint among graduate students and shouldnt be assigned to this course as a specific shortcoming, even if it weighed on me.",
    "I enjoyed having a mixed class-- I think all students benefited from one another's expertise. And the reading was all engaging and valuable. However, there were times I felt that the reading load was a little bit too much, and meant that I had less time for paper research."

    "Absolutely I would recommend this coursenot only is Professor Brunson an incredible instructor, but this material is as in her wheelhouse as it gets. The primary texts and images we looked at are fairly specific to the Russian context, naturally, but they are very interesting in their own right, and especially with Professor Brunson's facility for guiding discussion to larger points, they are also likely to be relevant to most people interested in any visual or literary tradition, since many of the questions Realism raiseof subject, of narrative, of style, of politics and art, etc.are likely to apply even in very different contexts as well.",
    "Absolutely. I was particularly gratified to see a colleague working on 19th century European Avant-Gardes in the course, who was already something of a lit-crit theory wonk to begin with (meaning Im sure she appreciated Bakhtin, Lukacs, Eikhenbaum, et al.) and will now leave the course feeling that there are more than two centers of modernity in the 19th century world (e.g. France and Britain), prepared to teach Repin in any undergraduate survey she concocts a decade down the line. I think this course is crucial to grafting the Russian 19th century back into histories of Europe, and so will advocate for it and courses like it relentlessly, as part of my own intellectual biases.",
    "Yes-- a really eye-opening course taught by a wonderful and very dedicated professor. Material was challenging and engaging."
