   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of math in the class but there is a little bit of disconnect between the materials we learn in the textbook and what is covered in class. I wish the class built towards a final project so we had a progression of understanding.",
    "Strengths: webgl, project, material Weaknesses: taught at 9am (you may think I'm joking or being unreasonable, but I would have learned a lot more and been more engaged had this class been taught at a different time)",
    "I think the lectures are not very organized. I get lost very fast.",
    "It would be incredibly helpful to have a TA available, or even help hours like in other CS classes. Just finding where you needed to make changes in the given code for the homework took a while.",
    "The course was really disorganized and jumped right into the course material before teaching students the basics. Lectures were uninformative.",
    "Although lectures are interesting, they sometimes do not help you understand how to do the challenging homework assignments.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it is a good overview and touches broadly on many topics. It also felt easy to fall behind when assignments are about every two weeks, meaning that the assignments were often on topics we'd learned two or three lectures ago by the time most people got started. Maybe it would be easier if they were weekly but less questions. The workload is perhaps heavier than necessary.",
    "Homework is a strength. Lectures are a bit dry: not being at 9am would help tremendously",
    "Doesn't cover too much material and much of class is not too informative. Material was interesting.",
    "The material was very interesting, but I think there could have been a lot more student support in the class. The TA was absent for half the semester, but even after he returned, he was very unhelpful and always unprepared for office hours. It seemed that he never even looked at the problem sets before holding office hours, or even reviewed the concepts that the class was currently learning about. Furthermore, instead of acknowledging that he didn't know the answer to a question, he would lead you down to a wild goose chase of a completely incorrect answer.",
    "It was very interesting but there is way too much material covered in my opinion. It is a survey course, but I feel like the lack of depth made it a bit difficult, particularly if your background in calc and\/or cs isn't very deep. I think the PSETs should reflect the exams in both format and style or vice versa because this disconnect was fairly disorienting. I also believe the final project was a bit much at the end - either a second midterm or the project but not both - in my opinion."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend the class but know that it is math heavy and will not be easy, but cool in that unlike most CS courses you can see whats happening visually.",
    "If you are interested in the material you will enjoy the class. The psets are sometimes tedious but usually very reasonable in length. I definitely learned things.",
    "Take it if it's more organized. But it does teach you a lot of cool stuff. I enjoyed making a game for my final project.",
    "I was underwhelmed by this class. The Marschner and Shirley text is excellent, but Ganovelli et al sucks. The NVMC code is horribly written and contains many errors. I think the course would be a lot better if Professor Rushmeier scrapped the Ganovelli text. Although Professor Rushmeier is sweet, her lectures are slow and dull.",
    "Take this class! Yes the workload is by no means trivial, but it's really rewarding to be able to see the visual product of your code once you complete the problem sets. Holly Rushmeier is a wonderful professor and the grading is very fair--as long as you study for the exams and use your sheet of notes wisely for them, you should be completely prepared.",
    "This class was incredibly disorganized. Lectures were often disorganized and unhelpful, and the class starts by jumping right into the material rather than actually teaching the students the basics of the math and knowledge behind implementing computer graphics. You will really struggle in this course if you don't know linear algebra well. In addition, there were ~weekly psets, which you were completely on your own with, as it was difficult to get a clear answer from either the professor or the TF (who was completely useless; more on that later). When it came to exams, you were really on your own as there were things on the exams that just did not come up in lecture or in the books. It was really a guessing game on what would come up or what wouldn't, and it wasn't even a class where going to lectures would help as lectures would not have covered the questions that came up in the exams. However, the final project is great as you get to design a video game and that was really fun. Only take this course if you're REALLY interested and willing to invest a lot of time. If you want to take it for a CS elective or credit, find a group of people that you can study and exchange questions with as soon as you can. Also, the TF went missing for half the semester and didn't know the information or anything that we were learning when we came back. I'm also pretty sure that the code you wrote for homework also wasn't run, and was simply dependent on the summary files that you submitted.",
    "Take this course if you want to know how graphics works, and have a good primer for making video games.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in computer graphics or interested in taking a good computer science elective. The course has really good problem sets, although they are quite difficult. The material is really interesting, and it's really exciting to be able to problem cool images.",
    "Yes, especially if he\/she has a good enough coding background and an interest in special effects\/animation. It's a great overview and assignments are generally really fun.",
    "High workload, but it's a CS elective with good and fair assignments and midterms and interesting material. Lectures are dry: if this is at 9am you will not be motivated to go if you are normal. Being st 9am was single worst thing about the class",
    "Excellent course.",
    "Take if you have a good math background with geometry and some Lin alg. This can be a fun chill class.",
    "You don't have much of a choice if you want to learn graphics, but be prepared to find a good study group given that the level of student support for this class is very low.",
    "Lectures are dry, giving you little incentive to wake up to attend class at 9. Psets are challenging and fun, but often tedious and completely disconnected from lecture. Would not recommend this class to someone for whom it is not a requirement, even just as a CS elective.",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to take on a tougher elective. It gets hard to stay engaged with the course after awhile because it is just so much information and the topic list is exceedingly long."
