   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course!",
    "This class is exactly as the the oci describes it: an in-depth analysis of the history and structure of English Words. We learn about major history events that affected our vocabulary as well as general patterns of change that allow us to track pronunciation over time. Later in the semester we begin to study semantic change. The class is definitely recommended for anyone who may find these topics interesting.",
    "I took this as my humanities credit and I don't regret the decision at all. In fact, I think it was the best humanities I could have possibly taken. It was a fair amount of work and the problem sets were pretty long, but it was worth it because I really enjoyed the material. It's a subject that's actually applicable to the real world, which is why it's totally worth your time.",
    "Ling 108 isn't a lot of work (psets every week, not too much reading) but it can get tiring. Some of the psets feel like busy work even though you learn a bunch of interesting tidbits. And lecture is alternately really interesting (you learn cool facts the same way you do when doing the psets) and a little boring. Prof. Horn is really sweet, it just gets hard to follow the class when it feels like you're learning lots of little things that aren't quite tied together.",
    "Words with friends (aka Structure and History of English Words) is great. You learn a lot about words and can apply them in real life.",
    "SHEW is an absolutely AMAZING course, and I would highly reccomend it to a student of any background. It was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, with an outstanding professor. Professor Horn is both eloquent and hysterical, making class lively and interesting. He is also quite approachable outside of class, which was incredibly helpful. The class will change the way you look at the English language, as well as language in general. Even if you are not intersted in linguistics, this class is a must take (especially with Professor Horn). Grading is not bad at all, with 9 problem sets (that are time consuming, but not usually too difficult), one midterm (which is a bit difficult), a final project that is easy as long as you keep up with it throughout the semester, and a take home final (which takes a ton of time, but is open-note, and is distributed weeks before it is due). If you are at all interested in linguistics or etymology, TAKE THIS CLASS. That said, you should definitely shop it, because etymology is not for everyone, and the class will seem boring and repetitive if you do not connect with the topic.",
    "Conjecturing and confirming are the basis of this class.Conjecture about how a word came to mean what it means (by tracing its root in online dictionaries) and by learning about common processes of word formation (like mishearing, mental association, spelling changes, and folk etymologies). The confirming part is knowing how words have changed because of Grimm's Law and the Great English Vowel Shift.The material is interesting, but you must be VERY INTERESTED to take this class for a letter grade and put effort into the problem sets. I recommend putting as much information as you canin your pset answers and doing the readings, or at least the ones you find interesting. Above all, read the directions carefully - they are long but there is a lot of hints as well as extra requirements of what they expect in your answers.",
    "Great course if you think etymology is fun! Horn's sense of humor means you learn things that you can actually bring up interesting and funny things in conversation with friends. Grading is unnecessarily harsh on psets, though, but that may just be because of the TA (Alysia). The amount of work and time you need to spend towards the end of the semester does kind of build up though. Also, Humanities credit is big plus.",
    "I would recommend this course for any lovers of English, and the language. For those people who are not sure if they'll like it, I strongly suggest really paying attention during shopping period, because the work toward the end of the term becomes very heavy, and it is difficult to get through if one does not enjoy the subject matter.",
    "This is a good fifth class if you're looking to learn about something totally new. There are parts of it that are incredibly cool, and the workload is totally manageable. It's not an easy A though. The midterm was hard and the final projects take a while. Glad I took the course though because I learned so much!",
    "SHEW is a really great course if you're interested in linguistics, but was definitely pretty dry for the average student. The problem sets are not difficult, but were pretty tedious at times. I would definitely recommend the course if you have ever given any thought to how unique and amazing the English language is. I objectively learned a lot, but Professor Horn's incredible amount of preparation on his handouts and readings made a lot of the material from the lectures pretty redundant.",
    "Great class - learned a lot. Good for non-majors, but not for Credit\/Ds. Beware that between the psets, final project, and take-home final, there's a lot of production required!",
    "Great course, definitely recommend it if the material sounds interesting to you. Not for everybody though.",
    "As a humanities credit, it's not bad. Problem sets are straight forward but can get redundant.",
    "Makes you think about words differently and is interesting overall. I don't think I want to continue studying linguistics but this is a more practical course.",
    "A pretty fun and easy class if you're interested in the subject matter. Problem sets and readings aren't too time consuming, and the project's pretty enjoyable too.",
    "I would not recommend Ling 108 to a fellow student. This is certainly my least favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. The focus on the class is the \"structure and history of English words\" and although the material might be interesting the execution is poor. The seven psets are tedious, lengthy, and mainly consist of looking up words online. Their grading is frustratingly arbitrary. The NEWJ is long, over 15+ hours to complete, and the take home final is equally as long. The beginning of the class seemed interesting but got increasing worse as the semester continued. The professor is ok, but not engaging at all. In the end, I did gain an understanding of how words form and change and I learned how to read and write using the International Phonetic Alphabet. Therefore, I did come away with something but Ido not think it was worth it. The class consists of a lot of STEM majors who believe that this p-set class would be a great way to fulfill Hu requirement, but I regret my decision to take this class and I would have much preferred to spend my time in a Hu class that would have improved my writing instead.",
    "Great class! Very interesting if you like words, but lectures were occasionally hard to follow.",
    "The course was OK. It was nice not to have a lot of reading, but rather research-like problem sets (yet grading was very picky\/annoying). The take-home final was very time consuming, but I liked the structure of this course because you can work at your own pass - a nice change-up from timed tests in math and science classes. In general, a good fit for a science-major looking for a humanities credit, though I do not guarantee the best grade.",
    "Interesting class for non-majors to get a very thorough intro to linguistics. You'll certainly learn a lot! Lecture is fun with lots of cool examples of words, but probably not strictly necessary. The section is optional, but I would recommend going because it is actually quite helpful."
