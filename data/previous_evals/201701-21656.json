   "comments": [
    "It was interesting but there were too many blogs and response blogs, and discussion in class sometimes went a little too long on a single movie.",
    "This course is a great L5, it's hard to ask for more. The class was fun and engaging and I feel I improved and learned a lot. Because of the openness of the instructor, all comments toward improvement have already been addressed.",
    "There are very few weaknesses with the course. It is really enjoyable! I loved the films we watched for class and feel like I have more of a window into Israeli society through them. I love the format of the weekly blog posts and enjoyed writing my midterm and final papers. I just wish that we could take the quizzes in print. I have loved this course, learned so much, and would recommend it to anyone! Also, Shiri is just truly a fantastic teacher, who cares about her students and wants them to succeed.",
    "The course provides a great window into Israeli society through its film (movies are fun!). The films we watched were almost all entertaining and engaging, and they provided a nice platform from which to practice and improve my Hebrew. The amount of writing for the class could be decreased slightly. I was surprised by how much work and time it demanded, but I don't regret taking the course at all."

   "comments": [
    "If you are ready to work a lot, and want to watch some (mostly) sad Israeli movies, check it out. Shop it first and see what you think b\/c the experience depends a lot on the other students in the class.",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend the entire department. Hebrew is a wonderful language and they really do a great job with it.",
    "Absolutely! I would recommend it to anyone interested in Israel or film. I find myself recommending these films to my non-hebrew speaking friends all the time. When I watch movies now, I have started to apply the film analysis skills developed in this class. I also feel like my writing and speaking skills have really improved!"
