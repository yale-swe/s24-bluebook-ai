    "It's an ok class. Xilinx is frustrating, but this time you learn how to program instead of draw, so it's better. The concepts you learn are actually important and interesting, but the lab is so frustrating that you tend not to do much reading.",
    "There was really not a lot of material covered in this course. Almost everything we talked about had already been done in 201. At some point in the middle of the semester, a majority of the class decided that it was no longer worth showing up to lectures. Overall, I think this course was not a very good use of my time. Its only saving graces were that it was not very difficult, you got to build a few fun projects in lab, and Professor Culurciello was very nice.",
    "The class is extremely interesting and rewarding if you actually work on the labs and commit to a good final project. However, the logistics of the course have to be significantly improved. Lectures should be held in the lab, and there should either be more than one TA or a different TA. The tests and the problem sets are manageable.",
    "terrible course and terrible TA. don't take it if eugenio is teaching it and brian is TAing or if substantial changes are not made to curriculum. for those of you are unlucky enough to have it as a required class, grit your teeth and do your best to get through it.",
    "Very interesting and useful material such as MIPS and Verilog"
