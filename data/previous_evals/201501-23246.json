    "It's a bit harder than L2 but not too much.",
    "To summarize the course, I would say that it offers a very good variety of activities and methods through which to study Spanish, and it has a manageable workload. The fact that it meets every day, while initially daunting, actually helps a great deal with keeping continuity with the study of the language. I would recommend it to another student looking to develop their skills in an enjoyable but still challenging format."
