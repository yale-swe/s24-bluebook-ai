    "Ton of work and very difficult. Doable but requires an investment of 2-3 hours per day for that A.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a pretty heavy workload since it's every day and sometimes a pain since it's in the morning, but worth it. Being in class is fun when you're prepared and the instructors are understanding and organized enough so that you always know what to expect. There are lots of components, to the course - from every day dialogues to skits to kanji writing, and the variety keeps it interesting.",
    "A difficult but rewardin language learning experience. Expect at least 1.5 hours of homework per night",
    "A continuation of Japanese 110. At this point you will start to understand some of what is presented in Japanese media (anime, music etc.) and that will help to encourage learning. However, this class is still a ton of work to get through but is very rewarding the more you learn. I would recommend this class if you are serious about learning this language. The teachers are very helpful and supportive if you want to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only with extreme caution. You learn a lot, but it comes with an absurd amount of work. All of my other classes combined are like half as much work. A much greater workload does not do justice to how much work this course is. However, if you are serious about learning Japanese and know that you can handle the workload, then this course is fun and a great way to learn. P.S. Be careful that you don't need the credits if you are unsure about this course because if you don't take the second semester you wont get credits for the first and I know a few were forced to take the second semester even though they would have rather not.",
    "This course was brutal. The first semester was equally--if not more--brutal, but the fact that you're forced to stay in the class to get credit was like salt in the wound, as I would have cut my losses and quit after a semester if that had been an option. Because of that, the second semester of it was even more grueling, because I found myself resenting the class. If you have the time and energy for it, you will learn Japanese quickly, but the course is unforgiving if you can't find the energy\/time\/some combination of the two to do an hour of a half of homework every night of the week, attend mandatory outside-of-class-class, and memorize skits with grammar structures you haven't learned yet every day. I, personally, would not recommend the course unless you REALLY want to learn Japanese, and to compete with tons of people who already have a background in it as you do it."
