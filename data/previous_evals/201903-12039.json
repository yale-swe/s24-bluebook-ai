   "comments": [
    "The biggest weakness of this course was how disjointed it felt. Because the class is structured as a class that is presented by several different faculty, it felt like there was a large overall lack of continuity. Moreover, the course is titled Boot Camp Biology and was advertised as a way for students with interests in biology but backgrounds in other fields to learn basic biology information, but the course did not accomplish that in the slightest. It felt like the course was taught under the assumption that everyone in the course already had a strong foundation in basic biological concepts, despite the fact that almost everyone in the class openly declared otherwise. Most lectures were next-to-impossible to follow due to our overall lack of foundational knowledge, resulting in over half the class choosing to no longer attend lectures by the halfway mark of the semester. Of all the lectures, the most helpful and engaging was Tom Pollard's because of his ability to present basic biological concepts to non-biology students and due to his willingness to discuss foundational knowledge rather than advanced experimental techniques. If absolutely nothing else were to be changed about the course, I would at the very least recommend having Tom Pollard's lecture as the first lecture of the semester so that students at least have some background prior to the other lectures.",
    "I think there was a lot of scattered information in the course without too much buildup or motivation. I think it would have been better to focus on fewer topics and educate us on basic biological concepts and processes."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to the students that the course supposedly is meant to target (students of a physics\/engineering background with interests in biology) because it fails to accomplish the objective that it is thought to accomplish. However, for students interested in pursuing biophysics research that are already familiar with foundational biology knowledge, this is a course I would consider recommending. As a result, I believe this course should either be renamed or reworked in its entirety if the objective of the course is not to be changed."
