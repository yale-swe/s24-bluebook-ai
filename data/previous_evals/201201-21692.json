   "comments": [
    "Don't take this course unless you have taken a class with Zeidler and already decided you love him. Not everyone does. I do. This class was by far the most surreal part of my week - I'm not sure whether that should be an upper- or lower-case 's' but either way I think I liked it.",
    "Great class. Learned a ton about Picasso, cubism, early 20th century art, and how to look at art in general. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in close analysis of paintings. We spend a lot of time talking about individual works, within the greater framework of the artist's career. Professor Zeidler is brilliant, and you will learn a lot from him. The class assignments are short weekly readings, one 20-30 minute presentation, and a 12 page paper based on that presentation. The research paper is what you make of it; it was definitely a highlight of the class for me, and I got really involved in researching my topic.",
    "This is probably the best class I have ever taken, period. I've learned so much about Picasso and Cubism, and Zeidler is extremely knowledgeable on the subject (as well as many other areas of Art History). The readings can get a bit dense, but the reward is immense if you can plow through them. Really, the only heavy work came at the end with the presentation and paper (12 pages), so overall the workload was manageable. Absolutely take this course if you can get in.",
    "Cubism was an excellent class - I got not only a comprehensive understanding of the material covered, but a developed eye for art as well. The final presentation and paper were held to a high standard which was made me work harder and develop my ability to think and write about art.",
    "yes if you're interested in cubism. even though it's a seminar professor zeidler will give lectures during the whole class and there's only a very little bit of participation. there's basically no work- only reading a few articles and then a final presentation and paper for it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, as Professor Zeidler assembled an excellent syllabus that integrates the theory with the art and the secondary literature well. Moreover, he offers his unique insight, which sheds a lot of light on an otherwise somewhat inscrutable period. Still, he has an unorthodox way of leading seminars, so do not expect extensive discussion."
