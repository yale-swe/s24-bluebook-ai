   "comments": [
    "If anything, I've certainly built a greater appreciation for more music artists simply because I think that they did an excellent job recording music and mixing\/mastering. Unfortunately, however, I can no longer watch a lot of videos on youtube because the people who make them use awful techniques and I've become more sensitive to crappy audio.",
    "This class really allowed me to expand upon my musical ideas and thoughts, and express them in a new way - through computer music and programming. It was incredibly interesting, and I learned about the great diversity in musical expression, and how it has evolved with technology.",
    "General knowledge of sound, acoustics, and digital representation of sound Technical skills related to sound synthesis, digital signal processing, mixing, mastering, and music-related programming General facts and historical details about digital music",
    "I now feel comfortable using digital audio workstations to create and edit sounds\/music",
    "In this class I learned about sound recording techniques (microphone techniques, ideal studio to record sound etc.), digital audio workstations, acoustics and pseudoacoustics,",
    "How to make music digitally; the intersections of computers and music.",
    "I learned about all sorts of different aspects of computer music from the history of computer music to the technicalities in modern computer music. Learned about how filters work, how to create music in a Digital Audio Workstation, and learned about coding with programs like SuperCollider to create music.",
    "I learned about the physics of sound, the methods computers use to represent sound in digital signals, and some ways to manipulate digital sound in a digital audio workstation (Ardour) and a coding language (SuperCollider). Throughout the semester I gained a stronger understanding of how the technology involved in a creative process ends up influencing the final product.",
    "CPSC 035 was a good introduction to the world of creating music with a computer. We learned extensively how to use the DAW Ardour to create synths, mix beats, and make three compositions. We also touched on the programming language SuperCollider and the electronic prototyping platform Arduino, though the main focus was entirely on using a DAW. We talked extensively about acoustics, what sound and recording mean in the analog and digital worlds, e.g. how a microphone records sound waves, what sample rate and bit depth are. Overall, a great class for learning about music, less for learning about computer science."

   "comments": [
    "I felt as though I was a 3-year-old being thrown into the deep end of a pool whenever we started new topics. Having no background in music really made this class an interesting challenge. However, I",
    "This course is very engaging and interesting, and really motivates the students to explore and push the boundaries of music. It could be improved by having more machines or potentially switching the software, since it was glitchy and caused some technical issues. However, the course was great and the professor was amazing.",
    "The syllabus was very ambitious; the class could be improved by having less topics and more depth (perhaps splitting the class in two). The small class size was hugely helpful and engaging, and an interactive class would be much more difficult as size increased. The projects were interesting, but somewhat limited by time: perhaps a multi-stage process of adding to previous projects could help make the final project\/final outcomes more polished and layered.",
    "The course is very interesting, it just felt a little scattered. I came into it as a CS person who didn't know too much about music, and the course felt very geared towards music people who don't know too much about CS, which I wasn't expecting--would have been nice to have known that beforehand.",
    "Although it could be more structured, this class was extremely engaging and taught me valuable skills that my major will require in the future.",
    "Syllabus was a bit too broad, I think it would be better if it focused on fewer things but more in depth. The projects were generally fun, I would suggest more in depth projects maybe instead of the midterm.",
    "I liked alot about how much I learned from this course. I liked how it was a lot of breadth and covered a ton of things I had no idea about. It wasn't personally a weakness to me, but if a student wanted to focus specifically on something like SuperCollider and getting very in depth with one aspect of the course, it would be difficult because we move on from topics rapidly.",
    "I think the name of the course was a bit misleading, since our curriculum didn't specifically address the artistic\/musical elements of the projects we were assigned, but mostly focused on the technical and mechanical side of the projects. There was also a lot of material we discussed in the beginning which we never ended up further exploring later in the semester, but that probably just happened because the curriculum was difficult to organize, students had different levels of experience so we needed to spend extra time on certain topics, and because this was the first semester the course ever happened. Still, I very much enjoyed the projects we were assigned. They were great opportunities for us to apply the skills we learned in class with a great amount of freedom. I wish we could have had more smaller assignments, that would have specifically walked us through how to apply some of the DSP and coding concepts we discussed, since it was difficult to jump from a discussion (of filtering, routing, automation, Pband, Pseq, etc.) right to an open-ended project that required us to apply a number of different ideas at once. So maybe some smaller, more specific assignments (apply EQ to an assigned audio clip, translate a few measures of existing melody into SuperCollider) could have been helpful. In the end, I believe I learned a lot, but my classmates and I did not all learn in quite the same way because our assignments were mostly quite open-ended.",
    "In the beginning of the course, Scott planned to cover three subject areas: Ardour (DAW), SuperCollider (programming language), and Arduino (electronic prototyping platform); however, due to various circumstances we were only able to really get to know Ardour and spent just a few classes on the other two. I am very happy with the depth to which we were able to explore DAWs, but I would have preferred that we develop a moderate understanding of all three and get to know them more based on what we desire to learn."

   "comments": [
    "If you are already a musician, this class seems like a very interesting opportunity. If you have an interest in music and a background in computer science, then I would still recommend this class, because learning how computers make music was very interesting. If you have no background in music or coding, then you'll probably die. My coding experience is the only thing that saved me from drowning.",
    "I would highly recommend this to any student who wants to explore new styles of music, and channel their creative aspect by composing new pieces.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has nil or basic understanding of digital music production, and wants to get a more historical, technical and experimental knowledge on the process. The open-endedness of the projects is so helpful and allows students to explore skills, genres and areas of interest that suit them. It is not difficult even with minimal musical background, as long as you are willing to put in the studio time to work out the kinks of production and mixing.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to another student! Especially if you are interested in Computing and the Arts, this is a great way to see if you would like it or not.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend if you're at all interested in digital\/computer music.",
    "Would recommend this class to anyone interested in the various aspects of computer music. The professor also takes account student interests into how much time is devoted into each topic covered which is nice. Learned a ton of new things about various aspects of computer music; some of which I wasn't even aware about before taking the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in either music or computer technology, and especially one interested in both. They should prepared for critical thinking and discussions in many different areas, including acoustics, digital processing, and musical creativity.",
    "Definitely would recommend. Scott is approachable and knowledgeable about both music and computer science. The class is small and everyone is at about the same level of experience, and Scott's lectures are informative and useful. I would definitely encourage students to push for what they want to learn, as the class is very malleable based on students' specific interests."
