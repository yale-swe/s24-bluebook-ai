    "If you want to learn Hebrew, there is no better way. The workload is manageable, but you have to stay on top of your work. The course also helps you get involved in the Hebrew\/Israeli\/Jewish community at Yale, which I saw as a huge plus.",
    "Don't take this class unless you're willing to put in the time\/effort it takes to do well. On the other hand, the professor is fantastic, the lessons are as interesting as learning rudimentary grammar and vocab can be, and you walk out speaking comfortably.",
    "10\/10 would recommend Hebrew to a friend. One of the best decisions I made in coming to Yale!",
    "A hebrew course that helps students build off of their L1 skill."
