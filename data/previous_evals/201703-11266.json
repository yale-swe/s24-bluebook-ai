   "comments": [
    "Applied economics and deeper understanding of policy questions",
    "I acquired a basic understanding of general microeconomic principles and concepts and their bearing on policy issues. I acquired an intuitive grasp of economic reasoning and modelling.",
    "It helped me understand microeconomics from an applied perspective. It has helped me cultivate a lens, through which I am able to look at problems from the viewpoint of the technicalities of economics.",
    "This course gave me the chance to enhance and put into practice some rather rusty maths and calculus skills in an applied context. It also enabled me to gain insights into subject matter I had previously considered but through a new economics lens. Most importantly, I developed a base layer of knowledge of how markets work and how consumers and firms make decisions, in order to better understand and consume economics findings in my future career.",
    "I gained skills in economic thinking, in other words a combination of conceptual, visual and mathematical thinking. I also gained a better understanding of why economics is an attractive discipline many use to explain the world in a way that is portrayed as rationnal, utilitarian and scientific. I saw the draw of economics, which does say it explains the world, but to do so it has to be extremely reductionist, reducing people to rational beings driven by selfish interests (rather than altruism and love and hate). It helped further define my belief in government regulation and my interest in alternative economic systems that put human solidarity and compassion further up front.",
    "Learned how to better understand markets and their fluctuations due to taxes, subsidies, and the like. Relearned some calculus I can see being very helpful in the future. Given insights into the world of international policy and how global markets are impacted by decisions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Not enough supplementary material to reinforce what is taught in class.",
    "Topics could be ordered a bit more logically - utility should be presented before risk and uncertainty. Moreover, problem sets involving numerical examples could be assigned more regularly, and exam problems could better mirror problem set assignments. Overall, excellent presentation of material, good pace, and good breadth of coverage.",
    "I found the course to be super interesting, it made me think! I just feel that the last third of the course was a bit rushed up, so it would have been better if we could have devoted more time to it.",
    "Strengths: It was an applied course that used as many real world examples as possible; this made the course material much more engaging and useful for the students. Given the diversity in economics backgrounds of the students taking the course, I think it did a good job of creating a learning environment that was relevant for everyone. Weakness: There could have been more practice questions and answers given to students in order to facilitate self-improvement and learning.",
    "Strengths: it was taught in an engaging manner, the small class made it possible to teach in an interactive and intuitive manner. weaknesses: I thought the course itself lacked in mathematical applications of the concepts we were taught, which proved complicated for the first exam. Had the TA not been excellent and willing to give us a lot of mathematical examples I do not know how many in the class would have fared.",
    "Great there was a lot of practice but needed more feedback on the practice problems. Hard to get it right with the large amount of content when we don't know what we did wrong. Zach TF did an awesome job of trying to fill the gaps."
