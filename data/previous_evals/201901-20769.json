    "I really liked the class discussions about how to improve on existing research designs, what would you do differently, how to design research experiments and which questions to ask, etc. Good slides, engaging lectures. Also good overview of research methods at the beginning. We spent a lot of time on some topics such as networks which got a bit tedious; would be nice to spend more time on migration instead. Also, it would be nice to give us the details of the presentations and confirm that they're actually happening more than 3 days in advance (I know they were on the syllabus but there was no mention of them otherwise until 3 days before.) I don't think a final exam is the most effective way to organize a 2nd year class or synthesize the material. Why not have research proposals or some other sort of project instead? Finals seem very 1st-year. Also, it would be great to have more grades than just simply the final and the presentation, and to make the class separable so that you could take only the first semester without having to commit to the full year."
