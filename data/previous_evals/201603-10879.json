    "Improved french reading skills, widened knowledge of grammar",
    "Improved grammar quite a bit over the semester.",
    "I improved my grammar tremendously.",
    "I improved my writing and my speaking ability because of the small class size and because of our oral tests. This class got me to think more in French and form opinions while discussing the books we read.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about French language, literature, and culture. Grammar review, in-depth lessons on advanced grammar structures, engaging literature of several genres, and several videos to improve aural skills were all included. My French improved by leaps and bounds in all areas.",
    "During this class, I developed more advanced French grammar skills, speaking skills, and a greater understanding of French literature and culture.",
    "I took this class simply because I felt that I needed to refine my french grammar skills and certainly achieved that.",
    "Greater ability to analyze and write about French literature; improvements in grammar and speaking skills"

   "comments": [
    "It is a very small class with an excellent teacher who cares greatly for her students. We cover a good amount of material each class and have plenty of time to discuss our readings or ask grammar questions.",
    "It is a demanding, but manageable course in terms of workload. As for strengths, each class is enjoyable, the homework is fun a lot of the time, the professors are dedicated, the course is very well-planned so that the grammar you learn corresponds to the grammar you see in the readings, and there are no surprises on the tests. Also, Madame Skorupa gave back incredible feedback on our work and was almost always available for office hours. As for weaknesses, I cannot think of one. It's kind of annoying to memorize 20 vocab words for every test, but since you use them throughout the semester, it's not actually pointless. And there are only 3 tests + the final, so it isn't ridiculous.",
    "This was an absolutely wonderful class, particularly because of Madame Skorupa. Before signing up for her class this past semester, I read that she was the best French 150 teacher, but I realized during the class that she absolutely is, and also the best teacher I've had at Yale. It was an extremely enjoyable class that I looked forward to attending every day!",
    "The course covers really engaging texts and has a consistent workload throughout. The grammar is a good mix of review and new material, and grading is always thorough without being discouraging. The course could be improved, though, by having additional review exercises - I think additional worksheets for grammar would have been very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "This is the basic continuation of the language learning series at Yale, but the workload backs off a bit from L3\/4, since it's not everyday, and is less focused on grammar than on the readings and films, but that means that you have to work more on your own on the grammar, since it's still essential to learn for doing well in the course and the language but not much time is spent on it in class.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Yes, the workload isn't bad at all. But more importantly, Mme Skorupa is the best faculty member I've encountered at Yale. If you are thinking about taking one of here classes, DO IT.",
    "I would very much recommend this course. You have a good review of grammar while reading several books and other short stories. The books also allow you to expand your vocabulary a good deal. The class involves lots of writing assignments which are good practice at forming a thesis and making an argument in French. The small class size is also great as everyone gets to actively participate and ask questions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material was incredibly interesting, all of the confusing grammar lessons were very well taught, the professors really care, and in general, it's a great all-around course to improve anything you might want to improve with your French. The readings are very manageable and there are a lot of videos, which is good for listening and speaking. All in all, a fantastic course.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student, and get Madame Skorupa!!! She will make every class great with her warmth, kindness, humor, and intellect.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone that likes French - this was hands down my favorite class of the semester and improved my French much more than my best expectations. Madame Skorupa was also the most amazing professor ever, and made class really fun every time."
