   "comments": [
    "Yeah, I'd recommend it. Spanish is definitely useful, and if you want to learn something you can really utilize, this is perfect.",
    "Absolutely. Its a great wall to fulfill the language requirement, and having class everyday is very reminiscent of high school, which is nice when other classes meet once a week",
    "This is a fine and not too difficult class if you just need to get your requirement out of the way, and a decent, but not fantastic class if you want to learn Spanish for fun. They speed through material, and there is very little time for\/emphasis on speaking; so, while people's grammar skills were good, almost no one was comfortable speaking by the end of the semester (although they were more comfortable hearing and understanding Spanish). That said, they get you through an impressive amount of material in one semester, and the textbook and professors are fairly clear overall.",
    "A fast-paced introduction to Spanish. I would recommend it to others because it seems a lot less time-intensive than other introductory language courses at Yale, but seems to cover the same amount of material.",
    "Spanish 110 teaches you what 4 years of high school Spanish tried to teach you. (At least in my case). The class is demanding since you meet everyday and have to memorize many vocabulary words and grammatical rules. Diego was a great professor if you get to take his section. He was very personable and understanding and made class very interesting. If you are interested in learning Spanish and don't have much background in Spanish, then 110 will give you a strong foundation in Spanish."
