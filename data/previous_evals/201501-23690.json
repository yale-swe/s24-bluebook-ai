    "Take it- just make sure you pick the right client that fits with your interests.",
    "Begin delegating tasks in the group right away, but also work on some issues together as a group. Learning how to effectively share and generate ideas together are useful skills. Some parts of your final product should really represent a team effort.",
    "Definitely take it if you want some hands on experience with business! Make sure you pick the right project because that is your key focus for this course during the entire semester."
