    "you get what you put into it. excellent teacher, small class room setting, yeaeasy workload, i enjoyed it",
    "This class is not just about Icelandic sagas; it's more like an introduction to Icelandic culture. The sagas are very interesting, written in a fairly distinct and enjoyable style, but what inspired me most in this class was the materials that were presented along with the sagas. We had speakers from Scandinavian regions and even learned to write in runes. If you're looking for a class from which you could truly learn something new and valuable, this may be the class for you.",
    "Sagas of Icelanders is kind of silly, but often fun, sometimes interesting, and not at all stressful. It's great if you want a small seminar and a class with a very reasonable amount of enjoyable reading.",
    "I would recommend it since she is a fantastic teacher and because the readings are fairly easy but interesting so any long readings (not many) are easy to read since they are so intriguing.",
    "Out of the 8 classes I've taken at Yale, this one was BY FAR the most enjoyable and interesting. The readings were hilarious, and I looked forward to going to class every time. The instructor also has a great sense of humor.",
    "Definitely take it! The field trip to New York was fantastic.",
    "workload is mostly reading, Professor is wonderful, and if your class talks, it can be a great class, might be seens as easy course by others"
