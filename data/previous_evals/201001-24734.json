    "This is a great class. As an art history major who focuses mostly on European painting, it was nice to get out of my comfort zone and learn about the fascinating visual culture of Latin America. The workload wasn't too bad, but I did find that not knowing Spanish made the memorization aspect of this class a little difficult.",
    "HSAR 296 was a whirlwind dive into the art and culture of early Latin America. The artworks presented truly became portals into the mindsets, traditions, and daily lives of the indigenous peoples, the conquistadors, and the later mixed peoples inhabiting the region. Professor Mundy mastered all forms of teaching and communicating the information, from offering a daily handout listing important works to allow focus in your studying to giving each student a copy of her incredible comprehensive database on colonial Latin American culture. The papers were enjoyable adventures into the images and documents offered in the database and, considering the field, Professor Mundy always took to heart any idea into which a student put his\/her full work and faith.",
    "This a very interesting class and if you are interested in art and looking at new styles and ways of expressing ideas through art this is definitely a great course.",
    "I disliked this course. The material was a little interesting, but class was boring and repetitive. I didn't learn much at all.",
    "Colonial art of Spanish America from 1520-1800, more or less. I would recommend this course, or any ever offered by Mundy again, to any student, one interested in art history or not. Many students in the class were not prospective art history majors.",
    "The class went into the main themes that would allow an understanding of the culture in Colonial Spanish America, through its visual culture. I loved that were did not only focus on paintings or builgings, but in other elements that actually defined the way Colonial society would be organized politically, socially, economicaly, religiously, and also the daily life.",
    "Great class, very interesting and not too hard. Professor Mundy is great too!"
