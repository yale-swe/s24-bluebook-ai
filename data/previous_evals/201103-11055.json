    "It is a great course for people who already have some background in genocide. If you are not interested, do not take it because otherwise you will not want to go through the readings and you'll be bored.",
    "I would say this class is about the history of genocide and why genocide occurs. I would definitely recommend it. It is a great course for anyone interested in the history of human rights, imperialism, conflict, and many other topics.",
    "historical overview of genocide, progressively more focus on case studies as the semester progresses, theoretical component very limited. open intellectual environment. i'd encourage having a clear research topic at the outset to make the semester more focused.",
    "This course is ideal for students interested in the topic of genocide that would like to do their own research. At the same time, the course load is quite minimal since students aren't really challenged to complete the readings. Be prepared for a very open seminar discussion where everybody can really just say whatever they want."

   "comments": [
    "I am not writing a dissertation, but I am hoping to work in human rights research and advocacy one day, and I found this class helpful in broadening my understanding of genocide, why it happens, and how the world responds to it.",
    "The course deepened my breadth of knowledge in the history of genocides and other atrocities. However, the course could have taken a much more careful look why genocides happen in certain situations and not in others. That seems to be the key question."
