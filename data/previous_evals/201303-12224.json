   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone (including those in humanities disciplines) interested in theories of the body. While the ethnographies are perhaps less relevant to those not in the anthropological field, the theoretical texts (Agamben, Foucault, Bourdieu) are incredibly useful and relevant to those in cultural or literary studies.",
    "This course is about the body as an anthropological site of inquiry. It challenges students consider how bodies are implicated in larger questions regarding politics, culture, social relations, and philosophical debates. I would recommend this course highly to anyone interested in the history of medicine, to soon to be doctors, and to all anthropologists",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in theorizing the body, especially someone who had some experience in the social sciences or humanities. This course was theoretically rich and reading intensive."

   "comments": [
    "This course broadened my understanding of how bodies relate to institutions of power, how they interact within social and political contexts, and what is at stake when discussing pain, trauma, and political repression. The theories discussed in class are incredibly useful and relevant to my field of interest, and I appreciate being able to explore a variety of perspectives and theoretical frameworks through the reading. Professor Brotherton also structured our graduate sessions around our interests, which was an excellent way to further explore class themes while tailoring the readings to our individual fields of study.",
    "This course was extremely successful in introducing students to the overarching theoretical debates regarding the body as a subject of anthropological study. I found the following texts the most generative and effective:Bodies in Formation by Rachel PrenticeThe Body in Pain by Elaine ScarryCasualties of Care by Miriam Ticktin,\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Normal Body\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Lock&Nguyen\u00e2\u0080\u009cCultivating the Body: Anthro& Epistemologies of Bodily Practice and Knowledge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Margaret Lock\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumanitarianism as a Politics of Life\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Didier FassinLife and Words by Veena Das\u00e2\u0080\u009cIntroduction: Government and Humanity\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Llana Feldman& Miriam TicktinEmpire of Trauma \/ \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolitics of Proof\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Didier Fassin& Richard RechtmanI will defiantly be drawing from these texts to frame my long-term research project. I do wish that we were able to discuss the subject of masculinity as bit more. I thought that the text by Emily Wentzell did not open up enough space for a well-formed discussion regarding the body as an anthropological site of inquiry and masculinity.This course certainly deepened my knowledge of medical anthropology.My one criticism is that I don't like writing one page response papers ever week. For the type of reading we did, the one page responses seemed more like busy work than actual ways to productively engage with the texts. I find it more helpful to write longer responses every few weeks as opposed to short responses every week.",
    "When I signed up for the course, I was interested in deepening my knowledge of anthropological theories of the body and phenomenology. This course met my expectations and beyond."
