    "I apologize, truly, for the harsh grading. The professor is a committed teacher. the problem is, the course is really incorrectly labeled. it is not a finance course for environmental managers- it is a financial course. there is ZERO VALUE to taking this course if you are interested in specific environment-related applications. it is straight finance. why not just label it as a 'crash course' in finance? why have any mention of environmental managers. very misleading- very disappointing. for instance, as a policy advocate, or a land manager, there is nothing in this course for you.",
    "The class was great overal, but I would really prefer a full semester class, or maybe the class should betaught in the beginning of the semester. The end gets too crazy for me and most students. Adding an extra evening class is the last thing I have time for, but it's really my only choice.",
    "Covered a lot of material in a short period, but provided a good conceptual grounding in financial and accounting concepts.",
    "I was very excited to take this course. However, I was very disappointed by the end. Lectures were uninspired.I do greatly appreciate the instructor's effort to learn her student's names. I was impressed that she learned 50 names in 2 hours a week.",
    "I had no experience in finance before this class, and this course was a perfect introduction. Dr. Burkedid an excellent job of explaining concepts in a way that was accessible to people with my level of experience. She was also very friendly and responsive to student questions and comments.",
    "Excellent class. Great intro to Finance for Environmental Managers.",
    "Instructor is more than excellent! Professor Burke has the confidence and knowledge necessary to teach such a complex issue in such short period of time.",
    "The information available for this course is really helpful but the lectures are often difficult to sitthrough.",
    "this course is great if you want to have a broad knowledge of accounting and finance terms. It has an adequate pace and the material is very valuable to save for future references.",
    "3. The workload of this course was lighter than other courses, but that's what was expected since it'sa 1-credit course. The workload of a 1-credit course shouldn't be the same as for a 3-credit course.",
    "The course covers a lot of material, therefore the pace is very fast to fully analyze the different topics.",

    "Very practical",
    "The readings for each lecture are the best aspect of this course. So good in fact that the professor translates them to powerpoint slides and reads from the slides for 2 hours.You could do the reading and not need to go to lecture.",

I really liked the in-class exercises, because they gave us the chance to try the type of calculations we would need for the homework while Dr. Burke and Ran were there to answer questions. The homework was also extremely helpful. It was extensive enough to help us learn the concepts without piling on too much work at the end of the semester when everyone was already extremely busy.",

I expect more from a Yale professor.I think maybe the course is ambitious in how much material it presents in a 6-week period. Either lengthen the course or cut some material.",

I feel like I have some familiarity with some of the concepts, but definitely don't feel like I grasped everything (even at an introductory level).During the in-class exercises, it was often hard to get the professor's attention, as she and the TA were often talking to each other, and not very attuned to students trying to get their attention to ask questions.",
    "Instructor moved quickly, would sometimes state points from slide without explaining them",
    "Some content might need to be cut out or an additional class period might be needed. It was too much content for the time allotted.",
    "It should not be a 1 credit. 1 credits only work well when they are in the student normal field. For this course most people had to completely switch gears into a new way of thinking and then do the work. Its a valuable course it just cannot be done sufficiently with as little time as a 1 credit should take."
