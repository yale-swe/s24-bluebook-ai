   "comments": [
    "Perfect size class - both a lecture and a seminar. Love the guest lectures.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in policy work or conflict theory.",
    "You take a topic by topic analysis of countries after civil wars or wars against rebels or something like that. Topics include, peackeeping, peacebuilding, disarmament, transitional governments, power sharing regimes, truth and reconciliation commissions, post war justice, and elections.you end up hearing somethings a few times because of overlap but thats ok. The class is not rigorous and there is no accountability for any of the readings. The material is probably something you have never thought about though.",
    "I recommend it if interested in politics of the post-war countries such as Rwanda, Cambodia, East Timor, Sri Lanka, and etc...",
    "I would recommend the class if you are interested in post-conflict scenarios. Otherwise, it may be somewhat boring. If interested, this is a perfect class to analyze post-conflict politics and investigate about a certain post-conflict scenario, with a great professor.",
    "This is an interesting class with a very knowledgeable professor. The subject matter was very interesting, but I felt that the format of the writing assignments detracted a lot of attention from the main topic of the class. There are 3 papers about one assigned country, so basically it becomes a class about your country of responsibility without having any lectures on it. There is a midterm but no final, so after the midterm there is basically no reason to go to class or do the readings (which are very, very dry). While this class could be improved in a lot of ways, I still feel that I learned a lot. Take it if you're very interested in the subject and don't mind having to write 3 papers about a single conflict.",
    "Good class-overview of post-conflict nations.",
    "Easy class that gives an introduction to PCP. Not recommended for people interested in a challenging lecture and deeper understanding of PCP but good for people wanting to scratch the surface of PCP.",
    "Yes, it's a wonderful class. You learn a lot and the professor is always there if you want to have a more deeper analysis of a certain topic.",
    "Yes. For my intents and purposes, this class was excellent. It allowed me to examine bigger patterns of postconflict success and failure while also letting me examine the specifics of one country (I chose El Salvador).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interest in one or more of the following topics: conflict situations, political institutions, foreign intervention, development assistance or international law. You can gain a lot of general knowledge from this class and applying it to your country of responsibility will help you link it to an actual case study. It is not a highly demanding course, but will, of course, require effort to do well. Papers are not graded very easily and it is sometimes challenging to write about topics such as transitional justice and durable peace in such a short space. Be warned: the prompts are very, very open, intentionally so. Check your thesis with the TA of Prof before writing; you will thank yourself later.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it. The papers are interesting and it feels good to leave the class with extensive knowledge of a country",
    "A good class with interesting material. You definitely learn a lot about different aspects of post-conflict politics without having to do much work. Professor Simon is engaging and approachable, so you can really make the course what you want.",
    "Yes, take this class! Great readings. The pacing of the course is nice and the workload will not cripple you. After the midterm, you can focus on your two final papers.",
    "A very interesting course on civil war peace scenarios.I would recommend it if people is interested in a specific country's prospects for peace. Also for IR students that are interested in the interplay between international mechanisms for peace and domestic politics.",
    "Definitely take the course. The readings were fascinating and the professor is great!",
    "A class you should take if you really want to know whats going on in the world right now after serious conflicts"
