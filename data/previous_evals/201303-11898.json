    "This was a pretty fun and relaxed class. Professor Kenny is really nice and has a great sense of humor, and although the concepts we covered were sometimes mathematically a little tough, he's great at explaining things in a way that I basically always understood what was going on during lecture.Go Professor Kenny!",
    "If you're looking to just take one astro class, then this might not be the most exciting one to take (I'd recommend ASTR 343), since the material in 310 can get a bit dry, but Prof. Kenney is a good lecturer and a quirky, but very nice person, and he makes what could certainly be a somewhat boring topic into a fairly interesting course. Also the class has a very reasonable amount of work -- about 7 problem sets, one midterm, one final exam.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in the subject matter!",
    "In terms of the material covered, Astronomy 310 is a somewhat dry class, heavy on details and mathematical computation. Professor Kenney, with his enthusiasm, humor, and kindness, made this otherwise difficult class enjoyable. I took this course as a non-major (I'm not even a science major, and have taken almost no astronomy prerequisite prior to entering this one), and I have to admit that although I at times questioned my decision to stick to this course till the very end, I ended up getting quite a lot out of it. The intensive studying that I did for the final (which, fortunately, was not cumulative) was one of the most fulfilling academic experiences I've had at Yale. I took this course Credit\/D, but I'm sure anyone taking the course for a grade would gain a more nuanced understanding of the galaxy and the extragalactic realm. The one thing I'd recommend is to not be intimidated by the textbook (which, to me and even my astrophysicist friends, was loaded with jargon and not helpful) but to focus on taking good notes in lecture--Prof. Kenney did a great job explaining difficult concepts and bulletpointing the main ideas \/ equations one needs to know to do well on the midterm and the final. The problem sets could get onerous, but if you could find a group to discuss the pset problems, should not be a major issue.",
    "Since it's a requirement for the major, you'll end up taking this class anyway. Thankfully though, the professor is great about staying engaging even during less interesting sections. The p-sets in this class are based out of a textbook that will drive you up the wall, because the questions will be very vague, and Sparke and Gallagher are very, very rough about their approximations; so if you answer is within an order of magnitude of what they suggest you'll get, you're probably right. In the end though, you'll be thankful to have taken this class, because it really helps with understanding the concepts in higher level classes, and the professor is great about answering questions both in and out of class, and is willing to explain things further in depth if you're curious."
