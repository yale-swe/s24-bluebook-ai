   "comments": [
    "It's a really interesting topic to take english 114 in, so if you're in it for the writing credit and\/or to improve your writing, this class is a good way to spend your time doing that.",
    "Good Writing class, interesting readings",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. I would summarize this class as a manageable workload, an interesting subject matter with very dense readings, and very productive for improving one's academic, formal writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I would describe it as a writing class focused on crowds and group dynamics. We read a number of different essays from different time periods that focus on different aspects of crowd theory and group dynamics. We use these papers to learn about different structure and writing techniques that we then happy to our now writing, We also discuss the papers in class and get to here all the different perspectives of our classmates. Overall this was a really amazing class. It was interesting and helpful and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in crowd dynamics and writing improvement.",
    "Primer on the major philosophical discussions of crowds. Not the *most* engaging class, but you'll definitely take something out of it and your writing will improve.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student only if the student is interested in the topic (crowds).",
    "This class is great for any student interested in the social sciences. There is a lot of freedom in terms of the topics you want to write about, and the professor will help sharpen your ideas. I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student!",
    "English 114 19 was an awesome introduction into academic writing, and it especially helped me as a freshman who had not experienced college writing yet. The readings were interesting and kept my interest, and they were never too much. The topic as well - Crowds, Multitudes, and Mobs - is simply something that few people would study elsewhere, and its multi-disciplinary approach gave it many faces to analyze. I would certainly recommend this course, as it is perfect as an introductory college English, particularly with its small class size.",
    "I am definitely glad that I decided to take this course. I think that the skills I learned will help me throughout college and beyond. What I took away from this class is not so much an improvement in writing in terms of style, grammar, sentence structure, etc., but an improvement in structure, analysis, and how I should be thinking. To do well in this course, you have to expect to put in a lot of work and to meet high expectations, but it is worth it once you put in the effort. This class pushed my analytical skills and challenged me to think in a new way. Andrew was a fantastic professor, and he did great for his first time teaching this course. He teaches with a lot of energy, and tries to make the lectures relevant to us, which definitely helped. It's clear that he spent time planning out classes and evaluating our progress. The classes were very discussion-based, which was great, but also felt a bit repetitive from lecture to lecture. Andrew was great about office hours, which massively improved my writing skills. It is clear that Andrew means well, really wants to help, and cares about how to tailor what you learn towards your potential major. The only issue is that I sometimes felt that what I learned in office hours outweighed what I learned in class. Tip: PREVIEW the articles you'll be reading when choosing courses. I did not find some articles interesting and should have done this in the beginning.",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend this course to another student. The professor requires his student to write in a style similar to an academic journal, with paragraphs that are 1 to 1.5 pages long. Any students who are unwilling to completely dedicate themselves to this course and to adopt an entirely new style of writing that should not take this course. The professor has expectations and any type of writing that does not reflect his expectations will not get good grades in his class."
