    "Yes, I would recommend the course! I learned a lot from my fellow classmates, and I think this course usually draws a self-selecting crowd that will be discussion great. Professor Silbermann is very helpful and sweet, and the final assignment and interview project was actually a lot of fun. Great readings too!",
    "Women in U.S. Politics was a great course! The first half of the course is focused on the definition on gender and is more WGSS theory and then the second half of the course incorporates the politics. The reading load was very manageable especially compared to other Yale classes. The class discussions were always interesting and engaging, but that may have been due to the other students in the class. The assignments were creative, which is a nice change from the normal political science essays. We had the opportunity to interview a person on the New Haven Board of Alders and then presented our findings from the interview to the class. Professor Silbermann is kind and supportive and wants all of her students to do well. I'd definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes! If you are interested it was a great way to learn about obstacles women face in politics",
    "I loved this class, and looked forward to it each week. The reading was interesting and enriching. Professor Silbermann was great. She's super approachable and made the classroom an incredible environment. She also designed a great syllabus. Each week built on the previous weeks, and every reading seemed worthwhile.",
    "This class focuses on feminist theory and its relation to and manifestation in different facets of politics. It was pretty heavy on theory in the beginning, but if you're interested in that, it's a pretty good class. Very manageable workload.",
    "Yes! So important!! An excellent intro to feminist theory!",
    "This course is a balanced dive into women as identity and political actors. I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in discussing identity, gender, and political representation\/leadership. It is not a very difficult or work-intensive course, but it is fun discussion. It doesn't have too much structure though, so this course is not for a student who wants a really theoretical and structured class.",
    "A great tour of all of the issues related to women in us politics, from looking at feminism and intersectionality, to looking at women as candidates, officeholders, and political participants. It's also a great way to get to know other students who have been involved with women in politics. One of my favorite classes at Yale. Take it!",
    "Definitely recommend!"
