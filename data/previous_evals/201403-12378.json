   "comments": [
    "This is a good class for learning a lot of cool physics. It is work-intensive but not more so than other classes in the major.",
    "Hardest class in the major... but you learn SO much. Really increased my appreciation for physics.",
    "A great class in that you learn a TON of material at a strong level. A hard class in that a lot of work is required to do well and truly understand the material. Weekly problem sets are challenging but really help you learn the material well. Lectures are fine and the book is pretty meh. If you're ready to learn and work for it, take the class.",
    "A class that I would take with caution. Dont loud up on hard credits the semester you decide to take it because 15 hours a week is a very serious possibility, especially with the last problem set (which was due during reading period). This class is probably the hardest one youll take at Yale because of the excessive time commitment required. Good luck having a serious life outside of it. I have no idea what it would be like if Professor Stone didnt teach it, but it almost certainly couldnt be harder. Read the Ode to Physics 420 review from Fall 2012 for a more detailed idea of what youre up against. I didnt like the class, but I will say that I learned a lot, and its definitely an excellent course to prepare you for grad school. Really, my advice would be not to take the class unless youre interested in grad school because otherwise its probably a waste of your time. Oh, and I would not recommend taking this class at the same time as PHYS 441 because both courses will be pretty work-intensive. Its possible, but its very, very tough on your schedule.",
    "Stat Mech is a great class. Often challenging and time consuming, you'll learn an enormous amount of material in this course which you'll ultimately find very rewarding. It has definitely been one of my favorite physics classes at Yale so far. The textbook isn't great, but prof Stone always did a good job of explaining ideas and derivations when the book was unclear. Stone is generally a really great guy and brings a lot to the class. Problem sets were often challenging, but not impossible. I felt like I was actually learning something by doing the problems, as opposed to just working out a bunch of meaningless algebra. Finishing each assignment was oddly satisfying and it made me actually want to spend the time necessary to do the problems carefully. Overall, a very good class that any physics major should take",
    "As Alex said: \"This class is excellent preparation for graduate school.\" And another quote from professor Stone after the second midterm: \"I don't want to reduce my intimidation quotient\" and \"Exams are a learning experience.\" That should give you an idea of courses' philosophy. It takes guts and ambition to take this class. The material is extremely valuable and very well taught. But it can also be overwhelming at times. This should be your hardest course at Yale, but it's also likely to be the class that teaches you the most.",
    "It is hard to describe this class through a course evaluation. I would recommend talking to the older physics majors and asking them about it. It is an experience. I'll try to say something though. This class is very hard. The problem sets consistently take >10 hr, and the tests generally have low averages. Taking this class and, say, CPSC 323 at the same time is a very bad idea. You will spend a lot of time on this class right up through reading week and the end of the semester. (the first couple problem sets take ~1\/2 hour or so though - don't think that will continue). That being said, your brain will transform during this class. After doing so much physics, you can't help but think about the world in a different way after. I did things in this class with differential equations that I didn't think were even allowed by the rules of math (to be clear, they were). Prof. Stone can seem sort of intimidating at the very start just because he is chair of Applied Physics, director of Yale's Division of Physical Sciences, etc. But he is very approachable and I would highly suggest getting to know him. He made a clear effort to know the name of everyone in our class and get to know us on a personal level, which was nice.",
    "As an intensive physics major, it's about when you'll take this course rather than if, and that's a pretty legitimate question. My experience was that about half of the majors in my class took it as juniors and half took it as seniors. Taking it junior year gets one of the hardest courses out of the way (and it is hard) and gives you a wide open senior year. Also, having done stat mech before the advanced lab would have been really useful. I took it my senior fall, and got the benefit of having it be my only physics course for the term. My friends who doubled up on Stat mech and quantum II were pretty overwhelmed, as the problem sets for both get pretty lengthy towards the end. Working in groups, it was typically two or three nights worth of work plus the problem session (Alex Cerjan is the best TA in the department, if he's still around) for each set. The exams are characteristically tough. Be prepared for no open book! Finally, I really liked Dr. Stone. He's not what you'd call a high energy professor, but he is easy to follow and keeps class interesting, especially with his well researched stories about what a boss Einstein was. He knows all of his students and wants each of them to learn the material. I think I learned a lot in this class, compared to other physics classes.",
    "PHYS 420 will gives a basic introduction to Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics. The course seems to have improved substantially based on reviews from previous years, and Professor Stone is highly attentive to student feedback. It takes concentration to make sure you learn everything in the course correctly, but there is lots of support available and Professor Stone designs all of the problem sets and exams to be as intuitive as possible.",
    "This is a pretty solid class. The material is interesting and refreshingly different from other physics classes I've taken, and I feel like I've had my eyes opened to a whole new field of physics. The lucidity of Professor Stone's lectures is about average, but he brings alot of really fascinating historical context to the table that I found really appealing. He's an interesting man, and I recommend getting to know him. Workload was fairly heavy, expect to spend 10-15 a week on psets. The review sessions with your wonderful TF (hopefully Alex) are indispensable, and will save you tons of headache\/heartache. Complaints about a glut of material in the last 2 weeks remain valid, but Professor Stone is trying to fix this. I understand that it was better for us than the last class, and will hopefully continue to improve. Now if they can move it from that dreaded Wed-Fri 9:00am slot we'd REALLY be talking...",
    "The homework assignments are tough, but not significantly more work than those in other main-sequence physics classes. The two midterms and the final were also pretty standard fare...it was a challenge to finish them in the allotted time, but there was a good mix of easy\/medium\/difficult parts to the problems and they were a good test of the material we covered. There was too much material pushed into the last couple weeks, which would be my main complaint; be prepared for that to happen again.",
    "If you're reading this, you probably have to take it anyways. So just put your head down and muscle through. It's not that bad. I swear. Yeah, it'll be a lot of work, but it's nothing you can't handle. And the material is interesting to boot!",
    "This class is the hardest class in the physics major by far. This class alone was more work than 440 and 430 combined, and the material is both difficult conceptually and often tedious mathematically. Get ready for a ride. Luckily, Professor Stone is a very good lecturer, and really cares about his students, although he is not stingy about assigning long difficult problem sets, especially at work heavy times in the semester. He will likely assign a problem set due reading week, so be prepared and plan ahead. Problem sets are generally 10-20 hour ordeals, some slightly more, maybe a few at the beginning that are shorter."
