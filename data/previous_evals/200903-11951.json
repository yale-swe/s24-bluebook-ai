    "A 10\/10 course. The subject this year was Hindi poetry - an extremely fascinating and colorful subject. Students were part of the material-selection process (a first for me at Yale) and this really sparked a strong interest in class-discussions. While this was a formal overview of the world of Hindi poetry, the material prompted certain questions that applied to poetry as a form of expression - a theme that transcends language. So in a great way, this course was intensely specific but also surprisingly broad.",
    "Take it if you want to gain a slightly nuanced understanding of a particular topic in Hindi.",
    "Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes"
