    "We read the major philosophical works from Descartes to Parfit. We write three papers and have 2 discussion sections a week. I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you are serious about engaging with ideas.",
    "Take the class! If you truly engage with the material, the readings and lecutures are mind-bending and will change your world view! However, DO NOT take this section. Professor Goldman is nice, but his section is an unstructured, rambling mess that doesn't even take you through the actual steps of the argument clearly. I never felt that I came out of the section with a better grasp on the material. Furthermore, there were some philosophers that Professor Goldman proclaimed as \"crazy\" or \"impossible to understand\" multiple times, which was really discouraging. I also really enjoyed more than one of the philosophers that he labelled as \"crazy,\" so I appreciated the labelling even less. He's self-deprecating at times, saying \"I don't understand this any better than you guys\" or \"I'm not sure about this reconstruction of the argument\" etc. It was endearing the first few times, then it just got incredibly annoying. I felt almost like I couldn't trust his judgment, which I surmise he did on purpose to prompt further philosophical enquiry on my part. It just sparked annoyance on my part instead. I wish he would have given us different interpretation options if he wasn't sure, instead of just putting one up and saying \"I'm not sure.\" I'm all for philosophical inquiry, but these works are so dense and confusing and we go through them so fast that sometimes we just need some structure or reconstruction to work with. Beyond all of this, sometimes it really seems like he doesn't know the material. During my Kant paper meeting with him, not only was he just plain unhelpful, he misled me on an important point of Kant's argument. I wrote my paper on the basis of the misinformation and only realized the mistake when I talked with another philosophy professor who specializes in Kant. All of this made me hate philosophy at times, even though I actually enjoy the subject. Bottom line: Professor Goldman is nice and makes you feel like you are capable of doing philosophy BUT you will end up with muddled, unstructured sections.",
    "Kant's difficult, Hegel's impossible, more and more and more papers, but you will survive and you will emerge with a far greater appreciation for ethics in particular and be rather flummoxed by metaphysics in general. If you're thinking philosophy, try DS philosophy first.",
    "If you are in DS, you know the drill. If you thought Aristotle was confusing, wait for Kant and Hegel. Workload is about the same, which means less reading than the other 2 DS classes, but a lot more dense and more difficult to understand most of the time. Professor Goldman is knowledgeable. It's a good idea to see him before the paper because he really helps clarify your ideas.",
    "Professor Goldman is terribly earnest and wants very much for the class to engage with the philosophical ideas in a more combative\/interesting way. Intent-wise, this was a fine idea, but there were times when we might have been better served by a little more time spent on just pure explanation. Some of the ideas in second semester DS Philosophy, after all, are rather famously thorny. He gave fabulously detailed and helpful comments on the papers though, and he also gave helpful answers to pre-paper questions.",
    "This course went through a lot of the most important philosophers, and is overall a lot more mindblowing and interesting than the last semester. David Goldman is an alright professor, he is very approachable. However, in terms of contents of the course he did not do a good job of explaining the important arguments. Actually, for most of the philosophers he did not go through anything other than what was said in lecture. He collects two questions a week from us, and sometimes goes through them in class. That is a good indication of how unstructured and unhelpful section is, when he bases it off student questions from first readings. There is absolutely no concrete plan for class and I definitely did not learn even close to what I should have learned from these philosophers. Goldman is pretty fair about papers, but verges on the hard side because he doesn't really teach and expects a lot more from us. He is very strict on the word limit (we can only go 3 words over the minimum limit), and when an essay is supposed to be 1800-2000 words, he does not want you to go a bit more than 1800. Sometimes I wonder if he could put more effort, 1) in actually teaching a structured and helpful class, 2) in taking the time to read our essays and not mind if we have to go over to argue a complicated idea, 3) in not being so lazy about some philosophers (he skipped entire sections of some philosophers and didn't hold any makeup classes when we missed school, just got more and more behind, he also did not host a review session when we were already confused as to what we had to study because of the unstructured nature of the classes).",
    "The second semester of Directed Studies: Philosophy is different from the first in that the ideas and texts dealt with become much more complex and diverse. Because of this new complexity, one of the drawbacks of the course is that it is more difficult to keep track of the main themes throughout the semester. Many of the texts earlier in the semester deal with sense perception; a considerable amount of time and energy in the middle of the semester is dedicated to Kant (whose prose is atrocious); and the final weeks of the semester move somewhat to ideas about the identity of the individual and his role in society and relationships with others. To be perfectly honest, I would not recommend this course to other students; the ideas it deals with are simply too complex and abstract to seem relevant to students' lives and studies. That said, I realize that this course is part of the required syllabus for the second semester of Directed Studies: do NOT let my bad review of this course stop you from participating in the second semester of DS!!! During this semester, Literature and H&P get increasingly interesting as the texts become more modern; the fact that the other two DS classes this semester are so cool definitely make it worthwhile to trudge through this class. And, who knows? If you are a philosophy person, you might like this class more than I did, anyway..."
