   "comments": [
    "The course is pretty broad--\"Style, Purpose, and Pursuasion\" covers just about everything. The assigned readings are similarly dispersed, though they focus on Bromwich's interests of course: Romantic poets, Emerson and Thoreau, with a sprinkling of Shakespeare, Woolf, Orwell, and more. I can't say that I came away from the course with any particular concrete skill or knowledge, but I'm sure it improved my abilities in literary analysis. More important, Bromwich is just a pleasure to listen to and learn from. He is Exhibit 1 for why the humanities are so valuable; they allow us to see ourselves and our world in a new light. His lectures were pithy and captivating. The course is structured such that you don't need to devote yourself to the readings that you don't find engaging, which is really liberating: I enjoyed being able to spend my time reading and writing about the readings each week that spoke to me most strongly, rather than having to struggle to extract meaning from works that didn't. Bromwich is such a treasure that it's definitely worthwhile at least to show up to the first lecture and see if you enjoy listening to and learning from him; if so, take the course.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in learning from an incredible professor and being inspired by some awesome writers. Still, some lectures are a bit \"inside baseball\" when it comes to the philosophers.",
    "This is an excellent senior year class. A large number of short- or medium-length essays, poems, etc.nearly all of which you haven't read and nearly all of which are excellent. A survey of sorts. You'll read something in this class that'll deeply affect your thinking about something important. This year we wrote a 1-2 pages response every week and a 7-8 page term papera very doable amount of writing and a welcome change from the schedule of most English courses.",
    "Very much so - great class - really enjoyed the breadth of material.",
    "Bromwich is super smart, but make sure you agree with his teaching style, because his voice can def put you to sleep if you don't! Two reading response journals and a final paper make this class not a lot of work, but super hard to tell how you're doing in it...",
    "Style, Purpose, and Persuasion looks at essays, poems, and short stories that you might not have come across in your English career so far. The emphasis is not so much on writing persuasively, as it is understanding the techniques that various authors have used to influence their audiences. Bromwich is a great lecturer (if a bit dry at times), and the workload is reasonable (1 reading response a week, 100+ pages to read a week, and one final paper).",
    "Great class with interesting eclectic reading list.",
    "You could describe this class as a course about rhetoric\/persuasive writing, but it is more importantly a class about works that mean something to Professor Bromwich, works he hopes others will benefit from having encountered. The reading list is capacious. You will read the best of texts that have been written with an effort to convince someone else of something. When you think about it, that really includes all writing, which may be one implicit idea of the class. Take it for Bromwich, for his profound wisdom, learning, and humor.",
    "A really good class! Unlike any English class I've taken before, and a really great selection of readings. Gave me a lot to think about.",
    "This is a fantastic class unlike any other English class you will take at Yale. If you want to read texts you may not have any other opportunity to read and to discus them in ways you didn't expect then this is the class for you! The discussion is not as focused on the technicalities of the writing as some English classes can be, but much more focused on the overarching ideas of the texts and their structure. I would love more classes like this at Yale!",
    "An interesting course. I was definitely glad I took it, but I'm not sure exactly what I learned, or what it was about. Fantastic readings, organized thematically by weekdescription with intent, epigram and aphorism, incitement, etc.and Bromwich's lectures were thoughtful, insightful, and a good 50 minutes of brilliance. Section with Bromwich was intense... and also usually ran like an hour over.",
    "This course relates a variety of great English texts in a coherent and cohesive way that allows for a deeper appreciation of the English language as well as for those who use it with the greatest effectiveness. At times, it even seemed like a philosophy course, as we tackled the nature of belief to then examine it in the writing of others. I highly recommend this, as it was an influential course that I took great pleasure in reading and writing for.",
    "As a non-English major, I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Bromwich is brilliant, and the poems and essays you will read are very engaging. If you have not taken English courses before, it may be a good Cr\/D.",
    "Amazing class -- thought provoking, inspiring and insightful. prof Bromwich was really interesting to learn from and to hear his thoughts on the materia, which was a really stimulating selection.",
    "I recommend taking this class if you are interested in the intersection of literature and rhetoric, or at looking specifically at the way persuasion functions in literature. I think many students took this course thinking it was a class on political rhetoric and were disappointed with what they found. The class is very much an English course and follows the structure of English discussion and assignments, though many of the texts may be political. I would especially recommend taking the course if you appreciate interdisciplinary study in the humanities and making connections between disparate fields. The readings in this course are diverse and one of the most interesting ways of going about the course is to try to focus on what unites the readings from each week."
