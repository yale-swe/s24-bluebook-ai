    "Definitely. Really interesting class with a fantastic reading list and a great professor. Hagglund's teaching style is casual and easy going, and his comments are incredibly thought provoking. Also, aside from reading about a book a week, the class is not much work.",
    "I would certainly recommend it because Hagglund is brilliant and the reading list is fabulous.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes of the semester. The syllabus\/reading list is amazing and the topic of time extremely fascinating. Hagglund's lectures are really interesting and I never got bored listening to them, you discover really cool insights and ideas about life and time and humanity and everything! I would most definitely recommend.",
    "If you like the reading list, you're going to like the professor and the class.",
    "The class is a fascinating blend of philosophy, literary theory, and pure aesthetic appreciation. While the focus is on the modern novels of Proust, Woolf, and Nabokov, the course begins with St. Augustine's ruminations on the nature of time and is interspersed with the non-novelistic works of T.S. Eliot, Freud, Peter Brooks, and Samuel Beckett, giving the themes texture and a place in a larger literary history. The main problem addressed is the conundrum of time and place: while the issue of what exactly time and space are has plagued every writer, Hagglund shows how modern novelists changed the way they wrote to reflect it - from Proust's memoire involuntaire to Woolf's free and indirect discourse to Nabokov's inclusion of the fact that narration its takes time, each author radically changed their prose style to reflect their temporal philosophy. Ultimately, the course centered around a series of paradoxes.I would definitely recommend this course - Hagglund's ideas are fascinating and the books you will read are some of the greatest books in all of literature.",
    "TAKE IT!"
