    "The strength of the course lay, I think, in the way it was designed. Making each participant an 'expert' of a discussion session on text(s) that they themselves chose is a good idea. I would have liked, however, if our access to primary texts were less mediated, since in some cases we only discussed certain key texts of German romanticism through the lens of their 20th century reception in Germany. I believe that the Romantics and the contemporaries in dialogue with the Romantics were better trained as theoreticians and philosophers than people studying the Romantics in the 20th century, and their brilliance was somehow made dim through the mediation. There should have been, I think, sessions where we read and discussed texts of the Romantics, without recourse to the at times mistaken and many times befuddled interpretations and appropriations in the 20th century. This would have forced us to look at texts of the Romantics that have been, perhaps unfairly, less influential in their reception history, but which, perhaps, might have had more clear things to say about the nature of art and the world.",
