    "I would recommend the class to a student who has a great interest in economics. The class studied heavy economic concepts and works that would have not been fun for someone who is not serious about economics.",
    "Yes, because it provides a strong basis for writing at Yale.",
    "Very importabt tool for improving academic writing skills.",
    "Definitely! The content is fascinating and I struggle to see where else a freshman could possibly find it except for hard-to-get-in-to upper-level seminars.",
    "ENGL 114 16 is a seminar focused on presenting different views of capitalism while simultaneously promoting strong writing skills. I would recommend it as is has vastly improved my writing abilities and expanded my knowledge of capitalism."
