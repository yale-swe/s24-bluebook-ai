   "comments": [
    "This course was the most useful methods course that I have taken at Yale. I have a much more in-depth understanding of experimental methods after taking this course, and I feel confident in my ability to apply the research skills that I learned in this course in my own research.",
    "I developed knowledge about experimental methods and the statistical foundations of its applications in political science.",
    "Basically the essentials about designing and running randomized field experiments.",
    "This seminar introduces graduates to basic concepts in experimental design (such as random assignment, clustering, blocking, difference-in-means estimators), complications in field experiments (non-compliance, spillovers and attrition), and major themes in design-based inference (use of covariates to gain precision, when and how to block, \"implicit mediation\" analysis). Not only is it substantively rich, the course hones coding and data manipulation skills. The instructor (Professor Coppock) encourages students to improve their coding skills (work on dplyr) and maintain tidy datasets. Finally, I learnt a lot through practical tasks in this class - replicating an experiment, performing one on non-living subjects and through homework assignments.",
    "I can now design and (theoretically) implement randomized field experiments in Political Science.",
    "Developed a deeper knowledge of the core issues associated with experimental design and got exposure to a wider set of issues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really think that you guys should consider distributing answer keys to the problem sets. The current grading system takes a really long time, and having an answer key would help me more quickly determine what concepts I do and do not understand.",
    "I can't think of much to improve. It was very well-executed, the material was clear, instructor knew exactly how to explain and teach the material, and the content was interesting and practical.",
    "Might be nice to have a sort of \"lecture notes\" to refer back to since there is a ton of material to cover. The strength of the course is that the textbook and class time were both used very effectively.",
    "This is an outstanding course, easily the best methods course I have taken. Any comparativist (political scientist) who intends to apply for and use grants for survey or field experiments should sit this class. It is exceedingly well taught, it is rigorous but covers the most fundamental issues in experimental research.",
    "Strength: So much content. Gives you comprehensive training in experimental design. Weakness: So much content. It felt like it was moving too quickly at many points in time, and things couldn't be reckoned with fully.",
    "Lots of deep knowledge out of this course. We received appropriate and realistic warning about the workload. As you make this course your own, I recommend leaning less on the book and developing your own presentation of things that Gerber and Green present imperfectly. (Not a knock on them, first textbook on this subject was never going to be perfect.)"

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend taking this course if you are a student in the Political Science PhD sequence.",
    "Yes. Especially to anyone who wants to use or critique experimental methods in the social sciences.",
    "Lots of work but very worth it if you are interested in doing field experiments as a part of your research.",
    "Absolutely. It is a lot of work but Professor Coppock is understanding of graduate school pressure. The work is front-loaded but it is do-able, engaging and very rewarding.",
    "yes, one of the best classes I've taken",
    "You must take this course if you want to do experiments."
