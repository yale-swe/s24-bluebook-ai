   "comments": [
    "YES. TAKE IT. YOU DO LEARN. Just do the work.",
    "Yes, the professors are extremely helpful and patient. The language is challenging but very fun to learn as a Westerner, as it is different than what most students will have learned before coming to Yale. The best part is that it makes an extraordinarily rich and joyful culture accessible.",
    "110 part two. bahut grammar.",
    "If you took 110 I assume you are taking 120. The workload does increase initially as you have more worksheets and assigned reading to do than in 110. Still a very chill class.",
    "Hindi 120 is a great class. Like Hindi 110, it's going to be more challenging if you're a non-heritage speaker but the professors really do try to work with you to make it easier. The community within Hindi 120 was also great. You'll probably enjoy this class more than other language classes, in my opinion. It may seem daunting because it's not a Roman language but it's not bad!",
    "I would highly recommend L2 Hindi to other students, as it is a course where you learn a ton, in a laid-back environment. Definitely more intense as compared to L1, but still a pleasure to be a part of."
