    "I would recommend this course to another student. If you are interested in doing qualitative research in your future, or even just want a better understanding of how to assess qualitative research, this is really a good course to take. I was able to spend the semester designing my own project, which I hope to complete in the near future, and getting hands-on experience of how to do qualitative research.",
    "Yes, because this class allows students to learn about qualitative research method and provides opportunity to practice use it through a guided student project.",
    "Comprehensive overview of qualitative analysis focused on helping you to further define you dissertation topic",
    "Yes- see answer to question 1. Only downside- might have liked a little more guidance\/structure and more on grounded theory and thematic analysis."

    "I won't be doing a dissertation, but I feel like this course gave me a much broader understanding of the research that's out there and how to utilize different methodologies to answer whatever research questions I come up with in the future.",

    "Helped me gain additional clarity on my dissertation topic",
    "I may want to do qualitative or mixed methods for my dissertation. In that regard this class was very helpful. I did not have any experience with qual research prior to taking this class."
