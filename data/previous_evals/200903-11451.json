   "comments": [
    "It's a requirement... so you probably should take it. You build 4 models: massing, tectonic, circulation, and program. There are probably about 8 all-nighters attached to that curriculum.",
    "Very frustrating course. A lot of us had no idea what we were supposed to be doing with our analytical models. Petit tries to makes the assignments vague so that we'll take things in our own direction, but then he is VERY particular about what he likes to look of in crit.But you don't have a choice.On the bright side, you'll have some cool models to put in your portfolio.",
    "You know what, if you really want to leave this school having learned something, having produced something that you can be proud of after you finish college and feeling that you exploited all of your resources as much as you could to produce something, than this is your class. Of course this may involve a few all-nighters along the way, but everything has a price...",
    "If you're not an architecture major, don't take this course. If you are, then you have to, so there's no point in reading further. It's a frustrating course, but in the end you will learn a TREMENDOUS amount of very valuable information that will prove vital in future studio courses.",
    "Analytic model is a class I would recommend. After finishing, I have realized that it is important to put a lot of work into each model and to work steadily to improve each model after critique. Basically, this class gives you the opportunity to have four beautiful models at the end of the class, if you put in the work, but you can also slip through the cracks and have a few mediocre models if you are not rigorous.",
    "The analytic model is a very intense introduction to analyzing a single building. The course consists making analytic diagrams and the building of four analytic models of one building which you \"choose\" with the help of Professor Petit and the TFs. Oftentimes Petit is very busy so the TFs become in a manner surrogate professors and your mentors. My words of advice: be creative, take risks, try to think spatially rather than linguistically, have confidence in yourself, and don't wait until the last minute to start building. Even if you don't have any idea what you are doing, make a sketch for 5-10 minutes and then just start building. Good luck!",
    "Yes! You're probably taking it because you have to, but it really helps the way you think about architecture...and representation of thoughts in general.",
    "I am glad that this course is now been offered to non- architecture majors as it is really an opportunity to learn how to think in a truly unique way. The class however is VERY expensive as so many materials are required. I spent approximately $1000 on this class this semester. However, it might be different for the non majors next semester and I therefore encourage all the students to be creative with recycled materials to cut costs.",
    "This class is amazing. It will teach you to really be able to analyze a building and learn ways in which to physicallyrepresent your analysis. It seems that building models would be rather straightforward, but it is not at all - this class is very difficult and time-consuming, but that is what makes it so rewarding. Petit is great - his criticism is always helpful, and he really pushes you to think outside the box when determining how to build your models. It is so interesting to be able to have your own project for the semester, and also to see how everyone else's models progress. Great class - definitely worthwhile.",
    "You have to take it as in arch major but yeah, it's fun",
    "The class is a lot of work, and it's a little nerve-racking the way everything builds up to the final review. But if you're will to submit to Emmanuel's aesthetic and his ways of teaching -- which you should because he's brilliant -- then, you can get quite a lot out of the class. At times, critiques can be frustrating because you aren't sure what you're being asked of, but it really helps you to constantly reinvent the way you analyze and interpret building plans and sections. You'll find towards the end the you get very creative in your analysis.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student and it is required for architecture majors. It is a lot of work and most of the time you will be lost and confused, but at the end you will be amazed at the models you have created and how much you have improved in your model making techniques and how much more you understand your building. Also, Petit is awesome. One piece of advice thought - when picking your building, remember you actually have to make it.",
    "PETIT AND BUILDING YOU WILL MARRY INSPIRES SO MUCH>LOVE AND HATE.",
    "It's a ton of work-- be prepared. Probably unlike anything you've taken before. If you're ever confused, don't be afraid to go to your TA or Professor Petit himself for help. They expect it. But it's essential if you want to be a good architect. Professor Petit is really incredible; don't miss this opportunity to learn under him.",
    "Architecture 249 is a difficult course, and I only recommend it for architecture majors. 90% of your time will be spent making models. Planning ahead and starting early is the key if you want to succeed in the class.",
    "Analytic Model is a challenging class for first year Architecture majors, but at the same time very rewarding. The series of models are organized in a orderly fashion to help students learn about the buildings that they are analyzing. The work load is heavy and sometimes even heavier than studio,so be prepared to pull all-nighters before the models are due and definitely before the final review."
