    "This last pre-req theory course is where it starts to get enjoyable. You really start to understand how music came to be what it is, and the coursework is very fun in this way. I highly recommend taking this course with Prof. McCreless\u00e2\u0080\u0094he's a very skilled piano sight reader, and he highlights the concepts he's teaching in a very useful way.",
    "211 is a great class, you should take it if you're interested in learning about chromatic harmony, and writing a schubert-style song and nocturne. The work is challenging but manageable.",
    "This is a great class if you're fairly proficient at writing harmony (from 210 ideally) and are genuinely interested in analyzing and talking about music. If not, this class will be really hard. That said, the assignments are really enjoyable (we wrote a schubert style song and had the opportunity to write a chopin style nocturne for the final project).",
    "Yes. If you love music, take it. And take it with McCreless.",
    "As a composer, MUSI 211 was a lot more interesting than MUSI 210 because the \"chromatic\" (as opposed to the \"diatonic\" topics in MUSI 210) were more interesting and applicable to the music I was writing. In MUSI 211, you really get a sense for what makes Chopin's, Schubert, Beethoven and other composer's music \"tick\" and sound the way they do. It will take your appreciation of romantic and 19th century music to a new level! I definitely recommend MUSI 211 and strongly recommend taking it with a professor like Prof. McCreless who is the DUS of music and teaches the class very well. My experience with TA's teaching the MUSI 205\/210\/211 series has not been the most positive, hence why I strongly suggest a Professor.You do a model composition in the style of Schubert (very fun project!) in addition to usual harmony and analysis assignments + a final analysis paper.",
    "Yes, most definitely.",
    "Fun class. Exciting range of music covered. I took it with Prof McCreless and had a blast -- though I imagine that not many teachers could be as awesome.",
    "Great class. There's homework for each class, but it's usually not much at all. You learn (more in-depth than 210) how to analyze pieces, learn some new musical styles and techniques, and end up listening to a lot of classical music along the way, as well as composing a piece or two as well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys music, not just music majors (because I am not one), if you've already gotten past 210 or just have a lot of background in theory and\/or music."
