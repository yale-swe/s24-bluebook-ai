    "Absolutely TAKE THIS CLASS! At first, I was leery, because I am a non-science major and I was considering fulfilling another distribution requirement this semester, but during reading week I was won over by this class, and I'm extremely glad I ultimately decided to take it! Each week Professor Prum gives a short lecture on the week's families of birds, then you spend some time examining specimens of the week's bird families. The quizzes are fairly difficult, and for the final you must memorize 150 bird families, but the work was worth it to me! I would never have made use of the Peabody's resources without this class. This became my favorite class of the semester, even over Ornithology lecture. Even though we didn't go to Ecuador over spring break, it was worth it.",
    "Ornithology lab was really great. I don't think I have ever learned so many interesting things in one course before. Additionally, I actually REALLY LEARNED a LOT OF STUFF, which is super awesome. Knowing all those bird families is sort of like learning a new language- you have to understand key identifying marks and what they mean and learn to think critically about different bird types. It did require a lot of studying, but the weekly quizzes force you to learn it. Basically, this course is unique and really should be taken. TAKE IT!The field trips (generally Saturdays early to afternoon) were a lot of fun, although about half got rained out.",
    "The nature of the course is rote memorization. You basically learn to identify birds by their taxonomic classification up to their families. It demands a huge amount of your time and effort. If you're taking it along with the lecture, you'll see that you're working a lot more for the lab than for the lecture, which is an interesting balance for 0.5 versus 1.0 credits. Nevertheless, it is very rewarding if you put the time in to learn the material. So easy to fall behind if you don't take one week seriously. The structure is more like a class than a lab because there are no lab reports... but there is a constant demand to study, study, study. Survival is a testament to one's manhood. You better know you like birds if you decide to take this course. Don't take it if you're looking for an easy biology lab because THIS IS REALLY HARD!",
    "If you are excited to learn how to identify almost every family of birds and to appreciate the biodiversity of birds, this class is most definitely for you. It requires a lot of memorization and there are weekly quizzes, but if you study everything you have learned so far before the quiz every week, you will do very well. Birds are so awesome!!!!!!",
    "An intense survey of avian families. Make sure you have a genuine interest in birds- not just you think they're cool or pretty, but really want to learn about the specifics of their bone structure, calls, feeding systems, breeding systems, etc, and memorize an innumerable amount of foreign family names.",
    "This class is a lot of work. You have to memorize about 150+ families of birds. More than just the names, you also have to know information about habitat, diet, and interesting facts. You have weekly quizzes to prepare for, which is kind of stressful. However, only the midterm and final count for your grade. While studying for the lab took up more time than the actual lecture, I learned a lot. You will walk away with a lot of practical knowledge and an experience few others will get to have. Takingthe lab also helped reinforce everything in class.",
    "it's a great class, but keep in mind it's a lot of memorization. if you already have some background about different birds you're off to a great start.",
    "It's a lot of work and memorization. I probably shouldn't have taken it for a grade.",
    "I would recommend this class in addition to the lecture; it adds a whole other facet to learning about the concepts in lecture. However, if memorizing lots of names (as that is the basic outline of the class) is not something you enjoy, this class probably isn't for you. But it's a very interesting course, and you get to see lots of cool, interesting birds, so I would definitely recommend it!"
