    "Knowledge about what causes global warming",
    "I learned a great deal about the physical processes involved in global warming.",
    "Some knowledge, minimal skills",
    "A wider knowledge about the body of scientific literature on global warming, as well as a more thorough understanding of many scientific phenomena and climate-related effects.",
    "I gained knowledge about general concepts discussed in the warming papers, the scientific method, standards for research, and current debates in methods for approaching global warming.",
    "I learned about the history of climate science (the concepts, scientific traditions, etc.) through studying various papers and course lectures.",
    "Basic understanding of climate science from the ground up - IR-active gasses, global warming, climate forcing and feedbacks, general circulation models, etc."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great class formatting. Well structured and well-timed. Engaging and organized professor. Weakness: Better preparation for first exam.",
    "Strengths: great engagement through semester-long presentations and the final debate!",
    "The weekly student presentations were very useful for learning the crucial aspects of the sometimes overwhelming papers we read. The lectures were usually filled with content, although I felt that we sometimes did not spend enough time discussing the more complicated parts of lecture, and asking questions for clarification in class was not very easy.",
    "I am very grateful that I have learned the basics of climate change from this course, but I wish the course could have been even more specifically tailored to pushing back against climate deniers in the political (and social) world. We did talk a fair bit about this, but I wish it was even a bigger focus of the course.",
    "Strengths: encourages participation Weaknesses: Too much unclear information",
    "Wetllaufer is engaging, and the readings don't ask too much of you. That said, the student presentations tended to be somewhat dry.",
    "Teacher does not know how to teach non-STEM majors at all. He's funny, but not forgiving, and horrible at outlining expectations. It doesn't matter how hard or how smart you study. If you're a HUM major and you want to do well, you simply have to be lucky.",
    "The course is strong because it is very helpful to both people without much scientific background and people with more scientific background alike. One weak point is that it's easy to go week-to-week and not learn many things from the course, then the quizzes come kind of all at once. I think maybe it would be better to have evaluation points more spread-out through the semester, like maybe bi-weekly quizzes instead of two larger exam-style tests. Additionally, there should maybe be some supplementary materials to help explain the scientific content covered in the course.",
    "I thought that a major strength of the course was the way that it was set up to provide a general overview of the concepts discussed in that weeks paper on Tuesday, followed by a class discussion of these topics on Thursday. I didnt see any way it could improved; the course was very well taught.",
    "I thought it did a great job of outlining the science for a layman (I can now hold my own in a dinner conversation, which was one of the teaching goals) however sometimes I felt the papers were too technical to move through quickly, and so often felt ignorant as opposed to knowledgable on the subjects covered in class.",
    "The class structure worked quite nicely - read a paper a week, with lectures on Tuesdays to go over important concepts and student presentations on the paper and discussions on Thursdays. The presentation part was especially valuable, as you got a chance to delve deeply into a paper and understand it more fully than the others. Lots of fun!"

   "comments": [
    "YES, use this as a science credit! It's not that much work and you learn a lot. I am leaving the course knowing a lot about the science behind climate change. Definitely an important course to take.",
    "Yes. I think this is a course\/subject matter everyone at Yale should become educated about.",
    "Great science credit for non-STEM students. Very well taught, makes me wish I had spent some more time in hard science classes!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning the basic dynamics of global warming. The course did get excessively scientific for my tastes at times, however. Coming in, I was expecting more of a discussion about the basic of climate change, but it sometimes felt like we were getting bogged down by scientific minutiae.",
    "I would recommend this course because it did give me basic knowledge on climate change as a non-STEM major. I also thought Prof. Wetlauffer was very good and was really committed to teaching us the concepts of the material. However, at times I felt I didn't have enough of a science background to really appreciate the scientific papers that we read and the discussions that we had in class. I wish this class either spent more time in the beginning introducing us to scientific conventions and lingo etc, or focused less on the nitty gritty science and more on using our knowledge of climate science to make headway in the world.",
    "No, we didn't receive much feedback on how we were doing throughout the semester",
    "Yes, but be prepared for doing some actual science! Quizzes were surprisingly hard, given how demanding the rest of the course was.",
    "No.",
    "Take this course! I was a second semester senior looking for a science credit, and was so pleasantly surprised by this course. Professor Wettlaufer is funny and kind, and the course is definitely very approachable for non-stem folks. If youre interested in getting a basic background in scientific concepts that are important to global warming, I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "If you want to learn about how climate science actually works, this is the course for you. Even with a limited science background, you will be able to explain global warming and climate change to your peers and understand the history of climate science. It's good fun!",
    "Great class, especially for non-science majors or science majors in a different field who want a working knowledge of the atmosphere and literacy of geophysical papers WITHOUT all of the nuts and bolts calculus underlying these processes. Super interesting structure - you read a paper a week, with lectures on Tuesdays to go over important concepts and student presentations on the paper and discussions on Thursdays. Discussions often went beyond the science and forayed into the real world implications and societal interactions!"
