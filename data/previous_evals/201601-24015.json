    "Learn a lot about sugar in Cuba, scientific and medical progress made in Cuba, and US imperialism in suppressing their research.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone interested in Cuban or general Latin American studies, and are curious about interpreting this history, not from the typical social and political perspectives, but more from the environmental, economic, and cultural ones.",
    "This class focuses on environmental history of Cuba only. I would recommend this class to a student if they had previous interest or knowledge of Caribbean History. However, if you are looking for a class that focuses more on political or classical history, the class is not for you. These topics were touched upon in class, but the primary goal was to survey environmental history. I found this to be a very interesting lens through which to view broader themes.",
    "It's a decent course if you like cows and capybaras. Not much reading and pretty easy overall, but that might make you slip. Professor Funes is truly a god among men, but prepare for a lot of lecturing and little discussion!"
