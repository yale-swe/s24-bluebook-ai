    "Computational Vision and Biological Perception is an extremely interesting series of lectures. I find it hard to describe it as a \"course\" because it really doesn't feel like the typical course just because of the breadth of material covered. Take it, but take it Credit\/D - I have no idea what my grade will be which is why I wish I had. The problem is that prior to finals week all you have in terms of grades is a few homework assignments that don't really affect your grade. In the end your grade completely comes down to the final (where at least this year there was very little spread among the entire class) and your project (and that just seems to depend on how much Zucker likes it). If you aren't worried about your grade, you will get SO MUCH out of this course and you won't be going half mad at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course with some reservation. The pace was so fast that I didn't really get a solid grip on most of the material, although in retrospect, I don't think that is expected. The presentation of the math was a little sloppy, and sometimes difficult to follow. (Some topics, like relaxation labeling, are really notation heavy and require a bit of careful reading.) The expectations of the course are really unclear, which can be stressful at times, particularly for the exam and final project. The amount of work (and portion of the grade that is determined by that work) is disproportionately placed at the end of the course, with both a final exam and project, each worth 40%, though the rest of the course was relatively light (only 4 psets). Overall, it is a good survey course and I feel I have a better general understanding of the field.",
    "First half: building the vision system and abilities from simple creatures to more complex. Second half: computational vision concepts and methods, visual cortex connections. Yes I would recommend this course, it was really cool and the final project was fun to do.",
    "Computational Vision was a great class, I learned a lot of interesting things. However, it was very unorganized. before the final week of school only 20% of our grade was determined. And the guidelines for our final project were very loose.",
    "At times I, and I think most of the class, was terrified of what we were learning in 475. I'm a computer science major, and a lot of the stuff we learned was way over my head. That being said, after it's all over, I appreciate the level of detail Professor Zucker went into.Professor Zucker was usually entertaining, and class was only occasionally dull.If you take this class, don't stress out about the final. I know I did, but Professor Zucker ended up making it way easier than I expected. He knows that he's teaching hard stuff, and he doesn't expect you to know all the little details.",
    "The strengths of this class are the mathematical concepts that it treats. Convolution, the FFT, and filtering are all fascinating topics and the class gives you a chance to play around with them a bit.The teaching was the main weakness of this class. The lectures are unstructured to the point of being convoluted (forgive the bad pun). Zucker favors the \"point-last\" style of presentation, where you have no idea what he is talking about until the last 30 seconds of lecture, when he tells you the thesis of the lecture. At that point, there's no time to ask questions if you're confused (which you often are) and you have no chance to understand the body of the lecture in terms of the thesis he wants to prove. This might work for some people but I was hopelessly confused and felt like I didn't get much out of the class.The lecture notes are the only other resource the class provides for secondary reading. Since they're written by Zucker they are also pretty dense and often unnecessarily complex (i.e. four long equations where a sentence will do). Reading the actual papers Zucker mentions might be a better way to engage with the material more. I read some of the papers (\"What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain\") and some are very understandable to non-neurologists.The problem sets were generally not long and involved much more playing with Matlab than thinking about how to solve the actual problem. Having a midterm might be a nice way to check in with students part way through the course to make sure everyone is not lost.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone that already has a decent background in several of the topics. This is not really the time to learn the material being taught...However if you already have some background this is an excellent overview of the relevant areas of vision. It also might be a fun course for someone who knows very little and just wants a course overview of interesting topics. However, without a background a lot of the material might seem a bit unclear.",
    "Yes, with reservations. It is a class that would mean more after some background in other subjects (math neuro compsci engineering), and a student without the background can be quite lost. It is also highly independent, probably designed for graduate students. 80 percent of the grade is final + final project, and the directions for final project are quite literally \"do something creative that's related to the class.\" Offers a high degree of freedom, but fewer guidelines."
