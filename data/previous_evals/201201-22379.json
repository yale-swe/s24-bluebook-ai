    "Music 210 is the intermediate level in the music theory progression (205-210-211). They redesign 205 and 210 like every other year, so I'm not sure it would be helpful for me to go into any specifics. For me, this class was frustratingly similar to 205, but it let me take voice lessons for credit, so it was definitely worth it.The best part of this class is getting to compose your own classical music. It's the opposite of being creative, but it teaches you more about form than you can learn otherwise. Put as much work as you can into all the composition assignments.",
    "You have to take this class to take other music classes, so why not take it with Jonathan? He's a really chill guy, and I learned a lot from the course. There are assignments every class, but they're completely manageable and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are planning on being a music major\/need it for lessons for credit. I only took this course because I am also taking lessons for credit (it is required with lessons for credit). Unless you are fascinated with music theory and wish to continue learning music theory to a higher level, you probably should not take this course. The course material is very detailed and there are a lot of exceptions to the rules. If you love analyzing pieces and talking about music theory rules for 75 minutes, you may enjoy this class. However, for most people, this class will probably be boring (not because it's easy!) and tedious. Also, if you take the course with Jonathan, he has a stricter hw policy than the other TAs.",
    "This class forces you to really put yourself out there in developing your analytical and compositional skills. I was really scared at first, but I got a whole lot better because of it.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to a student interested in theory.",
    "This was definitely my favorite class of the semester. Though there is some overlap with the material of 205 (which a good number of students had taken in the fall), it's a welcome reiteration of ideas and allows one tograsp more strongly onto the concepts at hand. The work is never really overbearing (unless you start your variations or string quartet project at the last minute), and can often be enjoyable and interesting to do. Also, the smaller size of the class allows for better communication both between student and teacher and students in themselves. There we looked over pieces in class all the time, there could be a bit more formal analysis so students really have the opportunity to see how composers utilized the concepts we learned in the abstract. This is more of a suggestion than a weakness, because it's not as if analysis wasn't done at all. Overall, a great class, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to continue his study of music theory.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. By far my favorite class this semester -- I came in with a love of music and a pretty solid knowledge of basic theory, but I had no idea how much I had yet to learn, and this class taught me so much. Jonathan (the instructor) was absolutely fantastic, and his love of music was infectious! Workwise, there's weekly homework and the occasional quiz, but it's low-pressure. We elected to have an in-class final, which was rigorous, but we were all well-prepared and it was no problem. The main assignments to focus on are the mid-term and final composition projects (a set of piano variations and a minuet\/trio-style string quartet). They required quite a bit of time and effort, but it's so rewarding! Nothing beats the satisfaction of having something you and you alone have created being performed by a live string quartet."
