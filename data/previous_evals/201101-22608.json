   "comments": [
    "I thought it was a really helpful course and I feel that my French improved tenfold. The work is a lot but it's not too hard and the material is great (see; L'\u00e9tranger and Truffaut's Jules& Jim) Mme Koundi is a great teacher and I would definitely suggest taking this course with her",
    "I would recommend this course because it allows you to move on to L4, but it is not a good class for people who are interested in learning to love the french language since the homework load is so great one might resent it more than love it.",
    "Lots of work, but will improve language skills vastly.",
    "In French 130, in addition to general grammar instruction and exercises, we read several French books and watched a few French films. Each day, we discussed the book or film we were currently discussing. The constant discussion definitely helped to improve my language skills.",
    "Great course. The workload for the Petit Nicolas unit is a bit too heavy, particularly when compared to that of the rest of the semester. Other than that, I appreciated being in an environment in which I was required to speak French, and as a result, I definitely think my French improved significantly.Madame Koundi is great! She is extraordinarily encouraging to students when they are having difficulty, and she corrected our sentences without injuring our self-esteem. She is also very understanding of any personal problems that may arise. I can't wait to take French again with her in the fall.",
    "Yes, this was a great class to learn a language in and it is very exciting to realize you can read novels in French!"
