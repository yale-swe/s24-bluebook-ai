   "comments": [
    "Not what you are expecting if you think Game theory is going to be this fun thing.",
    "The class starts out fun and cool, but can get FAR too technical at times. I would recommend it as a credit\/d\/fail course for anyone, since much of the material is interesting.",
    "The class was ok. It's Neeman's first year so he'll hopefully learn. The first weeks were fun, with video clips and anecdotes but class rapidly devolved into boring chalk talks and formal proofs. I stopped going pretty much. Psets were graded p\/f and the TF had good solutions posted quickly. The 70 page pdf of Neeman's notes was a godsend. Very interesting and clear. Also, the exams were very similar to the sample exams posted before them. Interesting material and not hard to do well but not the kind of lecture that you look forward to.",
    "IF THIS IS TAUGHT BY ZVIKA NEEMAN AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I took this course because I enjoy econ and had enjoyed the game theory I had done in the past. This course was by far the worst class I have taken in college. The lectures were confusing and disorganized, questions weren't ever answered, and the psets were RIDICULOUSLY difficult. To make things worse, the midterm and the final were on more typical game theory topics...which we spent almost no time on. I feel like I have learned nothing from this class, and I would not recommend taking this as long as it is taught by Professor Neeman.",
    "Do not take this with Zvika Neeman.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless taught by another professor. Otherwise it probably is not worth your time.",
    "Fun if you just want to learn a little more about strategy. Fun to read textbook.",
    "Recommend if you are interested in the course material. Definitely have some experience in Econ at Yale before taking the course.",
    "Too theoretical but if you have a good TA to explain the material it is a very good course.",
    "I would recommend it for Econ majors who want to see a cool way to see how games (the larger idea of games, not just like Monopoly) work.",
    "A course like Game Theory is really interesting, and Id recommend taking it IF you make sure that Professor Neeman is either a) not teaching it or b) learned from this semester that he cant teach it as a mathematical\/proofy course. Im not an econ major and this was my first econ course, so Im looking at this from the perspective of any random interested student. The workload is manageable and the exams are fairly straightforward, and its not such a big time commitment or anything. But if you want to actually learn something, like people who took Ben Pollacks course did, Id ask around (if I were you) to make sure that the professor is a good one. My course was not very good, but the content almost made up for that fact.",
    "Very difficult concepts, poorly explained. Would not recommend!",
    "ECON 159 was a very interesting course. The material was vey thought provoking and made me think of every day interactions in a more strategic manner. I would recommend this course to another student, but I would advise those who are not intimately acquainted with advanced math to maybe take it with another professor.",
    "This class might be enjoyable with a different instructor. But this semester, it was a poor use of a credit because the teaching style prevented me from truly learning the material.",
    "It was a pretty interesting class and not too much work. It was just structured poorly. The psets contain the hardest problems in the class, and you can only learn them from section. It's kind of annoying that he doesn't explain the stuff you actually have to do in class. He takes the stance of explaining the basics and then you learn on your own on the psets.",
    "An introduction to game theory with a heavy focus on the math",
    "Good but doesn't balance theory and problem solving too well. If Jin Wook still tas go to his sections.",
    "I like the idea of game theory, but Neeman's version of it was extremely dull, uninteresting, and difficult to follow. His lectures were long, drawn-out, and generally not relevant to the homework, and the homework was complex and difficult in comparison to the exams which seemed a great deal simpler by comparison. I know the class used to be a great one back when Benjamin Pollak taught it, but I would recommend something you won't regret going to each day over this class if Neeman is still teaching it.",
    "Do not take it with Neeman if you are looking forward to really learn and understand game theory. Just dont.",
    "Game Theory was a difficult, unfulfilling, impractical class. I recommend you avoid it. I took it to fulfill an Econ elective and because it didn't seem too math-heavy...if you're in that same boat, it may be worth it depending on the quality of the other options, but otherwise, nah.",
    "I would not recommend Game Theory as taught by these professors to anyone. I was really looking forward to learning the subject, but feel like I just wasted my time in the class and could have a better understanding by now if I had just read some books about it. I took it credit\/d\/fail so the workload was minimal (just 1 problem set a week that I spent about 10 minutes on).",
    "Awful class that was easily the worst experience I've had in five semesters. The lectures by Neeman were worthless because he clearly didn't care if anybody learned anything. He made no effort to check our understanding, never pointed out important points or topics, didn't hold any review sessions, and was just terrible at teaching in general. He operated as if his only job was to write his lecture notes (which were very unclear) on the board for 75 minutes twice a week. The notes and the problem sets were too advanced for an introductory-level game theory course, especially one that a lot of non-majors take. That might have been ok if the teaching was any good, but I think pretty much everybody was left in the dark. Game Theory used to be a must-take course here, so Yale should be outraged at how bad it was this year.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS (with Professor Neeman). Honestly the worst class I have had at Yale. This isn't an intro course. We cover material that should be reserved for upper level Math courses (Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem?) and it is all covered in a very math-heavy manner, while Game Theory should be taught using a lot of real-world examples. Because I barely understood the class, I felt like I learned nothing throughout the entire semester. There isn't a lot of work, only one extraordinarily difficult problem set each week, but it is graded on effort, along with a midterm and final. The tests are easier than the problem sets, but the lecture notes are so hard to follow that it is nearly impossible to study for. Game Theory can be interesting, but after this class, I never want to see it again.",
    "Game theory is a useful set of tools to think about decision-making, but the course itself will not be your favorite. Take this course if you think game theory will help you in future coursework, but do not take it for its own sake as you will probably be disappointed. It is the sort of course you could probably learn pretty well from a textbook, so don't take this course if other classes interest you more.",
    "Great class, prepare to be a little bit confused at first, will teach you an entire different way of approaching problems and way of thinking. try to ask the professor questions about things that you don't get, do not ask the TA.",
    "Don't take it if Professor Neeman is teaching it. I had to for my major, but I would have dropped it otherwise. It was not a good class, and I had to learn the material on my own outside of class. The problem sets have nothing to do with the material discussed during class, and you get absolutely no feedback on how you did on the homework, so you have no idea what to expect going into the tests. The tests were graded harshly. I would suggest taking a game theory course in a different department, unless someone else is teaching it.",
    "Game Theory is an overview of a trendy and somewhat useful field in behavioral economics. The course format varies hugely depending on who's teaching it; I took it with Neeman this year, but shopped it with Nalebuff last year. Neeman's style of teaching lacks the hands-on experience and gradign incentives a class like Game Theory needs to really reinforce the concepts being taught. Under Neeman, each week's problem set would be graded pass\/fail, meaning that students had little incentive to actually learn how to work through difficult Game Theory problems before the midterm came. If Neeman's teaching it, take this class only if you can teach yourself effectively. The course material is incredible, but poor class format and section structure really undermines how well students can absorb the information.",
    "Would not recommend with this professor. Hard to follow in lecture and not much better when asked questions.",
    "Interesting class! Material is a little dry though",
    "I would not recommend taking this class unless you have to.",
    "Game theory covers strategic and extended form games and includes such topics as Nash Equilibria, backward induction, prisoner's dilemma, and bidding. I would recommend it because it is great for strategic thinking and applying it to the real world.",
    "I enjoyed this course. Good way to get an so for math majors.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH SVIKA NEEMAN. Honestly, this is the worst class I've taken at Yale. I don't think I really learned anything. I really wanted to like this class going into it. Unfortunately, Professor Neeman did not explain things in a way that enabled me to take away underlying principles and apply them to other problems. The class was not much work, which was a plus, but it's graded on an econ curve. While this is reasonably generous, trying harder will not guarantee you a better grade. If you come into it already getting this stuff you'll do well, if not, you don't have much hope of learning. Maybe this class will be better if they get a new instructor, but if it's the same as this semester, I wouldn't advise taking it.",
    "Do not take this class.",
    "Game theory is definitely an interesting topic, but don't take this class with Professor Neeman. The lectures were confusing and conducted almost entirely in formal logical definitions. There were only 2 TAs and they were less than helpful. The only good thing might be that the problem sets were graded based on effort, but the terrible consequence of that is that you receive virtually no real feedback - so that when it comes time for examinations, you don't even know if you know what you need to know."
