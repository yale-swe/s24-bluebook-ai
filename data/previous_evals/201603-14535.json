   "comments": [
    "I learned about the global financial crisis and how it spread from the Lehman Brother's crash to the Greece and the rest of Europe. I learned the political and economic causes and effects of the crisis.",
    "I gained a comprehensive understanding of the economic, political, and social dynamics underpinning the Eurozone crisis. We were exposed to different theoretical and empirical approaches to the crisis and gained competence in evaluating the response of governments and international organizations (such as the IMF).",
    "Knowledge: Eurozone crisis from both economic and political perspectives Skill: think critically about international events Insights: debates about causes, struggling during the procedures, sophistication of the results of various Eurozone issues",
    "Gained a working understanding of the Eurozone crisis.",
    "I learned to examine the causes of the crisis in more detail and distinguish the reasons across each country. I also learned about the social and political effects of the crisis which intersected with economic shortcomings of the crisis.",
    "Essay writing, developing communication skills.",
    "This course was a great opportunity to see concepts of political science and economics as they occur in reality and how they are used to fix problems. It also provided a great understanding of the crisis itself in its economic, social, and political particularities.",
    "I learned a lot about a pressing issue facing the world now, and about just how dire the situation is in Europe. If one wants to learn about the origina of the Eurozone Crisis, the series of events, and the political, economic, and social effects of it on various countries, then this is the ultimate class. The nuances of the situations I learned were incredibly interesting, and I will retain all of the information I learned. I also familisrized myself with some basic and some specialized macroeconomic terms relevant to this course.",
    "Prior to the course, I had a limited background in politics and economics of the European Union. Not only did the course assist in learning more about the region, but also I developed analytical skills which are applicable to any course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A major strength of this course was the guest speakers that brought real life experiences and context to the materials we read in class. I think this course would be better if there was a midterm paper.",
    "Hard for students unfamiliar with the issue",
    "I would have liked more activities in the class that would allow us to synthesize the information we learned.",
    "This class is extremely well taught and interesting. It is perfectly structured in the first half of the class, but I think it starts to lose its focus in the second half (i.e. after the Ireland and Cyprus lesson). The thematic\/country approach works to an extent, but having a more chronological approach in certain lessons would facilitate an understanding of the succession of events.",
    "This course was taught seminar-style, and is very intimate because of that. It also has a lot of reading, which is crucial to class discussion, and Professor Aslanidis knows if the class hasn't read. All of the articles touch on different aspects and are quality reading, so they should be done anyways. On response papers and readings, he gives you a full week to do it, because he class only meets once per week. Definitely don't try to squeeze the readings into one day.",
    "The course was very heavy on economics without much economics introduction for a course with no economics prerequisites. As far as strengths, the seminars were incredibly informative and engaging, with the discourse feeling intense but also flowing naturally and coming from well-argued places."

   "comments": [
    "An excellent class. Professor Aslanidis is engaging and provides excellent insights while furthering discussion. I think the class is beneficial for both those who know very little about the Eurozone to those with an advanced knowledge. Would definitely recommend this course!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the connections between politics and economics.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in European affairs. The knowledge of the EU that you gain through this class goes beyond the past crisis and constitutes a good comprehensive introduction to the various political, economic, and social dimensions of the integration project. Prof Aslanidis is a great professor, very engaged and available. The classes are structured well, with short initial lectures to cover the \"basics\" of the topic at hand and initiate the discussion.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in being articulate on issues facing the Eurozone and EU. Especially for those going into fields where world knowledge is important, this course will give you the tools to reach your own conclusions. Prof Aslanidis values intellectual diversity and seeks out all viewpoints.",
    "Yes I absolutely would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes. Very relevant and interesting material. A lot of reading though.",
    "I would but this should be considered ECON more than any of the other disciplines for which it is listed.",
    "If you have any interest in understanding Europe as it is today, take this course. Professor Aslanidis is great. Also, if a seminar's quality is due to the people in it, this course seems to attract knowledgeable people with a genuine interest in the subject but with vastly different backgrounds. This makes for great discussions.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, especially if taught by Professor Aslanidis, who is really an expert in this field. It broadens your pur iew of the world significantly, and can be a good class if you want to go into public policy, because it makes you examine how different policies worked and failed and in what situations they did so. The seminar is a bit hard to get into, but not very. Demonstrate an interest and be honest, and you will have a good shot."
