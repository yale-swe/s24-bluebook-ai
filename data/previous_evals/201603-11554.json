    "I learned a lot of new things about disorders and neural processes. I also became better at preparing and studying for tests.",
    "I learned basic anatomy and function of the brain as well as information about various mental disorders. Each disorder we talked about what is not functioning right, how that contributes to symptoms, what caused those dysfunctions, and how to treat them.",
    "This course gives an overview of the basics of psychology and neuroscience as well as introducing different disorders and how one may diagnose them. Each class explores both the psychological and neural aspects of the day's focus. Would definitely recommend to someone interested in psychology or neuroscience! It's a very interesting and engaging way to approach understanding different disorders. Though there isn't too much work, it's easy to get behind and the tests require a thorough knowledge of everything said in the lecture.",
    "Very basic but difficult introductory course-- discusses brain anatomy and then goes in depth to different psychiatric disorders.",
    "I learned a general foundation for neuroanatomy, neural circuitry, and neurotransmitters and the way that affects behavior and psychopathology.",
    "This course taught me a lot about the brain and the way things can go wrong. I also learned a bit about genetics and the ways that the brain interacts with the rest of the body. Since there was a lot of material to remember, I got some practice with studying and memorizing effectively.",
    "This class provided a foundation for how I view mental disorders. It has provided a scientific a background to framed my opinions of current debates about mental health and treatment.",
    "Abnormal psychology knowledge, with strong neuroscience\/biology basis.",
    "Deeper understanding of human pathology in terms of the biological, genetic, and physiological changes that occur and lead to the syndromes and symptoms, as well as the various treatments that can address these problems.",
    "Gained a much broader knowledge of the brain and its functions",
    "The scientific basis of many mental illnesses and their treatments",
    "I learned about the biological bases for mental disorders as well as prevailing diagnostic paradigms and ethical\/legal concerns associated with treatment\/research relating to mental disorders. Went through some background neurobiology\/neuroanatomy in beginning and some patient stories. Then most of the semester was taken up by going through 10 or so mental disorders and learning about etiology, treatment, pathophysiology (how disease reflects biological function), etc. Really good course overall and I'm a non-science non-cogsci person.",
    "I learned a ton about neuroscience in the clinical realm. if you want to learn about every neurotransmitter or brain malfunction caused in all of these disorders, this is an awesome way to do it.",
    "better understanding of the neurochemical pathways underlying mental disorders",
    "Very interesting class, engaging lecturer, very understanding of life-issues that arise.",
    "I learned about the neurobiological workings of mental disorders along with symptoms and diagnoses and some legal cases as well.",
    "Before taking this course, I only had a limited, vague understanding of each of the disorders we discussed, and now I understand both the psychological and biological issues surrounding them as well as the ethical treatment of patients with these disorders.",
    "I thought I got a pretty thorough understanding of some of the various neural mechanisms of some major psychological disorders. Definitely changed the way I viewed a lot of the disorders we learned about in class. I thought it was well-paced and well-organized.",
    "basic understanding of a variety of mental disorders and their treatments, as well as basic brain structure and function.",
    "I learned so much about the psychological disorders and their biological and neuroscientific background. Can't recommend taking this class enough!",
    "By taking this course, I developed a deep understanding of the current mechanistic theories of the major psychiatric disorders. This class also gave me something even more valuable: a method of scientific inquiry with which to approach the investigation of the brain and its abnormalities.",
    "You'll get a basic knowledge of the etiology and treatments behind most major psychiatric disorders.",
    "This course helped me understand how different mechanisms of the brain give rise to psychopathology.",
    "I learned about the neural underpinnings of the major psychiatric disorders, neurotransmitters, how neurons fire. It was really interesting to see how some features of disorders in different categories (psychosis, mania, substance abuse; anxiety and depression) had similar deficiencies in certain neurotransmitters or similar affected systems (basically, the overlaps were interesting).",
    "I learned quite a bit about the complex neurological workings of the brain and how the normal processes can be affected by mental illnesses and how this affects how people think, feel, and react to stimuli."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the lectures are interesting at times, but they can also get really monotonous. On the first day, Professor Cannon showed us videos of case studies, actual patients with these disorders. I would have liked to see more of these real world applications in the lectures instead of so many slides.",
    "Not a huge commitment as it only has 5 assignments and lecture twice a week but gives lots of great, interesting information.",
    "Although the class was an \"intro\" level class, material was not at an intro level.",
    "This is a lecture course with teaching assistants but without sections. I think that this course would be improved by adding sections, as the lecture goes over so much material that is only mentioned once. Additionally, there is so much information packed into each class that it often feels like the professor is rushing to get through all the information rather than focusing on explaining the information in-depth.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was the quality of the material and the assigned readings. I found the lectures and readings to be comprehensive, and I was rarely confused about any of the concepts explained. I definitely felt like I learned a lot throughout the course. Also, the assignments were very well spaced out and organized. Three midterms and two short papers was definitely manageable. The course's main weakness was its ability to engage students. I'm not totally sure if this could really be blamed on any one person, but it seemed like a lot of students were just there because they needed a science credit. Attendance at lecture was super low, and a lot of people seemed like they didn't know what was going on and weren't interested in the subject matter. That being said, if you're into the material, you won't really care about other people's attendance.",
    "The course was strong in that it provided a lot of detail, but not so much as to be overwhelming. The lectures and powerpoint slides corresponded well to the sorts of questions we were asked in our papers and on the exams. A weakness of the course was that the material itself was presented in such technical terms that it was very difficult to understand lectures without constantly googling things for non-science majors. I would recommend the lectures be posted before class, so we have a chance to look them over first.",
    "Weakness: everything is just on the slides. Strength: everything is exactly on the slides.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive, very detailed, useful for larger understanding of brain and mental pathology, professor is incredible Weaknesses: moves very quickly through material, can be difficult to take notes during class",
    "It was very interesting but some lectures were pretty boring",
    "Strengths of the course: really good and engaging lectures, logical progression of topics learned, exams and essays were true to the material and challenging but very doable. Course could be improved by spending more time on brain anatomy--some students had a strong background in this but I did not, so it was hard at times to keep up with the material.",
    "I most struggled with learning specific brain anatomy",
    "Strengths: Really systematic trek through mental disorders and how they work -- good lectures by Prof. Cannon. He's a great explainer. Weaknesses: A bit too technical with neuro-anatomy\/physiology sometimes, especially for a non-science major like myself. Also, often the tiny details weren't on the test or necessary for papers -- Cannon should have been more upfront about what level of detail was important.",
    "Strengths: great material, great lecturer, great everything Weakness: tough to learn",
    "I was hoping for more invested TA's and an easier way to get feedback on assignments.",
    "This class was very boring. The material had the potential to be very interesting, but there was not much passion and energy put into the course. But, it was a very low workload, which is a plus.",
    "The course is very well organized and each lecture is interesting and fits in well to the different themes of the course. The one way it could be improved is to provide more feedback on the essays and exams.",
    "This course was very engaging, and the material covered was interesting. More feedback on the essays would be appreciated.",
    "Strengths: Interesting course, interesting subject matter, generally well taught. Weaknesses: Large overlap between weeks; a bit inconsistent with slide spacing, i.e., important slides are glossed over while less-important slides take up too much time.",
    "This course was basically just a memorization of the textbook. I didn't feel like I really gained anything that I couldn't have just done by reading the textbook. I did think the material was really cool but I just thought I could have gained more by learning things that extended beyond the power-point material which was essentially the entire lecture.",
    "I truly enjoyed this course - the material discussed in lecture was always taught in a captivating manner and at just the right amount of detail to promote an understanding of the subject matter. The exams were fair and the essays proved a great way to synthesize my understanding of the material covered across several different disorders as well as how it overlapped between disorders.",
    "It would have been helpful to elaborate more on the criteria that the essays would have been graded on, and what might be expected in them. The questions were pretty broad, and you can't fit everything we've learned about the topic posed in two pages, which led to calls on what to include and what to cut - which I'm concerned might have affected how \"thorough\" I was and my essay grades. I think that the essay grading should be more flexible, extend the page count, or have more specific essay questions (I felt the ones we had were trying to incorporate various lectures and topics).",
    "Course was straightforward and taught what it said it would, but I found the lectures boring and the slides very detailed, making it easy to justify skipping class.",
    "Information is incredibly interesting, i just never found myself going to lecture because all the information was on the slides.",
    "The weaknesses are that there are so much to cover, but so little time, so we didn't go into great detail for most of the topics. But other than that, Professor Cannon did a great job in teaching us as much as he could in those 4 months of classes. The lectures were therefore very dense but also super interesting.",
    "This course was strong in its direct presentation of material and clearly outlined expectations. One weakness was the effectiveness of the review sessions before each midterm--it would have been extremely helpful to have Professor Cannon there to confirm the interpretation of the data and findings discussed in class.",
    "Lectures are engaging, and grading (tests\/essays) is very fair. However, I wish Professor Cannon had gone more into some of the social realities of the disorders we discussed. Some of these diagnoses are leveled disproportionately against certain population demographics, and it's important to acknowledge this.",
    "Strengths = did great job of connecting complicated details to the overall big picture, used lots of case studies as examples which was helpful weakness = the professor unnecessarily used lots of big words to explain concepts that could have otherwise been explained in a simpler way",
    "There was a lot of material packed into each lecture, and the information that needed to be learned was very specific so it was somewhat difficult to keep track of all of the very specific information.",
    "Strengths: informative, organized, covers different theories. The essays were my favorite part. Weaknesses: lecture a bit dry at the beginning, but as we started to cover the actual disorders it got pretty interesting",
    "Strengths: The professor is very dedicated and knowledgeable to these topics and makes them rather interesting. The TA's were always there to help should we have needed it. And the course work was informative yet manageable. Weaknesses: Occasional brushing over of complex concepts that appear on exams.",
    "The course was split up very well into very concrete parts, so I felt like everything had a place. I do believe that because there is such a large amount of material between the readings and the lectures, and this is an introductory course, it would have been helpful to be told what the most important aspects to know were, and expectations of how in depth we were supposed to know the material."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure. If the person really loved neuroscience then I would. However, for me, I'm more interested in psychology, so I was really looking forward to seeing real-world examples of how patients could be diagnosed and what that process was like, but I didn't get that so the class fell a bit short of my expectations.",
    "I would stay away from this course if possible. 1. The material is far above an intro level. 2. Professor Cannon, although a great guy, is a tough lecturer (slide reader).",
    "I would recommend this to a student with an interest in neuroscience or psychology. It's very interesting and engaging and you have the opportunity to learn a lot on the topic, however the small amount of coursework make it easy to slack off. Also, the lack of sections is a challenge and the TA's can be hard to meet with. You have to be willing to put in the work, but if you are then this course will be worth it.",
    "The assigned workload is relatively low, but I would not recommend this course to someone who does not have a good background in biology. As a non-science person, this course was very difficult to follow\/keep up with.",
    "The content is a bit dry, but that may just be because I'm really not STEM-oriented.",
    "I would recommend it to any psych majors or anyone who is generally interested in how the brain affects behavior.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Of course, I'm not totally objective because I think neuroscience is super interesting and I loved all of the readings. However, it's still a cool subject. Take it if you're remotely interested in psychology or neuroscience. Don't take it if you're just looking for a science credit, because you could take things that are a lot less \"niche\" and might be more exciting to you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has taken biology or psychology courses at Yale and has a sincere interest in neuroscience. While I am personally interested in neuroscience, this course was rather difficult for me, given my lack of background in any relevant science field.",
    "yes, if interested in psychology, this course is a must-do",
    "Great class if you're interested in neuroscience and have a biological background. This is not a gut because you actually need to study for the exams, but you end up learning a lot.",
    "Although it is an intro course, material can be quite challenging.",
    "I would recommend if someone is very interested in neuroscience, but if only slightly interested, the course could get boring",
    "Yes! I took this as a non-science major to fill the SC requirement. I learned a lot and really enjoyed the class! (I was looking for an SC class that would be interesting, relevant to real life, challenging, and not a ton of work, and that's what I got.)",
    "I took this class for my science credit and would recommend it to other students who want to do the same and learn about the human brain",
    "Highly recommend -- really good look at mental disorders and how they work in the brain. I was a non science major and level of difficulty was manageable. Not an easy course, but if you study hard you can do well.",
    "I'd recommend this class, it was difficult but worth it. You learn so much great information especially if your a PSYC major. The professor is really young and cool. His vocabulary is massive so you'll probably learn a few words here and there. Overall, a great course despite it being difficult.",
    "If you need a science credit, it's not that bad.",
    "Not unless it's required or you want a class that you barely have to show up for.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to another student but it is definitely not a gut if that is what you're looking for. There is not much work throughout the semester but the exams are graded pretty strictly and cover specific material. Make sure to go to lecture, as they're both interesting and necessary to be successful in the course.",
    "Good course in Neroscience. Not as 'introductory' as the name might suggest, but if you have taken a basic bio course in highschool, you should be fine. Interesting topics, no section which is good as a boring and unecessary section is such a drag. Two (very short) essays and three exams which require some studying but are very doable. As an arts major who has taken some (easy!) science credits, this class was a doable SC credit, but required some effort, but no more than the boring grind of Issues Approach etc...this was actually interesting, so you don't begrudge the effort. Worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course. Beware of the fact it is not as clinical-based as its title may suggest, but instead closer to the course Abnormal Psych. The tests are unreasonably fact-based for a concept-based class. The essays were actively enjoyable to write, and ensured understanding of the material in a way that I do not believe the tests really did.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to another student unless they really really really enjoyed neuroscience or they really needed a science course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student - I think it was well structured and well thought and allowed me to truly develop an understanding behind the biological and psychological processes driving each of the disorders we discussed.",
    "I'm glad I took it, but not sure if others might feel the same way. I'm a non STEM major, but I had a very solid background in PSYC and BIO from high school. I appreciated that I didn't have to put in too much effort, but was interested in the material and still learned a lot (what I wanted since I'll only be taking two science classes in all four years of Yale), but other people might have a more difficult time or a less enjoyable time.",
    "Not really the best choice, even if you need the Sc credit, pretty boring.",
    "Yes, definitely. Anyone interested in the neuroscientific background of psychological disorders should take this class, it teaches you a lot!",
    "If you are interested in the biological and genetic components of mental disorders, this course is for you. It is rigorous in its level of examination, but well worth it.",
    "I would only recommend PSYC 190 if you have taken a neuroscience course before. The course material is very dense and Professor Cannon is very intelligent in this field, so he expects you to know a lot for each test. There is only 3 midterms and 2 2 page papers, so the work itself doesn't look like much BUT all of the topics are very lengthy.",
    "Focuses on the biological aspects of abnormal psychology. The way Dr. Cannon presents the information is amazing. I went to every class just to listen to his lecture. Its very analytical but extremely insightful. WAYYYYYY BETTER THAN ABNORMAL PSYCH",
    "Yes! Take this course. The material it covers is so relevant.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the overlap of psychology and biology, this is a great course to take",
    "I reccomend this class to anyone with a genuine interest in Neuroscience. I enjoyed the class but I know several of my classmates abhorred it (because it isn't as gutty as you may have heard)! Tldr: good class but not a science gut",
    "It helps if you've taken abnormal psych before this course, though there is still a lot of memorizing to do. It doesn't really feel like an intro course.",
    "If you want to focus on clinical psychology, this course is really good, because it brings in a different perspective for looking at disorders (especially the essays--they make you think about the RDoC type of classification instead of DSM-5).",
    "Great course, I highly recommend to any student looking to understand more about the brain, mental illnesses, or just people in general. A truly enjoyable course that I enjoyed from start to finish.",
    "No. Although the readings and material were mostly interesting, the course does not lend itself to thoughtful exploration of the material. The teaching fellows did not seem very engaged in the class, which I believe was both a cause and effect of the overall disengaged atmosphere of the class. The lecture was one fact after another with little reflection of what these facts mean, or how they are connected to create a useful picture of the mind from a clinical or neuroscientific lens. It was useful to learn studies and theory of the underlying neurology behind pathology, but I would have liked to more explicitly talk about the practice of clinical neuroscience and how these theories are thought about by current neurologists and their support\/critiques for and against them. The essays tried to make us create a narrative in which to place the theory, but I did not find it too productive, as we did not really discuss it in class."
