    "Amazing course. First time it was taught, so there are some kinks to work out (slight disorganization), but Tooze is still a terrific lecturer and will engage you with his novel approach of looking at history that it won't matter anyway. The topic is very relevant, as everyone reading this undoubtedly lived through the GR. Please take this class to understand why we're in such a mess!!! However, if you're an econ major looking for answers, don't come: there are none; the issue is too complicated.A midterm, midterm paper, section participation, and final comprise the grade. Pretty standard for history lectures, so stop dilly dallying and come find out how Tooze (British) pronounces \"Barack Obama\"!!! ;)",
    "The Great Recession as History was a very engaging course. Professor Tooze is a great lecturer, and the caliber of TA's our year was very strong, which is always an important aspect of a course. There was a heavy macroeconomics component to the course, but while a strong macroeconomics background might give you a richer understanding of the topics covered in the course, it is certainly not necessary -- in fact, many of the macroeconomic theories covered in the course are being revised\/enforced by responses to the recent financial crisis (meaning that they are by no means obvious, which acts as an equalizer for most students). This was the first time HIST 277 was taught, and whenever a class is as good as it was in its first iteration, it is a strong indicator that the class will be phenomenal in future iterations.",
    "If it's offered again take it! Might be a little difficult to navigate for the non-econ\/finance people, but covers so much material that everyone should be exposed to.",
    "Yes. Learned a lot, midterm paper was just an op-ed of your choice. Great, engaging lectures. Decent amount of reading each week but nothing unbearable.",
    "This was an awesome, relevant course that every Yalie should take. It was especially good to get a better understanding of American, Asian, and European economic history, something I had yet to encounter in my coursework here. I'd recommend those without econ backgrounds try it cr\/d, but the midterm and essay were graded fairly enough for many students to switch to a grade afterwards. Great class, great professor, and get Nick as your TA!!",
    "This course is extremely interesting and obviously very relevant, but is not for everyone. As someone with no background in economics, I struggled with some of the concepts that many students knew from previous coursework. This course also entails a fair amount of work; the weekly readings are large enough to be quite discouraging to those who don't understand them very well.I would recommend this course to anyone with at least some basic background in economics, otherwise take it credit\/d.",
    "Amazing course! Take it! Interesting material and well-taught by Professor Tooze.",
    "Take this class, regardless of major. Take it.",
    "Take it! Awesome course",
    "Yes, it is one of the few lectures here worth your time.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about the world and learn what's outside the cave.",
    "It's a complicated course, but definitely one worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. An interesting take on the Great Recession - one that differs a lot from that of most Yale Econ professors.A lot of reading at times, but material complemented the lectures and was generally interesting.Class is not too much work, and all assignments are graded generously.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Don't take it if you consider yourself conservative. You'll hate the entire semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was everything that I could have hoped for. A coherent explanation of what happened in the Great Recession and how we avoid letting it happen in the future is not really what you're in for; although I think that everyone probably understands going in that such a sophisticated topic eludes simplicity like that. Professor Tooze is one of Yale's great lecturers, and he exposes you to lots of 20th century economic history and all kinds of theories about depression and recovery, though there is clearly a hard-line Leftist bias to the course and to the readings. Be prepared to be jumping around a lot within the course (superior organization is not one of Professor Tooze's many strengths), and know going in that some econ is a sneaky, unmentioned prerequisite for this. I know lots of people who did just fine in this course without having an econ background, but having taken a macroecon class in high school or college is essential to being able to maximize your gain from this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who has interest in economics and more broadly who wants to learn about this recent financial recession. It is very comprehensive and eye-opening.",
    "Amazingly interesting and taught by an awesome professor.",
    "This class had a rocky first iteration. Tooze was pretty disorganized and I left some of the lectures feeling like I hadn't learned anything. I think the second iteration of the course improve it a lot, though, since a lot of the work will be done and Professor Tooze can do the fine-tuning that the class so greatly needed.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in learning in depth about the recent recession. The course covers causes of the recession in both the US and the Eurozone as well as how the respective zones reacted to the crisis. Towards the end, the course also goes into crisis in Japan and China.I strongly recommend this class to those interested in the economics and politics regarding the great recession. I came into this class with no economics background and got to learn a ton from it. The class is a reasonable amount of work. There are weekly sections, a midterm exam, a midterm paper and a final. Material-wise, the class is more of an economics course than a history course.",
    "Take it. I came away with a solid grasp of macro, and all those financial instruments and products those aspiring banker friends throw into everyday chats. Most importantly, you come to grips with a whole array of narratives on origins of the crisis and where we go from here. Completely changed how I think about politics.",
    "Great class. You'll learn about the recent financial crisis but also the Fed, Great Depression and Asian Financial Crisis. A must-take for all people interested in economics. As an Econ major I had a leg up on history majors who didn't know anything about Econ. I don't know how they got through the course. It was basically an applied macroeconomics class.Tooze is a great lecturer and professor. If you're lucky enough to have Ted as your TA you'll learn a bunch. Readings were long but 90% of them were interesting and useful. Not toomuch writing in this course (just an op-ed and 3 reading responses for section).",
    "If you have a strong background in economics or have been paying close attention to economic news for the last five years you won't get much out of this class. If you have no background in economics at all, you'll find yourself on uneven footing. Otherwise, definitely take this class. Professor Tooze is brilliant and makes even the Japanese recession interesting, and the class covers events everyone should have a better understanding of.",
    "Take this course in two years when it's fully fleshed out, especiallyif you're not an economics major. Right now, it's confused as to it's direction and intended audience, and a lot of it went over the head of its students. If you're a senior economics major or a person with in-depth knowledge of the economy, you probably don't need to take this class, but could enjoy it because of Tooze. Also a lot of reading.",
    "As it stands, take it Credit\/D\/Fail. Otherwise it's in too much of an experimental phase with regard to the curriculum. This is great for Credit\/D-ing because you'll actually learn some relevant information.",
    "Econ class for history majors. Definitely recommended if you want to learn about the recession in a comfortable environment. Take it if you want to learn more about the world we're living in now. But maybe start out credit\/d...",
    "Amazing course! If you want to learn about the economy today, about the recession yesterday, or about global development and trends across the past century, this is the course for you. Professor Tooze is an amazing lecturer who lectures at a million miles an hour and spouts controversial takes on things as proven fact. It's a wild ride, but one that will make you consider politics, history and the economy in a whole new light.",
    "Definitely--every current Yale student needs to know about the Great Recession, as it was a defining moment of our generation that is still playing out in some respects. Econ heavy though, so beware of that.",
    "This class is a great mixture of economics, history, and a bit of political science. Professor Tooze expects and welcomes a diverse class and does a fabulous job in the exams of allowing every student an equal chance to present what appeals to them the most. Every student, regardless of major, is equally capable of succeeding in and contributing to this class.",
    "You should learn to talk knowledgeably about what is the biggest event of our lifetimes and is ongoing. To do so requires technical knowledge and historical context of what happened and what is going on. This class provides that. Yes.",
    "Awesome and relevant class",
    "This class is very ambitious in its goal of understanding the \"history of the present.\" But since the economic recovery is coming along nicely, this class might become another typical history class; this is not necessarily bad, as it might have more of a historical narrative approach, rather than a poli-sci or econ approach. I would recommend checking it out in the future.",
    "History 277 01 is a history course that focuses on the Great Recession. If you are a student who is interested in finance or economics I would recommend this course for you. However, you should take a few other History courses first so you understand the methods and importance of History. Also, keep up with the readings.",
    "A bit all over the place, but that's a consequence of the subject matter and it being the first year this class is offered. Tooze is a great lecture and the class was really relevant (obviously). I feel much more capable of holding my own in dinner table conversation now - really everyone should take this. Minimal reading, econ background helpful but. It needed",
    "This course needs to be cross listed in Economics and History. It contained far too much information requiring knowledge of micro and macroeconomics not to be in that department. Almost all of the history majors in that course, including myself, took it pass\/fail because we felt too intimidated by the lectures to take it for a grade. The readings were extremely accessible and made the lecture material more clear when it was nearly impossible to understand. The lectures often presumed familiarity with the subject and offered Tooze's alternative theory, instead of going through enough background and giving information on the currentdiscourse. In the future, if Tooze is going to move that quickly and assign that much reading, he should have it be a seminar. If he's going to keep it a lecture, he should decrease the workload and move more slowly. Either way, should definitely be cross listed. The exams were surprisingly fair for history majors and graded very fairly as well. If I had known they would be that well-designed for history majors, I might have taken it for a grade. However, regardless, the lectures shouldn't be so intense and economic-focused without cross listing it.",
    "Do not be fooled by the syllabus' promise that \"no prior knowledge is assumed.\" If you, like me, have no econ background you will feel lost for most of the semester in a crazy way. I've never been in a class where I understood so very little about what was going on. If you're an econ person, this class will be a breeze for you, OTHERWISE IF YOU ARE NOT AN ECON MAJOR TAKE THIS CLASS CREDIT\/D. The exams and papers were not that difficult but you will feel lost in lecture. Not much work, 2 exams, section, and a midterm op-ed."
