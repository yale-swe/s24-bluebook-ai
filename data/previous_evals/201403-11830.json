   "comments": [
    "This class provides a great overview of gender, sexuality, and it's ties to different subfields of anthropology. It's a great intro class with an extremely manageable workload. The professor is great (and hilarious). If you need a social science credit or want to learn more about sex and gender in a low-pressure class, you should be taking this.",
    "This was a highly informative class and an excellent introduction to anthropology. The format of the class was great, the size was ideal, and the guest lecturers were all, for the most part, as interesting and engaging as the professor. Lectures were light and fun, yet I feel I learned a great deal from the class. Homework was very reasonable, mostly just readings and a few section assignments.",
    "Great course to learn more about the interesting topic of sex through all different anthropological lenses. If you're hoping to get a great overview of the subject, this is the course for you! If you'd prefer something more in-depth, it might not be. I would absolutely recommend this to a student hoping to take a course that is engaging, fun, interesting, and not horribly work heavy. Amazing social science credit with an amazing professor!",
    "I would recommend this class for another student even if they are not Anthro majors or WGSS majors. It is not designed to be mind-numbing or overly difficult. Professor Nakamura is chill. There are some interesting ideas that I had not been exposed to before as a PLSC major.",
    "I experienced pop quizzes and bonus points for my first time at Yale. The guest lectures were interesting, but Professor Nakamura's lectures were only fair. I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you like to take a stance or express an opinion in your papers, because Professor Nakamura has a very narrow idea of what she is looking for. Overall, not difficult, could have been much better.",
    "Not a very rigorous class, but definitely worth it even if you're mildly interested in anthropology. I'd say it is a gut, but is also worth considering as a fifth (or sixth) class.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend it. Only warning would be prepared to feel woefully under-qualified on section assignments--the assignments ask you to answer big questions briefly. But seriously, take it anyway. You learn a lot and there's really not a lot of work.",
    "As a survey course, it covered a huge range that generally touched on linguistic\/sociocultural\/biological approaches to the diversity in sex\/gender systems. Definitely opened my eyes to a whole lot, and I appreciated that the assignments made us think about the nuances of some really controversial things like sex verification in the Olympics\/analyzing gendered terms in conversations. At points it was frustratingly slow-going, like in discussion where we spent a lot of time on how to write a 5 paragraph essay (so maybe this would be better to take as a first semester freshman). But otherwise the 2 exams (midterm and final) are actually quite low-stress (but there's a fair amount of reading you have to keep up with each week - not piles of it but it can take some time depending on what the kind of reading it is) so you can actually enjoy the class and learn something new.",
    "ANTH 169 was a really fun course that covered a lot of SUPER interesting material! The readings were never too lengthy, but just do them or else you'll lose the really easy points from the pop quizzes and the lectures won't be quite as interesting. That being said, if you're taking the course cr\/d\/f, you could honestly get away with never doing a single reading and just paying attention in lecture (which isn't hard, lecture was fascinating and easy to keep your attention!!). I don't recommend that, because the readings weren't too difficult and were honestly pretty interesting even on their own. The guest lectures made this course different than other typical intro courses; it was fun to really delve into a somewhat obscure topic just for one class. Karen Nakamura did a great job of bringing up common themes through the vastly different topics we covered and overall on making the class really fun. This was my 5th class and wasn't too much of a burden but was really a ton of fun!! The midterm and final are a breeze if you do the readings and take good notes from lecture, and the few assignments were honestly fun to complete. I couldn't recommend this course enough!!",
    "I'd recommend it for a fun, easy SO credit. It was pretty lighthearted, and the topics were interesting. The only thing that was a little disappointing is that I wish we had treated the topics slightly more rigorously. It was pretty non-rigorous. Also, we hardly ever talked about the readings in class. It made it so that there were certain readings where I didn't know why they were included.",
    "ANTH 169 is a great class to take for your first semester. Although there is a lot of reading, the readings are really interesting. The guest lecturers were all great and the quizzes before each one really help your grade.",
    "Yes. If you are new to the field of anthropology, this is an easy and accessible intro course. A good fifth class.",
    "Yes because it's interesting and easy. It doesn't feel that organized so if that will bother you, find another class.",
    "This class was a survey of how we approach and view sex in all senses of the word and in different cultures. It was very interesting and fun with a relatively light workload, and Karen's lectures are funny and really taught me to look at sex and gender in a different way.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Yes you learn so much about sex (every meaning of the word) but this class really teaches you to think about EVERYTHING in a different way. You learn a whole lot about deconstructionist theory and queer theory and it is so mind-opening and you learn SOOOO much. MUST take for any major!",
    "ANTH169 is a great class. It is very enlightening and very low stress, allowing you to learn valuable information from the numerous topics covered without stressing about minute details. Professor Karen is one of the most amazing, intelligent, laid-back instructors at Yale and an extraordinary resource. I would go so far as to not only recommend ANTH169, but also all of Professor Karen's courses.",
    "Take it! I took this class as an into to Anthropology and I do not regret it one bit. I became much more involved and interested in the subject matter than I intended to, honestly. Not to mention I found myself much more well-versed in topics very relevant to society today and though this class wasn't the end all, be all it definitely peaked my curiosity and influenced me to take other classes like it and also with this professor.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to anthro in the context of sex. How does language, culture, and biology affect the way we think about sex and gender and how do we define sex in these contexts? - that questions pretty much describes the class. It's fun and chill. You learn a lot and the exams are easy.",
    "Fun class, interesting material. Not too tough but definitely not easy.",
    "The readings can be a bit dull, but if you like anthro, take it. If you are an anthropology major and need intro courses this is a great one to take! Karen is awesome and super available if you don't understand a concept or need extra help on an assignment. You can't go wrong with a Nakamura course.",
    "AMAZING. Take this course. The workload is manageable, the subject is interesting, and Professor Nakamura is engaging. Excellent course.",
    "Easy A class, but you have to do all the annoying assignments and attend all of the classes. At least not too stressful."
