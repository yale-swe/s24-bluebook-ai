   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This course taught me so much, both about Nero and about myself. Wonderful course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I found the content interesting and the discussions engaging.",
    "The course does not require a lot of reading but is nevertheless an advanced course, for the expectation is that significant and mature ideas should be developing through class participation, presentations, and the final paper. I recommend this class to a student who is familiar with both Classics and Art Historical methods who is not in the least afraid to voice their opinion of speak in front of a group.",
    "The course provided an introduction to imperial art through the close study of Neronian art and architecture. The focus of the course was developing and producing a research paper based on the student's interest and practicing the presentation of that research."

   "comments": [
    "The course was a challenging yet fair introduction to what is expected out of an art historical graduate seminar. I learned a vast amount about a very focused historical period and this pointed analysis surely will help with research and writing going forward in the PhD.",
    "I now feel much more comfortable incorporating material evidence into my research. I feel that I have especially made progress in dealing with the confusing world of numismatics!"
