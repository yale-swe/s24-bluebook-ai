    "This class focuses on all things food related from how we get food to how we prepare it to how it affects our lives. Lots of snacks included such as seaweed, wacky cake, pretzels, fluffernutters and so on. All inspired by the entertaining readings.",
    "This class is awesome!!! Who doesn't love writing and reading about food? Professor Stuart is awesome -- so nice, accommodating, and very on top of everything. I will keep great memories of this class. (Also food tastings are a thing -- I think that speaks for itself)."
