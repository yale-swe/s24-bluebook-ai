    "For Question 13:The class is reading based which is great because the readings relevant and interesting but the Professor has so much experience from his own personal life that I was hoping he would bring that to class apart from the discussions he lead on the readings.The class would be better if he provided situations that he experienced and taught us how we should deal with such situations when facing issues about the society and the environment. Even though this is a foundation course and the aim is to have the students think about what the issues are, in the end you remain confused about what one should do. Maybe that was the point of the course, to provide so many circumstances that you realize all the things that you would not have when dealing with a situation. Nonetheless, even a little bit of building skills to address the issue would have made a huge difference.",
    "Question 11: There was often little opportunity to ask questions during the lecture portion, because Professor Dove would be looking only at his notes or the screen.",
    "There are lots of readings and discussions. A great class overall.",
    "Most of the class material was not relevant to what I am interested in pursuing outside of FES. I should have looked more closely at the course readings prior to enrolling in it, but course options were limited this term given the caps on so many courses and scheduling conflicts with courses I otherwise would have taken. I felt a bit cornered into this course, and found it mostly lacking. Professor Dove's facilitating was illuminating and helpful, but his lectures were mostly dry and simply recited in a monotone that was sometimes difficult to engage with.",
    "This class should be taken by every FES student. Its concepts apply to any type of research or management work- local or international. Although highly theoretical, I find myself thinking of this class a lot as it helps to explain why certain things happen the way they do.",
    "Dove has a very particular style (he speaks slowly and reads all of his lectures from printed notes), but if you can get into that it's a very good course. He also has a subtle and charming sense of humor which breaks things up considerably.",
    "Sarah Randle - I would have liked it if she would have allowed the weekly commentators to lead the discussion a bit more. Despite this she was very insightful.",
    "Course moved way too fast for my ability to really comprehend it all, but it was still a great course. A ton of work, the most of any class of mine this semester, but we also received feedback, so I felt like the learning process worked.",

I appreciated the variety of scholarship presented in the readings, as well as the variety of sources utilized for the lectures (video, email exchanges, readings, personal experiences).",
    "The readings were great. Dr. Dove has a lot of insight into anthropological research.",
    "Dr. Dove's lectures were excellent. The readings were almost entirely excellent and fascinating. For me, with some international development experience, this course wasn't so much of an eye-opener as an opportunity to articulate many of the ideas and feelings I'd had. By far the most intellectually stimulating and demanding course I took this semester: this is what I had hoped graduate school would be.",
    "The readings were fantastic. I'm incredibly glad that the assignments were the way they were: concise one-page analyses of three readings. I feel that these assignments pushed my analysis of the readings to a deeper level. They were incredibly hard but completely worthwhile.",
    "The cultural aspects of the environment was a revelation to me. This course also pushes students to think beyond the surface of the subject matter.",

   "comments": [
    "The Discussion section was too long (a bit more than an hour) and the diversity of the class makes it slightly chaotic because not everyone is on the same page. To address this, I would have preferred having smaller discussion groups that could discuss the readings weekly and then each group could present their ideas at the end of the classAlso, the class size was too big for the classroom so sometimes we had to sit by the window sill and that was uncomfortable",
    "I wish the lecture slides could be made available to students - sometimes Professor Dove would go through them too quickly for note-taking.The classroom was unacceptably overcrowded - people had to sit on the window ledges every time.",
    "1. Would be better if the lecture style is more dynamic;2. Smaller class size might help;3. More instructions for the discussion.",
    "- The nature of the lectures, which I found ineffective for my learning.- The course material should be more relevant to problems and their solutions.- The facilitation of the discussions were hit or miss.",
    "More one on one time with the professor. There were 15 min slots of office hours every week, and I often felt like I did not have time to explain or expand on material seen in class.",
    "Lectures were boring.",
    "I think the course is pretty solid the way it is.",
    "The theory was heavily in the readings and the method was heavily in class, and it would have been nice for a little more of a conceptual linkage to have been made between the two. Additionally, I found the firm division between lecture and seminar off-putting, because it barred engagement with the lecture while forcing it during seminar. I think a more integrated approach, where discussion is interwoven into the lecture and the discussion section draws on presentation would have better helped foster dialogue and allowed me to get more out of the lectures. Sometimes the discussions were like pulling teeth.",
    "I think we would have gotten more out of the class if Dr. Dove and the guest lecturers don't just read their notes and papers instead of lecturing.",
    "Too much reading. I mostly did all of the required readings, and it usually took me at least 1-1.5 days\/week, too much time considering all the other class I had to take. If it's not possible to pare down the reading requirements (or if the point is to learn to read this much) it would be great to have more discussion about how to accomplish this: tips, techniques, expectations, etc.The 25-30 page paper was a great way to develop some ideas, but after writing it I realized I don't really know how to write such a thing, and I wasn't able to find the support I wanted at FES. The instructor did give us some great tips and guides for writing the final, but a little more support would have been appreciated. Along these lines, the teacher's office hours would fill up very quickly - maybe making more designated time would appreciated.",
    "The class discussion could be further improved. While splitting the class into two sections did help, I still felt there were too many students within a discussion group. Perhaps further splitting would improve the flow of discussion, which never seemed to move past awkward. Keeping the same groups for longer but switching the TA\/professor leading the discussion (instead of mixing up group members multiple times) might also address this issue.",
    "While there were discussion sections after the lecture, it would have been nice to have discussions with the whole group rather than breaking up into two groups. I liked being able to hear everyone's input."

    "N\/A",

    "See above.",
    "Discussion groups were very effective.",
    "I didn't think the seminars worked very well. In fact, as the course went on, I found myself really looking forward to Dr. Dove's lectures and the readings, but in a small way dreading the seminars. This is because it felt like there were far too many people in the room, and it became clear we didn't really know how to run\/participate in such a discussion. We got sidetracked over and over, the leaders' questions sometimes prematurely cut off discussions, and we often argued over semantics. With as many people as we had in the class, this just didn't work that well. I realize there is an art to participating in a seminar, and maybe more time going over some strategies and ground rules would have been helpful. To be clear, this wasn't just an issue with this class: most of my seminars at FES this semester went the same way. The only ones that seemed to work were those with 4-5 students, as a brief sidetrack was affordable with that few people. I did think Sadie's leadership in the discussions was very beneficial: she is a great facilitator.",
    "The relationship was well thought out and obvious. My comments on question 17 address areas for improvement.",
    "It was effective. The discussion section could be improved with more guidance as to topics to be discussed.",
    "I thought the relationship between lectures and discussion was incredibly effective. It was important to be able to discuss the readings, especially since so many students had not been exposed to this type of class before. At the end of the semester we had discussion with the whole class and I really enjoyed it. I think that for the most part the smaller groups were better, but it might be interesting to have a couple of full-class discussions interspersed in the semester rather than just at the end of the semester."

I think she had a little bit of difficulty reading the room during our initial discussion sections. At the beginning of the course, she occasionally stymied discussion section in the way that she asked us to define terms. I think I know what she was going for - wanting us all to be on the same page and understand the concepts we were throwing around - but the way she went about it put people off, I think. Other than that, I think she was a great TA, and I very much enjoyed her lecture.",
    "Instructor: Sarah Priscilla Randle \u00a0Sayd was a great facilitator and really improved the discussions by keeping us on track and holding people accountable for their comments. While a little bit intimidated at first by how interactive she was in the discussions, I quickly realized how beneficial this was and admired her ability to facilitate. It was clear she knew what she was talking about and held people to the same high standard.While her presentation was fascinating, I am not a huge fan of reading from prepared notes. I think it somehow works really well for Dr. Dove, perhaps because of many years of refinement and practice, but for other presenters it gives a feeling a disconnection. Sayd is an interesting, charismatic speaker: she should use these abilities when she gives a presentation. Still, I got over this and immensly enjoyed and learned from her efforts.Sayd also gave great feedback on assignments.All in all, Sadie was an excellent TA and I really appreciate her help.",

    "If you're new to this subject like I was, the beginning of the course can be challenging to follow with the lingo but stick with it, ask questions and by the end of the course it all makes sense. Also, start the term paper early!",
    "Hardworking but it pays in the end.",
    "There are a lot of readings and many are dense. The course is good for your brain, and Dove is a good professor to become acquainted with if you are interested in the social aspects of environmental work, particularly in a foreign context. If you are not interested in development or indigenous peoples, you might want to look elsewhere, but even if you are not interested in working in that field or with agricultural communities, the larger ideas addressed in this course are beneficial in thinking about the unintended impacts decisions and programs can have, across sectors.",
    "start the final paper early.",
    "Start your finalproject early. Write about a limited topic. I chose too broad of a topic and ended up writing a long, somewhat shallow paper, just to cover the bases. In hindsight, I would have much preferred to go deeper and not cover as much.Figure out a way to get the readings done sooner. This might be standard graduate school stuff, but I didn't know how to read and comprehend things fast enough to feel like I had time for these readings and all my other class work.",
    "Deeply read all the readings as if you were writing a one-page analysis of the subject material.",
    "Do not procrastinate. Take notes, it helps in the end. Enjoy the ride.",
    "I think it's a great class. It will teach you to look back and question a lot of things that you have always taken as given. This course teaches you a thought process. Make sure that you give yourself time on the term paper."
