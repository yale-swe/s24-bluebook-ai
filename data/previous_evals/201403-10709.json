   "comments": [
    "I would recommend CHEM 560L to another student mainly because it provides a different kind of educational experience from most other classes. The challenging nature greatly encouraged cooperation and collaboration between students which I believe would be lost if the course was over simplified.",
    "This course is useful for experimentalists who need a good overview of the various laboratory techniques required in physical chemistry. It is recommended if you have the time to dedicate to the various modules. Some of the modules are more time consuming than others.",
    "It's a lab course. It's actually kind of fun, but there's a lot of work involved, even if you start early. Fortunately, there are five late days and several due dates are at the end of holiday breaks. I lost a lot of sleep to make the deadlines. It's a useful course, but I wish I'd picked up a little bit more."

   "comments": [
    "This class helped to reveal the sorts of techniques my future discipline\/profession might include. I believe that it did not necessarily contribution to my dissertation, but rather gave me a better idea of what sorts of dissertations I could potentially be writing.",
    "The course was a good overview of computer programming, electronics, spectroscopy, and vacuum technology. These are all necessary subjects for pursuit of research in any physical chemistry lab.",
    "I think that I will probably end up doing some programming--though likely not in Fortran. I will likely be doing some vacuum stuff, and probably also circuits. This course laid a foundation, but it's a foundation that needs a lot of bricks and cement to be a respectable structure. There will probably be a lot of questions about things I was *supposed* to learn\/remember from this class on the orals."
