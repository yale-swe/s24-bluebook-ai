   "comments": [
    "I definitely know a lot more about American Decorative Arts, which translates into an overall better understanding and appreciation of objects around me everyday in life!",
    "I can tell you this much: if you asked me to find a nice vase for you on ebay I'll find you a great deal. I also appreciate the world differently now: a chair isn't really a chair any more, I'm afraid.",
    "I learned about the many different trends in decorative arts, design, art education, consumer culture that worked to shape daily life in the 20th century in America.",
    "This class provided an excellent opportunity to engage with historical and material facts about objects--including their materiality, the condition of their making, and what they represent. The instructors encouraged close looking and connecting physical details to larger course themes.",
    "This class gave an overview of the design and objects of the 20th century in America.",
    "This course provided a fascinating and comprehensive overview of the history of craft and the decorative arts in twentieth-century America. The course focuses not on style but on the various social, cultural, political and academic forces that influence the designed objects that furnish our daily lives.",
    "I learned how to evaluate the craft and designed objects around me, as well as to think about American material culture in new ways. I finally understand how the Arts and Crafts movement really operated, and feel like I fully understand the forces shaping the thought behind designed objects.",
    "This is a class everyone should take. Whether you're an art history major looking to expand and apply high level theory to material culture, just want to learn about the world around you, this class will help you understand the material reality we live in every day.",
    "This course allowed me to learn about American Decorative Arts from the 20th century in more depth. It allowed me to view objects in a new light and also see where modern objects come from and where they draw on the past for inspiration. I also continued to develop my writing skills throughout the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a good overview of American decorative arts, but I wish it were better at tying themes together over time. Each lecture felt a little disjointed and the sheer number of names, places, workshops, objects, styles, and materials seemed overwhelming at times. Otherwise, the course projects were extremely fair and usually very engaging, and Professor Cooke and Sequoia are excellent instructors.",
    "this is an incredible course with an exciting syllabus, excellent professors, and engaging assignments.",
    "This course did a fantastic job of articulating main themes and elaborating them clearly throughout, as well as demonstrating their real appearance in the world through object studies. Overall, a really fantastic class--and both instructors worked well together, and brought different things to the table.",
    "Overall, I found it a bit challenging to keep up with this course having never had any experience with Decorative Arts. The class certainly goes very in depth into the material, which can make it hard to follow (and do well on exams) without prior knowledge of materials, production techniques, etc. I received good prep and feedback on my essays, which I appreciated, but I think I also would have benefitted from some sort of general essay lesson on how to write essays like the ones this class required (having never done anything like this before). However, the class was very interesting overall (though perhaps a bit dry at times) and Prof. Cooke and Sequoia were great instructors.",
    "It wasn't especially beneficial to have the perspective of two instructors working in tandem.",
    "This course is taught in a leminar style, which I thought was perfect for the material. We had object studies, lectures, and seminar styled discussions about readings. I thought it was great way to engage with the material.",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses. The class is swiftly-moving and well-structured, and the lectures are well-considered and well-delivered. The teaching is enthusiastic and sophisticated, and the readings are very interesting. I loved it.",
    "I think a weakness is the final essay, which was looking through a newspaper issue and analyzing it for designed object information. It was a confusing and frustrating assignment, although I was able to find decorative arts information. I really loved the 'leminar' format of the class, and was engaged the entire time. Professor Cooke and Sequoia teaching together was really great.",
    "The format was awesome, the material was incredible, the assignments were engaging, would not change a thing.",
    "This class was great because it combines a lecture and a seminar into one sitting. The first half of class was usually set up in a lecture format, with Professor Cooke or Sequoia lecturing about the particular topic of that week. Then, the second half of class would be in the seminar format, so students were able to bounce ideas off of one another and just discuss what was lectured about in class and also tie them into the particular readings which were assigned for that week."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes - if this is something that interests you! But this can be a pretty niche topic and there isn't much reason to take the class without having an interest in furniture, decorative objects, design, etc. to begin with",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants a challenging art history class that covers a lot of ground. You'd have to be enthusiastic about the subject, although it's not hard to get into it with professors like Ned and Sequoia.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Learning about material culture and methodologies over the course of the 20th century totally reshaped my historical notions of the time period. The readings in particular were substantive and enriching, and I felt that the way Professor Cooke and Sequoia Miller engaged with them in the class strengthened and challenged my ability to evaluate scholars' arguments. Further, between the gallery, the furniture study, and Professor Cooke's private collection, any student will have the amazing opportunity to actually engage with works of art in an exciting and hands on way that will totally transform both his or her perception of the piece and his or her thinking.",
    "definitely take this course. an exciting syllabus, excellent professors, and engaging assignments.",
    "Yes! Both Professor Cooke and Sequioa are both passionate and knowledgable, and pass that enthusiasm along to their students. An interesting way to study American culture through by considering the objects we engage with (but probably don't think about) everyday.",
    "100%... such a great way to engage with the material that will allow a person to think about the 20th century in a different than any other class",
    "Absolutely. If you're even a little interested in understanding what the objects around you say, and what broader cultural forced they embody, do it. The teaching is accessible to all levels of art history experience.",
    "I really would recommend the course! This course makes you think about art history in an entirely different way. The course has made me excited to go into a new building and look at the furniture and the decorative objects, and this course is just generally important for students to understand the material world we live in. I loved it!",
    "This class is a great class because it offers a different view regarding art history than one would get just studying traditional paintings or sculpture. It is a great, hands on course which allows students to engage with a different branch of art history."
