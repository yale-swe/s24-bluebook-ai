    "This is a great class for someone who is very interested in neuroscience\/psychology\/economics. I would recommend this class but would caution that this is really not an economics class - it's more of a neuroscience class. You learn how to write a scientific paper, how to read scientific papers critically, and how fMRI experiments are carried out.",
    "A lecture seminar. Would recommend for those looking for a class in an interesting new field.",
    "I would take this class if you're interested in neuroscience and economics! The papers can be hard to get through. Most of the time I didn't know what I was doing and I feel like that was with most of the people in the class, but I still got by. Grading was fair and easy. Workload was not that bad.",
    "I would recommend this class to an econ major thats interested in trying something completely different senior year. Ive been interested in cognitive science since freshman year, and this class provided me with a very thorough perspective on interesting and significant achievements in the field, and a clearer understanding of what fMRI can and cant do, an important skill in our day and age when it seems like a different study comes out every week. Its also quite a chill seminar with a reasonable workload and super helpful intermediate deadlines for the final paper. I loved the class and would definitely recommend it to a fellow student of any major.",
    "This is an excellent class if you're interested in the topic. As an econ major who has also taken some biomedical engineering for fun, this was my dream senior seminar. If you're not at all interested in the neuroimaging\/medical component, just in behavioral econ, then I would not recommend this class. Neuroeconomics papers are highly technical- interpreting the imaging and statistical data takes some work- and you're going to be reading several of these papers every week and writing reading responses on them. We did not read any pure behavioral economics papers, and even if they're added to the course, the focus will still be on medical imaging studies. If you like the topic, the class is amazing. Professor Levy is one of the most engaging instructors I've had. In addition to very helpful slides on difficult topics, she showed awesome videos on topics like brain lesion patients, Nobel-winning animal studies, and studies delivering small electric shocks to the brain. This was my favorite course this year.",
    "Solid class overall. Often more focused on neuroscience than Econ so make sure you're interested in that aspect",
    "Overall, this class was a little disappointing. The material was interesting and Prof. Levy was an excellent and patient instructor, but I feel that I didn't get as much out of this class as I could have with with some background in neuroscience. The economics covered in this seminar is extremely basic, especially for people with experience in behavioural economics or game theory. However, it was hard to really grasp the implications behind some of the studies with no background in neuroscience. I would recommend this course to somebody who has taken some PSYC classes who is also interested in economics.",
    "I was really surprised and delighted to see this course in the economics senior seminar offerings this semester, because it really captures an interdisciplinary attitude that I did not see reflected in most of the economics curriculum. If this course had been cross-listed with cognitive science, psychology, etc., I think it would have attracted an even more diverse group of students. Prof. Levy is an incredibly kind, caring, and intelligent professor who never hesitates to pause in the lecture to answer questions and explain basic neuroscience research concepts. Even though the seminar was lecture-driven, I really did learn a lot about how neuroeconomists conduct research and it was a great survey to the topics and questions that these researchers pursue. That said, I would have appreciated connecting what we learned in lectures and readings to more practical implications and how these findings would impact us in everyday life. The workload is extremely manageable: 7 weekly reading responses (5 count for a grade) that is usually pretty straightforward and comprehension-based, and a final page (max 12 pages) that is nicely broken up into a 1-pg research proposal and a 5-pg midterm draft throughout the semester. Consequentially, this was the only paper I wrote this semester that wasn't started the day before the deadline :) Overall, probably one of the most interesting and different economics senior seminars out there - it was so nice to get away from the typical atmosphere of the usual econ crowd."
