    "FREN 120 does its job very well - it builds on the french learned in first semester, and really solidifies the students understanding of the language. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in developing better speaking skills, and a better understanding of the language itself.",
    "Students from 110 with be familiar with it, as it is essentially a continuation of the French in Action series. Be prepared for weekly tests, videos, and written compositions.",
    "FREN 120 is essentially the same as 110 but with a greater focus on vocabulary than the prior semester. It is a necessary follow-up to 110 and basically continues exactly in the same format as 110. Your French will improve significantly by the end.",
    "French 120 is for students who want to continue FREN 110. We learn a lot of vocabulary and new grammar, but the weekly exams really help hone your skills. It is not too heavy on the workload and it really helps you learn french fast!",
    "Most likely another student would take this course to fufill a requirement. If not though, then yes I'd recommend the class. It's a lot of work, but every intro language class probably is.",
    "Fren 120 teaches students lots of useful material, but a second semester of french in action is almost painful to complete."
