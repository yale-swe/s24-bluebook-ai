    "Amazing class with an amazing professor. As an English major who signed up for the class without much background knowledge in African American poetry, I know I've learned a lot during the course of the semester about material that I would never have been exposed to otherwise. Prof. Stepto is extremely flexible with paper topics, and is very open to project ideas. This is perfect for seniors interested in writing a guided senior essay; you can shape your own topic in any way you want.",
    "This class is a true delight! One of Yale's many gems. Professor Stepto is perhaps the most kind-hearted, endearing teacher you will ever have. The syllabus is fantastic and you will be very swept up in the subject matter and nuances of the various poetic forms. Do not be reluctant if you have never studied poetry before! Professor Stepto makes the material very accessible and interpretation is not burdensome at all. The papers are completely up to you as well. After each class I left the building feeling just elated and deeply moved. The class was supplemented by art, music, biographies, current events, and much more. A fulfilling course in every sense of the word. Professor Stepto is absolute magic!",
    "African American Poetry is a lovely seminar. Class meetings are relaxed conversations about the weekly readings were are excellent and there are two 12-15 page papers throughout the semester that require a good deal of work. Professor Stepto was amazing. He is so kind and thoughtful and truly an expert in this field. He creates a calm classroom environment and I felt comfortable to share my ideas. Meeting with him one-on-one was fantastic. He takes such an interest in your paper and projects. One of the best professors I have had at Yale. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "A must take class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. Professor Stepto is an absolutely wonderful professor, kind and incredibly knowledgeable, and he also allows for a lot of creative flexibility in terms of both discussion and assignments. He will help nurture personal or esoteric interests. The poets you read are incredible, and you probably won't read most of them in any other class at Yale."
