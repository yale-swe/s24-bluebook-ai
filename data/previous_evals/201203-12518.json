   "comments": [
    "decent class.",
    "Nope.",
    "Definitely take it if you need an Econ credit. You won't find a better Econ lecturer at Yale than professor Jaynes.",
    "I would recommend it. It's interesting, not too hard, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Take poverty as a 5th or 6th class. Not much work involved. It is possible to get curved down though because the class is that easy.",
    "Pretty easy going econ class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is useful to address current issues of poverty in this country and it was interesting to try to think of how public policies might be modified to address these issues.",
    "If you need an easy 5th class, I would take it. If you really want to learn about poverty in America, I would probably not take it. I learned some things but not as much as I was expecting.",
    "This class gives you a good overview of poverty and inequality. It also goes in depth into the different forms of measuring poverty, the problems that arise between parties, and etc. It's a nice ECON class to take if you're looking to take a break from the macro\/micro ECON.",
    "Econ major, I know life is hard. You want this class to be your fifth class, the gut course. My friend, there are much better gut courses out there. You will wince when you go to class. Or sleep. Be warned, because the tests were easy (we covered little meaningful material), grading was arbitrary since they can't let everyone get an A. Got 2 points taken off? You get stuck with an A- or B+. So not that gutty. Stuff could be covered in less than half the time the professor takes now. He's a nice guy, but you won't learn much beyond stuff you could Wikipedia or read an article about.Non-econ majors, you will not learn anything and waste your time.When I say it's bad, I mean it. This is the most sarcastic, not nice eval I've ever written.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Sure, take it and do the debate if you'd rather not write a paper. Best decision of the semester for me was to do the debate.",
    "This is a good straightforward class on basic concepts of poverty and inequality, and debates about poverty in the US.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Great professor, interesting material, manageable workload.",
    "Take it! The workload is light. Lecture itself is basically a repeat of the notes the professor sends out the night before. The curve on the midterm was pretty hard since everyone did so well. I suggest doing the debate for the final instead of the paper. It was a great experience.",
    "I would be careful of recommending. Though it is a light workload, it may be hard to ascertain what your final grade in the class is.",
    "Good course, no section or psets or textbook so...",
    "Take it! It is easy and fun and the course material is actually interesting.",
    "We had one exam (which was basically the practice exam he posted online), a small quiz thing, and a final project. We also had two small assignments that took max an hour to do. In terms of workload, really relaxing, but the curve is probably awful.",
    "Easy gut.",
    "Introduction to the study of poverty in the US.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because you learn skills that are really valuable for real life, even if you don't plan to major in economics. You can easily adapt to the teaching style and the assignments are doable and fun.",
    "Interesting class, I would recommend this class.",
    "Not really. Didn't feel like it was an engaging class",
    "Take it if your interested in the syllabus."
