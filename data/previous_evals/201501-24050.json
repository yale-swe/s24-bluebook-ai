    "I loved this class! We tend to gloss over Native Americans in our history classes; even when they are discussed, it's in so little detail and with so many misconceptions, so even a class about Native American languages taught me so much about their cultures and ways of life. Doing a grammar sketch of one language was a fascinating task that allowed you to go in depth into a language you might never have heard of and that had aspects you didn't know were possible. The dialect aspect was also very interesting because it's something that affects all of us, and the dialectology project was a great experience to do. This class was part linguistics, part sociology, part history. Hannah Haynie is also wonderful. She's really smart, funny, and nice, and always willing to help you with something you don't understand. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in linguistics, sociology, Native Americans, race, WGSS, or just fascinating material."
