    "1. There were texts used in other related classes I found useful and ones mentioned in this class I wished had also been assigned.5. The instructor was wonderfully available and ready to engage on any subject of interest and concern.7. I wish the instructor had provided our written work back with comments and guidance, or engaged them as much as she did us as individuals.",
    "Susan Clark is an expert and loves teaching the policy sciences, which really helps the students learn the material. She absolutely loves answering questions and he field trips really help with understanding the policy sciences.",
    "Timeline and expectations need to be laid out more clearly at the beginning of the semester",
    "Question 1: Susan picks great readings, and is an exceptional writer, so we always benefit from reading her work. There are too many readings to fit into the time we have for this course, but fortunately, this semester she did not assign all of those readings. It would be nice to have required and recommended readings every week.Question 2: These concepts are difficult to grasp, and I feel like our class didn't ever get to the point where our discussions were as illuminating as they could have been. I think something that would have helped would have been to start the class with a guest lecture, followed by discussion, rather than the other way around which is usually how it happened.Question 3: The short answer assignments were not very helpful because we got no feedback on them, but they did force students to do the reading. The longer projects are always valuable, because the value of the class is being able to apply the concepts to a specific example, especially one from the student's past or current experience.Question 4: To do all the reading and really understand what is going on enough to be an active participant requires a significant amount of work.Question 6: I feel like there could have been a better structure to the class so we really knew what we were supposed to be learning each day. Susan tried to accomplish this with semi-regular updates on \"where we are and where we're going,\" but it was still vague.Question 7: Susan has unique insights that have taught me more than any other professor at Yale. She makes more time for students than any other professor and really involves herself in enhancing our learning experience. Jenn also devotes an enormous amount of time to helping students grasp difficult concepts, although she can sometimes be difficult to reach on email.Question 9: I participated in the field trip to Arizona. It went fairly smoothly, although understandably some things deviated from the schedule as weather and other factors caused cancellations. Perhaps if we had been able to decide earlier who was going to participate and who we should coordinate with or get in touch with, we could have had more people to interview. However, it was an extremely valuable experience. It was also a lot of work, and would have been nice to receive some sort of extra credit as recognition of the fact (perhaps by getting 4 credits for the class instead of 3, for example).Question 10: This is hands down the most valuable course at FES for students with interests similar to mine.",
    "I think the class should be divided into two class sessions because it is important to be exposed to the policy sciences material more than once a week. Having the class twice each week would allow students to engage the material more often.",
    "This course provides new skills in thinking more effectively and acting more responsibly in complex species and ecosystem management cases. The course presents conceptual tools to integrate, synthesize, and locate the best arenas for interventions that would facilitate problem-resolution.This can be best summarized with various quotes from the course's readings:\u0093Resource problems are not really environmental problems: They are human problems that we have created at many times and in many places, under a variety of political, social, and economic systems.\u0094 As such, it is important to understand that science alone will not prevent species extinctions and that we need to look at the \u0093human envelop around species recovery\u0094.What more can be said of a course taught by a scientist and an expert in endangered species that teaches us that if we truly want to be successful in species management, we need to take a hard look at the social and decision process context, in addition to the science of species recovery. This course provides the foundation of true problem solving orientation that FES needs."

   "comments": [
    "A syllabus would be nice for understanding and balancing expectations with other commitments, but that's a minor thing. Feedback on the writing assignments is where I would most want to see change. Writing is a much better tool for learning when it is engaged.",
    "Probably better to have two courses a week instead of one long class",
    "Susan's fall course, Foundations of Natural Resource Policy, should be a prerequisite. We spent too much time reviewing the policy sciences - those of us who had taken classes with Susan before wanted a faster pace.",
    "Prerequ for students who have taken a policy sciences course should be seriously considered for this courseConsider placing greater emphasis on readings (esp. Averting Distinction), by spacing them out more, having assignments for, and discussing more in depth these material - and less emph. on presentations and\/or papers",
    "Facilitation of discussion, which would be enhanced by having the guest lecturer speak first, or by having students engage in an interactive exercise or small-group discussion and then report findings to the larger group. This was tried twice this semester, with great success.",
    "The class would benefit by more practical applications of the policy sciences. Opening the field trip up to more students would be a start. Also, it would be helpful to have workshops on how to actually conduct workshops related to participatory problem orientation and problem solving.The organization and timing of the class presentations needs attention. The expectation are too high to try to fit 10 or so speakers into one class period. Spreading the presentations over 3 class periods would be helpful.",
    "The course felt a little repetitive in respect to the policy sciences framework. I understand that this framework provides the backbone of the course, but I wished there had been more case studies about various species conservation issues. I loved the black-footed ferret, tasmanian tiger, and ivory-billed woodpecker discussions, I just wanted more of them!",

I am really disappointed that after Steve Kellert leaves, Susan will be the only professor remaining that teaches interdisciplinary classes related to wildlife conservation. FES will be deficient in this area, and should really think about offering more classes and\/or hiring more professors."

    "Group seemed unnecessary based on the project, but it was interesting to learn more about other peoples' interests.",
    "This was my first real group work at FES, and it was much more difficult than I expected! There was a short deadline, which made coordinating schedules difficult, and I spent so much time with those group-mates in such a short time period that afterwards we were all behind on our other work and didn't see much of each other for the rest of the semester.
