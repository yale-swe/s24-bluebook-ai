   "comments": [
    "The class moves at a good pace, and there is a good balance of written homework, recordings, tests, and essays.",
    "If the teacher could spend more time focusing on grammar nuances and subtleties in meaning instead of trying to cram as many vocab words into us as possible, that would be great. Also more opportunities to work on conversational oral skills would be greatly beneficial.",
    "The strengths were that the professor was FANTASTIC. She was very enthusiastic and really made the course a lot of fun. The weaknesses were that the texts were kind of boring, and sometimes the exams felt like they tested unfair questions."

    "If you are continuing from the fall semester, you will probably be already used to the workload and pace. There are daily recordings and daily quizzes, written homework every week, and an essay every other week. We also had 3 tests, 2 presentations, and 1 skit. Learning formal vocabulary and cheng yu from wang laoshi's lessons will help improve your speaking and writing skills. Pay attention to grammar points discussed in class, and review the powerpoints for all the tests.",
    "Absolutely. is like a mother; she is very nice and loves teaching.",
    "YES! Take it for the professor for sure, and you'll definitely notice a tangible difference in your ability to speak, read, and write.",
    "Wang Laoshi is a very kind and helpful instructor. She created an engaging class environment that was enjoyable and instructive."
