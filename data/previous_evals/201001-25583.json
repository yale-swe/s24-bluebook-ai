    "Pretty much a review of grammar, with some finer points not taught in AP. I took this 2nd semester without taking 150, after taking AP the year before in high school. I was hoping to get more \"fluent\" but that didn't really happen. I'm better at writing though, and definitely know the grammar, so when I speak it's more grammatically correct but not any easier to come up with. Would recommend if you want to solidify your understanding of French grammar, but not if you want to become a better conversationalist.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this course unless you have to do it in order to continue French study. Only do it if you're willing to really put in the work. Otherwise take it credit D and assert yourself in class discussions to improve your French.",
    "recommend it, especially with diane charney.",
    "French is lots of work, but meh whatever.",
    "Great class, loved the books, movies, and professor! It was a really good look into what is real and what isn't with a slight focus on the arts. There is also a review of grammar."
