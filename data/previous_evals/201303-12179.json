    "I would recommend the course to any student of American history, mostly because the course proved so productive. I worked hard, but I made a lot of progress toward understanding the period of history, the historiography of that period, the discipline of history. I also made a lot of progress toward my reading for orals. I don't know how I could summarize it: I guess the word I used above, \"productive,\" captures my feeling well. So does \"enjoyable.\"",
    "A truly excellent class. The readings were great; the seminar was enjoyable and interesting; and Prof. Dubcovsky-Joseph was a pleasure to work with.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a fantastic course for anybody interested in researching and\/or teaching early American history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend HIST707 (and have already done so).",
    "Yes -- I learned more than I ever thought was possible in the course of a semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about early America."

    "I may decide to do my own work in the period as a result of this course. If I don't, the course has certainly introduced me to the questions I'll need to consider as I approach American history in any period.",

    "The books and the articles gave me a broad view of the literature on early America, which will be incredibly helpful when preparing for orals.",
    "Alejandra spoke quite often about subjects like syllabus creation, book writing and turning a dissertation into a book, and teaching. I found these brief discussions, and the Skype sessions with other professors, helpful in understanding the profession and the field. This course was helpful in helping me understand a chronological period that precedes my area of interest."
