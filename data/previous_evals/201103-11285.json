    "There was an overall lack of consistency with this course, at the level of the instructors and the TAs.Also it is important to note that some of the labs were very intense and required a lot of work and it was clear that other labs were not worth your time (i.e.: CBA). The Labs need significant work in terms of the expectations, proper instruction during the lab time to actually learn the technique, and how to apply the work to your papers. I firmly believe that the instructors had goals for having the labs, but since they were lead by the TAs the various take home messages were convoluted and unclear. For example, although I completed the causal loop diagram, I still have no idea how to correctly make one or how to apply the techniques. Instructors should be present at every lab, and this was made clear by the fact that the instructor led lab was the most effective (Policy Options).Also, I felt that the information provided to us that was \"sufficient\" to complete assignments was a bogus statement... you clearly had to go above and beyond to capture an accurate assessment of the system. The instructors had clear idea in mind of how the papers should turn out and it was not made clear till the last class how they actually wanted the paper to flow (ie: section one should have this... section four should include this... - examples include the clarification of outputs versus outcomes as well as the need for metrics).Better effort can be made to select readings, for example for the Hypoxia case, we should be reading the 2008 Action Plan not the 2007 SAB report that lead up to it.",
    "Most of the labs were horrendous. They were a miserable time sink that I took nothing valuable away from. The TAs were incredibly unhelpful and the Profs were glaringly ABSENT for all but Brad's lab. The \"systems analysis\" lab was particularly bad. If you want to teach us this software and these methods, then teach them. I mean, have a Professor at the front of the class going through the material and answering questions. Don't just drop a 20 page, 50+ step \"instruction manual\" on us for this incredibly complex software and stick us in a room with a TA that is either unwilling or unauthorized to answer basic questions. That's not learning, it's just annoying. And it takes away from time better spent on other assignments. Like the readings.",
    "Q 2&Q 7 are difficult to answer because it is a team-taught course. Brad Gentry and Shimi Anisfeld were fantastic, definitely rated 5 by me.Julie Zimmerman and Pete Raymond would get 1.5, maybe 2. They were not as good.",
    "In response to QUESTION 9:The labs were a complete waste of time except for the policy discussion and the lab led by Shimi on modeling. I am pretty sure most of the class still doesn't know how to do a causal loop diagram because handing students a 20 page manual and then making them sit there for 3 hours before the lab trying to figure out how a program works and then another 2 hours in the lab and then at least another 3 hours after the lab to finish the lab. If the goal of these labs were to give students real skills, it was a total failure. And while I thought the policy lab was one of the best ones, it made me think that these were the types of discussions we SHOULD have been having in the class. Although students said that the room size was a deterrent to classroom participation, I disagree. If students are expected to work in groups throughout the semester they should be given the opportunity to work on their ideas during class time and benefit from instructor feedback during classroom discussions. The lecture PowerPoints that only presented a small piece of the situation were a starting point, but I disagree with the instructors stating that if you wanted to you did not have to do any outside research for the papers. This was definitely not the case.",
    "Re: Question 7 (Instructor) - I especially liked Shimi and Brad as lecturers.Re: Labs. It would help if the activities fit into the allotted time and were easier to follow. The information wasn't useless, but it was frustrating to feel trapped and confused.",
    "The design of the lab work could be improved greatly, by having Professors in attendance, by giving students an opportunity to prepare for lab before they arrive, by encouraging greater interaction (rather than just working individually and asking the TA's questions as they arise), and by establishing more clearly how the labs relate back to the course material.",
    "I believe that unlike many of my classmates, I found the labs incredibly useful. I enjoyed learning new skills in each of the labs that we could apply to our case papers. However, I felt that the TA's were not effective leaders of the labs. The labs for which the professors were present were infinitely more useful than those only led by TA's. With that in mind, it might be worthwhile to only have four labs and have professors each attend their own lab. In particular, labs run by Ran Ran and Dania were particularly frustrating in that these TA's seemed unaware of what the learning goals of the labs were. Dania was also a source of frustration as I felt she treated me like an idiot by just telling me the answer rather than helping to clarify what the lab question was asking and allowing me to figure it out myself.",
    "This course has a lot of potential and has some strengths, namely:-breadth of information presented-types of water problems presented (not much repetitiveness)-context of policy and legal solutions-guest speakersThis course has more weaknesses or areas of opportunity than it does strengths, however. Some weaknesses are:-increidbly poor communication of expectations to students-variable quality of lecturers and material presented-problems or case studies taught in a vaccum without acknowledging ongoing or relevant work, in many cases-wildly inconsistent paper grading-time-consuming labs that are poorly planned and don't really illustrate concepts learned in class, with one exception (SimWatershed was well done)-for those of us with several years of experience as natural resource managers, this class does little to teach new skills or tools for dealing with the difficulties of the profession. Instead, it acknowledges the types of harried, assumption-laden decisions that environmental professionals will invariably have to make during their careers, and then makes some feigned gestures as to how to overcome these hurdles--without really offering any substantive advice or in-depth problem solving instruction. This class reinforces bad habits and really offered me nothing.",
    "question 9a: the labs for this class were designed as afterthoughts. they were utterly useless and poorly administered. the work they required of us was disproportionate with the amount of thought put into their design.question 6&7: it's not that the pace was too fast or too slow. it's that it wasn't paced at all. far too much material to be squashed into a semester. four case studies on hugely complex questions? it was an overview, a summary. far more effective would have been more time on each case with a much more serious effort by the instructors to describe concepts and talk them out with students.",
    "I wrote that there were \"too many\" labs and field trips for this course because most of the labs were far too technical and time-consuming for their practical value to the class' overall structure. Furthermore, most of the more technical ones were not only not that useful, but also not taught at all - for one lab involving a new piece of software, neither a professor nor a TA actually \"taught\" the material, instead handing us a 30-page VCR manual and expecting brilliant results.Some of the labs were indeed very useful though, particularly those consisting of a discussion of policy and economic options for water management.Finally, there was one cool (optional) field trip to the Hamden water plant. Kudos to Rich for organizing it. It would be great to have more field trips to bring home the fact water management is the about the least abstract environmental problem of all.",
    "In the end I was left questioning the usefulness of the papers we wrote, as all possible solutions we could come up with had already been implemented or were in the process. I understand the objective of the course was to make us think \"systemically\" of all the variables involved in solving environmental problems, but it would have been useful to receive more guidance on the solutions end in order to better prioritize them and analyze their feasibility.",
    "I did learn quite a bit from the lab assignments, and I think that it is valuable and important to learn the skills\/programs that the labs are geared towards teaching. Relative to the other classes that I took this semester, this course required quite a bit more work. Because the labs require 2 extra class hours every other week on top of papers, it would be more appropriate for the class to count for 4 credits instead of 3.I think that some of the TAs were responsive and helpful, but others were inflexible with their grading criteria (wrt labs) and not approachable or able to explain their criteria. There was not an adequate feedback process in place once we received our graded labs.I appreciated the flow of the papers. I think it is important to be able to ease into the group writing process, so starting and ending the semester with solo assignments seemed most appropriate. At the beginning of the semester, I was not quite clear on the requirements for the individual paper and think that more of the details (single v double spaced, that you definitely want a causal loop diagram and optimization matrix, etc) should be specified on the slides.I think the primary failure of the course results from bringing together a really dynamic group of people who are trying to challenge the way that environmental problems are approached, but confining the students to solve the problems within existing structures. Meaning, if there is never enough time to make fully informed decisions, never enough time to read and process all of the information, are we not just perpetuating misinformation and poor decision making processes? By conforming to the failures of an existing system, we are merely learning to cope with those failures rather than do something about them. How can we think outside the box while we are wrapped so tightly within it?",
    "The labs were poorly organized and not useful. The expectations for the group work projects were not clearly defined.",
    "I really liked this course. I thought the raw cases were a great, flexible way to discuss freshwater management, and I enjoyed having a group of professors teach it. I think it would have benefited from having more discussion -- maybe replace the labs with discussion sections? Or have each group present once, with discussion following? I know that many of the other students in the class were not as happy with the course format as me, and this made them less interested in discussion in the class.",
    "Integration of the disciplines worked well, but developing solutions to the problem needed more insight. Simply engineering based solutions are not likely to resolve the problems in many of the cases we are dealing with.",
    "The policy lab was one of the most enjoyable class sessions. I think it was useful that everyone had put some thought and preparation into how they might address the Murray Darling case prior to the lab. As a result, thediscussion was quite useful.Some of the class sessions probably delved into more detail on the biophysical aspects than were really useful in our casework.I did enjoy gaining practice on writing policy memos.",
    "The papers asked far too much for the amount of time we had. Answering the questions asked in any reasonable manner would take farrrrrr longer than the 2-3 weeks allotted (divided by 4 for the avg number of classes everyone takes makes it closer to half a week of dedicated time for each paper, which is ridiculous for such open-ended questions.)Narrow the scope of the papers considerably and the class would be better.",
    "I enjoyed the class very much.",
    "There are 4 different professors in this class, I would rate them as follows.Anisfeld HGentry HP+Raymond HP-Zimmerman HP",
    "I was very interested in the class when I looked as the syllabus but as the course went along it was not in accordance with my expectation. I had a hard time meeting the expectations of the instructors.",
    "#7: The quality of the teaching is very unbalance. Half the professors are clearly engaged while the other half are not.",
    "I really wish the professors allowed some flexibility in paper topics. I found being forced to write about the same topics as every other student in the class to be less ideal than allowing us to pursue our own interests."

    "Since it was my first semester at F&ES, Science to Solutions definitely introduced me to the different faculty members who are teaching other really interesting courses and working on really exciting research at the school. However, the course needs a tremendous amount of work. I think the case studies selected were very interesting, and I really enjoyed the concept of each professor presenting the case from their particular discipline.I also enjoyed the group work. This was really the only time I saw the interdisciplinary team work going on during the course. I worked on a team with students from a number of different backgrounds and found this to be the most beneficial aspect of the course. However, I think if you are going to have students work in teams then the feedback needs to be consistent from one project to the next. We were given very different critiques from each of the professors and it seems almost impossible to \"improve\" as you go on in the semester when there doesn't seem to be a great deal of objectivity from professors in their assessment of the papers.",

    "Quality of lecture; was hoping for more discussion, both while learning about the case and after writing our papers. Would have really enjoyed hearing what other students had decided and getting the chance to defend my choice- would have made for a much more lasting learning experience.Several of the labs did not contribute to course material. Would be helpful to publish the lab details the week prior, to expect students to do most of the work prior to the lab, so that labs can be more about discussion.",
    "1) Completerevision of the Labs2) Better selection of reading materials.3) Clarity on the overall message and intended outcomes -- more consistency is needed.",
    "the PPT could have been better organized and visualized.",
    "Organization. Structure. Clear expectations. Professors should actually know and understand the case studies. I asked a question about the NYC watershed and Pete answered it with an assertion of fact that was patently FALSE. That's unacceptable. Get it together.",
    "First, I would have at least one individual paper where students can choose a topic they are interested in, and then apply the solutions framework taught in class.Second, Pete and Julie's lectures need improvement.Lectures by Pete make no sense, and are painfully boring. Julie's are slightly elementary and somewhat patronizing.",
    "Selecting cases that will actually elicit a work product that requires students to learn and utilize skills they will be using when they get out of here in a year. Don't ask us to solve the Murry Darling Basin or Bangladesh water crises in a 10 page paper. You are asking for a bunch of bs regurgitation of what you gave us to read. how about some assignments that require us to write a memo on solving a more manageable water problem? Like the a discrete pollution issue in the New York City watershed, or one piece of the nps runoff affecting the water quality in the mississippi river, or chesapeake bay watershed. or water management strategies for a city impacted by water scarcity in florida\/alabama\/georgia. Seems like you could winnow down the assignments a lot better to give people something more practicle to tackle.",
    "See question 12.",
    "See notes above on the labs.It might be nice to focus on something closer to home (like LIS) instead of Mississippi. Mississippi is interesting but overlaps somewhat with MDB, which makes it a little (though not terribly) redundant.",
    "the labs. and the assignments- the feedback didn't seem consistent with the grading (ie. grading more harsh than comments on the papers).",
    "For any interdisciplinary course there will be a difficulty in combining very disparate subjects. This course could be greatly improved by clarifying expectations of students for papers. For example, Julie's explanation of good writing at the end of the course made it clear that both a causal loop diagram and additional research beyond papers provided are necessary for a good paper. Therefore, a CLD and additional research should be requirements for every paper, not only \"suggestions.\" Explanations about what makes a good paper in this class would be useful during the firstfew sessions of the class.",
    "I found it hard to justify going to class. Everything we needed to know was on the slides and in the reading. When I did go to class, it was so large and non-interactive that I often spaced out. I know part of this is my problem, but time at FES is valuable. My solution to this would be to make the classes more about discussion and interactivity, with a real eye to putting in mechanisms that force students to do reading ahead of time. I mean--there are four professors, and it seems like a waste of their time too to all be sitting there every class. Why not do more breaking off into groups? The best lab by far was the one based on discussion with Brad and the best class was the one where Brad was asking people questions. People were visibly more awake.",
    "Communication to students in terms of expectations was endlessly frustrating. The rules of the game changed from paper to paper and were NEVER articulated to students. The majority of the labs were poorly designed, contributed little to understanding the concepts discussed in lecture, and were very time consuming.I think the course would benefit from fewer case studies and more time spent on the tools\/skills discussed at the beginning of the semester for addressing environmental problems, especially the causal loop diagrams, charts, matrices, etc., that apparently are so critical for the papers throughout the class. These aren't necessarily intuitive and students need more opportunities to practice them before they can be applied. The labs tried to get at this idea, but didn't really succeed.",
    "The course needed a greater social science perspective. We treated all of the course's problems as primarily technical in nature, devoid of social context; yet, as Professor Dove and others impressed upon me, social\/political forces are often enormously important. For example, while we received extensive lectures about the biochemical causes of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, the destructive agricultural subsidies that cause the excess application of nutrients were merely mentioned. A strengthened social perspective would go a long way. Also, the course should be help in a different room - Burke did not prove conducive to engagement and participation.",
    "1.) Integrative, team-taught classes should have a different evaluation from than this one that's provided for other classes (ie, derived from this form, but with some different questions).2.) Leave Burke if you want to be more interactive with the class.3.) The nature of the problems we're tackling are hard to synthesize quickly in my case, and I think the nature of a responsible enviro. manager is such that they're going to be cautious before saying too much that is a result of synthesis. So I think a way to promote synthesis that leads to more interaction and decision-making oriented discussion would be to reduce cases to 3 and go more in depth, and have some lab sessions be discussion-oriented.4.) To expand on point 3, I think it might be worth considering having 3 cases only (I'd be hard pressed to choose which 3 but I'll go Bangladesh, Australia, and Mississippi if there aren't others within one or more instructors' sweet spot). This would allow for creating some additional class space (I assume) for discussion after material has been presented; for one more guest lecturer (who were all excellent) even if via satellite; and for more dedicated class time to speaking about report-writing framework and decision-making in general. Also, longer time on 3 cases would allow for tackling social\/historical\/cultural\/gov. institutional topics specific to a region that in some cases we didn't cover too much in reading or discussion.5.)To expand on point 3 in another direction, the lab load seemed heavy. I think if you want to keep the same weight for the labs overall, mixing in a few discussion oriented ones in which you have to prepare for a question in advance and grade is perhaps more participatory related could be ideal way of lightening the load and also promoting the synthesis of ideas and discussion that you want to see in class (if the lab is timed right to class discussion).6.) For the last class, I think that there was some criticism of the class in terms and cases and grading and all that which seemed especially prevalent from first years. I bring this up because I'm not a first year and I don't share that opinion. (And ultimately my own opinion is that their concerns are coming from other places.) But in part to address that criticism, and mostly because I think this is a class dominated by first years, I think it might be important to take a point in the course about half way or more through and discuss decision-making, case-writing and four-section format, etc. more generally again. It seems this is one of the few successful integrative classes right now so talking about decision-making within and beyond the topic of water makes it more broadly applicable to students (even though water is perfect conduit). Also, I think students can be confused about how the process of sounding definitive and making decisions can be vague, rushed, or uncertain in life, and still recommendations must be made. How to do this most responsibly, and how this aspect might sever as a basis for grading in the class (or whatever other criteria might be the case), would be useful to review somewhere in the middle of class, rather than at the very beginning and very end only.",
    "Cut a couple labs",
    "you have to decide whether this is a class for 1st years or not. if it is, then you need to make much more of a effort early on to introduce concepts around policy and policy writing. there needs to be much more discussion based learning here. people didn't do readings because classes were just exercises in being talked to, which was disappointing and frankly annoying when most people were really there to talk about these problems, to think about them creatively, to try ideas as a group. if integrative work is the point of this class, then there needs to be far more integrative planning among the instructors. get it together! how does it all fit? where's the passion? where's the problem solving? where's the notion that we're all this class because we WANT to be, that we want to discuss these concepts concretely. focus on two case studies--that way you don't have to constantly introduce new facts and we can get into the details much more effectively. granted there are lots of manifestations of water conflicts, etc. out there. but admit that even in four case studies we can't get to it all. plan collaborative classes, plan classes for discussion, plan classes that are not you talking at us.",
    "The theoretical framework in this class, although never explicitly mentioned or discussed, seems to fit into a very antiquated and obsolete system of thinking, in which professionals are expected to promote\/promulgate solutions based on the best science, with very little attention paid to the decisionmaking process, the dynamic of social values and interaction, and the necessities of problem-oriented contextualization. This class, to be useful at all, must be enhanced to go far beyond merely understanding biophysical systems and technological\/fiscal solutions, a la the policy sciences.The lectures in this class are very disjointed, and it is incredibly difficult for students to wrap their head around exactly what is going on the case studies. While real-world problems are obviously difficult to understand, the manner of disconnect in this class seems indicative of poor coordination amongst the professors.The lectures from Brad and Pete were very good, for the most part, although Brad should have spent more time looking at innovative policy options rather than rehash the basics of fiscal instruments.Structuring an entire class around learning material to complete onerous group projects is a terrible idea. It only leads to students dreading the class.A majority, but not all, of the labs were quite boring and consisted mostly of busywork, i.e., were not conducive at all to actually learning something new. They were also very poorly worded and difficult to understand.Most of the difficulties in this class did not stem from any sort of intellectual stimulation at all, but mostly from busy work, making sense out of the disorganized lectures, and drudging through remarkably boring readingsthat manage to completely drain any of the excitement from the case studies.",
    "Given that this class was team-taught by 4 professors of very different backgrounds, it's not surprising that it often felt like they each spoke their distinct language at us and expected the students to combine the pieces into something coherent. That is of course, part of the point of the class, because that's how the real world works, after all. But this system often meant it was completely unclear what the profs actually wanted from us in the numerous assignments, and clear that cohesion was not a priority for any of them.Furthermore, both Julie Zimmerman and Brad Gentry had unique and worthwhile perspectives to offer, but there was a bit of redundancy between the contributions of expertise from Pete Raymond and Shimi Anisfeld. Pete is a really interesting person to talk to one-on-one, but Shimi is by far the better teacher. I think cutting back to just 3 professors would alleviate a lot of my frustration described above.And finally, this class had absolutely no passion. Water is literally the most fundamental element of life on Earth, but you'd never know it from the chore it was to sit through this class every week. There's so much about water that MATTERS - infinite room to add guest speakers, personal stories in the assigned readings, histories of the cultural impacts of water-mgmt decisions, photographs like Rich's, etc, etc. to bring gravity to the class.",
    "The individual long essay at the end should be much shorter.",
    "Burke Hall is not conducive to class discussions. If the class is going to continue to take place in this venue, maybe make it more explicit that class discussion and participation is a part of the course\/grade\/etc. If we had more of an opportunity to discuss existing frameworks, problems, solutions, etc. as a group, I think it would be a more valuable experience for all.",

    "Some readings are getting outdated. The 4 assignments seem to open ended but at the end I realized that its hard to create a state of the art solution for each case study based on less than a month of exposure.",
    "The overall layout of the course itself I think can be improved. The current layout of surveying four different water problems didn't give me an opportunity to really delve deep into each presented problem. Rather, I had to quickly pick up information about each only to leave with a superficial understanding of all the different case studies. I think it might be more effective to tackle the question of \"How Should we Manage Water?\" if one case study is assigned to a group which they can wrestle with for the semester.",
    "The whole course needs improvement. It should be made more introductory for its namesake. The new students from diverse background should have good understanding of the materials and instructors should be considerate and not very strict.",
    "Overall, the best labs were the ones with discussion. For the lab learning to using the causal loop diagram software, it would have been better to have the software explained to use rather than sitting for 3 hours being frustrated by reading the instructions and it not working right. The first lab was also very frustrating as a non-scientist and lacked the direction needed for it to be a positive learning experience.It also would have been helpful to describe the expectations of the paper, similar to what was done in the last class early in the semester. Although creativity was encouraged when announcing the paper topics, in practice the paper required a strict framework with very specific information. The papers (other than the 1st one) seemed to be assessed on a inflexible rubric.",
    "I felt the labs were asking for a little too much on top of the other assignments. They were valuable but could have accomplished the same end goal within a shorter session."

    "I only took this course to fulfill the integrated framework requirement, and after asking around heard that it was the best one.(The others are rumored to be pretty bad)It was generally ok, but I'm not focused on water so I wasn't particularly motivated to dig into the case studies. Because it's such a basic introduction into science\/policy, I think it would be much more interesting if it either spans several environmental issues (water, forests, climate, etc) OR if it allows students to pick topics about water that they're specifically interested in.",
    "I don't think it is an easy task to put together an interdisciplinary course that brings together science, engineering, law and policy, and finance all in one semester. I think this course tries to achieve what all of the other FES courses should be doing by assembling groups of students together each from different disciplines to problem solve and develop innovative solutions. As a law student, I definitely saw the value in working with students with varying expertise. I probably learned more from my fellow classmates than I did from the entire course and for that I'm grateful that I took the course. I think the lectures were very well put together and definitelyshowed the professors put a high level of preparation into each of the courses. But, I think a lot more needs to be done on getting more student interaction. I find PowerPoint presentations can often deter discussion--especially in a dimly lit room on a Monday morning. Also--please do something about the labs! They were tedious and unhelpful for the most part. I would have liked to have another one or even two individual projects on case studies instead of attending those sessions in the evening.",

The science part is too wonky and the policy part fails to link the science. I think this class would benefit with some more statutory and regulatory policy infusion as part of the \"solutions\" aspect. And perhaps discuss some of the real world issues with implementing on the ground solutions. You picked some really big water problems and then said, solve these in 10 pages. I didn't get anything from that. I think you would offer students a lot more value if you took more management problems and asked us to simulate a problem that we might actually encounter as first or second year associates at a consulting firm or a government agency. don't ask us to solve the Bangladesh water crisis in 10 pages.",

It didn't feel quite cross-disciplinary, maybe: instead of blending the perspectives of the different professors, the class just sort of overlaid them. I can't quite articulate how to improve this; perhaps instead of each professor having one lecture day all to themselves, they could participate in each other's lectures, or co-lecture. Additionally, the lab work, especially the rather recipe-like water chemistry labs, could have been a lot more stimulating and useful.",

In the real world managers usually work at a variety of scales where as this class focused on some of the worlds most pressing environmental challenges -- not very practical or feasible to apply in a lot of small scale scenarios.Also, the lab should have included an actual water quality analysis.",

    "The course was overall what I expected although I do think the idealist in me thought that we would come to better solutions for each of the case studies. But I guess that was the goal of teaching the adaptive management introductory course so that these solutions can be monitored and improved upon in the future. I think the labs were presented in a way that we would be taking away real world skills from this course, and I definitely think the labs ended up not being what I expected.",

I feel that the course reinforced bad habits as a young environmental professional, and didn't really do much to provide solutions to these potential pitfalls as an environmental professional. Personally, I would like for the lecturers to assert themselves more or give more concrete examples of success stories.Letting students \"practice\" environmental management with incredibly complicated problems taught in a vaccum with little to no constructive feedback does us little good.",
    "Sort of. I gained the useful technical skills that I alluded to earlier, but I didn't quite feel as though I was on the cutting-edge of environmental problem-solving; in other words, I feel like I gained insight into how organizations deal with environmental problems now, but not how they'll be dealing with those problems ten years from now.",
    "no.",
    "This course did not an interdisciplinary framework for tackling ill structured problems. The only theoretical frameworks taught were causal loop diagrams and optimization matrices. These tools are very limited in their use. Causal loop diagrams simplify real world problems into simple biophysical objects to be manipulated through top-down policy mandates. They are not great for paying attention to dynamic structures, such as evolving social processes through time, or decisionmaking processes. Optimization matrices basically amount to saying that policy should be evaluated along different criteria, which is quite obvious. The criteria taught in this class to evaluate policy options are very simplistic. Students would get a much more in depth discussion of things like economic efficiency and equity from an introductory microeconomics class.",

You each end up writing a disjointed segment of an incoherent paper that few, if any members, feel comfortable writing about.",
    "The group work was great. The biggest advantage was that my co-members were all older and more experienced than me, and so had a better sense of how to write the group policy papers and devise creative solutions. Obtaining their perspective, and watching them work, really enhanced my ability to think of solutions and write reports, and I think my final paper reflects that. There were no disadvantages; I really loved it.",

I definitely sacrificed other coursework in order to meet the expectations of the assignment and the group. I realized through this process that I thrive in a lab environment where I can field questions and ideas and work through problems in a setting that is conducive to feedback, but also prefer to work independently.Group work is also especially challenging when the project or assignment is presented to the group , rather than designed by the group in the first place.",

Would have been nice to mix up groups; maybe just assign them next year, since there are so many first-years in the class anyway.
