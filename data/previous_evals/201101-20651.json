    "For any student interested in a transpacific class, this is the one.",
    "HIST 781 is course that tries to answer the question, What is transpacific history? You learn how transpacific history is differentiated from transatlantic history, an area of history that has been studied from myriad angles. Surprisingly, there is quite a bit of scholarship in transpacific history, and a variety of different questions that are involved with this field than in transatlantic history. Professor Yokota forces you to think upon the unique issues of ethnography, historicizing the period, physical conceptions of the area that arise in the Pacific field. The readings really highlighted the relevant issues for me each week, and the reading responses are good ways to work out the big questions. I would highly recommend this course, as Yokota is a wonderful professor to work with and have discussions with.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. I would suggest it to another student who I knew was the type who could really take the initiative to take something out of the class. Prof. Yokota is the type of professor who isn't going to hand out the information while you passively take notes. She had more questions of us than we had of her, which created a really stimulating environment. However, if you're the type of student who likes to sit back and passively receive the professor's pearls of wisdom, you would hate this class and Prof. Yokota's style."

   "comments": [
    "The course helped me crystallize some of my research interests and to see the region in a completely different light. It was a great class to take to put everything in perspective. One's own parochial research interests are really part of a huge field and should be viewed in light of the broad time frame and geographic scope of the Transpacific World.",
    "This course helped me perceive my dissertation topic in a larger, international context. I haven't yet gone over Prof. Yokota's comments on my final paper, so hopefully there will be more specific feedback that I can use as I revise."
