   "comments": [
    "Super interesting class, one of the best classes I've had at Yale. Had a nice mix of philosophy majors and also polisci\/epe majors. The class varied between the very theoretical (e.g. \"what is a lie?\") to the very practical (e.g. did Bill Clinton lie about his relationship w\/Monica Lewinsky?) I recommend this class very very highly.",
    "Amazing class, an introduction to the philosophy literature about lies deception and even self-deception. Also has a very fun applied component. Loved the class. Take it!",
    "Take this course--or any with Prof Mahon for that matter. Too bad he's leaving at the end of this year... Truly a wonderful professor covering genuinely interesting content.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student, even a student with relatively little background in philosophy proper. This class is in fact probably a good foray for non-philosophy student into upper level philosophy discussion - certainly the material is treated rigorously, but it is not as abstract as other possible subjects in philosophy and almost all of the work was written in English.",
    "A philosophical walk through the varied definitions and applications of lies and deception."
