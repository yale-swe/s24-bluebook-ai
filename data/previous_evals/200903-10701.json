    "Exhausting, a huge commitment of time, money and energy, but ultimately a very rewarding experience.",
    "Europe 1400 used the Yale, Metropolitan Museum, National Gallery and Philadelphia Museum collections to attempt to generate a sense of Europe's art at 1400. Because this period has been studied with less depth in the past, the course gave us the space to create new narratives and to think through the various iconographic and medial changes happening at this moment in time.",
    "Stand in front of art and talk about it--absolutely take the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student and I would characterize it as a very object\/image-based course in which students have the opportunity to truly look at objects and to formulate their own conclusions. Also, this course is fantastic because of the breadth of potential research topics it can possibly encompass."

   "comments": [
    "I didn't really, and this, I think, was the real weakness of the course. No one in the class, or in their first two years of coursework, really felt like this time period (1400) was very applicable to the work that they want to do. Either people want to work on topics that are much earlier or much later. So while good work was produced by this course, I am left asking, \"To what end?\"This is especially upsetting because Chris is the only person who can teach a Renaissance course right now. I think it is irresponsible, and quite frankly unfair, to not offer something more squarely within his own specialty and the interests of his students. This was even more upsetting because he will be teaching a nineteenth-century course next semester, so no student in the departments will have had access to a truly Renaissance course, either north or south of Alps.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of a period of fundamental importance to my area of interest. We looked closely at a great variety of artifacts and media and read some of the seminal critical works on the period. In the term paper I was able to do research on a topic closely related to my dissertation ideas.",
    "The course certainly deepened my knowledge of the discipline and instilled in me the vital importance of seeing objects in museums whenever possible, rather than in reproduction.",
    "The object which I wrote my term paper for is a very unique work and one which certainly requires further research. This topic may prove to be the beginning of further endeavors."
