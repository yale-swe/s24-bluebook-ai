   "comments": [
    "I absolutely recommend this class with Shankar.",
    "Phys 402 is statistical mechanics and E&M, both of which are thoroughly explored. You have to take this class if you're doing the non-intensive major, but I would encourage non-physics majors to take it as well. Sadly, I don't think Shankar is teaching it next year, which is a big disappointment.",
    "I'm not sure this class would be as good with a different professor but it is a good physics class",
    "Difficult and high effort, but doable. The more you put in, the more you'll get out.",
    "Physics 402 begins with Statistical Mechanics, which is not covered in any introductory physics courses. Stat Mech is basically a way of understanding the world around us using probability, and it gets pretty cool once you start understanding it. Then, the course covers Electrodynamics at a slightly deeper level than in 261 (more focus on potential diff eqs) and then ends with a section on tensors and how special relativity affects E&M. If you're a physics major, you obviously need to either take this or 420\/430. Otherwise, if you're interested in this stuff, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Comprehensive course taught on statistical mechanics and E&M.",
    "Shankar is not teaching this again, so I don't know how it's going to be next year, but overall an excellent course. Pretty easy compared to other 400-level physics courses. Problem sets are pretty average for a physics course (maybe 4-6 hours a week on average).",
    "You're taking it because you have to. So it's fine. I didn't enjoy it at all, but I'm not a fan of EM stuff anyways, so maybe that was why. Shankar is supposed to be awesome, but I didn't really feel like that was the case.",
    "Very good course to learn a lot of physics at a manageable pace!",
    "Phys 402 is awesome. I would definitely recommend it. It's all of the cool stuff you've always wanted to know about and can finally do in a quantitive comprehensive way!",
    "Yes, It was a fun and interesting class, but I may be biased because I really like electricity and magnetism.",
    "Take it if you are a phys major. Not too hard (compared to the 410\/440 classes)",
    "Shankar will not be teaching it again, but he did four lectures on stat mech, and the rest on E&M and relativistic electrodynamics. About 20 students in the class- some didn't go to lecture becasue he followed the book closely most of the time and even encouraged us to watch his lectures from PHYS260 if we needed a review. There was overlap with the intro physics courses, but it caused me to strongly understand the fundamental concepts, become much more comfortable with vector math and diff. eqns.",
    "Yes. Awesome class, even if you're not a Physics major the 401\/402 course sequence is great, especially with Shankar (you NEED to take a class with him - he is incredible!)"
