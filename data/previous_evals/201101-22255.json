    "Yes, a great class that helps build your conversational Hebrew skills. Very enjoyable and the professor is great. We had a lot of fun assignments like keeping a Hebrew blog. Overall, not a stressful class and you improve your Hebrew skills by the end of it. Highly recommended.",
    "A great course that helps you learn Hebrew as you will need to know it should you want to live in Israel.",
    "A great way to continue learning at an advanced level and maintain proficiency in Hebrew. Helps a lot with feeling more comfortable speaking and learning the vocabulary necessary to discuss every day topics in depth. And, of course, Shiri is wonderful.",
    "Good class, if you want more practice with conversation. You get to do some talking with people outside just Shiri and the other students, and it covers a range of vocab topics and activities, which was nice. I really liked it.",
    "This course was aimed at exposing students to a broad range of vocabulary pertinent to real life circumstances. I would recommend it because Shiri is a great instructor and the theoretical premise of the class is valuable, however more structured speaking opportunities and adjustment of quiz frequency and format would make the course more effective."
