   "comments": [
    "English121 with Professor Epstein was my favorite course this semester. I gained confidence in my writing which made me an exponentially better writer. By learning how to mimic the styles of other writers, I was able to find my voice.",
    "I greatly improved my writing throughout this class. I'm so glad that I took it, because I feel that I've grown into a much stronger writer and developed my own voice.",
    "This course definitely improved my writing abilities. After taking this course I am more engaged in the writing process. Professor Epstein puts good emphasis on reviewing basic writing skills that may seem to obvious to think about.",
    "I learned that writing is skill that can be improved, that there are specific rules that could greatly improve your writing. I also learned that writing could be fun.",
    "From this course I learned how to communicate scientific ideas more clearly and to consider the audience when deciding how to present information. I also improved my interviewing skills and got a better sense of how to decide which quotes to use to make a piece of writing more interesting.",
    "I gained \"basic writing skills\" which somehow seem to disappear in other Yale classes, I learned how to communicate something I know and understand to the general public, and I improved my observation skills.",
    "finally learned how to write! i had never really taken a real writing course at Yale, and this taught me how to actually do it. also neat to see how it implements itself into my everyday life in the way i view things. it's like i'm seeing the world in metaphors now.",
    "English 121 - Writing about Medicine and Public Health - helped me develop my writing, comprehension skills, and insights on medical journalism without the chase for sources. I learned a lot about writing with power and eliminating the unnecessary fluff (including adverbs, excessive description, etc) to make impact.",
    "Through the course I gained insight into how to write about science for both scientific and general audiences. While doing so I was able to improve my writing skills by paying attention to tone, word choice, clarity, and simplicity.",
    "This course helped me further develop my writing skills, especially as they relate to science and medicine. This was closer to journalism than any other courses I've taken.",
    "I truly learned how to simplify and refine my writing to be elegant yet concise especially in the medical field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness: Very disorganized and you never knew when assignments were due on Canvas. Didn't really feel like my writing improved. Felt like there was no structure to the course at all.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was Professor Epstein, she was always willing to meet with students outside of the classroom as well as connect students with her peers in the medical industry. Although the workload was higher in this class compared to my other classes, I feel that I learned immensely from taking the course.",
    "I'm very happy with how this course is run! We get to do a variety of interesting readings and writing exercises. We also went on field trips to a pathology lab, the British Art Museum, and the Cushing Brain Library. All of these were really fascinating.",
    "The greatest strength of the class was the amount of writing involved. By continually writing different styles of pieces throughout the semester, I felt my writing style was improving. At the same time, I was able to try many different voices and writing styles depending on the assignment. I think the greatest weakness of the course was a small deviation from the syllabus after spring break that made the course feel a little chaotic. However, I think that is to be expected after missing a class due to a snow day.",
    "This class teaches a wide range of writing, from fiction to nonfiction, from profiles to op-eds. It even includes a lesson on grant proposals! The variety helped me grow confident in every aspect of writing related to my future career in medicine.",
    "I liked that we got to try all types of medical writing (grant proposals, profiles, a screenplay, etc). This was fun and also helped me to understand how to present scientific information depending on the audience and intended outcomes of a piece. I also thought the work was well spaced out so that the course load never felt overwhelming. There were a couple of times when the expectations for assignments were vague, especially with the AIDS screenplay assignment. This made it difficult to decide how to approach the assignment at first.",
    "i really loved it!",
    "The strongest assets of this course include the Path Lab visit and in class interviews with people who have interacted with medicine first hand - e.g. a sickle cell patient, a former drug addict, and a doctor at the forefront of the aids epidemic. I also loved the visit to the British Art museum. Overall, the medicine in humanities approach to the course was rewarding. Additional strengths of the course include analyzing and implementing a variety of genres of writing - OpEd, Play, Feature, Profile, etc that help students develop an understanding of each. I also enjoyed developing a \"writer's toolbox\" or formula of sorts to streamline the writing process. This was done by close reading writing samples from established writers such as Oliver Sacks and Siddhartha Mukherjee, noting down signature techniques and strategies that those writers use. We were then able to emulate those styles in our own writing. The course could be improved by incorporating more current events (especially with the changing healthcare scene). Although, we touched on this during this semester as well.",
    "The instructor's expertise was invaluable for learning how to write professionally about this subject. I felt some of the readings were unnecessary, but there weren't many other weaknesses of the class."

   "comments": [
    "If you are an MCDB major looking for a writing credit, don't take this class. Med Schools will not care if you take this class. It won't look good or bad on your transcript. Take another ENGL121 class about law or religion or music, or take a history seminar (if you can get into one) with relatively low reading each week and expand your knowledge. Weakness of this course: Very disorganized and you never knew when assignments were due on Canvas. Didn't really feel like my writing improved. Felt like there was no structure to the course at all.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student. You do not have to be a STEM major nor do you have to be a pre-med student to enroll.",
    "Definitely take this class! Professor Epstein is fantastic. You get to read a variety of interesting works, interview patients and write about their stories, and even visit a path lab and art museum. This class was an incredible learning experience for me and I highly recommend it!",
    "This class is awesome and a lot of fun. There is more to writing about medicine than the science - this class introduced me to a whole new world about medical writing and its impact. I definitely felt that my writing improved over the course of the semester. There were a ton of interesting readings and cool trips to places like the brain library at the medical school.",
    "I'm so happy I took this course. Professor Epstein is such a creative professor who knows exactly how to encourage her students to be confident in their writing and try new skills. I learned to love writing through this course and felt that my writing improved more in this one semester than ever before.",
    "Any student who is interested in learning to write about any topic related to medicine should take this course. Pre-med students especially should take it, because many of the readings and assignments focus on humanizing patients and engaging with their experiences. Prof. Epstein is kind, thoughtful, and experienced, and provides insightful and supportive critiques and comments on all assignments. Student workshops also hep students polish their writing skills. This class is entertaining, engaging, and important for anyone planning on entering into a health profession.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot, the field trips and occasional guest speakers were very interesting, and I could see improvement in my writing over the course of the semester.",
    "YES! Professor Epstein is incredible! The readings are interesting, you get much better at writing through super low stress workshops, and it's really fun!",
    "YES! Randi is amazing, and so is this course. Even if you're not crazy about the medical field, this course will still be a joy to take. You learn so much, and you'll actually learn how to write as well.",
    "I would highly recommend ENGL 121 02 to another student interested in medicine or public health - whether they are on the premed track or not. It provides a great first-hand insight into the medical field and also helps students improve their writing habits and style.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, especially to those with an interest in science and public health. This course helps you improve your writing skills while teaching you how to apply them to scientific writing. Along the way you will also learn about various medical conditions and hone your skills as a scientific researcher.",
    "This course will help take your writing to a new level more than English 114 or 120. It helps you learn and experience real world writing and journalism as opposed to the academic essay which we're too familiar with.",
    "Highly recommend to take this class. Not easy by any means, but it's worth exploring this side of medicine, the writing that it generates, that is rare to find in other courses. So take it for the exposure and great medical writing, not the grade you'd want."
