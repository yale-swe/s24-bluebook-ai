   "comments": [
    "I would summarize History of Art 688 01 for a fellow student as a class on Soviet art production from the 1910s to the 1930s. The art movements we looked at included Suprematism, Constructivism, Productivism, and Stalinist Realism, focusing on photography, design, painting, film, and advertising. We also examined philosophical, economic, political, and social issues pertaining to art production. I would definitely recommend History of Art 688 01 to another student. Soviet Constructivism is a very difficult subject, and I think this was the best class I've had on it.",
    "I would recommend it because Zeidler is good at excavating the ideas and socio-politics behind the images--critical for this field.",
    "I would recommend this course. I took it knowing next to nothing about the subject, and even without a session that laid down elementary facts I feel I learned a ton about it in a profound way.",
    "Recommended, though - as I mentioned above - the course is still under development, and it shows - especially towards the second half. That being the case, I believe the seminar would benefit from attempts to cross-reference in a more inclusive way the genre it focuses on with concurrent artistic movements in Europe"
