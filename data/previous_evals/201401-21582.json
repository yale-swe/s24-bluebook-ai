    "This is an advanced and rigorous econometrics course that covers a lot of dry materials. Thankfully, it also teaches you some advanced STATA commands. Great course, required for the econ\/maths major. Definitely take with Yuichi, best and sweetest professor at Yale! Problem sets and exams are fair (open book), but people who take this class are econ\/math majors so be prepared for a bad curve.",
    "Take it if Professor Kitamura is teaching it! Professor Kitamura is the best professor at Yale, or maybe in the universe. He is a sweetheart who will teach you econometrics like nobody else. I don't know about other professors, but if Professor Kitamura is teaching anything else, I will take it. Not too stressful, manageable and you learn SO MUCH. Yuichi Kitamura is the GOD of economics.",
    "Yes - great class if Yuchi is teaching it",
    "Definitely, especially with Yuichi. He's a great teacher that makes you realize how cool econometrics can be. You learn so much theory in intermediate micro and macro and econ 136 essentially gives you the tools to begin testing out that theory. The course had rigorous elements, but generally it was focused on just making sure you were proficient in understanding what you were doing when you ran regressors and what certain numbers \"meant\". But yes, I definitely recommend it.",
    "As an Econs and Math major, this is the best class I've ever taken at Yale. I came out of 136 learning more than I had thought I would, and without a doubt, it is all thanks to Prof. Kitamura. If he teaches this class again next term, do yourself a favor and take it. Yes, the materials appear to be dry and boring at first, but with Prof. Kitamura's passion and great teaching style, Econometric easily became the most interesting class for me. In fact, I decided to change my future plan, and decided to apply to grad school after Yale just to learn Econometric. That, I believe, should sum up how awesome this class is!",
    "A bit boring at the beginning, gets more interesting later. Light workload, very reasonable tests and problem sets. Not enough math for my tastes, but there isn't really another option.",
    "Great course to learn linear regression, OLS, IV, and TSLS methods. Took after Stat 241\/242 sequence, so I was fairly well-prepared before this course, but I still got a lot out of it.",
    "You should only take this class if you know you want to major in Econ\/Math rather than regular Econ. It's a good class, but it can be a bit theoretical and there were times when I wanted a practical approach to the subject. That being said, the problem sets did allow us to sift through some data which was fun. The class is definitely not as scary as people make it out to be. Professor Kitamura is clear and makes the material more than manageable.",
    "Econ 136 gave a nice intuition and many examples for the processes and problems of econometrics.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone thinking about doing economics research--it's a very practical course, you pick up STATA along the way (which is super-useful for research), tests are open note, questions are fair. Maybe not the most interesting course, but it's a solid one nonetheless.",
    "This class is a continuation of Econ 135 in which you learn about OLS regression and IV estimation mainly. Very useful in understanding economic studies I had seen previously but never really understood. I would definitely recommend this class to an Econ \/ Applied Math major.",
    "Econ 136 is a great introduction to the major tools and some of the nuances of regression analysis. It had great continuity with Econ 135, and was in many senses even more exciting because it provides you with more powerful tools to do your own data analysis and a solid understanding of how and why these tools work. But I have to say that in my mind, the real secret of this course\u2019s success was in Yuichi Kitamura\u2019s excellent instruction. He\u2019s so much fun, and he really knows how to present the material in the most comprehensible and interesting way. Those 75 minute periods really flew by, and I\u2019m actually quite sad that it\u2019s over. For all these reasons, I would definitely recommend taking Econ 136. In general, the Econ 135-136 sequence is really worth it. There\u2019s a bit more math, but the payoff is much greater in my mind.",
    "take it with Yuichi",
    "It's a good class, challenging but not overwhelmingly so, and very well taught. I generally enjoyed the lectures.",
    "Take it if you have to. But also if you think you aren't satisfied with what you've learnt econometrically so far. You'll be surprised by how intuitive some of it is!"
