    "Absolutely do not take this class unless you have to (sorry if you do)! One of the worst classes I've ever taken at Yale. I was pulled in with the low workload and medium-ish class ratings, but don't be fooled! This material in this class isn't that hard. The psets aren't that hard. BUT the lectures are unbearably boring (I'm wasn't aware you can make something as cool as astrophysics boring, but it is apparently possible!) and the psets\/tests are graded so unfairly that it's not worth it. You'll end up feeling like you know the material because it's not that hard, but you'll still not do well because they are so picky and one little thing will prevent you from getting a good grade. Honestly, I studied a lot for this class and worked hard on the psets, but if you get one tiny thing off, she'll take off ALL the points on the problem. There are 4 problems in the test and 8ish on a problem set. It's almost impossible to do very well. Also, the professor seemed nice and approachable at first, but later became very unhelpful and even condescending. She is pretty detached from the students in the class. Professors should hold their students to a high standard, but they should not be condescending and should understand that this is new material for students and not everyone is an astrophysics major! Definitely would not recommend this to any other student. Do yourself a favor and take the other intro astro class. If you're a STEM major and think this will be a walk in the park, don't. The psets are quantitative, but the midterms\/finals are 70% qualitative. tldr: Don't take it.",
    "Don't take it with Sarbani. She's really nice but lectures are disorganized and she goes on tangents. She doesn't give formulas for exams, which I think for something like astrophysics is really unfair, and will take off small points just for wording errors even if you get the concepts right. Also takes off similar points on psets as well as for making small rounding errors in calculations, even when answers are correct. So many other QR or SC credits you can find that are easier than this, which makes sense since this is more of a class meant for people who are trying to explore Astrophysics as a potential major. Just in general, don't take a combined QR SC credit class if you want either of those.",
    "If I could offer any advice to a student at Yale, it would be to avoid taking this class. If you're looking to take it for your major, choose the other option. If you're taking it for a science credit, look elsewhere. This class was a poor introduction to stellar evolution, not engaging, and incredibly confusing even as a person with prior knowledge. The professor would often get confused at the board during lecture and would spend a lot of time going back and forth, and didn't seem to understand some of the material herself. Asking for help one-on-one was not helpful as she'd actually get frustrated with the student if they didn't immediately understand the material and kept asking questions. Many classes are challenging at Yale, but most turn out to be rewarding in some way. This class was far from rewarding and diminished my interest in astronomy as well as in the major. Logistically, midterms are graded out of 20 points (I did fine on these), but missing a few points here or there could really tank your grade. TA grades arbitrarily on these; did not understand that taking off even 1 or 2 points contributed much more than he thought to the overall score. Problem sets were much more difficult and time-consuming than midterms but were graded harshly. Tests involved mostly a ton of memorization. Overall, a class I would not recommend. Wish I would've skipped it because I had a genuine interest in astronomy before coming into it, and still do, but am now significantly discouraged.",
    "Only take the class if you need to for your major or are truly interested in the material. The class can be frustrating because lectures are not engaging and it's hard to prepare properly for the tests.",
    "It's a fun and easy science credit but you need to do a lot of review of the notes on your own.",
    "Take this class if you have a serious interest in Astronomy! I personally loved learning all of the topics, but even though I loved it, the class was still difficult because PSETs were graded really harshly, as well as tests. The class really should be easier, but because the grading is so strict, it's actually pretty difficult because the material is so dense. Basu isn't the greatest lecturer, but she's genuinely kind and will help you if you go to her office hours. If I could do this class again, I would say to take meticulous care with your psets because they're worth 40% (go see Basu if you need help). For the tests, you really just have to memorize the material because there is no multiple choice.",
    "You will learn about our solar system, and then more broadly about \"stars, and their evolution\". High mass stars. Low mass stars. Giant stars. Dwarf stars. Good intro class for someone with NO prior knowledge. Not much work but not super interesting",
    "Only take if you are or considering a ASTR major.",
    "Would recommend if you like physics and are a non major",
    "Interesting overview of exactly what the title of the course is. It was cool to see some of the basic mathematics behind processes that I knew about on a qualitative level, but don't worry too much about the math no calculus needed. Worry more about finding an effective way to retain the material, because there's a lot of it and it can get overwhelming come exam time if you let it.",
    "Yes, this is potentially a gut. 5 psets, 2 midterms, and a final. It's not worth it though. Professor Basu wrecked a majority of the class with her grading of the midterms and THIS CLASS IS NOT CURVED. Yes, it might not be a lot of work, but don't take a gamble with your GPA. There are better classes out there if you need a SC or a QR. Cool material if taught well.",
    "This was not a good course. Professor Basu is a good person, but the lectures were disorganized and hard to follow, and the expectations were very unclear. Many times I spent more time puzzling through what her cryptic slides meant and interpreting whether the fact that the textbook and lecture notes contradicted was important. Many times this translated into arbitrary grading on HW and Tests, that left many students who had studied or memorized the wrong definition (many students on the second tests lost points for learning the definition in the textbook for a problem versus learning the definition in the slides without being told which to study) losing 15% on a test. The material is interesting but the course needs to be formatted differently\/have a different professor in the future if it is to be taught again. I would say a recommendation that have is that I would not have minded doing more work, and having more material to learn, as long as the expectations were more clearly stated and we were given information we could easily study without puzzling over its truth value. The worst thing about a course in my opinion is when you don't know what material to study and you don't know what is true\/not true and you are worried every little note you make on a problem set might cost you the entire problem. In the future I would recommend a) making the lecture notes far more clear b) giving more difficult work so that the grading doesn't need to be as arbitrary and weird.",
    "This class had a lot of interesting material, which included information about the constituents of our solar system, techniques for analyzing stars and planets, and of course the different paths of stellar evolution. However, the lectures were incredibly dry and mostly pointless since all of the information could be found in her helpful slides and notes, as well as in the textbook. The problem sets were really easy and involved plugging numbers into equations from her notes, and occasionally some algebra. It takes a long time to study for the two midterms and the final, as there is a lot of information to memorize from her slides, but none of it is conceptually difficult, and the exams involved fact recall and easy computation. Her exams are made easier by the fact that there isnt a single question you absolutely have to answer, because the questions come in sets (Answer 4 of the following 7 questions.) But keep in mind that this class has no curve, so the margin for error is small. You needed an 88 for an A- and a 93 for an A. Take this class if you want to learn more about our Universe in a reasonably quantitative way and are willing to put in the hours to memorize every detail of her slides. Otherwise, there are much easier classes to take at Yale.",
    "ASTR 210 wasn't a terrible class, but you could do better. Definitely not the best intro to astronomy out there."
