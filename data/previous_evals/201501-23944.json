   "comments": [
    "A great interdisciplinary course! Don't let the title fool you, there is so much to discuss when it comes to gossip, a semester is barely enough to unpack this facet of human behavior. Literally everyone will find something that interests them in the course of this class and the most valuable part is the contributions from classmates. Also, you get to write papers that you actually find interesting!",
    "Incredible. A shame that it will probably never be taught again, as Carolee is teaching somewhere else. But it was a blast. I loved the readings and looked forward to every class. Everybody participated and actually made meaningful contributions. Gossip can be found everywhere, as its fundamental to human conversations and social groups. You learn to see it in a new way, both academically and personally. Even if you can't take this class, read some scholarly articles on gossip. Ugh but Carolee is great. Such a subtly incredible discussion leader and professor. She made sure the direction of the course was in accordance with our interests by occasionally asking for feedback in class (i.e. halfway through she asked what we liked the most so far and what areas from the syllabus we would still like to explore. A Lot of us said we were interested in reality TV and gossip so she changed to readings to that and brought in a reality TV producer.) Overall, the type of class that defies a liberal arts education: passionate professor, engaged students, and interesting material about a relevant topic.",
    "This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I absolutely loved it, and our class became really close, which made the class even better. The assignments and readings were fun, and I learned so much!",
    "Take it! Great class--will leave with new perspectives and a broader understanding on how we define gossip and why we gossip",
    "So much fun! A really interesting topic and an amazing discussion each week.",
    "Yes, definitely. I think it helped me gain a new perspective on a subject that is not commonly discussed academically. Also, I felt as if I could synthesise a lot of the material I had learnt in other classes with the underlying themes of the one.",
    "Gossip was the best class of the year for me. Carolee was great, the people in the class were great, and it was plain fun. One week the seminar was cancelled, and everyone was upset. Arguably the best class I will ever take at Yale.",
    "A cool concept but overall poorly executed. Focused entirely on celebrity gossip which was interesting at times but easily could've (and should've) been expanded to talk about other, broader or eve just different areas of gossip."
