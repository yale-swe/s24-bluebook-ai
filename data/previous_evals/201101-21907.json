   "comments": [
    "YES!!!TAKE IT! Great lecturer and not that much work.",
    "The classes are fun and interesting. Studying for the exams is really a huge pain, as it is all rote memorization and you're asking yourself the whole time what the point of this is. This was my first architecture\/art history class, and it was fine, so that should not be a concern. All in all, I'm glad I took this course, and it wasn't very much work at all (aside from the exams). The research paper wasn't even much work.",
    "I think every Yale student MUST take this course, if only to appreciate our own amazing (very Roman) campus even more and the incredibly pervasive influence Roman architecture has had on every aspect of our environment. Plus, who wouldn't want to spend 75 minutes twice a week looking at gorgeous slides of Rome?",
    "TAKE IT. DO IT. And be friends with Prof. Kleiner. Only bad thing is that it's at 9 in the morning.",
    "She made too many 'Bigger is Better' jokes. It made me uncomfortably. I wish she was more respectful and created less of a sexually hostile environment in the lecture hall.",
    "Take it if you haven't taken a history of art course. It has NO section and the work is interesting. The exams cover A LOT of material and requires memorization but I thought it was fun.",
    "Yes!!! You really don't need an art history background to take this course. Professor Kleiner makes the material very interesting. The only annoying thing is that there are so many images to memorize for each exam, and you have to memorize the specific date and location as well. So start early!",
    "A really interesting class. You don't need to do the reading so the only work is studying for the 2 non-cumulative tests and either an 8 page paper or you can design a roman city. Also, the lectures are onliine on open courses so it's okay if you don't want to go to 9am class",
    "Definitely recommend this class to anyone. The material is very interesting, although there is a lot of studying for the 2 midterms. Lots of preparation for the exams, and paper is required but otherwise the workload is quite moderate.",
    "requires alot of memorization for tests. take it if youre willing to keep up with the material throughout the year. if you fall behind youll be in trouble. paper is interesting to write if you havent written an art history paper before",
    "A solid course. If you'd need it for a major requirement or have any interest, I'd say go for. (though the virtual forum is rubbish, utter rubbish).",
    "A good course, but expect to do work. The midterms require a lot of memorization, so bear that in mind if you're not a fan of that. Overall, however, you'll learn a lot and the work is definitely worth it.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. It's pretty light with two tests and an essay\/project. Nothing about the material is too esoteric.",
    "One of the problems with Roman Architecture is that your one TA grades both of your exams and the paper, and in my experience the grading was not very fair across sections. I would not recommend the class simply because it was enjoyable at the beginning, but by the end I was really sick of Roman buildings.",
    "Great class. Must take at Yale.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. An awesome survey of architecture which is far more relevant than most people realize.",
    "It is a class that teaches you about ancient Roman architectural techniques, materials (still used in modern buildings) and styles. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in Roman history, modern Rome, or the buildings around them. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "This class is absolutely amazing; even though I'm a science major, I loved all of the material. Professor Kleiner actually makes history come alive, and I would recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested in Ancient Rome.The professor is personable and interesting and the material is very engaging, not to mention an amazing opportunity to design your own city at the end of the year.Just be sure to go to lectures!",
    "If a fellow student was interested in Roman history and architecture I would definitely recommend that they take this course. It was just so interesting and eye-opening, and it finally gave me the vocabulary to describe what I see in all these buildings around Yale. TAKE IT. Great stuff.",
    "Never in my life would I want to subject another human to how bad that class was.",
    "I would recommend this class only to those who are prepared for the memorization. It is definitely key to have a midterm study buddy. It is too hard otherwise. If you are ambivalent about the memorization aspect, just take it for Professor Kleiner.Also it is great for athletes and those in L1-L4 languages because the class meets so early (9AM).",
    "Take it, but don't make it a gut.",
    "Diana Kleiner is one of the most amazing lecturers at Yale and this class is a must if you are remotely interested in art history or architecture. The course is designed to make you succeed-- if you go to lecture and use the study tools that she gives online for the midterms you are set. Kleiner really knows her stuff and has amazing and gorgeous pictures from all of the trips she's taken. The workload isn't bad at all: 4 online forum posts, two midterms, and a project (paper or design your own city, which is a cool option). Seriously, the best way you'll learn the material is just by going to lecture (which is definitely worth doing, even at 9am)...just roll in, sip your willoughbys, and sit in a comfortable dark room as an expert in the field talks about some of the most incredible architecture ever made in human history.",
    "If you're at all interested in Roman architecture, at least shop this class -- you'll get a good idea of what it's like in the first few sessions, especially if you check out classesv2 for the course. If you've never taken a Roman history course before, this is a good introduction to it, and it will probably make you want to learn more about Roman history. The information would be enriched by knowing more about architecture or Roman history, so if you have no background in either of these topics, you might leave the class feeling like you need to learn more. (That's not the professor's fault, though -- she does give you the background you need even if you're totally new to the topic.)",
    "Great course if you can handle the early timeslot and you have an interest in ancient Rome.",
    "Roman Arch is very well-structured and well-organized course. If you want to do well, be prepared for LOTS of memorization. It's two memorization-intensive midterms, a final paper, and four posts in the online forums, which are not bad at all. If you're interested in architecture and can memorize many monuments and buildings, then take this.",
    "I would recommend the class. She makes a seemingly dry subject come alive and makes it interesting.",
    "Yes- great class, manageable workload, engaging instructors, interesting material.",
    "Yes. Take it",
    "Roman architecture is an amazing and engaging class. I loved taking the class and really enjoyed it. You learn a lot about Roman architecture - its styles, its trends, its evolution, and its influences. You will be able to identify the major Roman elements and develop a great appreciation for their architecture. After taking this class, you will walk around campus and be able to identify Roman elements all over the place. In addition to learning about architecture, you will learn about the history of the Roman empire and about the engineering techniques the Romans used to develop their masterpieces. You will also develop an immense respect and appreciation for the work of the Romans.Prof. Kleiner is an amazing lecturer. Her passion for Rome is contagious. Her choice of words is so sophisticated, her style of lecturing is so elegant, and her knowledge about Rome is absolutely impressive. She is also always willing to help you out and will definitely learn your name and treat you as a friend. She will also tell you about all the good gelatto places in Rome and where to eat and where not to eat when you travel to Italy. Taking this class will make you want to go to Rome so badly.Also, Prof. Kleiner provides you with so many learning tools. The web portal has flashcards to help you memorize the monuments, the monument list is very helpful. It all makes for a very dynamic and interactive learning.",
    "Roman architecture gives you a very solid grounding in Roman architecture. I recommend the class.",
    "If you have interest in archaeaology and ancient rome then definitely.",
    "Roman Architecture is a great course for art history majors or beginners with art history. It requires a lot of memorization but you learn a lot about architectural structures and architecture within a historical context. I would recommend this class because it is very interesting and visual.",
    "I would TOTALLY recommend this course. It is one of the best classes at Yale and you have to take it for the true Yalie experience. Professor Kleiner is incredible!",
    "Very interesting and easy work. Take it.",
    "The course is very interesting and informative. Be careful with the virtual section though! Sometimes I would forget about it or just have nothing to say. The paper topics are AWESOME - you can opt to design your own city. The professor has a great sense of humor and her love for Rome is contagious :) - by the end of semester I wanted to go and visit Italy so badly!!2 non-cumulative midterms, 1 paper (due a week before second midterm), no finalIt's vital that you have good visual memory",
    "Take it",
    "Take the class if you want a solid survey course. It's really worth it. The tests and projects are the most terrible, but make sure to study well ahead of time."
