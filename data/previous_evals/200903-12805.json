   "comments": [
    "Yes! French 130 is a great course -- you finally get to read books and watch actual films, and it's a breath of fresh after the drudgery of French-in-Action (if you took L1 and L2 at Yale). There are only 5 tests, and the final exam is reasonable. The workload isn't bad, and I think that this is the course where you actually begin to make practical progress with the French language.",
    "If you can take it pass\/fail and just want to improve your French or if you have to take it for the language requirement, do it. There is a lot of busy work, and many of the exercises are unhelpful and confusing. It's a lot of work for very little reward.",
    "Wonderful class. I would definitely recommend this class to any fellow student; my French improved tremendously.",
    "If you take L1 and L2 at Yale, you are at a disadvantage taking L3 the following semester. The slight majority of students in my L3 class were freshmen who had taken 4 or 6 years of French in middle\/high school and spoke, understood and read at a much higher level than those of us who started French at Yale. Also, a few people take French classes over the summer or go to France and come back ready for L5 but take L3 for the easy grade. Since there's no curve, this technically doesn't matter in terms of grading. But it is frustrating to be a true L3 student because you feel like you lag behind a bit. I would therefore recommend that if you've taken L1 and L2 at Yale, go to France over the summer or take higher levels of French somewhere else and then take L3 at Yale (or simply skip to L5 if you can avoid an everyday class commitment!)",
    "It was okay, i'm sure it could have been worse but other people in the same level seemed to have a more thorough idea of the material. The other teachers put more effort into preparing their students and helping them learn the language.",
    "It is HARD. The texts go quickly from childhood tales to existentialist works. The movies are very hard to comprehend. If you REALLY want to learn French, than it is an EXCELLENT way to learn quickly.IF YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO PASS A LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT, THIS IS A TIME INTENSIVE COURSE.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this, it's either because it's for a language req. or because you want to learn French. It's sometimes a frustrating amount of work and can be a lot, but you will come away with good speaking skills. The books and movies can feel very advanced for someone who's only taken French for one year though. Prof. Wing is GREAT!",
    "French 130 will help you catch up with grammar and speaking skills you may have missed in earlier French instruction. It's not always the most interesting class, but if you do the daily work your French will improve. Professor Wing clearly wants his students to do well, and he's good at transmitting concepts, but if you want to be pushed, you might consider picking a different professor."
