   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a class that works to teach you how to teach. I would recommend the class because I think it was a wonderful learning experience and ripe for growth.",
    "This course is an introduction to teaching at the university level, with demos and course shadowing to help you prepare in a real-life, hands-on setting. I would recommend this course (and particularly, the instructor) to others.",
    "ENGL 990 is the teaching practicum course in which second-year graduate students learn how to teach literature and writing to undergraduates. I would definitely recommend this course (especially to relevant individuals outside of English, such as students in Comp Lit or Medieval Studies) as a thorough introduction to teaching undergraduates at Yale.",
    "I think it's a useful place to start; the class allows one to get used to the idea of teaching before having to do it full time."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It's one of my first forays into teaching in a college classroom, so that was extremely important to my professional needs.",
    "The class was important in professionalizing as both a teacher and a teacher within the specifically Yale system. If I had my way, it would run concurrently with more actual teaching, as it would in, say, a student-teaching program for high school teacher certification. But that's a bigger-picture question for the department\/university.",
    "This course truly helped me grow into the teacher I am. While I am not very experienced at this stage in my career, I truly feel prepared and excited to teach in coming semesters. I was able to feel a difference in my confidence and teaching style by the end of the term, thanks to this course.",
    "By putting me in the position of the teacher rather than the student, this course forced me to approach a classroom setting in a different way. I became attuned to different parts of a discussion, not just what was being said, but by whom, how, and for how long. I became aware of just how difficult and nuanced the facilitation of classroom discussion can be, and I learned a whole variety of tools and tricks to use towards that end. I also learned to think about writing as a teacher, rather than just a practitioner; I learned new vocabulary and new techniques. This course deepened my professional toolkit by getting me to talk about what it is we do as scholars of literature in a different way.",
    "I hadn't thought much about teaching and I was scared of it, so this class helped."
