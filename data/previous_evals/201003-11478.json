    "Marx, Durkheim and Weber are clearly essential material for any Sociologist. It might have been nice to have some practical examples of contemporary papers written using the ideas of these thinkers, or to spend more time reflecting on how these ideas might inform our research. I wish as well that this course was part of a two course series with the second part being 20th century Sociological theory."
