   "comments": [
    "Barbara is crazy in the best of ways... she really cares about her classes and wants them to succeed. So, even if she appears intense, it's only because she wants everyone to do well.",
    "Spanish 130 is very much what one would expect from a language class that meets five days a week. If you need the credit, take it--you will definitely leave speaking with more fluency and knowing more grammar. Safille is a fantastic professor to have.",
    "Barbara Safille is a good, energetic professor. She really wants to make her students succeed. She has fun and enjoys teaching. The material for the class is whatevs. A lot of it was a review of earlier levels.",
    "Yes, really helps you improve conversationally.",
    "It's Spanish. Pretty much what you'd expect.",
    "This is a very good class. I would recommend taking it with Professor Safille. I learned a lot and I was able to speak much better by the end of the semester. Professor Safille is the best Spanish teacher I've ever had. She is a great person and a great teacher. She always tried to make her class more interesting.",
    "Barbara was a good professor to take the course with. She is loud and forceful, but she does help you learn spanish.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Spanish L3 may not sound the best course ever, as it meets everyday. This is a false impression. Barbara Safille is actually the best Professor at Yale. We had the best conversations in and out of the classroom. She really likes theater and is very theatrical during classes, so you never get bored and actually learn a lot. She cares so much about her students. It is just beautiful! Please, DO ALL THE HOMEWORK OVER THE WEEKEND. It will only take you 2 or 3 hours on Saturday and you can just sit on the classes during the week. The daily assignments are very easy, but too long. So, EVEN IF I DID NOT CONVINCE YOU TO TAKE THIS CLASS, TAKE IT FOR BARBARA. Again, she is the best.",
    "Professor Safille was great! Very engaging and really cared about her students. If you have the opportunity take it with her! It wasn't that much work either and we went through the grammar very thoroughly",
    "For me it was a very helpful review of grammar. I recommend it if you haven't spoken Spanish in a while and are looking for a place to get back in.",
    "Standard intermediate language course. Lots of grammar and writing."
