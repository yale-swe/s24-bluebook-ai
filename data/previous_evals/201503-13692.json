    "great class and its content; all of the professors were incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the material; interesting exposure to NH; appreciated the workload and thought all of the assignments contributed a great deal to my learning experience",
    "Not sure. The disorganized nature of the course makes it hard to know what you need to accomplish and understand in order to perform well. The papers offer lots of freedom yet the final seems ehhh.",
    "If you have no background in urban studies, prepare to do a lot of learning on your own. Lectures were disorganized, some readings were inaccessible. Still, if you put in enough effort and have plenty of initiative, you could learn a great deal.",
    "PLSC 279 is an interesting course about the complexities of an American city through the lens of New Haven. Much of the material covered, from gentrification, suburbanization & white flight, and urban policing, was enjoyable to learn about. What I didn't like as much was that the three professors often seemed to like to hear themselves talk more than they liked to just get to the point in lecture. Although this is just their teaching style, it's good to know going into this course that you will often zone out. Overall, it's a good class to take if you want a low-stress, PLSC course.",
    "yes. Cool topics, two essays, one final.",
    "Good, not great",
    "Its very disorganized, but on an interesting topic. I wouldn't dissuade someone from taking it.",
    "New Haven and the American City is on the lower end of workload, in terms of classes that I've taken, but it's middling in terms of classes that I enjoyed. There were many days where I sat in lecture wondering why am I here and why are there so few things worth taking notes on. I actually don't know who to blame. Elihu Rubin is by far the best lecturer of the three, but the other two aren't really bad either. (Douglas Rae is sometimes slowly-paced and drags and tells long stories, but since they are his personal experiences, it's okay.) Some of the guests were bad lecturers or only drove one point home repeatedly. The fact that TFs Marvin and Tasnim summarized the main points of the course into an hour and a half review session may be a problem. I learned some, and it was easy enough to never complain about the work, but it's not one of those classes that \"I would do all over again\". Going to lecture gets boring after a while, and it's so easy to not pay attention (especially if you take this with a friend or spend the whole time on your laptop). Also, you don't need the textbook. Paper 1 (Mapping Urban Change; 4 pages) felt like a chore. Paper 2 (6-8 pages on a new event\/project\/proposal\/policy of your choice) was more engaging. The final is easy.",
    "Take it",
    "The class has many interesting topics, but lacks continuity. With three professors, it is sometimes difficult to follow the material, which makes it somewhat difficult to study for the final. Overall, it was still an interesting class and I do not regret taking it.",
    "A very easy class full of athletes (including most of the football team). You don't really need to go to lecture or read anything. 2 papers and a very easy final. However, you do learn a lot about the history of NH and trends in urbanism in general. Overall, I'd take it again. Lots of learning for very minimal work, and if you get a good section leader it can be informative.",
    "Definitely. Great class.",
    "Interesting class that focuses on a wide variety of topics (city planning, housing, transportation, the trajectory of American Cities, policing, etc.) Can be somewhat disorganized\/redundant sometimes. Papers are interesting and fairly easy. A good fifth class, for sure.",
    "I loved this class!! I had never taken a class entirely focused on cities, and we learned so many nuances about America's most iconic landscapes. The beginning gave a lot of relevant history of New Haven, while the class went on to describe how cities have gone through various urban transitions. There were guest speakers throughout most of the second half of the course, which definitely made lecture feel disjointed and even pointless at times, but everyone was always interesting. The workload was low, the grading was ideal (two SHORT papers, a chill final, and section participation), the TF's were awesome, and overall it was my favorite Yale class so far! I would absolutely recommend this course---relaxing, informative, and I'm coming away with practical knowledge about cities that I would actually tell my friends about. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Great for a 5th class - 2 assignments and a final all semester. If you've never done urban studies, this might be a good intro as well (though always be wary of the New Haven class taught by three white men), but if you have done any urbanism, you probably won't learn much.",
    "You get out what you put in. You can get by with doing very little, or get a lot out of the class if you put in the work; really up to you. The class was more about New Haven than the American city in general, and more policy\/politics\/social justice focused (very little architecture or urban planning concepts). Provided a good perspective on New Haven.",
    "You can learn a lot about New Haven's history, which is really cool and valuable. However, unless something changes about the class's structure, I would not recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The material was interesting and pertinent, and the professors were great. The assignments were fair and fun, and the final allowed us to show what had learned in a rewarding way.",
    "A somewhat disorganized discussion of the development and decline of American cities. There are pockets of brilliance in this course, moments that change the way you see the city. Elihu Rubin's lectures among them. Otherwise, many lectures are disorganized and confusing.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student--it was interesting and not a lot of work. It is also a class you truly would not take anywhere but Yale. I think the class is an introduction in urban studies in the context of New Haven.",
    "It's interesting material, and the lectures are definitely engrossing, but the course tries to cover such a wide spectrum of issues that a lot of time you're left wishing that they had gone more for depth than breadth.",
    "If you're looking for an easy class, take it. If you're the kind that gets tired of all the political correctness and butt-hurt Yale kids that can't take facts without either being extremely offended or just simply denying reality, then don't take the course. If I had known all that would transpire at Yale during this semester and all the protests and the way students would react, I would never have even considered such a course. Two of the professors add basically nothing to the lecture and just reiterate pointless statements about topics no one cares about. Douglas Rae does a great job though, and it's a shame he's overshadowed by the other two.",
    "Very interesting class- completely worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class if you get the chance. It's super easy and super interesting. The lectures are short and fun, and it really makes you appreciate New Haven.",
    "I would recommend this course only for anyone looking for an *incredibly easy* fifth class. It requires almost no effort except for cursory lecture attendance (to know what we're talking about, since the syllabus is rarely completely accurate) and going to section. If you're looking to get anything out of one of your 36 Yale College classes, however, don't take it. It won't be worthwhile.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The professors are great people\/academics, but with the three of them together, there are too many cooks in the kitchen. The lectures didn't really have a clear progression and became repetitive. If you have ever taken over classes on urbanism or urban politics, much of the class will be stuff you already know. The reading is kind of heavy for this type of class - and you probably won't do most of it anyway. It's a gut -- if that's what you're looking for, then fine. But if not, look elsewhere.",
    "Yes! However, you need to be interested in Yale\/New Haven history\/architecture or NOT have taken an urban studies class before - the lectures are very broad and cover a lot of ground quickly. It's a wonderful fifth class - I started it credit\/d and converted to a letter grade. The first half of the semester had great lectures and projects - mostly New Haven\/Yale centered - and the second half featured some guest speakers and not-so-great lectures. However, you'll learn a lot about Yale and where New Haven is today, and the professors do a good job.",
    "This is an easy class with not too much work. The readings are manageable and the assignments are not very difficult. The course material is very easy to grasp and understand, so this class is for anyone. The material is very interesting and this is overall a good class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The course material is inherently relevant, but also fascinating. It was relaxed and lectures were enjoyable. But it also has changed the way that I see the city of New Haven - or any urban city for that matter - when simply walking down the street.",
    "New Haven and the American City is a very interesting course. I recommend it to students interested in sociology, political science, ethnicity race and migration, american studies, and architecture.",
    "Yes, this is a good class. Do go to lecture even if you do not take notes.",
    "Definitely take this class for a low-stress way to learn about something that is relevant to everybody!",
    "If interested in the forming of urban cities and policies surrounding them, take the course.",
    "Yes if you have any interest in how cities work in America.",
    "I would most certainly recommend!!",
    "Great way to learn about new haven",
    "Good class variety of topics that are pressing for modern cities.",
    "This is a great overview of the development of the \"American city\" as we know it today, by looking at various american cities and how they have changed from settlement to present day. While much of the focus is on New Haven as a template for how American cities developed over the years, New Haven is compared and contrasted to various cities throughout the course in an effort to show that cities developed at different paces with varying levels of success. I would suggest this class to anyone interested in city planning, issues of income inequality in urban america, architecture in american cities, or industrialization and american history. The workload is manageable and the material is very interesting.",
    "Kind of repetitive material. Not too difficult though",
    "This class was a great way to learn about the city we live in and the general concepts of urbanism that shape the spaces and communities in which so many of us live at home.",
    "Must take if your a poli sci major",
    "I would not recommend this class to other Yale College students, aside from perhaps people who have never taken an urban policy course before and have no intentions of exploring the field further. If the professors organize the course better next year, it could make for a perfectly adequate survey course. This year, however, the course was thoroughly disorganized, and I would not recommend it to anyone. What is more, as someone already familiar with urban policy and New Haven generally, I found the course relatively uninformative.",
    "Really interesting class. Not very much work. A great 5th class. Ideal for credit\/d.",
    "This is a great class with a light workload. While the readings can be long, they can often be skimmed, but lecture is difficult to make up since the online resources are disorganized or often omitted.",
    "Yes, good course overall, offers lens into New Haven which, especially with Rae, feels like a very personal experience.",
    "Fine class but definitely not one of my political science favorites.",
    "New Haven and the American City was surprisingly revelatory. The first few lectures didn't grab me, but by the end of the term I couldn't wait to attend lecture and section. Though the lectures were sometimes rushed or not as deep as I would've liked, the topics covered were varied and interesting, with something for everybody interested in politics, history, urban policy, or just the way in which people interact with one another when in close proximity. I loved the two assignments (tracing the development of a New Haven block from the Industrial Age to today and researching a current project in any city in America), finding it difficult to write everything I wanted to say in just a few pages. Most of the readings were great, with some fundamentally challenging my view of policing, homelessness, and equality. I loved this classnot only was it fun, challenging, and even emotional, it was also a wonderful introduction to urban studies that will shape my career choices.",
    "So much potential, but fell short",
    "Definitely take the course! It's a fun and interesting course that may be a nice break from the normal routine. It's great having 3 lecturers as well - it offers a change of pace.",
    "ARCH 385 is a class for people interested in the urban landscape. If you're not interested in this, take it anyways, because it gives invaluable information on the city Yale is in. It is an excellent course.",
    "The class is all over the place. Lecture was hit or miss and got progressively less cohesive. Still, readings were pretty good and could be a decent intro to urban politics.",
    "A fantastic course that leaves you with a great understanding of city planning and policies. New Haven is a learning resource that is underutilized by Yale students. The three lecturers are some of the best you will have at Yale and they bring in guests that cover important topics like networks of violence in cities, segregation, and public transportation in cities.",
    "You will definitely grow to love and appreciate the city of New Haven!",
    "A gut social science course. I did none of the readings and attended only 3\/4 of the lectures, but still did quite well in the course. That aside, the material is actually quite interesting. You not only look into the development of New Haven history but also the ways cities develop and many of the tactics they use in that development. The direction of the course can be confusing at times, but if you pay attention, they are some nice kernels of knowledge you can take away from it. If you can, get Carmen Lu as your TA. She mainly shows Youtube videos in section which mean you don't need to necessarily read the readings and that you actually get practical applications of the knowledge you learn in lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students since it offers basic insight into the workings of cities and is not overly difficult."
