   "comments": [
    "Fantastic exposure to Australia, its history, and its material culture!",
    "This course provides an excellent overview to a field that most art historians know almost nothing about. It is sensitive to the racial and colonial power dynamics of a complex region and ties this region into the larger art historical issues that students are engaged in. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, and I hope it is offered again. The course is about the art of Australia and New Zealand but reaches out to British, German, and American art. Plus it covers many media--metalwork, ceramics, architecture, etc. Plus each student takes a week's readings and conducts more research about the topic and gives a class presentation. It is a great opportunity to become more knowledgeable about a certain subtopic."

    "Contributed to my studies on the British empire",
    "Though the subject of the course is outside of my planned research, Professor Cooke did an excellent job shedding light on the larger theoretical issues that were raised in class. It provided a unique perspective through this theoretical attention on my planned dissertation.",
    "I have taken a number of European and American art history classes but never one about the art of Australia and New Zealand. Taking this class was very important to my knowledge and skill set. I appreciated being able to make connections to events and art movements in other countries through the lens of Australia and New Zealand."
