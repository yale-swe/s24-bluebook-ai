   "comments": [
    "This class is wonderful. I learned how to write history, how to think about history, and how politics evolved in the United States.",
    "a better understanding of liberalism and conservatism and their influences on modern US politics.",
    "I definitely got a solid survey of American political history since the New Deal. The course puts a lot in perspective, does a good job of addressing political developments from both above and below and puts intellectuals in conversation with one another in a useful manner. I gained research skills, and a keener eye into where we are today and how we got here (politically, in America).",
    "I actually learned about Conservatism and Liberalism rather than just token criticisms of each. The 1950s readings were awesome. Also I learned to do some archival research at Yale and how to navigate the resources we have which will be super helpful for the senior thesis. This class carried another level of significance due to the backdrop of the Trump election",
    "-A sense of the broad changes and continuities in American politics during the 20th century. Very useful.",
    "I learned about the different definitions of conservatism and liberalism throughout 20th century American political history. Most valuable was my use of the Yale archives for research.",
    "-an ability to view current political developments in the deep context of a century's worth of electoral struggle, ideological evolution, and cultural shift -a critical eye to cast upon the \"traditional narratives\" of the US political tradition -the chance to dive deep into a single fascinating topic\/period of US political history. Using the archive was such a pleasure!",
    "I learned to think about the ways political thoughts are connected over many different decades. This class helped me understand our current political moment by rooting its themes in history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths: 1. Professor Gage is wonderful and helpful 2. Justin Randolph is wonderful and helpful. 3. The political discussions are interesting. 4. All students care about the material. The weaknesses 1. There aren't enough conservatives at Yale (were there any in the class?) so sometimes the discussion was fairly left-leaning.",
    "I think the course itself was great, and any weaknesses are not too substantial. That being said, each week felt isolated from the previous and following weeks. Despite that the weeks were chronologically ordered, there wasn't a strong sense of continuity which made it hard for me to place everything in some sort of time line. That being said, I'm not sure if this timeline really exists, and if there was one in the class it might have been forced and more confusing and misleading than anything else. I found the paper to be one of the more rewarding academic exercises that I've engaged in my time at Yale, and the key really is to find something one's passionate aboutwhich I did!",
    "I appreciated many of the primary texts we read for the course. Some truly changed the way I think about American political history and contemporary issues and their origins\/the conversations around them (\"What's new vs. what isn't vs. what has changed). I wish discussion felt more organic. Professor Gage would often call on a bunch of people in a row who would proceed to make various points not based off one another. I would have appreciated if people could just respond to the points of others and build off of them more frequently.",
    "Excellent class!",
    "Strengths: fascinating readings, loved the paper draft and workshop process-- I'm a senior history major and have taken a lot of seminars, and have never done that in any other class. It was fun to read classmates' papers and critiquing theirs helped me think critically about my own, too. Discussions were usually good. Weaknesses: reading could have been lightened, but I appreciated the diversity of sources each week. Seminars where the week's reading is from a single book usually feel flatter in my experience and this one did not have that issue. Generally good class discussions but sometimes they felt unstructured and dull.",
    "This course covers a large period of history, and I think I would have benefitted from more background reading about the historical context of the political actors we discussed. I think that the readings are good and interesting for the most part (except the first week, those were virtually unreadable). The hour-long draft discussion was really helpful, but I think one more meeting with a professor, either earlier or later in the process, would be useful. Otherwise, I thought this was a great course and am happy I took it.",
    "strengths: -Prof Gage herself. She has so much knowledge, passion, wit...and crucially, snark. Not enough professors intervene sufficiently to direct discussion, and Prof Gage does. -great mix of primary sources that give a flavor of the era, with interesting secondary source commentary weaknesses: -the course could do somewhat more to critically re-evaluate certain political eras. What I mean is that rather than saying \"Some people say that the Great Society was an era of -occasional lack of clarity on what actually *happened* during certain eras. For example, while we got a lot of material about what motivated Nixon's rise, or Reagan's era, I still left not quite understanding what legislative\/executive actions they took to concretely implement their visions. Potentially a quick summary of X laws, Y initiatives, and Z votes for each week could clarify the micro-level of each era's politics."

    "This is a course that every history student should take. It provides a nuanced explanation of political history, and will make you re-think your own political beliefs. The assignments are long and extremely difficult, but I am confident that you will enjoy the experience.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Professor Gage is a wonderful instructor and the readings are fascinating.",
    "Absolutely. Take this class if you can get in. You'll learn a lot about liberalism and conservatism in the modern US, and that in itself is incredibly rewarding and interestingI gained a different perspective on many issues. Just being in the room with Professor Gage and the other amazing students is a notable experience in its own right, however, and the final paper is really what you make of it. If you can find some really interesting primary resources, you can do a lot and really become an expert on that specific topic.",
    "Very solid course. You read a lot of core texts that you should read at some point anyway. Professor Gage is very knowledgeable and friendly. The political autobiography you write at the beginning of the year is very interesting, and the 15-20 page research paper at the end can be fun if you pick a good topic. There's plenty of reading, which is good, but you don't have to do all of it. I wish discussion felt more organic. Everyone always wanted to talk, so Professor Gage would call on a line of people, and then everyone would make unrelated points. For a 2 hour long seminar, I would have appreciated if the discussion built off of itself and felt less rigid-- but that might just depend on the class composition. If you like politics, or are interested in getting a background on US liberalism and conservatism, go for it. Not a mind blowing course, but worth taking.",
    "Yes this is a great class to understand the development of American political history since the Great Depression. You will not really debate issues, so if that's what you're looking for, go out for coffee with a Republican\/Democrat\/Trump supporter. This class is to understand the development of political intellectualism in the past 80 years and understand what these political movements are really saying.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Gage exudes professionalism as a professor, and she is a joy to hear speak. Ironically, one of the things I realized taking the course and learning about 20th century politicians was that Gage herself would make a great politician. This is good in the sense that she is always appropriate, on time, great at making you feel listened to, but virtually never reveals her own opinion on issues. She leads discussion like an omnipotent deity, controlling everything but revealing nothing. If you like professors with strong opinions, or professors who like to share opinions, Gage is not for you. She is a great historian, but you won't leave class shocked or awed by anything she says--again, not the worst thing ever, but still something to consider. The readings are important works of 20th century American politics--you'll discuss MLK \"Why We Can't Wait,\" Barry Goldwater, Galbraith, Gunnar Myrdal, New Left shit like The Port Huron Statement, among other things. You will be surprised learning about the development of the modern day Dems and Republicans, and probably reassured that the election of Trump isn't necessarily as crazy as we think. This was a particularly poignant class to take with that as the context. I would take. You will come away much smarter as a person, but it won't change your life.",
    "Worth the hype. Take it if you love politics! Definitely consider another course if you're less than enthusiastic about US politics, or if you lack basic background knowledge.",
    "Yes it really teaches you to think about political thought, and helps you understand what \"liberalism\" and \"conservatism is,\" separate from any political party."
