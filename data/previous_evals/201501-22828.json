    "Stochastic Processes is a wonderful follow-up from Introduction to Probability Theory. The class itself is a must-take for any student who enjoyed Math 241. We used Joe Chang's manuscript as the textbook, which I personally find to be clear and easy-to-follow; many disagree on this, finding his humor to be dry and his statements vague. The class difficulty can vary wildly, depending on the professor. This year, it was rather laid back and we meandered through the course, only reaching Martingales and Browning motion before calling it a semester. I would have liked if we talked about options pricing, but our slow pace prevented that from happening. Homework with Sahand was straightforward but enjoyable. It supplements the class notes rather well and fills in any knowledge gaps that we might have had concerning the lecture. In total we had 5 psets, 1 midterm, and 1 final\/project (you could choose either). The midterm was very easy, and the final project is completely open-ended.",
    "Take it if you have a good understanding of probability. It's a great course, and it's pretty challenging, but you'll learn a lot, and it's a really interesting field. Sahand is a great professor and extremely helpful and approachable.",
    "I would recommend this class! Just keep up, and practice problems regularly outside of the classroom.",
    "Great material, good course. It is a bit disorganized but not a ton of work.",
    "Stochastic processes is fun. It's what you took intro-stat and probability to prepare for. If you can, take the course.",
    "This class was a highly unusual experience. First off, the material is difficult. It can be tough to wrap your mind around some of the concepts that are taught, and most of them are taught at breakneck speed making it quite difficult to keep up. The problem sets were difficult and could take a very long time to do. The exams were similarly difficult. The office hours of the TA were held on Friday afternoons. The professor (Sahand) was very much on edge through much of the semester and often seemed like he really didn't want to be there teaching us (though, admittedly, this cleared up in the second half of the semester, where he proved to be quite a capable teacher). I think the material in this class and the textbook we were given for it are enough reason to take this class if you are even considering taking it, because a lot of the concepts taught are very cool and practically valuable.",
    "A bit more difficult than you would expect from a class with number. However, it was interesting to see all the applications of Markov chains and other concepts discussed in class. Taking it Cr\/D\/F definitely made it less stressful. Didn't have much homework at the beginning, but at the end had weekly problem sets."
