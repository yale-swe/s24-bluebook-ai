   "comments": [
    "A great lecture class on classic novels that is definitely fun. Not overly rigorous amounts of work, but you get through a ton of reading by the end!",
    "I would characterize this as a good course, but would only recommend the course to one who has an avid interest in learning and reading Dicken's novels.",
    "Take it! It's a lot to read of a single author, and it takes determination to stay on top of the reading, so make sure you are up for it. Dickens is great, especially Bleak House and Great Expectations.",
    "This class was one of my favorite lectures I have taken a Yale. I had never read any Dickens before, but I found the novels to be way more entertaining than I would have ever anticipated. Although the reading is substantial, the work is fairly regularly paced and the overall requirements (two 6-page papers, a midterm, and a final) are less than what you would find in some other English classes. Professor Carlisle is amazing- an expert in her field who cares about nothing more than that you learn to love Dickens as much as she does. Her knowledge of Dickens is staggering and combined with the opportunity to read several great novels, provides reason enough to take this class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will gain an appreciation for Dickens that you never thought you could have. I'm not an English major and this was my favorite class this semester. Be warned: you will be expected to read a lot every week. But I promise you it's worth it. Professor Carlisle is so sweet and so passionate about the subject, and you learn a lot about Victorian England along the way, which is a bonus. I thought I would be sick of Dickens by the end of the semester, but all I want to do is go read more of his literature. TAKE IT!",
    "If you have a liking for Victorian lit., take this class. The greatest part was section, so I don't know if it depends on the TA. Prof. Carlisle is a great Victorianist but the lecture format is rather cold. However, be prepared for harsh grading. On the other hand, the papers challenge you to think independently about Dickens' work and can be fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Carlisle's goal is to share her love of Dickens with the students, creating a very enjoyable class experience. While you will read a lot of Dickens, Professor Carlisle provides a variety of cultural and biographical perspectives on the novels so that the lectures and discussions never get stale.",
    "I would not. Only take this course if you are an english major. On the final, we had to address stylistic analysis (sentence structure --parataxis vs hypotaxis) which threw everyone for a loop. There are 2 papers, 1 midterm and a final. This is way too much for an english course."
