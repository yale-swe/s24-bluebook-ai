    "Relatively standard introduction to Trade and Development Econ. The first half of the class is lecture style and a bit dull. The second half of the course is focused on presentations from the students. Make sure you are comfortable in econometrics before taking it (most of the assignments require STATA).",
    "It is an excellent class - DEFINITELY take it if you're interested in Economics, Trade, or Development.",
    "The first half of the course is a summary of theories of trade. By the middle you work on replicating academic papers, and use this experience for your final project. An enjoyable course; you will get out of it what you put into it.",
    "midterm exercise took a ridiculous amount of time with little instruction--TA was helpful though.",
    "Yes",
    "Gives a great overview of the issues related to trade and development today. The first half of the course focuses on lectures and classical trade models and insights. Atkin does a good job covering this material.The second half, beginning with a \"midterm\" problem set that is really more of a gentle introduction (or refresher) to Stata and Econometrics. This half ends up focusing a lot on statistics with the aim of providing a survey of current research. Basically, the things that researchers care about, so beware if that's not your aim in Economics. This part of the course took the form of presentations by various students; so it wasn't as good as a professer's lecture but you certainly learn a lot by doing a presentationThe course ends in a paper which is a very rough version of the ones you've read. It's tough to come up with a topic, find the data, and run the relavent regression, but the writing itself is not so tough."
