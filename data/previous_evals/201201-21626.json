   "comments": [
    "Algorithms is a great course. The material is interesting, and Dan Spielman is a fantastic teacher. Coming into the course I was scared that if the material did not come naturally to me, I would feel like I was floundering, but he really explained how to approach the problems, so that the problem sets were very manageable.",
    "Definitely take it if you have a strong foundation in math and wanna learn more about algorithms, it'll definitely change the way you think. Prof. Spielman is just amazing, he prepares his lectures so well. The psets are challenging but not impossible. It's a great experience overall, definitely worth it.",
    "If you're good at math, take it! I liked it more than a lot of my math classes.Yeah just take it.",
    "Take it. It's amazing.",
    "I'd recommend it. You get a feel for the more mathy side of computer science, which is something those who've only programmed in the past might not appreciate about the discipline.",
    "I would definitely recommend CS365. I feel, however, that it's important to have a background in discrete math and proofs (CPSC 202 or MATH 244) because Professor Spielman likes to use a lot of mathematical notation when covering the material. The textbook was excellent and usually used less math than the professor in explaining the concepts.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Workload is relatively low, topics are incredibly interesting. Spielman is an amazing teacher, very clear and excited. If you're a CS major, this is a great elective choice. If you're not a CS major, don't worry! It is 100% approachable from a non-CS background and in fact it's probably better from a non-CS background because the material covered is very general (there is no actual \"coding\" in the class).",
    "This was my favorite class I've ever taken. Take it just for Spielman. He is so so smart and cares so much about the class. Problem sets and exams are all pretty fair.",
    "A very solid course on designing algorithms and proving that they work. I heard that this course was a lot of work, but it's not that much. Spielman is tremendous.",
    "Critical for anyone who wants to really dig into CS. Best class in the major in my opinion. Spielman actually can teach, which is dreadfully rare in the department.",
    "Well you have to, if you're a cs major. I can't say I would have if I wasn't even though I really like the prof",
    "Professor Spielman is a great professor. He is always energetic and in general explains things very clearly. It takes some stamina to last through a whole hour and fifteen minutes of proofs, but other than that, lectures were good. The problem sets covered interesting things and were definitely manageable with TA help (no student collaboration is allowed). The tests were hard, but the problem sets are worth 45% of the grade, and the class is curved.You probably have to take this class anyway, but it's definitely an interesting introduction to algorithms, whether you know stuff about algorithms or not.Overall, this class was a reasonable amount of work, but also a very solid class.",
    "CS 365 is a great course. Spielman is a very enthusiastic professor, usually clear, although the class moves quickly. It's probably helpful to have some background in math\/ proofs, although the official prereqs didn't help me that much. The problem sets can be pretty frustrating or challenging, although looking back, they were pretty interesting and fun.",
    "The class is invaluable for understanding algorithms and complexity theory etc. It's required for the major, but if you're planning on doing any sort of programming work you should probably take it.",
    "This course is required for the major, but it's also pretty enjoyable. Spielman does a great job to make learning these very essential algorithms fun and he's very clear.My main piece of advice is to start the problem sets as early as you can, because they're the kind of creative problems that having them in the back of your mind is really helpful.",
    "Yes, this is an excellent course! Problem sets are fun and you learn a great deal. For a core CS class, it is a reasonable amount of work. Read the problem sets early so you can think about problems when you have spare moments. Finding solutions is a process that can't really be rushed, and is far more gratifying when you have enough time to do it properly. The exams are very hard.",
    "You should take it - I mean CS majors have to, but for everyone else it's just really fun neat stuff.",
    "Take it. It's difficult, but you will learn a lot.",
    "The material is a lot of fun and really interesting. As someone with a lot of experience in proof writing and discrete math, I also felt like the course really didn't take that much time, but I was a bit of an outlier in that respect. Professor Spielman puts a lot of effort into this class. The problem sets are well designed (and vary from year to year, which shows his dedication.) His lectures are clear, and it's obvious that he puts a lot of thought into what material he wants to cover and how to present it. I only occasionally spoke to him outside of class, but he was always very helpful. The bottom line is that he is a very good instructor.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Dan really knows what he is doing with this class. You will learn a wide variety of standard algorithms. Pace is fairly reasonable - you will have one problem set every week, but it is a non-coding problem set. Best advice is to at least start thinking about them early, whether or not you actually write them out.I would recommend taking this class even if you aren't a cs major, as long as you like thinking about puzzles at all.",
    "Definitely take this. You're probably looking at it because you have to anyway but if you're a math\/amath major, engineering or something like it this is definitely something to do. There's no programming, just algorithms. It's a lot like Math 244 and it's more theoretical than other compsci classes. Psets are algorithm design and proofs on run time and that they work. Tests were similar. That said, watch out for time, the point distribution was a little weird and each true\/false question was 10% of the test grade on the midterm which was a little terrible since they were graded all or nothing, but the final was the same format with better time. The pset problems are much more difficult than the tests, but theyre fun to think about. I recommend reading them a few days before you want to work on them so you can think about them idly for a bit.",
    "Standard algorithms course. Professor Spielman is one of the better lecturers in computer science, but I personally also found the textbook explanations enormously useful and recommend skimming through them before class\/reading them if you have to miss class.The problem sets are difficult but helpful. Very mathematical, though, so if you're from a strong programming background but relatively weak with proofs, you might want to start early and spend extra time.For those of you considering taking this with little CS background but good math background: it should be okay, as long as you have CS 112 level background.",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in CS, take it. Even if you don't, take it. Also, don't worry about the CS 223 prereq (I took it concurrently). As long as you have a decent math background (some probability and stats, discrete math), you should be good to go.",
    "Great, well taught class. Spielman definitely knows his stuff and is a pretty engaging lecturer. The material is incredibly interesting and you can see a lot of the applications of the algorithms we cover to real life. Not a terribly difficult class, and if you have some experience with proofs you should be more than fine.",
    "Good introduction to algorithmic programming and coming up with algorithms. Lots of proofs, but none which are super-rigorous. If you have to choose between going to class or reading the textbook, read the textbook unless you're much better at absorbing in-class content, which goes very quickly. Professor Spielman is very clear, but it takes energy to keep up with his in-class proofs.",
    "Amazing class. must take for anyone that likes problem solving. You do not need the prereqs.",
    "Take it, even if you're not going into computer science. The math might be disorienting if you've had no exposure to discrete math proofs. I believe it will change the way you think.",
    "Definitely recommend! Even if you're not a CS major...",
    "If you're a CS major, you have to take this. Many people take it concurrently with 223 and seem to be fine. After you take both 323 and Algorithms, you'll know whether you're a math person or not -- you are a math person if you like Algorithms. I'm not a math person. I'm not good at writing proofs or inventing algorithms. I half think it is just a matter of intrinsic aptitude, that nothing can be done about. If you're like me, you'll just have to suffer through. Important advice: ask a TA for help on the problem sets (which you can't collaborate with other students on)! The TA might give you lots of help.",
    "Although this class seems like a lot less work than 323 (and it is), don't take it lightly. You should also understand that this class is, in essence, a math course and not a computer science course, and prepare accordingly. For non-comp sci majors, I hope you've had some math background.",
    "Highly, if they're looking to get a solid foundation in algorithms and algorithmic thinking. Be prepared to work hard though!!",
    "Interesting course, even if you're not a CS major. Not the easiest, though.",
    "Do it! I was really scared about this class and am not great at algorithms but it was really, really fun and I think about things differently now. I didn't enjoy it for a while, but it may have been one of the best classes I've taken here. Challenging, fun, perspective-changing--pretty much everything a course should be."
