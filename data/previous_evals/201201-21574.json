   "comments": [
    "If you take it, it will likely become your favorite course - so be warned :)",
    "If you guys changed the book I would, but if you didn't I wouldn't.",
    "I would definitely recommend Port 120 to another student. it's an amazing class. marta is the best!!",
    "Fun, good course in which you learn Portuguese. Keep up on your work. Do extra studying outside of class (especially if you start off behind everyone else). It will pay off.",
    "Wonderful way to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "I would recommend it, learn to speak portuguese.",
    "I personally love portuguese, think it's an absolutely beautiful language and thoroughly enjoy having Marta as a teacher. Having said that, the workload increases exponentially compared to L1. One expects to continue with the same methodology as during the first semester, but instead you start learning 3 verb tenses a week and having tests that expect you to learn not only grammar and vocabulary, but actually proper content about Brazil. Overall, I highly encourage anyone who took L1 to continue doing portuguese, but bare in mind that it stops being a complete gut class and you will need to study a bit more.",
    "I would really recommend taking this course. Not only do you need it in order to receive credit for PORT 110, but you learn more Portuguese and become more adept and fluent.",
    "Take it if you are interested in this romance language. A bit more work than last semester, but also more content in terms of history, culture, etc. A bit disorganized because there is a a lot jumping around, but you get used to it.",
    "Definitely. I think it is a great language to learn, especially with Brazil's promising future.",
    "Portuguese 120 is a solid introductory language class. There is a greater focus on conversation, and therefore much less written homework, than in other L2 languages such as French. This was made slightly difficult by the large size of our class, however. Portuguese is a fun language to learn, quick to pick up if you have studied other romance languages (esp Spanish).Try to get into Marta's section if you can. It's fun, and probably a bit less homework than the other ones. She's a native speaker, which is a plus. (The DUS Prof. Jackson is penalty a great teacher in other ways, but he has a strong American accent).TAKE PORTUGUESE, YOU KNOW YOU WANNA.",
    "Definitely. Its a great course",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it."
