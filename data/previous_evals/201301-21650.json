   "comments": [
    "Take this class! An interesting seminar based on political ecological thought, Amity introduces you to a new way of interpreting environmental problems and points of conflict. The structure is also really great, with weekly papers demanding students to really delve into the weekly readings but also allowing for the end-of-the-year project to be lighter in workload (you present a poster\u00e2\u0080\u0093no final paper).The readings are engaging without being too convoluted and you come out of the class with a whole new set of analytical tools.",
    "Should take it! Learn a lot of different perspectives.",
    "It's a great course for anyone interested in environmental issues and conservation. However, be aware that it is full of environmental studies majors. As a physics major, I felt little out of water.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "A great course! Really interesting overview of political ecology and not too much work. The only downside is that the topic can get a bit repetitive.",
    "absolutely. Doolittle makes the material very accessible.",
    "This is a really excellent class. I genuinely felt that it changed my worldview, and was really important to my education as an environmental studies major. It provides a really useful set of tools for considering all of the human aspects of environmental problems. It's an especially good choice if you are a junior thinking about writing an ethnographic style senior essay.Allof that said, be sure that you can handle the work. The readings are heavy each week, and the weekly reading responses are graded critically. In addition, the final poster project is deceptively time consuming, so start early. Think hard before taking this class on top of an already difficult schedule. You get out of this class what you put into it though, and personally I really enjoyed the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student, especially as a junior seminar for the major. Like I said, it really redefines the way you think by framing classic environmental topics in a new light.",
    "Political ecology gave me a great set of tools to approach environmental problems from angles that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Great class, but really a hardcore seminar. If the other students put nothing in, you'll get nothing out of it. Amity is great but takes a very hands off approach. Be prepared to read a lot of theory and discuss none of it, instead focusing on case studies. Generally in my case a strong class that enriched my thinking on and understanding of how to approach ecological problems.",
    "If you're an EVST major, go ahead and take it. Amity Doolittle is an excellent professor. Keep in mind, though, that in her picture of an ideal class, she does very little talking and leaves the bulk of the discussion up to the students. Every week focuses on a different environmental issue or mode of thinking, and the discussion is led by three or four other students. Everyone else prepares a reading response of artistic conceptual model beforehand. Overall, the workload is very minimal. In addition the the weekly assignments, there is a final project, in the form of a poster you create, with multiple partners if you wish. This can be quite fun, as you get to choose your topic, and anything related to the environment is fair game. How much you enjoy this class is very much a function of your fellow classmates, so observe people on the first day.",
    "Any student interested in potentially going into NGO work should definitely take this class. It is a bit broad in the topics it cover so potentially would be best for an underclassman not looking to delve deeply into specifics over the course of the semester, though the final project does allow it."
