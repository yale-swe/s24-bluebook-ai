    "Great course of application. Really ties into some abstract econ theories that you just see on paper.",
    "It's a really unique course at Yale - I've never actually had a class that teaches specific Excel techniques. Also, I was taking Math 250 at the same time and it was really helpful to see the overlap between the two - it definitely augmented my understanding of convex sets and other topics. Denardo's great, couldn't have taken it with a better professor. I took this as an Econ\/Math major and would say it was a good move.",
    "I believe this is the last time Denardo is teaching this class, so it's probably going to be very different next year.",
    "OPRS 235 is an introduction to the mathematics and techniques that underlie optimization that heavily slides towards the theoretical. I signed up for it hoping for more of a practical emphasis (i.e. how to use a quantitative framework to tackle business\/organizational problems). However, we spent at most 2 weeks on these fascinating applications, focusing the majority of our time on theory. The theory in the first half of the course, granted, was necessary to understand linear optimization. However, the second half of the course, which focused on the mathematics behind nonlinear optimization, was a random hodgepodge of subjects thrown at a class that had neither the ability nor the inclination to understand them. And regarding Eric: Eric is a very kind instructor who always takes the time to make himself available to students. However, he was not an effective instructor, often rambling. The class would have been very ill-equipped to do the homework if it wasn't for James, our amazing TA, who basically taught the course to us week after week.",
    "No. I took this class because I thought it was going to be all applications based and taught through examples. Most of the class was theory though which just was not what I was looking for."
