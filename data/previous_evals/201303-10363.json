   "comments": [
    "As the title indicates, this is a class entirely devoted to the writings of Hume. If you're interested in Hume (even if you don't know all that much) then take the course. If you find historical, early modern, or epistemological philosophy boring then do NOT take the course.That being said, it depends a bit on the Professor too, I'm sure.",
    "Yes. If you're interested in Hume. Also, taking this class at the same time as Kant really helped me to understand the pair of them better.",
    "This is a fantastic class. If you are serious about philosophy, or just interested in the most important philosopher to have writing in the English language, I can't recommend this enough. So much of philosophy is so thoroughly impacted by Hume. Prof. Winkler, if you haven't yet had him, is one of the best teachers you could ask for. It is worth taking a class with him just to get the chance to learn from him in the class room and in office hours. This class had a lot of reading, and it is very much worth doing as much of it as you possibly can.",
    "There probably isn't a more complete course on Hume anywhere else.",
    "PHIL 415 is a terrific class--especially if you have a particular interest in Hume! Professor Winkler is energetic in his teaching style and talented at leading discussion. He is also extremely thoughtful in all his comments on papers and helpful in one on one meetings. The course is a fair amount of work because you write a short response paper due in seminar each week in addition to two longer papers. However, I found that the response papers were extremely helpful and that I got more out of the class because of them. The short responses force you to prepare some ideas on the topic for that particular seminar and they also give you a starting place for your longer papers if you so choose. I highly recommend this course for anyone who is either a philosophy major or has taken a fair amount of philosophy!",
    "Great course for Hume's Treatise and Enquiry. Winkler is an excellent section leader, and the discussions were generally pretty engaging and interesting. Focus is on metaphysics and epistemology. Workload is very realistic."
