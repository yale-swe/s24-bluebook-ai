   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was prepared to learn about a vast array of issues surrounding agrarian societies.",
    "All three of the instructors of Agrarian Societies are obviously brilliant. Each of their lectures, on their own, were interesting and mind-opening combinations of history and theory, and definitely challenged me to think about new things. Discussion was frequently illuminating, though the constant shift of professors between sections was not a boon to synthesis. The readings were well-chosen for the most part, though the volume of reading could impair discussion when it was clear most people couldn't finish.This course would be truly great with the help of a TF or two.",
    "I would not recommend this course for being too large, too broad, and too unwieldy to meet the high aspirations of its syllabus.",
    "History 965 is not really a history course. It is a course about peasant societies and their environment approached from many directions. It has a wide breadth of readings and most students who take it are not history students. History students who take this class should be aware that discussions will not take a historical perspective and their interest in history will not be reciprocated by their classmates. If you like crossing disciplinary boundaries, this is a great course, rooted in very real contemporary problems.",
    "Way more work and way more chaotic than it seems at first. Really really hard to fit into an undergraduate schedule, because four hours of class at once and having to read at least once lengthy book per week (well enough to be prepared to lead the discussion) requires a lot of time investment. You have to be really self-motivated and interested in the material, and don't expect any personal attention. I would probably recommend it, but only to very specific, qualified undergraduates.",
    "Would recommend this course to any student interested in the topic of agrarian studies.",
    "This was a broad introduction to transformations in agrarian societies. It is quite broad, but the readings are very interesting. Lectures can be dull at times, but for the most part are very helpful and elucidate broader concepts and trends. Overall, I'd recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it but with a disclaimer about the basic survey style of the lecture component.",
    "This class is extraordinarily challenging but worth every minute.",
    "Yes, I already have. It's an amazing course.",
    "Would recommend - depending on class size, honestly. A good intro to important texts\/issues in the large field of agrarian studies - and at Yale, a must-take for anyone interested in the intersections of environmental history, rural sociology\/anthropology, and agriculture."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me new perspectives on history and contemporary life, and deepened my knowledge of Chinese history.",
    "This course helped me begin to understand some of the peculiarities of agrarian societies. I think as a member of an agrarian society I tend to take them for granted. But once we begin to identify them, it also becomes more clear what differentiates them from one another, and what possibilities they curtail.",
    "Very useful and applicable to the region I research on.",
    "I currently work on topics related to Asian societies. This course broadened my view and introduced me to loads of new ideas and methods.",
    "I did not know very much about Asia prior to taking this class and the focus on China\/Southeast Asia\/and South Asia gave me an opportunity to add depth to my knowledge of the region and offered important comparative possibilities and perspective for my own work. That said I would have liked to have a seen just a little more diversity, perhaps another book about Europe or North America or at least one about Africa or Latin America.Overall, a unique and valuable course though one not without the potential for improvement.",
    "This course has been invaluable to me in conceptualizing the dissertation I plan to eventually write. By taking this course I was exposed to new perspectives from a diverse group of students from across the disciplines and fresh ideas from a group of reading assignments I would have otherwise never encountered.",
    "It deepened my understanding of agrarian societies and the place of agriculture in history. Most importantly, it introduced me into a field that is going to be central to my dissertation proposal.",
    "This course directed me to essential themes and background reading for my dissertation research. The issues presented in lectures and through the course syllabus have given me a solid foundation from which to start articulating my own engagement with issues of rural social change and agricultural practice."
