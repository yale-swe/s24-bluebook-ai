   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the seminar style of the class and the conversational\/debate vibe that allowed for everyone in class to argue their point even if it was different from the rest.",
    "The main strength is the depth of course material--and Prof. Kahan's teaching of it. Because the readings were so heavy and Prof. Kahan's understanding of each so thorough, the classes could be used to dive deep into what the studies really meant for our greater understanding of the legal system. Because each week's topic was a different lens in which to view courtroom cognition, the various topics we covered could all be placed in conversation with each other as well. The discussions naturally grew more diverse and nuanced as the class went on, which was probably my favorite part of the course overall. The greatest weakness of the class is one that faces a lot of seminars in the undergraduate sphere as well: there seemed to be a reluctance to participate, perhaps driven by fear of Prof. Kahan's willingness to follow up on comments with requests for greater details and a tendency to skimp on the readings. I felt that, even as conversations improved over the semester, they were always a few steps behind what Prof. Kahan was prepared to do. Perhaps this comes with the territory of hosting a high-level Psychology\/Cognitive Science class in the Law School."

    "One of the most engaging courses I have ever taken. Structure of the class was manipulated to really encourage students to invest in and enjoy what they were learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I took it as an undergrad but I still feel like it was engaging, thought provoking, and in general just a fun class! It is well organized and the topics are extremely interesting!",
    "I'd recommend this course with a few conditions. Prof. Kahan's course is not designed for undergraduates in mind; there is no hand-holding. He expects everyone to come to class having grappled fully with the readings before class so he can go into greater detail. The format of the course (heavy weekly readings and low-stress essays every other week) is designed to offer students a lot of freedom in completing course work. If you don't believe you'll have the time and ability to do the work without having checks and structures in place, you may fall behind in this class--and that's difficult when each week builds on the last. Still, the class itself was really interesting, and Prof. Kahan is a bundle of brilliant energy. If you can handle the freedom of the course, definitely take it!"
