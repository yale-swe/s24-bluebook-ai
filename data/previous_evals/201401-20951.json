    "Yes!! Even though it's a lot of work, in the end, it is so rewarding. Professor King, Professor Horsley, and Professor Pollard make the material engaging and interesting.",
    "learning cell biology. great biology foundation. though lots of work week to week (weekly quizzes) you won't regret taking it and by the end of the semester, you will have learned a lot.",
    "You learn a lot during this class. You don't realize it, but by the end of the class you will have learned about all the parts and the cell and the various processes involved. There is a lot of detail, but each quiz only covers 2 lectures (choice of two questions, one from each lecture) so its manageable. The final is just 6 quizzes stapled together and quite comprehensive. Definitely take this class, but be warned that there is a lot of work every Monday.",
    "Absolutely take it! especially if you are a science major. It is one of the best science classes I have taken at Yale because it teaches you how to be a scientist and there is not as much memorization as you would expect in a bio class. They focus on concepts more than they focus on details. I recommend taking it sophomore year so you have a solid foundation before you join a lab junior year. Also, I recommend taking biochem (I took MBB 300) before or immediately after or concurrently with this course. They both complement each other REALLY well.",
    "I know you are going to hear some very scary and negative things about this class from some students. I'm not going to lie and say that these comments don't have their merits. That being said, I would still highly recommend this course to any biology major or anyone interested in cell biology. The course is extremely rigorous and probably covered more material than any other class I've ever taken. But it's all so fascinating and when you think about how this might be the last time that anyone is ever going to lay out all of this information for you, you realize how valuable it truly is. The professors are some of the best that Yale has to offer. Also, the class is extremely organized - you get a packet with essentially all the notes that you'll need from a lecture. The weekly quizzes, though incredibly annoying at times, force you to keep up with the lectures. Also, my biggest piece of advice is to read the book. Know what you're getting into when you take this class, but I still advise you to take it!",
    "The worst. The amount they expect you to memorize is unreasonable. Grading is very arbitrary. Don't go to class or look at the slides; just memorize the study guides.",
    "A survey of cell biology. Lots of information. I would recommend it, but only if this is your major class during the semester.",
    "This class presents way too much material way too fast, but it's still possible to get something out of it if you try hard enough. It's an okay class to take if you go in which the knowledge that you'll never really feel good about the material and how much of it you actually grasp.",
    "An awesome class; I learned probably more from this class than any other class I've taken at Yale. It's a bit intimidating at first, and I did rather poorly on the first few quizzes. However, know that it does get better and it becomes easier to absorb information\/focus on important aspects as the class goes on. I would recommend a student focus on the packet for the quizzes, and use the book as a supplement. This class is a ton of work, a lot of reading and studying before each quiz, but was completely worth it for me.",
    "There is a lot to say for cell bio. It is hard, has a large work level and has a 9:00 am lecture. The quizzes are weekly and worth 60% of your grade while the final is cumulative and worth 40%. This is no joke. That being said, I think the class is worth taking. I have never learned more than I learned over the course of this class and I feel that the experience was fulfilling. It certainly pushed my limits, but I'm glad I did it.",
    "This class is wonderful. Stressful to study for every week, but worth it if you do. The openness in this course is astounding.",
    "I really liked the format of Cell Bio. While I wish the classes were 50 minutes instead of 75, I thought the lectures were reasonably engaging and typically clear. The handouts and power points were great resources. I didn't really need to use the textbook that much. I was very grateful that, for once, memorizing really wasn't the end goal. It is a lot of material but if you focus on concepts it's not as overwhelming. If you pay attention in lecture and\/or record them and then review the handouts before quizzes, you can do pretty well with little effort and also accidentally learn some things too. Cell Bio is my favorite intro science lecture. I also think the quizzes are kind of good training for the skills you need for MCAT bio stuff.",
    "You probably have to take it for the major or as part of premed requirements. I took it a little later in my career and enjoyed having some more biochem background; it was good to see how all of the parts fit together.",
    "Absolutely! This class is a staple of the MCDB major. It truly teaches you cell biology in a way that is more in-depth, well-rounded, and more fulfilling than you have ever learned before. OF course with that comes a lot of work, but that work is manifested solely in textbook reading and reviewing the course material, which ultimately helps you learn cell biology (and helps you on the final too)! The class is simply composed of weekly quizzes, three of which generously get dropped, and a final exam. So it requires constant attention, but gives you room for leniency as well. I would absolutely recommend this course because it fundamentally transformed the way I think about biology.",
    "Yes. It all comes together in the end, so hang in there.",
    "Yes, take it but be prepared to spend a ton of time studying\/learning.",
    "most of you who are reading this have to take this course. Some of you are crazy enough to take this for fun. either way, if it's at 9am again, the main way you'll be doing your learning is probably from the handouts. understand that if you scrutinize the handouts and actually understand the material on them before each quiz, you will probably do decently to perfectly fine. it took me a while to figure this out. You can read the book, but it's a lot of extra information and should only be done when you have enough time to take it all in (but when you do, you do get a lot more details). I've never studied so hard for a final exam in my life but at the end of all that I felt like I really understood cell bio and was happy with my responses on the exam. I like the format of this class (grades from weekly quizzes and one final exam). even though my grade is up in the air, and there were definitely struggles along the way, I'm glad I took this class and would recommend it to anybody interested in science.",
    "A good class. Cell Bio was my favorite class this semester, and despite the amount of work it is to learn the material, it was totally worth it, and I definitely learned something from this class. Take it for the sake of learning, and you won't regret it.",
    "Yes, it really does teach you a lot about cell biology and how muscles work.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need it for your major. Not worth it.",
    "A work-intensive introduction to cell biology. Be prepared to know the study guides really well but you learn a lot from the class. Recommended.",
    "This course is great in that you learn a lot, and I think it is a lot more useful\/better use of your time than Developmental Bio. So overall I would recommend it. Be prepared for your Monday nights to be dominated by cell bio. Make sure you form a good but small study group and can explain the material to each other. The quizzes can be frustrating, but hang in there. Focus on the material that they give you in the printed handouts. Believe it or not, a lot of what you are tested from comes directly from these condensed notes. Knowing this from the beginning would have saved me a lot of time.",
    "All MCDB majors should definitely take this course, whether as a core course or an elective. You learn an incredible amount, although you are largely responsible for teaching yourself, and if you study well for the final, it is a really gratifying experience to realize how much you have learned. Be warned: Pollard's lectures will put you to sleep, but the other two lecturers will be much better. Quizzes are every Tuesday--you get to drop 3, but do not miss a single one!--and although the first two or three might be a little rough, you will hit your stride and start doing well after you get the hang of it. The curve is supposedly pretty generous, and regardless, it will be an awesome learning experience. Anybody who wants to pursue a career in biological research (even in neuro or clinical studies) should definitely take this!",
    "This was an awesome class that every MCDB major should take. The weekly quizzes really helped me keep up with the material. We learned so much, and I found the material truly fascinating.",
    "Cell Bio is an awesome bio course. It's definitely a lot of work--make sure you stay on top of the material and study the handouts really well. You'll be very satisfied coming out of the class, however, and will have a great grip on the foundations of modern scientific experimental design and cell biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student for the following reasons: the course covers a wide range of material, the course is extremely well taught by three devoted professors, and the course has many resources that are easy to access: the lecture packets, the textbook written by Prof. Pollard, the lecture slides, and of course the professors and TFs themselves. It is very clear what the requirements of the course are, and it is very easy to get the resources to meet these requirements. The challenge comes in mastering a huge volume of material.",
    "Good class. You learn so much. By the end, you realize how far you've come. It's a lot though. So be prepared for how much work you have to put in.",
    "Yes, take this class. Can be a very detailed, but worth it.",
    "Really hard course but you learn a lot of material. Be prepared to put in a lot of time for studying",
    "I would take this class if I was taking it credit\/d bc you get so much out of it but it is a lot of work and the weekly quizzes are rough.",
    "Lots of work, but worth it.",
    "Great course, hard work.",
    "MCDB 205 is a very information-intensive, yet engaging class. There is a lot of material to study; however, if you manage your time well and begin studying several days before the weekly quizzes, you will do well. Although the lecture notes do well as a stand-alone tool, the book provides a wealth of information necessary to do well. Utilize every resource in order to get the most out of this class.",
    "A great class, all MCDB majors should definitely take it! The information is really fundamental to the major, and it's very well taught and organized. Not so much work as it's made out to be if you keep up. Just focus on the packets and lectures, reading the book is not critical.",
    "Cell Biology is a wonderful class and you will learn many new concepts. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "It's a good class for anyone who wish to know more about cells. I think it is a good course for all the pre-med students.",
    "Here are the good parts: you will be developing a foundation of knowledge that will be applicable to every other biology class you will ever take. You will be using a good textbook that is written by the lead instructor and provided with a fantastic set of notes which outline and highlight everything you need to know. If you keep up, you will probably learn more in this class than you have in any other class before. The quiz and test system is generous -- you get to drop three of your lowest quiz grades and you will always be able to pick between two questions to answer. The professors are caring and knowledgable. The bad parts: Because of the quiz drop system, the quiz average will be very high (like 8.5-9). Everyone is doing generally pretty well and it can come down to the final to determine your grade. Although the quiz average is pretty high, everyone is struggling to learn all the material. There is a ridiculous amount of material to memorize, learn and understand and the course stresses conceptual understanding as well as rote-memorization (although more of the former than the latter). When you study for the final, you will be studying 26 units of material -- essentially the entirety of the textbook. It is overwhelming, and it is grueling. When I took it, I hated it, because you're not used to having to study every week for a class. But in the end you learn so, so much. I wouldn't consider myself a real biology major had I not taken this class."
