    "Over the course of the semester, I found my understanding and knowledge of Spanish improving significantly to the point where I could hold a conversation. The cost of this, however, was that we did not spend much time focusing on Spanish culture or history.",
    "Good at learning through repetition. Could vary up in class activity styles a bit more.",
    "Course was very strong. Well organized, fairly graded, and great instructor.",
    "The actual level of students throughout the course was very different",
    "Its super well organized and the CC is great. The textbook is expensive and the CC seems like it could probably be enough on its own with a few vocab lists borrowed from the CC.",
    "The course was very very well organized and easy to follow, but it was almost too monotonous and there could have been more creativity\/interesting activities on a day-to-day basis."

    "Yes, it is a useful course in taking your spanish to the next level.",
    "If they are looking to advance their spanish skills, yes. It is effective at what it sets out to do.",
    "Yes, as a language requirement. It definitely helped improve my Spanish.",
    "I would if they have the same level of experience as I do, which is basically just in a classroom setting. To try to learn with people who are basically fluent as well as people who aren't as proficient is difficult in a language setting.",
    "Yes. Well-organized and I feel solid going into L4",
    "Yes especially with this instructor! She is very enthusiastic and patient with students and you will learn a lot.",
    "Yes if you're interested in continuing learning Spanish, it's well-paced from L2 (both review and more challenging assignments, but not too much of a jump in terms of workload)."
